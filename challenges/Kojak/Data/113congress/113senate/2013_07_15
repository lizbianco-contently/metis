Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau and the renomination of Rich Cordray to \nserve as its Director.\n  Several years ago I began working on the idea for a consumer finance \nagency because our consumer credit system was badly broken. The laws \nwere inconsistent, they were often arbitrary, and the basic rules \nchanged for the same kind of product, such as a mortgage, depending on \nwhat kind of company sold it. People got cheated. And, as we know, in \n2008, reckless and dangerous mortgage lenders and Wall Street traders \nwho made money off those mortgages nearly brought our entire economy to \nits knees.\n\n[[Page S5676]]\n\n  In 2010 Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act. The consumer protection part of that was the \nnew consumer agency--the CFPB--which was designed as a watchdog to keep \ncredit card issuers, mortgage lenders, and student loan marketers from \ncheating people.\n  Now, there was a lot of negotiation over the structure of this new \nagency. Hearing after hearing, markup after markup, floor vote after \nfloor vote. But now the same big bank lobbyists are fighting the same \nfight and using the same tired old talking points about the consumer \nagency they were using years ago. You know, you really have to wonder \njust how much money they are making fighting this fight over and over. \nBut now let's go ahead one more time and talk about the facts.\n  Congress built in many features to the consumer agency so that it \nwould have strong oversight. Let me share just a few examples.\n  The CFPB is the only agency in government that is subject to a veto \nfrom other agencies over its rules--the only one. The CFPB is the only \nbanking regulator that is subject to a statutory cap on its funding--\nthe only one. The CFPB Director is legally obligated to produce regular \nreports to Congress, to testify before Congress regularly, and to \ncomply with audits. The CFPB also has now testified more than 30 times \nbefore Congress--30 times. In addition, the CFPB is subject to all the \nregular constraints in our system of government that constrain every \nagency--the Administrative Procedures Act, judicial review, and so on. \nAnd, of course, there is the ultimate oversight: Congress can overrule \nany CFPB regulation.\n  Since the agency became law in 2010, there have been two major \ndevelopments. The first is that Director Cordray has done an excellent \njob. He has won praise from consumer and industry groups and from \nRepublicans and Democrats for his balanced rulemaking and his measured \napproach. Small institutions such as community banks and credit \nunions--the ones that didn't cause this crisis--think he has been fair \nand effective. Other institutions that want a fair marketplace, those \nthat don't want to make a profit by cheating their customers, like Rich \ntoo.\n  The agency is working. It has already forced credit card companies to \nrefund nearly $\\1/2\\ billion they tricked consumers out of, and the \ncomplaint center is giving tens of thousands of people a chance to \nfight back when they are cheated. The agency has helped out military \nfamilies, seniors, and students. It has helped a lot of people.\n  The agency has become the watchdog so many of us fought for, and Rich \nhas surpassed even the high expectations I had for him 2 years ago when \nI stood next to him in the Rose Garden as the President nominated him \nfor the first time to the CFPB.\n  There has been a second development since.\n  The need for certainty has been intensified. It has been nearly 5 \nyears since the crisis and 3 years since the passage of Dodd-Frank. The \nbanks need to know for sure who is in charge and what rules apply. They \nneed to know that everyone will be playing by the same rules and \nexactly what those rules will be.\n  Here is an example. Both lenders and consumer groups have praised the \nCFPB's new mortgage rules. Now it is time for everyone to know that \nthese rules--not the unpopular default rule in Dodd-Frank that the new \nrules replaced--are the law. That helps everyone.\n  The American people deserve a government that will hammer out good \nrules, that will enforce those rules, and then will get out of the way \nso the markets can work. They do not deserve endless relitigation of \nstale political disputes and the uncertainty caused by repeated \nfilibusters of qualified and proven nominees.\n  I am new to the Senate, but I don't understand why this body accepts \na system where this kind of political stalemate will not end in more \ngovernment or less government but just in bad government--government \nthat lacks the consistency, clarity, and predictability that honest \nbusinesses and hard-working families need to plan for the future.\n  I don't understand why we would let an honorable public servant such \nas Rich Cordray get stuck in this nonsense. I don't understand why, \nwhen everyone says Rich is terrific, we can't just vote on his \nappointment.\n  I know some Republicans and some lobbyists think if they filibuster \nRich's appointment they are somehow going to be able to shut down the \nagency and protect the big banks from any meaningful consumer \nprotection rules. They can use all the slogans they want and talk about \nthings such as accountability, but outside the Halls of this Congress \nand the fancy lobbyist offices around Washington no one wants more fine \nprint and more tricks and traps. No one thinks it is OK to cheat \nregular people and cut special deals for giant banks. No one wants to \ntake cops off the beat so big banks can break the rules without being \nheld accountable.\n  So let me be clear to those who think this filibuster will shut down \nthe work of the new agency. Let me be crystal clear. The Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau is the law, and it is here to stay. Do your \ndirtiest with obstructing the confirmation of the new Director, but the \nagency will keep on doing what it does best: fighting for the American \npeople.\n  We fought to get this consumer agency. We fought big banks and their \narmy of lobbyists. We fought hard and we won. Now we have a strong and \nindependent watchdog to stop the banks from cheating families. We are \nnot giving up now.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have some comments and statements to \nmake regarding filibuster reform and nominees. I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be allowed to speak for up to 30 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to take the floor to talk about \nthese critical nominations the Senate is currently considering. In all \nof the talk about these nominations, about the politics of recess \nappointments and everything, one thing that has been missing is a real \nconsideration of who these people are. Let's bring it down to the \npersonal. Who are these people? What have they done? What can they do \nto serve our country?\n  We seem to have forgotten, in all this chaff that is out there and \nall the arguments going on, what we are supposed to be doing to fulfill \nour constitutional responsibility to advise and consent to Presidential \nnominations. As I understand it, we are supposed to look at the \nqualifications of the candidates, determine if they are fit to serve, \nand beyond that, that is it. The answer with all of the nominees before \nus is an unqualified yes. They are qualified, they are fit to serve, \nand the President should be allowed to put together his team. That \nshould be the end of our task. We should confirm them all today--or \ntomorrow, I guess, when they come up--and move on to the many other \nimportant issues facing this body.\n  I am going to talk in a little bit about the whole filibuster issue \nitself, but first I would like to talk a little bit about one of the \nfirst of the nominees who is up, and that is the President's choice to \nbe our Secretary of Labor, Tom Perez. Without question, Tom Perez has \nthe knowledge and experience needed to guide the Department of Labor--\none of our key Cabinet posts.\n  Through his professional experiences, especially his work as \nsecretary of the Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and \nRegulation--yes, he was basically the secretary of labor for the State \nof Maryland, and he developed a very strong policy expertise about the \nmany issues that confront American workers and businesses. He \nspearheaded major initiatives on potentially controversial issues, such \nas unemployment insurance reform and worker misclassification, while \nfinding common ground between workers and employers to build sensible, \ncommonsense\n\n[[Page S5677]]\n\nsolutions. It won him the support of the business community and worker \nadvocates alike.\n  To quote from the endorsement letter of the Maryland Chamber of \nCommerce:\n\n       Mr. Perez proved himself to be a pragmatic public official \n     who was willing to bring differing voices together. The \n     Maryland Chamber had the opportunity to work with Mr. Perez \n     on an array of issues of importance to employers in Maryland, \n     from unemployment and workforce development to the housing \n     and foreclosure crisis. Despite differences of opinion, Mr. \n     Perez was always willing to allow all parties to be heard and \n     we found him to be fair and collaborative. I believe that our \n     experiences with him here in Maryland bode well for the \n     nation.\n\n  That is from the Maryland Chamber of Commerce.\n  Tom Perez has dedicated his professional life to making sure that \nevery American has a fair opportunity to pursue the American dream. \nMost recently, as the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at \nthe Department of Justice, he has been a voice for the most vulnerable, \nand he has reinvigorated the enforcement of some of our most critical \ncivil rights laws. He has helped more Americans achieve the dream of \nhome ownership through his unprecedented efforts to prevent residential \nlending discrimination. He has stepped up the Department of Justice \nefforts to protect the employment rights of service members so that our \nmen and women in uniform can return to their jobs and support their \nfamilies after serving their country.\n  As the Senate author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, I am \nparticularly pleased with Mr. Perez's long history of leadership on \ndisability rights issues. While at the Department of Justice, he helped \nensure that people with disabilities have the choice to live in their \nown homes and communities rather than only in institutional settings \nand to receive the support and services to make this independent living \npossible.\n  Like any leader whose career has involved passionate and visionary \nwork for justice, Tom Perez's career has been one of making difficult \ndecisions and management challenges. He has been the target of a lot of \naccusations and mudslinging and misperceptions. But we have looked--I \nhave looked carefully into his background and record of service, and I \ncan assure my colleagues that Tom Perez has the strongest possible \nrecord of professional integrity. Any allegations to the contrary are \ntotally unfounded.\n  Again, Mr. Perez appeared before our committee. He was willing to \nanswer any and all questions. To those who were at the committee, those \nwho submitted letters--he has answered more than 200 written questions. \nHe made himself available to any Senator who wanted to meet with him. \nHe has been most accommodating, and I can say that the administration \nhas provided all the access people have wanted to his personal e-mails. \nIn fact, this administration, I can say from my experience in the last \n29 years, has gone further in providing access to even the personal \nmaterials of Tom Perez than any President has ever done before, any \nadministration has ever done before.\n  Again, he has been thoroughly vetted. He has the character, \nintegrity, and expertise to lead this Cabinet, and the Senate should \nvote on it. When I say the Senate should vote on it, we should vote on \nit with a majority vote, but, no, Mr. Perez has been filibustered and \nheld up to a 60-vote threshold. We know Mr. Perez has well over 50 \nvotes--the majority--but because my friends on the Republican side are \nstonewalling this, he may not have 60 votes. But why should it take 60 \nvotes, I ask? Why shouldn't it be a majority vote, up or down?\n  The same is true for our nominees to the National Labor Relations \nBoard. Again, these are three exceptionally well qualified candidates.\n  Mark Pearce has been a board member since 2010 and Chairman since \n2011. He was previously a union-side attorney in private practice. \nBefore that he was a career attorney at the National Labor Relations \nBoard. Richard Griffin, Jr., is former general counsel of the Operating \nEngineers Union and, again, a former career attorney at the NLRB. \nSharon Block served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Congressional \nAffairs at the U.S. Department of Labor and before that was staff on \nour HELP Committee. She was the senior counsel for Chairman Kennedy \nwhen Senator Kennedy was chairman of our committee, and she is a 10-\nyear veteran of the NLRB.\n  Again, I have yet to hear one Senator question their qualifications. \nIndeed, even the ranking member on the HELP Committee conceded at the \nhearing that these candidates are exceptionally well qualified and that \nhe admired their qualifications and their distinguished backgrounds.\n  They have been thoroughly vetted. They met with any Senator who \nasked. They have each answered more than 100 written questions. They \nhave come before our committee in a public hearing, which is not \ntypical for all NLRB nominees. They produced every document requested \nand answered every question they have been asked.\n  Again, if we concede that they are all exceptionally well qualified \nand well vetted, why can't we vote for them with an up-or-down majority \nvote? Some time ago my friend Senator Graham when speaking about the \nSenate's role and the nomination process said:\n\n       Our job, as I see it, is not to say what we would do if we \n     were President. Our job, as the Constitution lays out for us, \n     is to advise and consent by a majority vote to make sure the \n     President . . . is not sending over their brother-in-law or \n     sister-in-law or unqualified people.\n\n  So no one on this list is anyone's brother-in-law or sister-in-law, \nand everyone is exceptionally well qualified.\n  Again, if we are doing our constitutional duty, we would confirm all \nof these nominees tomorrow and move on to our legislative work.\n  Why aren't we doing that? Because my friends on the Republican side \nare hijacking these nominations and this nomination process to try to \nmake changes to laws they know they could not change through regular \norder. Many times a single Senator or a handful of Senators might hold \nup a nominee not because the nominee is not qualified but because they \nwant some changes made someplace else that they don't feel they can get \nthrough the regular order of business in the Congress.\n  For example, my friends on the Republican side don't like the \nNational Labor Relations Board. So what do they do? They can't repeal \nit, so they make it inoperable. They make it inoperable by not letting \nus confirm nominees. In fact, one of my Republican colleagues announced \nhis intention to filibuster the NLRB nominees 6 days before their \nnominations were announced.\n  In fact, he went on to say that an inoperable NLRB would be good for \nthe country. If that is the way they feel, offer amendments to defund \nit, do away with it, and repeal the law. But to hold up qualified \nnominees from carrying out the law--the National Labor Relations Act is \nthe law of the land. The National Labor Relations Board is constituted \nunder that law to carry out its functions. So to hold up qualified \nnominees because they want to change the law, again, is to try to get \nsomething done that they couldn't otherwise do through the regular \norder.\n  This level of obstructionism is unprecedented in the nomination \nprocess. Repealing laws by fiat is not and was never intended to be a \npart of the Senate's advise and consent function. A Senator's dislike \nfor a particular law or a particular agency certainly was not intended \nto prevent qualified and dedicated people from answering the \nPresident's call to serve their country.\n  Again, it is not only the nominees but the American people suffer \nfrom these unprecedented abuses of the process. The laws that these \nboards and agencies and departments enforce are important laws designed \nto protect people. When the system breaks down--or in this case, \nintentionally undermined--real people are hurt.\n  Let's take the example of the National Labor Relations Board. They \nhave to have a quorum of three members to act. If there are fewer than \nthree members at any time, the Board cannot issue decisions and must \nessentially shut down. The Board currently has three members, but \nChairman Pearce's term expires in August--next month. At that point the \nNational Labor Relations Board would be unable to function unless we \nconfirm additional members.\n  Keeping the Board open is vital to employees, employers, and our \neconomy. Without the Board workers cannot seek justice if they are \ndischarged\n\n[[Page S5678]]\n\nor discriminated against for, say, talking with colleagues to improve \ntheir working conditions or for joining or assisting a labor union or \nfor organizing a labor union. The only avenue available to these \nemployees to file a grievance and have their grievance heard and \nadjudicated is to file a charge with the National Labor Relations \nBoard. Without it, they have no options at all.\n  If the NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board, cannot function, \nworkers effectively don't have no rights. Yet my Republican colleagues \nsaid an inoperable NLRB would be good for the country. Imagine leaving \nworkers without any forum or recourse to have their grievances heard.\n  I could also say the same is true for the Consumer Financial \nProtection Board. As we know it was created as part of the Dodd-Frank \nAct with a simple idea in mind: Consumers deserve to have a watchdog \nlooking out for their best interests when using financial products and \nservices from mortgages to credit cards, to student loans, to payday \nloans. Without the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, consumers don't have that cop on the beat looking out for their \nwell-being.\n  Mr. Cordray, who has been chosen by the President to head this \nagency, has carried out his mission admirably. If Republicans have \ntheir way, he will never be confirmed. Not only will they lose his \nleadership but the ability to adequately oversee these financial \nservices and financial products in order to protect the American \nconsumer.\n  By refusing to confirm Mr. Cordray--and if I am not mistaken, I \nbelieve his nomination has been pending for over 500 days. His \nnomination has been held up for 500-some days. By refusing to confirm \nhim, the Republicans are using this nomination process to thwart the \nintent of the Dodd-Frank law, and that brings us to the crux of what is \ngoing on around here. It has been in the press so much lately. We are \ngoing to have an unprecedented caucus of the Democratic Senators and \nRepublican Senators out here in the old Senate Chamber at 6 p.m. \ntonight to air these grievances.\n  As we know, last Thursday the majority leader laid down a number of \nthese nominees and filed cloture on them. We will bring them up \ntomorrow. If the Republicans continue to filibuster, the majority \nleader has made clear his intention to change the rules of the Senate \nby using 51 votes to provide that nominations for executive branch \npositions are not subject to the filibuster rule.\n  So what we are talking about is the nullification of laws which are \nalready on the books through the abuse of the Senate's power to advise \nand consent to nominations--nullification. Read your history books \nabout nullification. It is one of the issues we fought the Civil War \nover: Could States nullify, on their own, Federal laws?\n\n  What we are seeing are the Republicans saying we can nullify the \nessence of laws or what boards are supposed to do by abusing the advise \nand consent clause of the Constitution. It is appalling and something \nhas to change.\n  I first took to the floor on this issue in 1995. This is the \nCongressional Record, and it is dated January 4, 1995. It was an \ninteresting time. The Democrats had lost control of the Senate and the \nRepublicans were in charge. I--along with Senator Lieberman, Senator \nPell, and Senator Robb, from the great State of Virginia--proposed a \nchange in the rules that wouldn't end the filibuster but would keep the \nfilibuster as it was kind of intended, a method whereby the minority \ncould ensure that they could amend or offer amendments on legislation.\n  The right of the minority should be the ability to offer--not to have \nthem adopted--thoroughly debate and vote on amendments. Secondly, to \nmake sure the filibuster could be used to slow things down but not to \nbe used to stop something. That is why I proposed on January 4, 1995, I \nsaid: It is getting worse. I also said: I believe in the long run it \nwill harm the Senate and our Nation if this pattern continues. I went \non to talk about the rising tide of the filibusters. I said: Clearly, \nthis is a process that is out of control. We need to change the rules. \nWe need to change the rules, however, without harming the longstanding \nSenate tradition of extended debate and deliberation and slowing things \ndown.\n  When I laid down the proposed rule, I went on to discuss about how \ndysfunctional this place was becoming. If you thought it was bad in \n1995, you should see what it is like now. Never in my wildest dreams \ndid I think in 1995 that 18 years later the Senate would come to this \npoint where we simply can't do anything unless we have 60 votes.\n  We now have a system whereby 41 Senators decide what we do. \nEssentially, that is what they do, and through the use of the \nfilibuster, a handful of Senators can truly thwart the will of the \nSenate.\n  There has been a lot said about different nominees and what is going \non here. There has been this accusation and that accusation. We have to \ncut through all that fog and all that haze. I referred to it in 1995 as \nsort of like the fog of war. It is sort of like the fog of war; we have \nto cut through it.\n  There is only one question we and the American public need to ask \nourselves: Should a person selected by the President, any President, \nDemocratic or Republican President, to be a part of his or her team--\nafter being thoroughly vetted, after having a thorough committee \nhearing, and after making sure there is nothing terribly wrong with \nthis person and they meet the qualifications--have an up-or-down vote \nby the Senate with a majority vote or is it going to require 60 votes?\n  Again, the Constitution of the United States very clearly points out \nthat there are only five times when the Senate needs a supermajority to \nact, such as impeaching the President, expelling a Member, adopting a \ntreaty, joining a treaty, approving a treaty, and things such as that. \nFor all other things, the Constitution envisions a simple majority \nvote. That is the real question. There is no other real question before \nus.\n  Before I yield the floor, I just wish to address an issue that has \ncome up regarding the National Labor Relations Board nominees. I wish \nto set the Record straight. I have taken the time to put this in the \nRecord. There have been accusations made on the Senate floor--I \nshouldn't say accusations. There have been comments made that two of \nthese Board members are serving illegally and were illegally put on the \nboard by President Obama. I am talking about Sharon Block and Richard \nGriffin.\n  Let's look at a little history. They were appointed by the President \nin January of 2012 as a recess appointment because the Republicans had \nalready announced they would not let us have an up or down vote on \nthem. Since we needed a National Labor Relations Board to function, the \nPresident gave these two people a recess appointment in January of \n2012. They have been serving since that time.\n  They were taken to court to decide if the President had the authority \nto appoint them as recess appointees. The DC Circuit Court issued an \nopinion. The reasoning they used was contrary to any other court \nreasoning in the past about recess appointments. The DC Circuit said, \nNo, the President could not make those appointments and, furthermore, \nthe President can only make a recess appointment during the intervening \ntimes from one Congress to another for vacancies that arise between \nsessions. No other court has ever held that. There was another court \nthat agreed the President couldn't make these recess appointments, but \nit didn't go quite that far; it just said that the appointment had to \nbe made between sessions. Other courts, including the Second, Ninth, \nand Eleventh Circuit Courts, have all decided these things differently \nin the past.\n\n  What we have here is a decision by one court--the DC Circuit--taking \na position that has never been taken before by any court. We have \nanother court--the Third Circuit--that also narrowly defined the \nPresident's power. Then we have other circuit courts that have defined \nthe President's power more broadly.\n  So what happens now? This case goes to the Supreme Court and the \nSupreme Court will decide this during the 2013-2014 term.\n  Sharon Block and Richard Griffin are on the NLRB. They took an oath \nof office to carry out their responsibilities. Some of my Republican \nfriends are saying they should resign; they should get off the board \nbecause they are serving illegally. They are not serving illegally\n\n[[Page S5679]]\n\nuntil the Supreme Court has made a final decision. I have said before, \nthe contention of some of my friends on the Republican side is like \nAlice in Wonderland: First the verdict, and then we have the trial. I \ndon't know what the Supreme Court will decide. We don't know. We have \nhad precedents in the past. There is a longstanding NLRB precedent when \nthe agency faces a split in circuit court opinions. When the DC Circuit \nCourt ruled in Laurel Baye v. NLRB that the NLRB needed three members \nto have a lawful quorum to act--again, this was contrary to the \ndecision of other circuits--the two-member board, consisting of \nRepublican Peter Schaumber and Democrat Wilma Liebman, continued to \nissue decisions until the legal issue was finally resolved in the \nSupreme Court. The Supreme Court said, No, they need more than two. \nThey have to have at least three people to make decisions.\n  The two-member board, during that interim time, issued decisions in \nhundreds of cases after the DC Circuit's adverse ruling, yet not one \nRepublican Senator called on either member to resign. So what happened? \nAfter the Supreme Court issued its decision and the board now had more \nthan three members, they went back and looked at these decisions, and \nif there were still open contentions they reviewed them and they issued \nanother decision.\n  Some of the decisions were accepted by both sides and people moved \non. Those that weren't were redecided by the board, including the two \npeople who had served on that board during that interim period of time.\n  Again, we have a recent precedent--and this was just within the last \n5 years, if I am not mistaken. So we have a recent precedent that \ndemonstrates that both Block and Griffin are acting appropriately by \nremaining in place and that the NLRB is acting appropriately by \ncontinuing to issue decisions pending the resolution of this issue by \nthe Supreme Court. They cannot and they should not resign because they \ntook an oath of office to fulfill their duties, and they must fulfill \nthat oath. After President Obama made these appointments, each new \nboard member took an oath of office promising to fulfill their duties \nas a member of the NLRB.\n  I wanted to clear that up. They are not illegal. We await the Supreme \nCourt's decision. I have no idea how they are going to decide because \nthere has been a split of the circuits. As I have shown, this issue has \ncome up before where we had a case split in circuits. Two board members \ncontinued to issue decisions. No one here asked them to resign, and \nthis was in the last 5 years. No one asked them to resign. But now, for \nsome reason, my friends on the Republican side want to deny the \nPresident his choice of people to serve on the NLRB. Two of those \npeople, Ms. Block and Mr. Griffin--let's say the Supreme Court says the \nPresident couldn't appoint people during that recess. Well, OK. We are \nnot talking about that now; we are talking about an appointment that is \ngoing to take place right now, and he should be allowed to have who he \nwants, as long as they are thoroughly vetted and qualified.\n  As I said, no one has questioned their qualifications. The President \nshould have the right to have his NLRB board put in place now, and the \nquestion of whether the decisions made in the last year and 5 or 6 \nmonths--those decisions, just as the ones before in the case of the two \nmember Board--went back and were revisited and the court issued its \ndecisions. The same thing can happen here. So we shouldn't let anyone \ntell us these nominees are illegal. That is absolutely not true. People \nmay think it is true, but it is not true.\n  I keep hearing: Well, now there are overtures from the Republican \nside to make some deals--to make a deal on not having the vote tomorrow \non doing away with the filibuster rule on nominations. Oh, I have heard \nall kinds of things floating around: This deal here, that deal there, \nand we have a little deal here. Since I took the floor in 1995 as a \nMember of the minority, I might add, to propose a change in the \nfilibuster rules, this issue has come up several times. It has come up \nseveral times since 1995. Every time there is always a deal. There is \nalways some little deal made so we don't fix what is wrong with the \nSenate. We sort of paper it over and move on. I hope that doesn't \nhappen again. Every time a deal was made and it was papered over, \nthings got worse--every single time they got worse. They might have \nbeen OK for a little bit, but then we go right back to our old ways \nagain. The old ways won't work any longer around here. They just won't \nwork.\n  I hope the only deal that is struck is the Republicans agree--we all \nagree--that any President should have his or her right to put their \nteam in place by a majority vote of the advise and consent of the \nSenate. They first should be thoroughly vetted with committee hearings \nand answering questions, but they are entitled to an up-or-down vote, \nwith a majority vote in the Senate. That is the only deal that will get \nus out of this trap in which we find ourselves. I think it is the only \nthing that will reassure the American people that, once again, the \nSenate is going to function; it is going to do its job; it is not going \nto be thwarted by a handful of people--one or two or three or four \npeople--and that we can actually move this country forward and let this \nPresident and the next President, who may be a Republican, have his \nteam. I said that in 1995 when I was in the minority, I have said it in \nthe majority, I have said it in the minority, and I say it once again \nas a Member of the majority.\n  I hope tomorrow we finally put an end to this nonsense of the \nfilibuster on nominations, at a bare minimum. I would like to see the \nfilibuster changed even more than that, but at a minimum get rid of the \nfilibuster on nominations to the executive branch.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I speak today recognizing that I have only \nbeen a Member of this body for about 6 months and a couple of days. I \nam hardly an expert on Senate rules, procedures, or precedent. But this \nmuch I do know: The rule change being considered this week is more far-\nreaching and more significant than has been advertised.\n  This rule change was described this afternoon by the majority leader \nas a ``minor change, no big deal.'' It is a big deal. It has the \npotential to change this institution in ways that are both hazardous \nand unforeseen.\n  We will discuss these changes later today in the Old Senate Chamber. \nI think it is appropriate we should meet there. The Old Senate Chamber \nhasn't been used for official Senate business in over 150 years. It \ngives some perspective to the gravity of what is being considered.\n  The majority leader noted today that Senate rules have been changed \n18 times in the past 36 years by a simple majority vote. There needs to \nbe a qualifier here--a very big qualifier. This rule change will allow, \nfor the first time in Senate history, majority-imposed cloture. That is \nnot minor; that is a big deal.\n  It is said by the advocates that it will only affect the President's \nexecutive branch nominees. That may be true initially, but once a \nsimple majority has been used to impose cloture for executive branch \nnominees, why can't it be used for judicial nominees who have a \nlifetime tenure? Why not use it for everyday legislation? But even in \nthe unlikely event this rule change remains confined to the President's \nexecutive branch nominees, it would not be a minor change or one that \ncan be described as ``no big deal.''\n  Let me give one example, and I hope it gives some of my colleagues \npause as they consider this rule change.\n  Currently under consideration by this body is the President's nominee \nto head the Environmental Protection Agency. This agency has broad \nreach across the country. Its regulatory authority extends to power \ngeneration and air quality. A heavyhanded approach on these issues in \nparticular has a potential to put a stranglehold on Arizona's economy. \nWith only 15 percent of Arizona's land privately owned, EPA's influence \nis magnified by a considerable footprint the Federal Government already \nhas in the State. So the President's choice to head the EPA is an \nimportant choice and the Senate's advise-and-consent role is vital.\n  After reading some of the media reporting on the President's pick for \nthis\n\n[[Page S5680]]\n\nposition, I initially had some heartburn. However, after meeting in my \noffice with the President's nominee, discussing some of the issues \nunique to Arizona, and receiving assurances that we could, where \nappropriate, work collaboratively on these issues, I felt comfortable \nwith the President's choice. On the whole this has been my experience \nwith the President's nominees. If this rule we are to consider were in \nplace, would I have received a visit from the President's nominee? No. \nI served in the House of Representatives for 12 years. Not once did I \nreceive a visit from the President's nominees during the nomination \nprocess. Why is that? It is not because they didn't like me, and it \nwasn't because I served in the other body or they have some aversion to \nthe other Chamber. No. It is because the House has no role in advice \nand consent. This is precisely the position that nearly half of the \nSenate will be in in perpetuity with regard to executive branch \nnominees by the end of this week if this change occurs. Let me repeat \nthat. Senators will be in the same position that House Members are in \nif you happen to be in the minority here with regard to executive \nbranch nominees.\n\n  The House has no role in advice and consent. If a bare majority could \nbe used to invoke cloture on an executive branch nominee, there is no \nreason for them to come see you in your office, to talk about what they \nare doing, to talk about what their philosophy is. Like I say, in most \ncases you feel comfortable after that, and after assurances that you \ncan work collaboratively on the issues, then you move on and vote for \nthe nominee, in most cases. But that will not happen if this rule \nchange occurs.\n  In my maiden Senate speech just a few months ago, I said the \nfollowing: The Senate is a body governed largely by consensus. The \nparty holding the gavel is on a short leash. Bringing even the most \nnoncontroversial resolutions to the Senate floor requires the agreement \nor at least the acquiescence of the minority. Over the past decade both \nparties wielding the gavel have chafed under this arrangement. Both \nparties have at times considered changing the rules. Both parties have \nwisely reconsidered. The House has rules appropriate for the House. The \nrules of the Senate, however frustrating to the party that happens to \nbe wielding the gavel, are appropriate for the Senate.\n  It is my sincere hope that this body can realize its potential and \nthat whatever behavioral changes need to be made are made within the \nlongstanding rules of the Senate, rules that have served this \ninstitution and the country very well for more than 200 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, today we are here debating \nthe issue of rules. I have listened to this debate about the Senate \nrules, and the word ``broken'' gets tossed around a lot--broken \nagreements, breaking the rules to change the rules. Those are the \nsideline comments and they miss the real point, because what is broken \nis the Senate itself.\n  I have said for a long time the Senate is a graveyard for good ideas, \nand the shovel is unprecedented abuse of filibusters, of delay and \nobstruction. It all adds up to one thing: broken.\n  We called for changes in the Senate rules at the beginning of this \nCongress. We should have put in place a talking filibuster and other \nchanges, but we didn't. So we have this tyranny of the minority, where \nthe minority governs--just the situation our Founding Fathers feared.\n  Too often the Senate is still a graveyard for good ideas, and the \nbodies keep piling up, especially with executive branch nominees.\n  In January, the two leaders agreed to--\n\n       . . . work together to schedule votes on nominees in a \n     timely manner by unanimous consent, except in extraordinary \n     circumstances.\n\n  The minority leader said,\n\n       On the subject of nominations, Senate Republicans will \n     continue to work with the majority to process nominations, \n     consistent with the norms and traditions of the Senate.\n\n  That was the agreement, and it has not been kept. The only \nextraordinary circumstance has been continual obstruction, and it all \nbegan very early on.\n  For openers, we saw the filibuster of Chuck Hagel's nomination--the \nfirst time a Secretary of Defense was filibustered. But this is part \nand parcel for President Obama's Cabinet secretaries.\n  By way of comparison, looking at other Presidents, not one of \nPresident Carter's Cabinet nominees was filibustered; President George \nH.W. Bush, zero; President Reagan, one; President George W. Bush, one; \nPresident Obama, four and still counting.\n  I am old enough to remember the era when my father was Secretary of \nInterior in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. When I joined the \nSenate, I told my dad when I went home one weekend, We can't get \nexecutive nominees in place. The President and Cabinet secretaries \ndon't have their teams in place. He said, Tom, I had virtually my whole \nteam in place in the first 2 weeks. Imagine that. Imagine if the whole \nteam for the Department of the Interior--or any other Department, for \nthat matter--was confirmed in the first 2 weeks. Agencies could \nfunction, our government could do its work.\n  Instead, the President's nominations are ambushed by filibusters. \nConfirmation now almost always requires 60 votes, contrary to the \nhistorical practice of the Senate and, more importantly, contrary to \nthe explicit simple majority requirement in the Constitution. These are \nnot the traditions and norms the Republicans committed to. It is \nanything but. Still, that is what we have seen, one nominee after \nanother blocked and key leadership posts left unfilled.\n  Americans thought they spoke with a clear voice last November. No \ndoubt they now wonder. And why wouldn't they? The will of the majority \nis drowned out by a small minority. People in my home State of New \nMexico want to know--Americans want to know--who is minding the store? \nThe answer, in too many cases, is no one. We still don't have a \nSecretary of Labor. The National Labor Relations Board is an empty \nshell. The Senate has failed to confirm a full five-member board and \ngeneral counsel. Two of these nominees are Republicans. Even they \ncouldn't get through. This has real impact for 80 million Americans who \nrely on workplace protections, for the rights of workers, and the \nintegrity of the collective bargaining process.\n  Some believe it is a good thing that we toss out the enforcement of \nlabor law in this country. I don't share that view. But it isn't just \nworkers who are left hanging. Leadership positions at other vital \nagencies remain unfilled: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, the Federal Election Commission. These are important jobs--\nimportant work--for the American people, affecting the environment, \nconsumers, health care, and even our elections.\n  Earlier this year we debated gun safety legislation. Republicans \nargued that we don't need new laws, we just need to enforce the \nexisting laws. Unfortunately, the agency responsible for enforcing many \nof those laws--the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and \nExplosives--has not had a Senate-confirmed Director in 7 years. Why? \nBecause Republicans do not want the ATF to function.\n  Many of these highly qualified Americans get tired of having their \nlives put on hold because of partisan obstruction. Rather than continue \nto languish in a dysfunctional system, they withdraw from \nconsideration.\n  One such example was Dawn Johnson, nominated to head the Justice \nDepartment's Office of Legal Counsel. Johnson was a respected law \nprofessor and former top assistant in the Office of Legal Counsel in \nthe Clinton administration. But Republicans blocked her nomination. In \n2010, after her nomination was stalled in the Senate over a year, she \nwithdrew.\n  Another example is Peter Diamond. In 2011, he withdrew as President \nObama's nominee to the Federal Reserve Board. Diamond's nomination was \nblocked because a small minority\n\n[[Page S5681]]\n\nof Senators questioned whether he was qualified. I tend to believe he \nwas, as he won the Nobel Prize in economics the year before.\n  It makes you wonder why anyone would subject themselves to a Senate \nconfirmation, people who want to serve their country, often at a \nsignificant pay cut from their private sector careers, who know they \nwill be subjected to a partisan fight that may have nothing to do with \ntheir qualifications. So months and years go by, work is left undone, \nwith no one at the helm of major government agencies.\n  That is why the Senate is in crisis. That is why we are here today. \nThe American people deserve better. We need a government that does its \njob. That is not possible without leadership. Congress's approval \nratings remain in the cellar. Why? Because of a failure to get things \ndone, even things as basic as allowing the President to select his own \nteam. Find 60 votes or find someone else or leave the position empty--\nthis is the status quo, and it must change.\n  It is time for us to act. It is time to restore the confirmation \nprocess--restore it to how it has worked for over 200 years. Doing so \nis not breaking the rules to change the rules. They have been changed \nbefore and it is often done by a simple majority--when the minority is \nabusing Senate procedure. As Senator Merkley pointed out last week, it \nhas been done at least 18 times since 1977.\n  Contrary to the Republicans' dire warnings, making these changes has \nnever led to the death of the Senate. In fact, the Republicans \nthemselves made a strong argument for such changes back in 2005. They \nwere up in arms. Why? Because 10 judicial nominations had been blocked. \nThat number seems quaint now, but it was enough for the Republicans, \nand they were very clear about it. That is what the Republican Policy \nCommittee said in 2005:\n\n       This breakdown in Senate norms is profound. There is now a \n     risk that the Senate is creating a new, 60-vote confirmation \n     standard. The Constitution plainly requires no more than a \n     majority vote to confirm any executive nomination, but some \n     Senators have shown that they are determined to override this \n     constitutional standard. . . . Exercising the constitutional \n     option in response to judicial nomination filibusters would \n     restore the Senate to its longstanding norms and practices \n     governing judicial nominations, and guarantee that a minority \n     does not transform the fundamental nature of the Senate's \n     advice and consent responsibility. This approach, therefore, \n     would be both reactive and restorative.\n\n  ``Restore the Senate to its longstanding norms and practices.'' It \nwould be difficult to state the case more clearly.\n  This isn't just about the rules; it is about the traditions and norms \nof the Senate and their collapse under the weight of filibusters. I \nknow the winds can change, positions can change. Neither side is 100-\npercent pure. Both sides have had their moments of obstruction and, no \ndoubt, their reasons at the time. But I don't think the American people \ncare much about that. They don't want a history lesson. They don't want \na primer on parliamentary procedure. They want a government that works, \nthat gets things done, period.\n  I came to the Senate in 2009. My position has not changed since then: \nThe Senate needs to do its job, and it is missing in action.\n  When we proposed to change the rules at the beginning of the \nCongress, we were very clear: We called for a talking filibuster. If \nyou want to hold up legislation, you should have to stand here in this \nChamber, on the floor, and make your case. We did not intend to trample \non the legitimate rights of the minority, and we were willing to live \nwith these rules, no matter if we were in the majority or the minority.\n  I do not believe the Constitution gives me the right to block a \nqualified nominee no matter who is in the White House. I say that \ntoday, and I will say it if I am in the minority tomorrow. A Republican \nPresident may have nominees I disagree with--most likely so. But the \npeople elect a President, we only have one President at a time, and \nthey give him or her the right to select a team to govern.\n  If those nominees are qualified, a minority in the Senate should not \nbe able to block them--on either side of the aisle. Oversight, yes; \nreview, yes, but not block because you don't like their policy or their \nprogram or the law they are committed to enforce. This is not advice \nand consent, this is obstruction and delay.\n  New Mexicans want a government that works, the American people want a \ngovernment that works, and they are tired of waiting.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              remembering lieutenant general richard seitz\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, there is no group of individuals I hold \nin higher regard than our Nation's veterans who have dedicated their \nlives to serving our country.\n  Among our veterans I have special admiration for the members of the \ngreatest generation who served during some of our Nation's darkest \nhours and liberated the world from the forces of tyranny.\n  Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, more than 16 million Americans \nanswered the call to serve our country and more than 400,000 husbands, \nfathers, brothers, mothers, and daughters never returned home.\n  More than 200,000 Kansans served during the war, including GEN Dwight \nD. Eisenhower, future U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and my own father.\n  During the dedication of the World War II Memorial here in \nWashington, Senator Dole described the greatest generation this way:\n\n       On distant fields and fathomless oceans, the skies over \n     half the planet and in 10,000 communities on the home front, \n     we did far more than avenge Pearl Harbor. The citizen \n     soldiers who answered liberty's call fought not for \n     territory, but for justice, not for plunder, but to liberate \n     enslaved peoples around the world.\n\n  Among those citizen soldiers was a young Kansan named Richard Seitz. \nWhen WWII began, Dick was attending classes at K-State University, but \nby the end of the war he had successfully led his battalion through \nsome of the fiercest fighting of the war in the Battle of the Bulge. \nOur country lost a great man, a dedicated soldier and an American hero \nwhen LTG Dick Seitz recently passed away.\n  Dick was born in 1918 in Leavenworth, KS. At an early age he showed \ngreat interest in serving his country through the Armed Forces. In high \nschool he was the cadet commander of his school's ROTC unit and \nreceived the American Legion Cup as an outstanding cadet.\n  As a young man Dick attended Kansas State University and while a \nstudent, he accepted a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. \nArmy. While spending a year away from K-State to earn enough money to \nfinish his degree, Dick was called into active duty in 1940.\n  During an infantry course at Ft. Benning, Dick witnessed the original \nparachute test platoon and volunteered to become a paratrooper. He was \npart of the sixth jump school class ever held by the Army and became \none of its first paratroopers.\n  Dick rose rapidly through the ranks until at the age of only 25, as a \nmajor, he was given command of the 2nd Battalion of the 517th Parachute \nInfantry Regimental Combat Team.\n  Showing great potential at a young age, Dick was soon promoted to \nLieutenant Colonel. As the Army's youngest battalion commander, he led \nhis men throughout many historic combat operations in Europe.\n  During the Battle of the Bulge, Dick's battalion and a Regiment of \nthe 7th Armored Division formed what became known as Task Force Seitz. \nTheir mission was to plug the gaps on the north slope of the Bulge \nevery time the Germans tried to make a breakout. During the battle, \nsome of the bloodiest fighting in WWII, Dick's battalion went from 691 \nmen to 380.\n  Years later when asked about the worst day in this life, Dick quickly \nidentified it as Jan. 3, 1945, during the Battle of the Bulge, when his \nunit came under heavy artillery fire and 21 of his men were killed.\n  Before shipping out to Europe and while still a student at K-State, \nDick began dating his first wife, the former\n\n[[Page S5682]]\n\nBettie Merrill. When Dick was called up for active duty, Bettie \ncontinued her studies at K-State, graduated in 1942 and joined the Red \nCross.\n  In 1945 she was stationed in Holland when she read that Dick's \nbattalion was heavily engaged in the fighting around St. Vith. \nDetermined to see him, she drove by herself from Holland to the front \nin Belgium and managed to find his battalion.\n  She wasn't allowed to go to the very front lines where Dick was, but \nher trip put them back in touch and 6 months later they were married in \nFrance, with one Red Cross bridesmaid and 1,800 paratroopers in \nattendance.\n  Dick spent the next 33 years by Bettie's side before her passing in \n1978. Together they raised one son and three daughters and traveled the \nworld as Dick continued to serve his country.\n  Among his many command posts were the 2nd Airborne Battle Group, \n503rd Infantry Regiment and the 82nd Airborne Division, which he led \ninto Detroit and Washington, DC, in 1967 to quell the riots.\n  An airborne historian, Dr. John Duvall, said Dick was:\n\n       . . . an airborne pioneer and one of the fellows who set \n     the standards for what the airborne was all about. That \n     standard continues to be the standard the paratrooper follows \n     today. They have bigger airplanes and more complex weapons \n     today, but standards were set by them. We have lost a great \n     soldier in Dick Seitz.\n\n  During his Army career which included nearly 37 years of active duty, \nDick received numerous awards. Because of his great courage and heroism \nduring WWII, Dick was awarded with the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars \nand the Purple Heart.\n  Despite his many accomplishments in the military, one friend said he:\n\n       . . . remained humble and sincere. Often embarrassed by any \n     fuss made over him. He was the kind of person you wanted to \n     be. He was always concerned for others above himself.\n\n  As a soldier and commander, Dick's philosophy was always to take care \nof his troops. Throughout his career, he served as a mentor to many \nother soldiers and leaders in the Army.\n  Retired Brigadier General and former senior commander of Ft. Riley, \nDon MacWillie said:\n\n       LTG Seitz showed to me and the entire 1st Infantry Division \n     what it is to be a soldier, a statesman, and a gentleman. \n     Very few men come along who can live as all three--Dick Seitz \n     certainly did. I will miss him not only because of our \n     friendship but because other soldiers will not have the \n     opportunity to learn as I did. Our Army, community and nation \n     has lost a treasure.\n\n  In 1975, Dick returned to Kansas upon his military retirement and 3 \nyears later, his wife Bettie passed away. In 1980, he married Virginia \nCrane and together they spent the next 26 years actively involved in \nthe local community until her passing in 2006.\n  Dick was a mentor, a friend, and someone I greatly respected. He not \nonly served our country but also his state and community.\n  Dick settled in Junction City following his retirement, but he never \ntruly retired from serving. He frequently visited Ft. Riley to greet \ndeploying and returning units from Iraq and Afghanistan--no matter the \nhour, day or night.\n  He was also involved with the Coronado Council of the Boy Scouts, \nserved on the Board of the Eisenhower Presidential Library, and was \nnamed an outstanding citizen of Kansas.\n  Most recently, the General Richard J. Seitz Elementary School at Ft. \nRiley was named in his honor in 2012.\n  Dick was well known to the students and staff because he regularly \nvisited the school. During his visits, he would talk with the students \nabout what it meant to be a ``proud and great American.'' And his \nmessage was always to ``respect the teachers and be a learner.''\n  His family and friends have described him as a gentleman, \ncompassionate, respected, full of integrity, gracious and giving. He \nwas truly a remarkable individual.\n  His daughter Patricia said this about her father:\n\n       He was my role model. An individual who had great wisdom, \n     great sense of humor, always interested in others, always \n     looking for ways to help others succeed.\n\n  Dick lived each day to its fullest and his commitment to his fellow \nman serves as an inspiration to us all.\n  In closing, I'd like to share with you what Sen. Dole once said about \nhis comrades in arms:\n\n       We were just ordinary Americans who were called on to meet \n     the greatest of challenges. . . . No one knows better than \n     the soldier the futility of war, in many respects the \n     ultimate failure of mankind. Yet there are principles worth \n     fighting for, and evils worth fighting against. The defense \n     of those principles summons the greatest qualities of which \n     human beings are capable: courage beyond measure, loyalty \n     beyond words, sacrifice and ingenuity and endurance beyond \n     imagining.\n\n  I would say that is a fitting description of my friend, LTG Richard \nSeitz.\n  I extend my heartfelt sympathies to his three daughters, Patricia, \nCatherine and Victoria; and to his son Rick and the entire Seitz \nfamily. I know they loved him dearly and will miss him very much.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Kansans to remember the Seitz family in \nyour thoughts and prayers in the days ahead.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to talk about one \nof the aspects of the debate that is occurring and which has taken \nplace over a long period of time but especially today, when it comes to \nSenate rules and what is happening on nominations and confirmations.\n  One major aspect of that debate relates to the National Labor \nRelations Act passed in the 1930s. I wish to start by highlighting one \nof the findings that undergirds one of the foundations of that act.\n  In the mid-1930s, because of labor strife and because of the \nconflicts between management and labor, people in both parties came \ntogether and said we had to put in place legislation to deal with that \nor we couldn't have the kind of growing economy we would hope to have. \nOne of the findings--it is the third finding in the 1935 act--says as \nfollows:\n\n       Experience has proved that protection by law of the right \n     of employees to organize and bargain collectively safeguards \n     commerce-- Safeguards commerce, I repeat those words--\n     safeguards commerce from the injury, impairment, or \n     interruption, and promotes the flow of commerce by removing \n     certain recognized sources of industrial strife and unrest, \n     by encouraging practices fundamental to the friendly \n     adjustment of industrial disputes arising out of differences \n     as to wages, hours, or other working conditions, and by \n     restoring equality of bargaining power between employers and \n     employees.\n\n  So says one of the main findings of the 1935 act. There is an \nadditional finding that speaks to it from the employer's vantage \npoint--how it is important to the free flow of commerce to have \ndisputes settled.\n  That is where we started in the 1930s. From that date forward--\ndecades now of work and practice--we have had labor-management disputes \nsettled and determined by use of the procedures in the National Labor \nRelations Act. Obviously, fundamental to that was the National Labor \nRelations Board--NLRB, the acronym. But here we are and we will not \nhave, in just a number of weeks from now, in August we will not have a \nfunctioning board because of the conflict in the Senate about this \nissue and because of the debate between intrasession appointments and \nintersession--meaning appointments within a session of the Senate as \nopposed to appointments outside, from one session to the other. I will \nspeak about that in a moment, but first I wanted to highlight one of \nthe real-world consequences of this.\n  Sometimes we have debates around here and they tend to be a little \ntheoretical, a little removed from the reality of life. Here is a real-\nlife story about how these appointments matter. Marcus Hedger was \nillegally fired in 2010 from his pressman's job at an Illinois printing \ncompany for his union activities. Last September, a unanimous National \nLabor Relations Board--two Democrats, one Republican at that time--\nruled that he should get his job back with backpay. There aren't many \ndisputes settled here that are unanimous. That has not happened yet. \nThat\n\n[[Page S5683]]\n\nwas in 2010. The NLRB decision in the Hedger case has been vacated \nbecause of the decision of the court of appeals regarding, as I \nmentioned before, these recess appointments. Hedger has lost his house \nin the meantime.\n  This is what Marcus Hedger said, and I think we should all listen and \nact upon these words:\n\n       So, almost three years later, I still don't have my job \n     back, even though the NLRB unanimously ruled I should get my \n     job back. I am asking the United States Senate to do what is \n     right for the people who gave you the power to represent \n     them, and to confirm the bipartisan package of nominees to \n     the NLRB so that other workers can have their rights \n     protected, just like the NLRB tried to protect my rights.\n\n  ``My rights'' meaning the rights of Mr. Hedger. That is what he is \ntelling us to do--to do our jobs.\n  I don't have time today because of the limitations of time we have, \nbut there are stories as well that speak to this from the employer's \nside. Listen to this one headline involving Walmart. The headline is \nfrom earlier this year, a Reuters headline, dated January 31, 2013: \n``Walmart Protestors Will Stop Picketing After Reaching Deal With \nNLRB.''\n  So we have a board which for decades has functioned, helping to \nresolve disputes, sometimes to the betterment or to the advantage of \none side versus the other, but settling those disputes nonetheless.\n  There is a lot of attention paid to what I would call kind of the \ninside baseball of this. It is about the difference between \nintrasession and intersession. But here is the record, despite what \nsome in Washington have asserted. Here is the record going back over \nmany Presidencies, just to give four Presidencies by way of example, \nand this idea that an appointment cannot be made during an \nintrasession--within the session of the Senate:\n  President Carter made one intrasession appointment to the National \nLabor Relations Board. President Reagan made four. President Clinton \nmade two. President George W. Bush made four intrasession appointments \nto the National Labor Relations Board. Since President Reagan's first \nterm--more than a generation ago--in addition to the members of the \nNLRB, hundreds of other recess appointments have been made \nintrasession.\n  So the idea that this is somehow a new development does not bear the \nscrutiny of the record.\n  I know we are out of time, but I rise to remind us what this Board \nhas meant to this country. I read that first section principally to \nhighlight the fact that the flow of commerce is mentioned twice--the \nflow of commerce. This isn't an act that says this act is to promote \none side versus the other; it is all about the flow of commerce, the \nmovement of goods, economic activity, so we can keep the country \nmoving. Obviously, in the past, when there was unprecedented strife, we \nwould have whole lines of production or whole sectors of our economy \nshut down because we didn't have a National Labor Relations Act and \nbecause we didn't have a National Labor Relations Board.\n  I end with the words of Marcus Hedger, who has suffered mightily--\nfirst, he is discriminated against; that is adverse to his life and his \nfamily. Then, when a decision is made in 2010, the decision is \nmeaningless so far to him because he hasn't been granted the remedy and \nhe lost his house in the meantime.\n  Here is what he said, and I will end with these words:\n\n       Companies shouldn't be able to get away with firing someone \n     just because they stood up for their rights. That's un-\n     American. We need a functioning NLRB to protect us and our \n     rights.\n\n  That is what Marcus Hedger said. We should bear in mind those words. \nWe should get the job done and get five people who are before the \nSenate voted on and confirmed so we can have that free flow of commerce \nand provide a remedy for people such as Marcus Hedger.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            In Memory of the McManus and Antonakos Families\n\n  Mr. SCOTT. Madam President, I rise today to honor the memory of nine \nSouth Carolinians lost last week.\n  The McManus and Antonakos families, both of Greenville, were \nvacationing together in Alaska when the small plane they were flying in \ncrashed on takeoff.\n  Melet and Kim Antonakos raised three beautiful children: Olivia, \nMills, and Ana. They were close friends with Dr. Chris and Stacy \nMcManus and their wonderful children: Meghan and Connor.\n  The loss of these two families has left the Upstate grieving, \nincluding the congregation at Christ Church Episcopal, where more than \n1,200 people attended a memorial service last Friday.\n  When you talk to folks in Greenville about the McManus and Antonakos \nfamilies, a few words come up over and over: faith, character, \nkindness.\n  Despite the heartbreak we feel, the Greenville community can \nhopefully take solace that these nine friends--nine neighbors, nine \nbrothers and sisters in Christ--are now in a better place.\n  We remember them not for the tragic way they died but for the joy and \ncompassion with which they lived.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Honoring Maine Volunteer Firefighters\n\n  Mr. KING. Madam President:\n\n     Who is in charge of the clattering train?\n     The axles creak and the couplings strain,\n     And the pace is hot and the points are near,\n     And sleep hath deadened the driver's ear,\n     And the signals flash through the night in vain,\n     For death is in charge of the clattering train.\n\n  That is a poem from the 1930s that was quoted by Winston Churchill in \nhis book ``The Gathering Storm.''\n  I rise today in the wake of a terrible tragedy, of a clattering \ntrain, where death was in charge--one that left more than 60 people \nmissing, 20 confirmed dead, and has devastated a community. But despite \nthe magnitude of this amazing loss, it is also a story of human heroism \nat its highest level.\n  I am referring to a horrific accident that occurred early last \nSaturday morning when a 72-car train carrying crude oil derailed in \nLac-Megantic, Quebec, near the border of western Maine. As the train \nerupted into all-engulfing flames, it came crashing into the town \ndemolishing everything in its path. Cars and buildings were instantly \nincinerated, pavement on the roads literally melted away, and sidewalks \ncrumbled from the intense heat and pressure. As a result, nearly a full \nsix city blocks were completely leveled, forcing almost 2,000 residents \nto flee their homes--a third of Lac-Megantic's total population.\n  And while local Canadian firefighters battled the flames valiantly--\nand I mean valiantly--it became clear they desperately needed support. \nSo after receiving a call at 4 a.m., 30 firefighters from Rangeley, \nFarmington, Phillips, Strong, New Vineyard, and Chesterville--all \nwonderful small Maine towns--as well as the town of Eustis, arose from \ntheir sleep, rushed to their engines, and drove 83 miles nonstop--\narriving at 6 a.m.--to help extinguish this horrendous blaze. It is \nworth noting that, except for the chief, every firefighter who made \nthis journey and put their life at risk, every single one that morning, \nwas a volunteer--serving and risking their lives of their own choice \nand volition.\n  Upon arrival, their efforts had immediate impact. They quickly \nrealized there was a desperate need for water, and because the town \nlacked a hydrant system, they swiftly turned their attention to a lake \n3,000 feet away and began to pump water using an extraction skill that \nMaine firefighters are specifically taught and trained to use. They \ncontinued to pump water from that lake for 21 straight hours.\n  Let's put that in perspective for a moment: For almost the entire \nnext day those brave men and women, driven by an incredible spirit of \nperseverance and self-sacrifice, worked tirelessly to extinguish the \nblaze and gain control of the burning train cars.\n\n[[Page S5684]]\n\n  Fire Chief Timothy Pellerin of the Rangeley station said everyone was \nhugging and cheering to celebrate their miraculous success when the \nfire was brought under control. It was ``like a ball team after a \nwin,'' he said. The Canadians, overwhelmed by the selflessness and \ncourageousness of those volunteer Americans, thanked them for their \nsteadfast determination to see the crisis through.\n  Residents of Lac-Megantic and local firemen were coming up to one of \nthe Rangeley firetrucks asking to have their picture taken with the \nAmerican flag attached to the safety bar and pausing to touch it as a \nsign of their respect and gratitude. After returning home late Sunday \nafternoon, Chief Pellerin said he has ``never been more proud'' to be \nfrom Maine and from America and to be a firefighter.\n  We still do not know the full scope of the devastation wracked by \nthis gruesome event. The cleanup and recovery costs will undoubtedly be \nastronomical, as well as the traumatic impact on the community upon \nwhich no dollar estimate can be placed. Initial reports indicated that \nat least up to 1.2 million gallons of crude oil spilled into the \nstreets, basements of houses, storm drains, and contaminated that \nnearby lake. Currently, over 200 criminal investigators are sifting \nthrough the charred remains of what might be North America's worst \nrailway disaster, and I sincerely hope that through their efforts we \nwill be able to better understand the causes of this horrible tragedy \nand perhaps, more importantly, how it can be prevented in the future.\n  However, my real reason for rising today is to honor those volunteer \nfirefighters from Maine--true American heroes who embody the best this \ncountry has to offer. They were called into action by their unwavering \nsense of civic duty, and throughout the night they overcame tremendous \nodds, including a language barrier and a lack of resources, to finally \nhelp extinguish the fire early Sunday morning. These brave Mainers \nshowed true strength of character--strength of character that enabled \nthem to overcome fear in pursuit of the greater good. It is without a \ndoubt that their actions saved countless lives. We owe these American \nheroes our enduring gratitude.\n  My thoughts and prayers remain today with those who are impacted by \nthis tragic event.\n  To go back to the words Churchill quoted so long ago:\n\n     Who is in charge of the clattering train?\n     The axles creak and the couplings strain,\n     And the pace is hot and the points are near,\n     And sleep hath deadened the driver's ear,\n     And the signals flash through the night in vain,\n     For death is in charge of the clattering train.\n\n  Death was in charge of the clattering train that dark night. The \nperseverance, skill, and courage of those firefighters from Maine and \ntheir brave Canadian counterparts could not prevent a tragedy but at \nleast contained and controlled it.\n  Madam President, this is the best of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                              Quorum Call\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise today to talk about \nthe balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution that I recently \nintroduced with several of my colleagues. These cosponsors include \nSenators Manchin, Begich, McCaskill, Heitkamp and Tester.\n  Debates over the merits of balanced budget amendments have occurred \nfor decades, and there is a wide range of conflicting thought on the \ntopic. Proposing to amend the Constitution is something I do not take \nlightly. But after much thought and consideration, and having \nconversations with fellow Coloradans, I came to the conclusion that \nfundamental budgetary reform like this is necessary to restore \nAmericans' confidence in our government and ensure long term fiscal \nhealth and stability.\n  I introduced the same balanced budget amendment in 2011 when there \nwas still a great deal of uncertainty about our economy and its \nrecovery. Although there has been economic progress, it is clear that \nwe have not yet completely emerged from the downturn that began in \n2008. It therefore remains critical that Congress continue to focus--in \na bipartisan fashion on ways to promote job growth and economic \nrecovery. It is to that end that I am proposing the idea of a balanced \nbudget amendment to enforce budgetary discipline.\n  The proposal I am introducing requires the President to submit a \nbalanced budget each year and ensures that our Federal Government \nspends no more money than it takes in, while allowing for exceptions in \ntimes of emergency. But most importantly my proposal takes steps to \nensure that Congress doesn't make some of the same budgetary mistakes \nthat got us into the mess we are in now. For example, my amendment \nprohibits deficit-\n\n[[Page S5685]]\n\nbusting tax breaks for Americans who earn $1 million or more per year \nunless the Federal Government is running a surplus. That is a \ncommonsense approach that makes sense to Coloradans. And importantly, \nthis amendment would shield Social Security in order to keep Congress \nfrom taking money from the trust fund to mask budget deficits. It is my \nhope that this amendment would prevent the unwise budgeting we have \nseen too often over the last decade while upholding the principle that \nwe should pay for our government in a responsible manner, with waiver \nauthority to be used only in exceptional circumstances. I think most \nAmericans can agree to that. Coloradans certainly do.\n  As we all know, Congress will again debate spending and revenue \nissues very soon as we approach a new fiscal year and an imminent need \nto raise the debt ceiling if we are to avoid default on our debt \nobligations. The total national debt is projected to reach over $16.8 \ntrillion at the end of 2013 and over $17.5 trillion in 2014. Coloradans \nfind those figures alarming. We are on an unsustainable path and it is \ncritical that Congress consider--as one tool--the type of discipline \nthis balanced budget amendment would require. I would not suggest to my \ncolleagues that this measure will solve all of our existing problems \nunilaterally, but it will help prevent the country from amassing \nmassive debt in the future.\n  I know some of my colleagues are skeptical about any form of balanced \nbudget amendment out of concern that it could be used to dismantle \ncritical programs or force uncomfortable budgeting decisions that \npurportedly pick winners over losers. However, I truly believe a \nbalanced approach such as the one I am introducing today will not \nrequire a slash-and-burn approach to programs that are the backbone of \nour national agenda, help grow our economy, and benefit hardworking \nAmerican families. In fact, I believe the only true way to preserve the \ncore programs that support America's seniors and provide care for the \nmost disadvantaged members of our society, for example, is to ensure \nthat we have the resources needed to fund them over the long term. \nWithout fiscal reform, our social safety net programs will disappear. \nThis result worries Coloradans.\n  The last time I introduced this amendment, I quoted progressive \nSenator Paul Simon, a Democrat from Illinois who championed the concept \nof a balanced budget amendment. I am going to do so again today--\nbecause his words carry such resonance.\n  In debating the balanced budget amendment in 1993, Senator Simon \nsaid, ``I am here to tell you that the course we are on, unless it is \nchanged soon, absolutely threatens all of the programs that you and I \nhave fought for and believe in so strongly. The fiscal folly that we \nhave followed for more than a decade has brought us to a crossroads. We \nface a basic decision, whether through default or through our actions \nto choose wisely the course that will lead us away from the brink.''\n  Senator Simon continued:\n\n       If we do not act, interest payouts will spiral upward until \n     they consume not only Social Security but health care, \n     education, transportation investments--every other need on \n     our national agenda. My warning to you today is that a rising \n     tide of red ink sinks all boats.\n\n  Senator Simon's caution is even more timely today, and I have the \nsame concerns about the budgetary path we are on. We have a structural \ndeficit and the only way to fix it is to fundamentally change the \nspending and revenue picture.\n  I have not given up hope that Congress may find common ground on a \ncomprehensive plan to cut spending, reform the tax code, and shore up \nprograms like Social Security and Medicare, which are critical to our \nNation's middle class. For example, I laud the efforts of Alan Simpson \nand Erskine Bowles and the many other advocates who are putting real \nideas on the table to reduce deficits and debt. These are people \nworking across the aisle every day to find common ground to reduce our \nnational debt. With that spirit in mind, last fall I led a majority of \nmembers of the Colorado delegation both Democrats and Republicans on a \nletter to our respective leaders in the House and Senate to support a \nbalanced, comprehensive debt deal, which includes spending cuts, new \nrevenue, and responsible reforms to shore up our entitlement programs.\n  Because we have got to have the fortitude to ``go big,'' I endorse \nthe general approach of the so-called Simpson-Bowles plan, which \nreforms all aspects of the budget. And I know many of my colleagues \nsupport that same framework. Finding agreement on comprehensive reform \nis the best possible action Congress can take to send a strong signal \nto main street businesses, financial markets and the American people \nthat we are serious about stabilizing our budget for the long term. \nSimilarly, this balanced budget amendment would chart a path toward \nlong-term fiscal health and promote the kind of confidence and \ncertainty we need to spur job creation, economic growth and prosperity \nfor a growing middle class.\n  With that said, I am convinced we will need additional tools that \nforce long-term fiscal discipline. That is why throughout the years I \nhave supported many policies to combat deficits such as a Presidential \nline item veto, establishing a committee to reduce government waste and \na ban on earmarks.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues to consider my reasonable proposal for a \nbalanced budget amendment. The proposal may not be perfect, it may \nbenefit from my colleagues' suggestions to improve it, and it may be \njust one piece of the larger fiscal puzzle. But I do hope that my \ncolleagues will give this proposal serious consideration as we continue \nto debate the best way to eliminate the debt and deficit.\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL J. MORELL\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Chambliss and \nmyself we wish to recognize and pay tribute to Mr. Michael J. Morell, \nDeputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, CIA, who will leave \nhis current position on Friday, August 9, 2013, and retire at the end \nof September. Mr. Morell's career spans over 33 years in the CIA during \nwhich he distinguished himself as a patriot, leader, and friend of the \nSenate.\n  Michael Morell deserves the gratitude of the entire Nation for his \nthree decades of selfless service at the CIA.\n  An Ohio native, Mr. Morell received a B.A. degree in economics from \nthe University of Akron in 1980 and an M.A. in economics from \nGeorgetown University in 1984.\n  Since joining the CIA in 1980, Michael's talents lifted him from \nbeing an analyst covering international energy issues to some of the \ntoughest assignments that the CIA has to offer: Presidential Briefer, \nAssociate Deputy Director, Director of Intelligence, Deputy Director, \nand toughest of all, twice he was called upon to serve as Acting \nDirector. In each assignment, Michael provided exemplary leadership for \nthe men and women of the Agency and demonstrated he was someone who \nknew how to manage operations, sharpen analysis, invest in new \ntechnologies, and assure the smooth functioning of the entire CIA \nworkforce.\n  As the President's Daily Briefer, Michael was at President Bush's \nside on that horrific day in September 2001. He was there at President \nObama's side as Deputy CIA Director when the United States brought \njustice to Osama bin Ladin in May 2011. These are only two examples out \nof many where Michael helped guide the Agency and the Nation through \nsome of the most complex and challenging times in our recent history.\n  As the Acting Director and Deputy Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, Michael has had frequent interaction with Senators \nand staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. His \nprofessionalism, mature judgment, frank and sage advice, and \ninterpersonal skills earned him the respect and confidence of the \ncommittee. His sound judgment and candor also directly contributed to \nhis successful representation of the CIA's interests before the \ncommittee and Congress.\n  As the chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, we have had additional opportunities to see Michael's \ncontributions to this Nation. We cannot speak of them here, but the \nAmerican people should know that his service goes beyond the public \nrecord, and has spanned the globe.\n  Throughout his career, Michael Morell demonstrated a profound \ncommitment to our Nation, selfless service\n\n[[Page S5686]]\n\nto the CIA, deep concern for Agency officers and their families, and a \ncommitment to excellence. Michael is the consummate intelligence \nprofessional whose performance personified those traits of courage, \ncompetency, and integrity that our Nation expects from its professional \nintelligence officers.\n  Mr. President, we ask our colleagues to join us in thanking Mr. \nMichael Morell for his honorable service to the Central Intelligence \nAgency and the people of the United States. We also thank Michael's \nwife Mary Beth and his children, Sarah, Luke, and Peter, for their \nsupport and understanding, as well as their sacrifices in allowing \nMichael to selflessly commit himself to protecting our Nation against \nthose who would do us harm.\n  We wish the Morell family all the best in the future.\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO TIMOTHY P. IRELAND\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Chambliss and \nmyself we wish to recognize and pay tribute to Mr. Timothy P. Ireland, \nDeputy Director of the Office of Congressional Affairs, OCA, at the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, CIA, who is retiring after a long and \ndistinguished career of government service.\n  Tim is not well known to the American people, but his quiet service \nand unflappable demeanor here made him a friend to the Intelligence \nCommittee and staff\n  After graduating from the University of Southern California in 1970 \nwith a bachelor's degree in international relations, Tim continued his \neducation, earning a master's degree and Ph.D. from the Fletcher School \nof Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. After teaching for 2 years, \nTim joined the Central Intelligence Agency in 1981, as an officer in \nthe Directorate of Intelligence, focusing on European political and \nmilitary affairs.\n  Tim worked in a number of analytic and management positions in the \nDirectorate of Intelligence, authored a National Intelligence Estimate, \nand served on the President's Daily Brief staff.\n  Throughout his career, Tim worked in both policy and intelligence \ncommunity positions. He spent 2 years in the Department of State's \nBureau of Political-Military affairs working on arms control and \nstrategic defense issues. For nearly 4 years he worked in the National \nIntelligence Council. Tim entered the field of resource management in \n1991 with a tour in the Office of Comptroller. He subsequently served \nin senior resource management positions in the Directorate of \nIntelligence, the Office of the Chief Information Officer, and the \nOffice of the Chief Financial Officer, CFO.\n  In this last capacity, Tim proved invaluable to the committee in \nunderstanding the CIA's programs and finances, giving direct, accurate \nanswers to difficult questions. Twice, Tim served as the Acting \nDirector of the Office of Congressional Affairs, serving as the CIA's \nprimary interface with congressional oversight committees, leadership, \nand Members. While serving in the offices of OCA and CFO, Tim was known \nfor keeping the Congress fully and currently informed.\n  In these capacities, Tim had frequent interaction with Senators and \nstaff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. His \nprofessionalism, thoughtfulness, and frank responses earned him the \nrespect and confidence of the committee. His friendly demeanor and \ncandor helped him successfully represent the CIA's interests before the \ncommittee and Congress.\n  Tim Ireland throughout his career has shown a deep commitment to our \nnational security, proud service to the CIA, and a calm yet thorough \nperformance in his work. His more than 32 years of service as an \nintelligence officer has helped to keep our Nation and its citizens \nsafe.\n  Mr. President, we ask our colleagues to join us in thanking Mr. Tim \nIreland for his honorable service to the Central Intelligence Agency \nand the people of the United States. We also want to thank Tim's wife \nAndy for her support and understanding, as well as her sacrifices in \nallowing Tim to selflessly commit himself to protecting our Nation.\n  We wish Tim and Andy Ireland all the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/15/senate-section/article/S5686-1", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            KAYCEE, WYOMING\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the centennial \nof Kaycee, Wyoming.\n  The late Chris LeDoux, country singer and beloved citizen of Kaycee, \nonce sang ``Well, I just smile because they don't understand, but if \nthey ever saw a sunrise on a mountain mornin', watched those cotton \ncandy clouds roll by, they'd know why I live beneath these Western \nskies.'' The citizens of Kaycee will tell anyone they meet that no \ntruer words have ever been spoken about their town. Located in \nnortheastern Wyoming, Kaycee is nestled in the foothills of the Big \nHorn Mountains with the Powder River flowing through its heart and the \nsprawling plains spread out before it.\n  I stand here today to honor the town in its 100 year celebration, but \nmany citizens would tell you that the town is 107. In 1906, the \ncitizens in this blooming new municipality filed for incorporation, but \nthe town went without a city government until the first town council \nmeeting on August 12, 1913. Whether the town's age is 100 or 107, we \ncongratulate Kaycee on this important milestone.\n  Kaycee has a rich and varied history. Before the settlers and the \nranchers came, Kaycee and the area surrounding it was the home of the \nNorthern Cheyenne and Pawnee. Following the 1876 Battle of Dull Knife, \nthe Cheyenne survivors surrendered and relocated, first to a \nreservation in Oklahoma, and then finally to the Pine Ridge Reservation \nin South Dakota. The outlaws Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid also \nused the beautiful but rough mountain terrain of the Kaycee area to \nelude capture by lawmen and bounty hunters at the Hole in the Wall \nCanyon.\n  Ranchers and cowboys were very important in the development of the \narea. The men driving cattle through the region needed supplies, thus \ncreating an opportunity for businesses at the Powder River crossing. \nHowever, the area was not tamed until after the 1892 Johnson County \ncattle war. This range war between small ranchers and larger ranching \noperations eventually required the intervention of President Benjamin \nHarrison.\n  As the battles for land settled down, ranchers began to expand \nagriculture in the area and people from all walks of life came to \nKaycee to create new lives for themselves. Some ranchers brought in \nsheep to graze the prairies, and with the sheep came the unique culture \nof the sheepherders. Among these are the Basque people who traveled \nfrom the Pyrenees Mountains on the border between Spain and France. \nTheir legacy is strong with the people of Kaycee today.\n  In addition to providing for the diverse wildlife and agriculture, \nthe rich hills of Kaycee have abundant energy resources. Every day, \ncitizens of this great community are working to increase our Nation's \nenergy independence by mining uranium and bentonite, and drilling oil.\n  In honor of the centennial of Kaycee, Wyoming, I invite my colleagues \nto see this wonderful place in person. I applaud the residents of the \ntown for their efforts to celebrate such rich history and to present it \nto visitors from all over the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/15/senate-section/article/S5686-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/15/senate-section/article/S5686-3", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/15/senate-section/article/S5686-4", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5686-S5687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. WYDEN, from the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources, without amendment:\n       S. 363.

A bill to amend the Wounded Warrior Act to establish a \nspecific timeline for the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs to achieve interoperable electronic health records, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, the men and women of our armed services \nsacrifice a great deal for this country and when their service ends \nthey should not have to worry about retaking medical tests or jumping \nthrough bureaucratic hoops to make sure their health records are \ncomplete. We need a modern health record system, and it needs to happen \nwithout further delay.\n  Each year 150,000 servicemembers make the transition from military \nservice to veteran status. When a servicemember makes that change their \nhealth records should go with them and transition seamlessly from the \nDepartment of Defense to the Department of Veterans Affairs. \nUnfortunately, as it stands today, the two Departments operate separate \nhealth record systems that do not communicate with each other. This can \ncause gaps in a servicemember's health record, meaning more medical \ntests that lead to greater costs and an increase in the backlog of \ncases at the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  For fifteen years we have tried to fix this problem, and in the past \n5 years the Departments have spent around $1 billion but we are not \nthere yet. Recently, Secretary Hagel announced that the two Departments \nwere abandoning the goal of creating a single health system. Instead, \nthe Department of Defense will invest in a commercial system that will \nbe able to communicate with the system being used by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs.\n  These recent efforts are a positive sign, but we must make sure the \nDepartments continue to make progress towards a cohesive health system. \nThat is why I am filing legislation that will provide a timeline for \nthe health record systems to be able to talk to one another. In \naddition, this legislation encourages innovation in the sharing of \nelectronic records and will provide patients greater access to their \nhealth records.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/07/15/senate-section/article/S5688-2", "month": "07", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 195--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY AND REPRESENTATION IN THE \n         MATTER OF THE PROPOSED DISCIPLINE OF LAURA BLOCK LOWER\n\n  Mr. REID of Nevada (for himself and Mr. McConnell) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
