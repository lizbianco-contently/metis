Mr. President, yesterday I warned of the economic \nconsequences if a few extremist Republicans force a government \nshutdown. Already, the stock market has slipped, and that is an \nunderstatement. Five days in a row--the longest continuous period since \n2012--the stock market has gone down, and they all say it is the result \nof the fear of the government shutting down. And why should the \nfinancial markets feel any differently? People are still speaking about \nclosing the government.\n  Now, the talk by a few Republicans over here has stopped the last 24 \nhours, but they over there are taking up where the long talk over here \nended: Close the government. The tea party is still insisting on a \nshutdown. It is hard to comprehend, but it is true.\n  The dark consequences do not end just by saying that. If the Federal \nGovernment closes its doors, seniors applying for Social Security will \nnot be able to apply. Veterans applying for disability will not be able \nto apply. They would be forced to wait until the Federal workers return \nto their posts. The FBI, because of sequestration and other anomalies \nwe have around here, is talking about furloughing their employees, \nclosing their offices 1 day a week. Across the country, mortgage loans \nand small business loans would be delayed. Members of the military will \nbe forced to defend this country without even a paycheck as thanks. \nBillions of dollars will drain from the economy every day the \ngovernment is closed for business.\n  This is not hyperbole, not conjecture. It is the truth. If you look \nback at history, it pretty well determines where you are on a given \nday, and if you look back to when Newt Gingrich and the Republicans \ncontrolled Congress--the House of Representatives--they shut down the \ngovernment in 1995 because President Clinton would not meet their every \ndemand, and it cost the country tens of billions of dollars.\n  So yesterday I urged Republicans to consider the impact of a shutdown \non\n\n[[Page S6906]]\n\nthe recovery. But the economic price of shutting down the government \nshould not be the only thing keeping the Republicans up at night; they \nshould worry about the political consequence as well.\n  Mr. President, we are all politicians, all 100 of us. A brandnew \npoll--CBS, a respected organization--says 80 percent of Americans--that \nis almost as much as favor background checks on guns--80 percent of \nAmericans--you rarely get 80 percent of Americans to agree on anything, \nbut they agree that those who want the government to be held hostage to \nextract these concessions are people they will not vote for. Seventy-\nfive percent of Republicans feel that way in this poll.\n\n  So those of us who remember the government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996 \nknow the story did not end well for Republicans. Just ask Charles \nKrauthammer. There is no more respected conservative--really \nconservative--columnist than Charles Krauthammer. He has penned a \nconservative column for the Washington Post since the 1980s. Here is \nwhat he wrote just a week or two ago:\n\n       Every fiscal showdown has redounded against the \n     Republicans. The first, in 1995, effectively marked the end \n     of the Gingrich revolution.\n\n  That is a direct quote.\n  As they did in the 1990s, today's radical Republicans have called for \nconcessions they know we will never agree to. Senate Democrats will not \nagree and the President will not agree. The Senate will never pass, nor \nwill President Obama sign, a bill that guts the Affordable Care Act and \ndenies millions of Americans access to lifesaving health care.\n  The statement made by John McCain yesterday said it all. He has some \ncredentials to talk about that. He was the Republican nominee for \nPresident of the United States. He did not like what happened with \nhealth care, and he talked about it here. He wished it had not passed, \nbut it passed. He said it was a fair fight and he and the Republicans \nlost. Move on to something else is what he said.\n  The Senate will never pass, as I have indicated before, a bill that \nguts the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare. Tea party Republicans have \ndemanded the impossible and vowed to shut down the government unless \nthey get it.\n  Mr. Krauthammer and I do not agree all the time, but he aptly \nmeasured the fallout from the shutdowns of the mid-1990s and correctly \npredicted a similar result from a modern shutdown--a modern shutdown. \nHe wrote what nearly two dozen mainstream Republican Senators have also \nsaid: ``This gambit is doomed to fail.''\n  He also wrote:\n\n       This is about tactics. If I thought this would work, I \n     would support it. But I don't fancy suicide. It has a \n     tendency to be fatal.\n\n  That is an understatement.\n  I commend Republican Senators who have spoken in favor of reason, and \nyou cannot imagine how satisfied I am because that is how we used to \nget things done here. I can look back at John Breaux from Louisiana. If \nhe thought we were not doing enough on this side of the aisle, he \nreached out to Republicans and worked something out.\n  So what Republican Senators have said in the last few days is really \nimportant. They have spoken out for reason, calling the tea party's \nshutdown ultimatum a ``box canyon,'' a ``suicide note,'' and ``the \ndumbest idea ever.'' Although these reasonable Republicans dislike \nObamaCare as much as their more radical colleagues, they also realize \nthe futility and the danger of political hostage-taking. They know this \ncountry cannot be governed by one faction of one party on one side of \nthe Capitol. Governing must be a cooperative effort that sets aside \nideological or parochial concerns in favor of what is best for the \nNation, for the economy, and for middle-class families.\n  On November 14, 1995--the first day of the first government \nshutdown--President Clinton urged Republicans in Congress to govern \nwith him instead of fighting against him. This is what he said:\n\n       There is, after all, a simple solution to the problem. All \n     Congress has to do is to pass a straightforward bill to let \n     government perform its duties and pay its debts. Then we can \n     get back to work and resolve our differences . . . in an \n     open, honest, and straightforward manner.\n\n  Mr. President, every Thursday when we are in session, I do a \n``Welcome to Washington.'' A lady from Boulder City, NV, came up to me. \nShe said: I work for the Park Service, and we are so afraid. At the \nPark Service, we don't know what we are going to do. The last time \nthere was a government shutdown, the parks closed. There is so much \nconfusion. That is the way it is throughout government.\n  So I offer today the same advice that President Clinton gave in 1995. \nLet government perform its duties. The way out of this predicament is \nas simple today as it was in 1995. So again I invite my Republican \ncolleagues to return with me to the time when we worked to resolve our \ndifferences in an open, honest, and straightforward manner.\n  Mr. President, I am going to take a few minutes. I apologize to my \nRepublican counterpart, but we have to understand, the American people \nhave to understand the seriousness of what is going on around here.\n  Tom Friedman wrote yesterday in his op-ed piece--he is a renowned \nsyndicated columnist. He has won three Pulitzer Prizes. He has had six \nor seven best-selling books. I am not going to read everything he \nwrote, but I want to read a little bit that he wrote yesterday.\n\n       The Republican Party is being taken over by a Tea Party \n     faction that is not interested in governing on any of the big \n     issues--immigration, gun control, health care, debt and \n     taxes--where, with just minimal compromises between the two \n     parties, we'd amplify our strengths so much that we'd \n     separate ourselves from the rest of the world. Instead, this \n     group is threatening to shut down the government and \n     undermine America's vital credit rating if it doesn't get its \n     way.\n       This kind of madness helped to produce the idiotic \n     sequester--the $1.2 trillion in automatic, arbitrary and \n     across-the-board budget cuts from 2013 to 2021--that is \n     already undermining one of our strongest assets.\n\n  And here he goes:\n\n       Ask Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National \n     Institutes of Health, the crown jewel of American biotech \n     innovation. In fiscal 2013, the sequester required the N.I.H. \n     to cut $1.55 billion across the board: 5 percent at each of \n     its 27 institutes and centers, irrespective of whether one \n     was on the cusp of a medical breakthrough and another was \n     not. ``There was still an ability within each institute to \n     make adjustments, but, as N.I.H. director, I could not decide \n     to emphasize cancer research and down modulate something \n     else,'' Collins explained.\n       Because of the sequester and the fact that the N.I.H. \n     budget has been losing ground to inflation for 10 years, ``we \n     will not be able to fund 640 research grants that were scored \n     in the top 17 percent of the proposals we received,'' said \n     Collins.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       ``They would have been funded without the sequester, but \n     now they won't. They include new ideas on cancer, diabetes, \n     autism and heart disease--all the things that we as a country \n     say are a high priority. I can't say which of those grants \n     would have led to the next breakthrough, or which \n     investigator would be a Nobel Prize winner 20 years from \n     now.''\n       Of those 640 top research proposals, 150 were from \n     scientists financed in a previous budget cycle who had \n     returned to the N.I.H. to secure another three to five years \n     of funding--because they thought they were really on to \n     something and a peer review board agreed. ``Now we are \n     cutting them off,'' said Collins, ``so you damage the \n     previous investment as well as the future one.''\n       In 2014, the N.I.H. was planning to offer new money to \n     stimulate research proposals in a dozen areas including how \n     to speed up the use of stem cells to cure Parkinson's and \n     other diseases, how to better manage pain in sickle-cell \n     disease, and how to improve early diagnosis of autism. All \n     were shelved because of the sequester, said Collins: Why ask \n     people to submit applications we would just have to turn \n     down.\n       In addition, in 2013, the N.I.H. had to turn away from its \n     research hospital 750 patients who wanted to be part of a \n     clinical trial for disorders for which medicine currently has \n     no answers. America's biomedical ecosystem depends heavily on \n     N.I.H. doing basic research the private sector won't do.\n       So we're cutting the medical research that has the \n     potential to prevent and cure the very diseases that are \n     driving health care costs upward.\n       In short, we're cutting without a plan--the worst thing a \n     country or company can do--and we're doing it because one of \n     our two parties has been taken over by angry radicals and \n     barking fools and the old leadership is running scared. But \n     when the Republican Party goes this far off the rail, it \n     isn't even remotely challenging President Obama to challenge \n     his base on taxes and entitlements.\n       And thus does a great country, with so much potential, \n     slowly become ungreat.\n\n  Not only do we have sequestration, now they want to do even more and \nshut the government down and not extend the debt ceiling. This is a say \nbad time for America. I hope people come to their senses.\n\n[[Page S6907]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/26/senate-section/article/S6907-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, later this morning in Maryland, the \nPresident will try again to sell his namesake health care plan to an \nincreasingly skeptical public. He will claim that Americans will have \nlots and lots of options under ObamaCare. Unfortunately, keeping the \nplan you have and like will not be an option for a great many \nAmericans.\n  It must be frustrating for the President that folks keep tuning out \nall of this happy talk. It is not hard to see, frankly, why Americans \nare not buying the spin. Over the past couple of years, I have \nparticipated in more than 50 health care town halls in my home State. I \nhave met with health care professionals, doctors, and nurses. I have \nmet with patients, and I have met with everyday Kentuckians, folks who \nare just concerned about providing health care for their families.\n  Many of the Kentuckians I have met with are a lot more knowledgeable \nabout ObamaCare than the Washington intelligentsia might like to \nassume. In fact, more than a few of them seem to know more about the \nlaw than some of my colleagues who rammed it through Congress. Let's be \nclear. A person does not need a Ph.D. to understand that a law that \ndrives costs up rather than down is a bad deal.\n  Kentuckians understand that the new government bureaucracies are less \nlikely to lower costs and improve care than they are to just simply get \nin the way. So it is for these and so many other reasons that \nKentuckians and people across this country are rightly concerned about \nObamaCare.\n  Two nights ago, I had another great opportunity to connect on this \nissue with Kentuckians via a tele-town hall. I will tell you, the good \npeople of my State are as concerned about this law as ever. One woman \nwho participated said she thought she had been making it, but reports \nthat she will now be forced to get a second job due in no small part to \nObamaCare.\n  I have received more than 50,000 letters from constituents frustrated \nby ObamaCare as well. Single parents want to know what they are \nsupposed to do when their hours are cut. Families want to know why \nWashington is OK with their insurance premiums going up by double \ndigits. Small business owners want to know how they are ever going to \ncomply with more than 20,000 pages of regulations. They want to know \nhow they are going to be able to keep their employees insured, \nworkforces growing, businesses expanding, and far too often, their \ndoors open once this law comes on line.\n  One Kentuckian from Henderson wrote to me about the small trucking \nbusiness she and her husband own. They have got 13 employees, and they \nhave always provided insurance for all of them. But their agent \nrecently told them their premiums would go up, a 100-percent increase \nin premiums. Here is what she wrote to me:\n\n       We can't afford this, even if we raise the portion the \n     employees pay. Then they wouldn't be able to afford it.\n\n  That was the experience reported to me by a woman and her husband \nrunning a small business in Henderson. These are the utterly \npredictable consequences of a law rammed through by a Democratic \nmajority over the objections of the American people early on a cold, \ndark, Christmas Eve morning.\n  Until a few brave Democrats join our united Republican conference in \nvoting to get rid of ObamaCare and starting over with a real bipartisan \nreform, we are going to continue hearing this same heart-wrenching \nstories over and over again.\n  We are going to keep seeing articles like the one that appeared \nearlier this week in Politico. It is titled, ``Obamacare: One Blow \nAfter Another.'' I want to read the opening paragraph:\n\n       The ObamaCare that consumers will finally be able to sign \n     up for next week is a long way from the health plan President \n     Barack Obama first pitched to the nation.\n\n  Among other things the story notes that ``millions of low-income \nAmericans will not receive coverage'' and ``a growing number of workers \nwon't get to keep their employer-provided coverage.'' Just yesterday, \nwe heard the District of Columbia's exchange hit a huge bump in the \nroad just days before launch. I would not be surprised if we see more \nstories of these types of problems popping up all across our country.\n  Let's talk about premiums too. A few weeks ago one veteran at a town \nhall wanted to know how this law could possibly be free. This veteran \nsaid: How can it possibly be free? Well, of course it is not free. He \nwas right. Premiums are part of that story. Based on the \nadministration's own data, along with some intrepid reporting, here is \nhow much more a single 27-year-old can expect to pay under ObamaCare in \nColumbus, OH: 436 percent increase, for a 27-year-old under ObamaCare \nin Columbus, OH.\n\n  In Charlotte, NC, it is 523 percent; Little Rock, 613 percent more, \n613 percent. Imagine for a moment. You are 27. You have done everything \nright. You have studied hard, graduated from college. You have student \nloan debt, car payments, car insurance payments, utility bills, rent, \nrenter's insurance, 401(k) contributions, and health insurance, of \ncourse. Then there is gas, food, and maybe just maybe, occasionally \nhaving a little bit of fun.\n  Then you lose your employer-sponsored health plan thanks to \nObamaCare. You get dumped into the exchanges. So jack up those monthly \nhealth insurance payments by 300, 500, even 600 percent. What are you \nsupposed to do now, go uninsured and pay penalty taxes? Stop \ncontributing to your retirement account? You cannot very well give up \nthe car you need to get to work, or food, or paying back your student \nloans.\n  None of this is a good option. They are not good for our society \neither. We should not be setting up disincentives for 27-year-olds to \ninsure themselves or contribute to their own retirement. But this is \nthe incentive structure that ObamaCare creates. When you consider how \nhard the Obama economy has hammered millennials already, it is hardly \nfair to whack them again, especially when so many are just barely \nhanging on as it is.\n  So this law is a mess. It needs to go. It is way past time to start \nover. As I have been saying all week, we need just five brave Democrats \nto join us to make that happen. So I hope some of our Democratic \nfriends who voted for this law will look at themselves in the mirror \nand think, truly think, about whether protecting the President's pride \nis really more important than helping the American people, because we \nowe our constituents better than ObamaCare.\n  We can do better. With your help we can do that.

Under the previous order, the time \nwill be controlled in hour increments, with the majority controlling \nthe first hour and alternating thereafter.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the families that I talk to in my home\n\n[[Page S6908]]\n\nState of Washington are not interested in partisan back and forth that \nwe see so much of here in Washington, DC. They are thinking about how \nthey are going to get their bills paid. They are wondering when and if \nthey will be able to save enough to retire. They are hoping that they \nare going to be able to give their children a better future.\n  They, rightfully, expect us to focus on strengthening the economy and \ncreating jobs which will make it easier for them to reach those \nimportant goals. We have had an opportunity, many opportunities over \nthe last few months, to move forward on legislation like the Senate \nbudget and the appropriations bills that were approved in Senator \nMikulski's committee, which could remove some of the uncertainty that \nis putting a drag on our economic recovery.\n  But instead we are here on the floor of the Senate, to debate a \ntemporary--a temporary stopgap measure to fund the government just days \naway from a possible shutdown. I think all but a few of my colleagues \nwould agree with me that these circumstances are far from ideal. So as \nwe work to pass this bill, this temporary stopgap bill, and continue \nnegotiations on the longer term budget deal, I think it is really \nimportant to consider exactly how we got to this point, what this \ncontinuing resolution means in the context of ongoing discussions and \nwhat needs to happen for us to reach a more comprehensive agreement \nthat works for our families and for our economy.\n  As we all remember, if Democrats and many Republicans as well had \ntheir way, we could have begun a bipartisan budget conference between \nthe House and Senate months ago and prevented this chaos. When the \nSenate passed a budget, I was very hopeful that both sides would come \ntogether and work out an agreement that would end this cycle of \ngoverning by crisis and allow us to focus on creating jobs and economic \ngrowth.\n  Democrats have came to the floor 18 times now--18 times--to try to \nbegin a bipartisan conference with the House on our budget resolution. \nMany Republicans thought this made sense. They agreed. We should at \nleast sit down and try to get a deal. But as we all know now, an \nextreme minority of Republicans saw things differently, and they \nbelieved they would have more leverage if they created a crisis--like \nthe one we are approaching now--than a few months when there was not a \nlooming deadline.\n  Those Tea Party Republicans, backed by the Republican leadership, \nstood and said no to the bipartisan budget negotiations 18 times, \nagainst the wishes of Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  So, today, when we could have been focusing on the real challenges \nAmericans are facing, we are instead focused on preventing the Tea \nParty from shutting down the government, all because Tea Party \nRepublicans want another shot at dismantling the Affordable Care Act, \nwhich, by the way, was passed by a super majority, upheld by the \nSupreme Court, and was a major issue the American people weighed in on \nin the 2012 election.\n  In the House continuing resolution, tea party Republicans are \nfighting to take away health care coverage for millions of Americans \nand get rid of crucial services such as prevention and wellness visits \nfor Medicare patients, prescription drug savings for our seniors for \nwhich we fought so hard, and coverage for over 92,000 Americans who \nhave preexisting conditions.\n  This is absurd. It is a nonstarter.\n  There is no way Democrats are going to give in to these demands that \nare so clearly harmful to the American people. The same is true of the \nfight the tea party Republicans are trying to pick over the debt limit.\n  Some Republicans claim it is typical to threaten a catastrophic and \nunprecedented default in order to extract political concessions, but \nthe fact is the opposite is true. The vast majority of debt limit \nincreases in the last three decades occurred independent of efforts to \nreduce the deficit or put in place budget reforms.\n  While Democrats are more than happy to negotiate on the budget--and \nwe have been trying to do that for the last 6 months--we do stand \nfirmly behind President Obama and are not going to negotiate about \nwhether the United States of America pays its bills. We believe \nfamilies and businesses should not have to deal with any more of that \nuncertainty.\n  Honestly, I do think a lot of Republicans agree. More than a dozen \nRepublicans have spoken to discourage the tea party from starting a \npointless debate over defunding the Affordable Care Act in the bill to \nprevent a government shutdown. I do know quite a few Republicans agree. \nBrinksmanship over the debt ceiling is the height of irresponsibility.\n  Given all the infighting we have seen recently, governing by crisis \nclearly isn't working for Republicans. It is certainly not helping \nDemocrats make the investments we feel very strongly our country needs \nto succeed in the 21st century, and it has put a completely unnecessary \nburden on our families and our economy. It seems the only ones \nbenefiting from this perpetual crisis mode are tea party Republicans, \nand I see no reason to keep doing them any favors.\n  I call on the House Republicans to cut the tea party loose, give up \nthese partisan games, and pass the Senate's bill to prevent the \ngovernment shutdown. This bill is, by no means, a permanent fix. It is \ntemporary. It continues the cuts from sequestration that are already in \nplace and locked into law until we get a bipartisan deal.\n  It will keep our government operating while those negotiations \ncontinue. This is critical, because even though some might not be able \nto see it in Washington, DC, a government shutdown will have serious \nconsequences for families across this country.\n  My home State of Washington is home to more than 100,000 uniformed \ncivilian and defense employees at places such as Joint Base Lewis-\nMcChord and Fairchild Air Force Base. If this government shuts down, \nthese men and women will still have to go to work the next day, but \nthey will not get paid for it.\n  Thousands of civilian defense employees in places such as Tacoma, \nWhidbey Island, and Spokane would be forced to do the same and \nthousands more could face furloughs. These hard-working Americans and \nfamilies across my State and the country are already dealing with the \nconsequences of gridlock in Washington, DC. They are dealing with the \nacross-the-board cuts from sequestration, which continue to pile up.\n  Hundreds of thousands of our defense employees, who now have to \nwonder about the effects of a shutdown, have been furloughed already \nand have taken pay cuts. Crucial supports and opportunities for \nvulnerable families and communities, from Head Start to Meals On \nWheels, have been slashed. Sequestration is crippling our ability to \nplan for the future and make the kinds of investments in research, \neducation, and infrastructure that will help our workers succeed. I \nhear about the impact of these arbitrary cuts whenever I am home in \nWashington State. I know every single one of my colleagues has heard \nsimilar stories. The cuts are only going to get worse with time and \nthey simply have to go.\n  When we send this legislation back to the House, Republicans have to \nput an end to the tea party temper tantrums and pass our bill without \nany gimmicks and games. After we do that, I hope we can leave the tea \nparty brinksmanship behind so those of us on both sides of the aisle \nwho believe in commonsense bipartisanship can move forward with \nnegotiations on a desperately needed longer term deal.\n  In those negotiations, I am going to continue fighting for an \nagreement that ends this governing by crisis and supports our families \nand economies by replacing sequestration with smarter deficit \nreduction, evenly divided between spending cuts and new revenue from \nthe wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations. I am fully aware the \nRepublicans have their priorities as well. I have never said reaching \nan agreement would be easy, but I know many Democrats and Republicans \nare sick of brinksmanship and crisis. I know they understand, as do we, \nthat compromise is part of our job description. I truly believe if \nthose Republicans work with Democrats, we can reach that critically \nneeded bipartisan agreement we have been working toward.\n  I have heard some of the tea party Republicans here in Washington, \nDC,\n\n[[Page S6909]]\n\ndismiss the damaging and costly disruptions a shutdown could cause. \nSome even seem to think that a default wouldn't be that bad, despite \nwarnings from countless economists that default would, in fact, be \ncatastrophic.\n  Americans across the country who are still fighting to get back on \ntheir feet don't have the luxury of dismissing these risks because they \nare the ones who are going to be affected. They are rightfully \nexpecting us to work together and reach a fair budget agreement that \noffers hard-working families more opportunity and more security. I \nbelieve putting the gimmicks and games aside and keeping the government \nopen is a necessary step toward that goal.\n  I am going to vote for this temporary continuing resolution and \nagainst the tea party's dysfunction and brinkmanship. I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same.\n  Part of the reason I am confident we can reach an agreement is \nbecause I know what we can do when we do work together. During this \npast summer, I worked with Senator Collins to write the transportation \nand housing appropriations bill for the coming fiscal year. It included \npriorities of Members on both side of the aisle, and it was approved in \nour committee with the support of six Republicans. That bill received \nstrong bipartisan support because it helps families, helps communities, \nand it gets workers back on the job. It was fiscally responsible, and \nit laid down a strong foundation for long-term and broad-based economic \ngrowth.\n\n  Our bill stands in stark contrast to the across-the-board \nsequestration cuts we have been operating under for the last 6 months. \nRather than slashing crucial investments in our infrastructure, our \nbill supports critical transportation projects across the country. It \nfully funds the highway and transit grant programs that allow our \nStates and local agencies to keep our transportation system working.\n  Rather than leaving our cities and towns that have been hard hit by \nthe recession to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps, our bill \nstrongly supports community development grants which offer the tools to \nstrengthen small businesses and local economies.\n  Instead of asking the most vulnerable to bear the burden of spending \ncuts, our bill funds a critical piece of the safety net, housing \nassistance and homeless shelters, for millions of struggling families \nand seniors who are just one step away from the street.\n  As any business owner will tell you, it makes no sense to slash the \ninvestments that allow one to compete and prosper in the long term only \nto make the numbers work in the short term. The investments that are \nlaid out in our bill are great examples. They make our country stronger \nby supporting job creation, economic growth, and by keeping our \ncommitment to help those most in need get back on their feet.\n  The need for these investments far exceeds the resources of the bill. \nThe bill Senator Collins and I have written keeps our commitment to our \nStates, communities, and makes sure the agencies in the bill can meet \ntheir statutory responsibilities. That will not be the case as \nsequestration continues for yet another year, which would make these \ncommitments impossible to keep.\n  It is important to note that the housing and transportation bill \naddresses challenges our country faces today. A full-year bill enables \nCongress to adjust funding levels to meet current needs and to \nimplement new policies that address the problems that have come to \nlight in recent years. This is something that does not happen when we \nopt for long-term continuing resolutions.\n  A great example is we know that one of every four of our bridges is \nconsidered deficient by the Federal Highway Administration. Our bill \nincludes funding to repair or replace deficient bridges across the \ncountry in order to protect the safety and reliability of our \ntransportation system.\n  If we simply extend the funding levels we debated 2 years ago, then \nthose investments and many others that create jobs, protect public \nsafety, and support the most vulnerable will be lost. We will also lose \nthe improvements our bill makes to programs, including reforms that \naddress concerns Members have raised the last time the transportation \nand housing bill came to the Senate floor.\n  Our bill includes important section 8 reforms that will reduce costs \nand create efficiencies. It contains reforms to improve oversight of \npublic housing agencies and boards, ensures accountability for property \nowners who don't maintain the quality of their HUD-assisted housing, \nand it increases accountability in the CDBG Program.\n  It is very important that we enact those reforms and do the important \noversight of Federal programs and agencies that the public expects us \nto do. For all these reasons, we need to pass this continuing \nresolution to keep the government running. Then we have to move forward \non a longer term budget agreement that replaces sequestration with more \nresponsible deficit reduction, a bill that puts our families and \neconomies first, and allows us to enact real, thoughtful solutions to \nour country's challenges, instead of these stopgap measures that do not \nmove us forward.\n  Investing in our families, communities, and our long-term economic \ngrowth shouldn't be partisan. The bipartisan work that went into the \nhousing and transportation bill and the strong support it received in \ncommittee proves they don't have to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Democratic \namendment to the House continuing resolution. We have offered this \namendment because its content offers a clear path forward to do three \nthings:\n  No. 1, avoid a government shutdown; No. 2, lay the groundwork for \nending sequester for hopefully the next 2 years, which means finding a \nway to reduce our public debt in each of those years by $100 million; \nand, No. 3, get rid of the theatrical veto-bait-provocative amendments \nthat are in the House bill calling for the defunding of the President's \nAffordable Care Act and also for the way they structure public debt.\n  We offered this amendment because we think it is the best way \nforward. The American people expect us to do our job. It is Thursday \nmorning, 10:45, and we are only now getting on the amendment. Why? \nBecause for the last several days we had to put up with theatrical \npolitics, rather than get the job done and begin deliberation. We have \ngone from being the greatest deliberative body in the world to the \ngreatest delay body in the world. The American people are fed up, and \nso are many of us in the Senate. When all is said and done, more gets \nsaid than gets done. This is the time to act.\n  We have an amendment on the floor that is open for full debate. I am \nabsolutely for this, but we need to do the business of government to be \nable to do our job. We must replace the sequester and allow a 2014 \nOmnibus appropriations to move forward before the end of the year. That \nsentence alone shows what is wrong in communicating with the American \npeople. Factually, it is accurate. It is absolutely truthful. But \nnobody understands sequester. Nobody understands the word omnibus and \nnobody understands what we are doing or, most of all, what we are not \ndoing.\n\n  Sequester was an invention by the Congress, working with the \nPresident, to say that we will reduce public debt over a 10-year period \nby $110 billion a year, do it in a balanced way--strategic cuts, a \nreview of mandatory spending and additional revenue--and if we fail to \ndo that, sequester triggers, which means across-the-board cuts--50 \npercent in Defense, 50 percent in domestic.\n  The problem with across-the-board cuts is that it cuts good programs \nas well as programs that are dated, duplicative, or dysfunctional. I \noppose that. I would rather make strategic cuts arrived at by the \ncommittee I chair--the Appropriations Committee.\n  For the last year, our committee has done its due diligence. Our job \nis to review programs and to put them in the Federal checkbook and \nbring them to the floor for debate, for amendment, and then for passage \nand sending them to the President. What we want to do in our amendment \nis to change the date of December 15 in the House bill to November 15. \nThat will keep the pressure on to get the deal needed so Congress can \nget to work and enact 12 fiscally responsible appropriations bills, lay \nthe groundwork for canceling sequester for 2 years, and invest in the\n\n[[Page S6910]]\n\nneeds of America today and the needs of the future.\n  This amendment is important for two reasons. It prevents a government \nshutdown. The President has already said he will veto any bill that \ndefunds ObamaCare; he will veto any bill that undermines the full faith \nand credit of the United States. So you can huff and puff for 21 hours, \nbut you can't blow ObamaCare away. I repeat: You can huff and puff for \n21 hours, but you can't be the magic dragon that blows the Affordable \nCare Act away. So if we pass the House continuing resolution, the \nPresident will veto it, which means more wasted time in getting the job \ndone, and our agencies, instead of doing their job and fulfilling their \nmissions--making wise use of taxpayer money and being responsive to the \nAmerican people--will be spending their energy in planning for a \nshutdown, which amounts to a slamdown.\n  The President can sign the continuing resolution and keep the \ngovernment open if we pass the Senate amendment, which will keep the \ngovernment open until November 15 and gives us 1 month to arrive at \npragmatic solutions. It cancels the provocative elements in it--the \nelimination of ObamaCare and the public debt--and also lays the \ngroundwork for moving forward.\n  There will be a few things that will happen if we can't enact a clean \ncontinuing resolution, meaning keeping the government open by October \n1. There are consequences here. This isn't just about show business. \nThe government has to be open for business. An estimated 800,000 civil \nservants will be sent home or furloughed. What does that mean? If you \nare an FBI agent during this time, you will be on your job, you will be \nat your duty station, but when you are working, you won't get paid. You \nwill get an IOU. What does that say to people who put themselves in the \nline of fire?\n  Shutting down the government means we will affect crucial research \nand lifesaving discoveries that will be put on hold. The NIH clinical \ncenter won't be able to admit new patients for new clinical trials. \nWeather forecasters, food safety inspectors, and those involved with \npublic safety will be at their duty stations, but they are going to be \nearning IOUs and looking forward to across-the-board cuts, which means \nthey could be furloughed when we have already told them there will be \nno cost-of-living increase for 3 years.\n  We want to recruit the best and the brightest for the FBI, to oversee \nour drug approval process, or to be border control agents--work that is \ndirty and dangerous out there. What are we doing here?\n  We show a contempt for the people who work for the government, and \nthat also shows contempt for the people who pay for the government. Our \ngovernment should be working as hard as the people who pay the taxes to \nsupport the government. The way they work hard is to put the money in \nthere for the mission and purpose of these agencies, insist they do \ntheir jobs, and then we insist we get rid of the dated, the \nduplicative, and the dysfunctional. We have laid the groundwork for \ndoing this. In fact, we have been doing it all year long.\n  I chair the Appropriations Committee. It is made up of 12 \nsubcommittees. You will be hearing from my subcommittee chairmen \nthroughout the day. I am so proud of them. For the last year they have \nlistened. They have taken the President's budget and they have analyzed \nit. They have conducted hearings. They have reviewed it, they have \nscrubbed it--as I said, they have analyzed it and squeezed it. I am \nproud of them. Out of what they have done they are ready to bring to \nthe Senate floor legislation that makes wise use of taxpayer dollars. \nThey have listened at every single hearing to inspectors general, where \nwe learn about the dated, dysfunctional, or duplicative, and they are \nready to move. But we cannot move if we continue having theatrical \nshowdown politics.\n  This will have grave impact. When we hear shutdown politics and \neventually slowdown through sequester, what we are facing here will \nhave a negative impact on our economy. It will add to the uncertainty \nfor businesses to make wise decisions. It will also slow down, in a \nway, the impact to jobs because we fund infrastructure and other needed \nprograms. It will impact public safety and it will impact future \ngenerations because of the big hit on research and development that \ncomes up with the new ideas for the new jobs.\n  Later on today I will be talking about the NIH, which is in my State. \nYes, the NIH. Because of NIH funding, thousands of people work in \nMaryland but thousands of people are working for the United States of \nAmerica. And at the end of the day, they are trying to come up with \ncures--cures that can be opportunities to create--so we are talking \nabout saving lives, doing the basic research that then helps us get \nthose jobs in biomedical and pharmaceuticals, and also to improve the \nlives of our people, improve our economy, and get the job done.\n  I will have more to say, but right now I want to turn to Senator \nPryor, who is the chair of the agriculture subcommittee. He is a new \nchairman, but he is not new to getting the job done. In fact, we refer \nto him as ``Tightwad'' Pryor. He has looked at the programs, he has \nanalyzed how we are truly going to get value for the dollar and at the \nsame time feed the hungry here and around the world, and also make sure \nthat important, vibrant sector of our economy--the agricultural \nindustry--is viable.\n  I yield the floor for Senator Pryor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the Agriculture \nappropriations bill, but I have to start by thanking our chairwoman of \nthe Appropriations Committee. She has already done so many good things \nfor that committee and for the Senate. Obviously, she has been a great \nSenator for the State of Maryland, and we see that greatness as she \nleads the Appropriations Committee. I think all the members of the \nAppropriations Committee, both Democrats and Republicans, would like to \nthank her for her service and her leadership.\n  Today I do want to talk about the agriculture appropriations bill and \nthe impact a government shutdown would have on the activities it \nsupports and the negative ripple effects--and there would be many \nnegative ripple effects--that would come to our Nation's economy if \nthat in fact does happen.\n  When people hear the phrase Agriculture appropriations, they \nnaturally think about farmers, and that is certainly a key part of what \nis in our agriculture sector and in this bill, but that is certainly \nnot all it does. The bill helps farmers with operating loans and \nconservation projects and marketing--all those are very important--but \nit also funds programs that benefit rural communities to supply clean \ndrinking water for people in rural areas, and housing. It supports \nnutrition programs. It helps kids all across the country. It also not \nonly involves food but the international food programs--programs such \nas Food for Peace, et cetera. It also has the Food and Drug \nAdministration in it, and that is critically important. We need a \nstrong, robust FDA.\n  This bill has been very bipartisan. This bill is about investing in \nour future. What we do here in this bill is actually try to save money. \nWe understand there are budget constraints. We get that. We want to \nlead the way by responsible governing, making sure we do things in the \nright way by making smart, targeted investments and saving taxpayer \ndollars by eliminating redundancy and streamlining loan programs and \ndoing things to make the USDA and the FDA spend their money wisely.\n  At the same time we are trying very hard not to reduce any services \nto hard-working Americans, and we are also certainly trying not to hurt \nany industries in this country.\n  Sequestration is already taking a toll on many of these programs. If \nwe look at the cuts these agencies have had to undergo in the last 2 or \n3 years, we already see a strain on their budgets and the difficulties \nthere. A government shutdown would wreak havoc on our economy.\n  I think I speak for most Americans, certainly most Arkansans, when I \nsay I am currently undergoing shutdown fatigue. We are tired of this. \nWe are tired of the drama. We are tired of, honestly, the other Chamber \nembarrassing the Congress and engaging in these dramatics. People are \njust tired of it. When I am home in Arkansas, whether I am filling up \nat the gas station or I am at the grocery or at the ball game or \nwherever I happen to be, people\n\n[[Page S6911]]\n\ncome up to me and say: What is wrong with Congress?\n  In fact, I was at a major fundraising event for cancer research in \nLittle Rock on Friday evening. I bet I had a dozen people come up to me \nand say: What is going on with the House of Representatives? Why do \nthey continue to do this? And I agree. It is hard to watch. It is not \ngood for the Congress. As I say, I have shutdown fatigue. We don't need \nany more drama. We need to get back to the business of governing. \nGoverning isn't always easy. We have to make hard decisions. That is \nwhy we run for these jobs. We run for these jobs to work to get things \ndone and to try and make good and wise decisions for our people and for \nour Nation. That is the way it is supposed to work.\n  I think my colleagues will agree with me when I say that \nstrengthening our economy and creating jobs is our No. 1 priority right \nnow. We look at the recession we have been through and we see the \nhardships folks have gone through. Strengthening our economy and \ncreating jobs is our No. 1 priority, and this bill will help us do it. \nAgain, it is hard to get to that No. 1 priority when we have some of \nthe shenanigans going on here in the U.S. House with some of these \nmanufactured crises they have created.\n  What I want to say about agriculture is it is one of the core \nstrengths in the U.S. economy.\n  We do a lot of things well. Our economy does a lot of things well. \nBut no one does agriculture better than America. It is something we \nshould be proud of. We do it so well, we probably take it for granted \nsometimes, but it is a core strength in the U.S. economy.\n  If we want one little bit of evidence for that, look at our trade \ndeficit. Everyone in this Chamber knows our trade deficit is not good. \nWe know it is bad. We know it is ugly. We want to change that. We want \nto make it better. But our trade deficit would be horrendous if it were \nnot for agriculture. That is our No. 1 export. This is something we \nneed to be mindful of: Agriculture is very good for the U.S. economy.\n  Take something as simple as raising chickens. That is not very \nexciting and a lot of people don't understand the first thing about it, \nbut think about what impact it has on the States and the counties and \nthe communities where this happens.\n  First, someone has to build the chicken house, someone delivers the \nchicks, someone delivers the feed. Someone has to maintain the trucks \nthat deliver the chicks and the feed. Someone has to generate the \nelectricity, someone has to supply the water. Someone is paying taxes \non all this, and it is helping local schools and local police and fire \ndepartments, et cetera. Someone at some point picks up the chickens and \ndelivers them to the processing plant, and it all starts over. Someone \nhas to build the plant. This has a huge ripple effect on the U.S. \neconomy and on everything about agriculture. It is not just the \nfarmers, it is a ripple effect and a positive effect on the economy.\n  Take the example of Arkansas, and I am sure this is true in many \nother States. I haven't looked at the numbers, but I bet this is true \nin 35 or 40 other States, and it is our largest industry. We love \nhaving our Fortune 500 companies there and we have several that are \nbased in Arkansas. We have more that have some sort of facility or \nplant or site of some sort. We love that and we are proud of that. But \nagriculture is our No. 1 industry. One in six jobs in Arkansas is tied \nto agriculture. It has a $17 billion net effect on the economy and it \nis 25 percent of our State's economy.\n  I was speaking with Debbie Stabenow not too long ago. She said, We \nare all known for manufacturing and heavy manufacturing in Michigan. \nAnd they are. But, she said, our second largest industry is \nagriculture. She is chairman of the Agriculture Committee, and she \nfought very hard to get the farm bill back on track, and much to her \ncredit she has moved that ball farther down the field than I think \nanyone else could.\n  Another reason I want the House to stop with this manufactured crisis \nand follow the Senate's lead to pass a commonsense, comprehensive farm \nbill--and I don't say that lightly. I have a lot of respect for the \nHouse. Certainly they are a separate institution within this branch of \ngovernment. I certainly have a lot of respect for that and their \nposition, and their role is critical. But they need to follow the \nSenate's lead. They need to follow the Senate and do what the Senate \nhas done. We are trying to be responsible. We are trying to show \nleadership. We are trying to get things back on track.\n  But when I mentioned Arkansas a moment ago, we are not alone. There \nare over 3 million farmers in the United States, and as a nation \nagriculture employs about 22 million people. The Agriculture \nappropriations bill would allow us to build on this economic powerhouse \nthat we have in this country. This bill helps farmers get started. It \nhelps farmers increase their yield and it helps them become better \nstewards of the land. Funding these programs creates jobs in rural \nAmerica. If you haven't been there recently, rural America needs jobs.\n  Take a program such as the USDA Rural Development Program. They \ncreate construction jobs. They rebuild hometowns and schools and other \nfacilities, and they keep our rural communities strong. We don't want \nthe Tale of Two Nations here where you have urban and suburban America, \nand rural America is left behind. We want rural America to be strong as \nwell.\n  Almost every Member of this body has sizeable rural portions in their \nState. We want those areas to grow and be prosperous. So in this bill \nwe provide guaranteed loans for rural businesses to let them grow and \nto get small and emerging businesses where they need to be. We also \nprovide money for creation and expansion of businesses in rural \nsettings. A government shutdown would stop these programs. It would \nbring these programs to a dead halt in rural America. Why break the \nmomentum? Our economy is just turning the corner. We do not need to do \nthis. We can't forget the role that Agriculture appropriations bill \nplays in keeping our families and communities safe.\n  One thing I have to say is the Food and Drug Administration does a \ngreat job. Again, a lot of people may take them for granted because \nthey do such a good job, but we have the safest food supply in the \nworld and we have the safest drug supply in the world. Do we want to \njeopardize that? No. Please, let's not jeopardize that. Why are we \nplaying games with people's food and medicine? It makes no sense at \nall. It is an unbelievable statistic, but in Arkansas alone the FDA \noversees 1,300 facilities, just in my small State. They also have \npresence there with the National Center for Toxicological Research in \nJefferson County that employs about 500 people. They do great things \nthere, and it is a very important, vital part of what FDA does. We are \ncertainly proud to have them.\n  Arkansas has 85 poultry and 50 meat processing plants. These are \ninspected by the Food Safety Inspection Service, FSIS. Last year my \ngood friend, Senator Blunt from Missouri, and I worked very hard with \nthe chairwoman of the committee and others in this Chamber to make sure \nthose meat inspectors stayed on the job; because the day that they \nmiss, that jeopardizes thousands of private sector jobs and \nproductivity and disruption to a very efficient market. So we were able \nto do that. Here again, all that is in jeopardy because of the games \nthey are playing in the House on this issue.\n  The progress we made when it comes to infrastructure would also stop. \nWe don't want to see that. We want to lay that foundation for future \neconomic growth. We all know infrastructure creates jobs. Clean water, \nwaste disposal systems, broadband expansion we have been fighting for, \nnot just in rural Arkansas but in every rural State.\n  These investments are critical to growing our Nation's businesses and \nthey are critical to local communities. This helps all Americans.\n  The programs I have talked about today are supported by Members on \nboth sides of the aisle. When we moved this through the committee, we \ngot a 23-6 vote. Senator Blunt and I worked together, hand in hand, on \nevery single provision. We produced a better bill because we did work \ntogether. It is a good solid case for bipartisanship and how to get \nthings done. It is one of the strongest bipartisan votes we have had in \nthe committee so far.\n  Nonetheless, I urge my colleagues to please follow the example of the \nAppropriations Committee generally, but the\n\n[[Page S6912]]\n\nAgriculture appropriations subcommittee specifically. Let's come \ntogether and let's do what is best for our economy and for the American \npeople.\n  Before I yield the floor, I thank Senator Mikulski for her \nleadership. It is not always easy to lead Senators. It is sometimes \nlike trying to herd cats, but nonetheless we are responding to her \nleadership. She is doing great things, not just for the State of \nMaryland but for the country and the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I will begin where Senator Pryor left off, \nand that is to commend our chairwoman for her extraordinary \nleadership--not only on behalf of her constituents but for the Nation. \nThese are very difficult times, and we all feel much more confident \nbecause of her leadership, because of her commitment, because of her \nincredible and energetic advocacy for commonsense solutions, in terms \nof not just her work on appropriations but in terms of the way we \nconduct ourselves in the Senate. We are fortunate to have her \nleadership.\n  Along with many of my colleagues I am here to address the looming \nfiscal deadlines, and, more importantly, how to keep our economy \ngrowing and increasing jobs. That is why I believe we were sent here, \nnot to engage in some of these procedural arguments, not to challenge \nthe basic presumptions and the history of our country--which show that, \nwith few exceptions, we have always managed to keep our government \nopen, and with virtually no exceptions we have paid our bills. Yet \ntoday we are consumed by these debates when most every American in \nevery corner of this country is asking us: What about our jobs? What \nabout growth? What about the future for our children? So we have to \nrefocus on growing our economy and investing in our country. A big part \nof that is to fund our government and to pay our debts.\n  Let me start by pointing out that denying health insurance to 30 \nmillion Americans doesn't help the economy and it doesn't create jobs. \nIt will do quite the opposite--it will set us back. We had substantial \ndebate and we passed legislation; the Supreme Court of the United \nStates declared the legislation constitutional, and we are going \nforward now, as most Americans want us to do, to deploy it, to fix it \nwhere it needs to be fixed, but not to use it as a political wedge for \npurely political means. We are for the first time about to achieve the \ndream of many people in many decades--that every American will have \naffordable access to health care; and, by the way, to do what other \nnations have been able to do and reduce the cost of health care so it's \naffordable, not just today but in the generations ahead. I think the \nidea that you would threaten a government shutdown to try to defeat \nthis objective is unfortunate and inappropriate.\n  We are facing two fiscal deadlines, and they can be reduced to very \nsimple questions: Do we fund the government? Do we pay the Nation's \nbills? My answer, and the answer of the vast majority of constituents, \nis: Yes, we do. We have to.\n  We understand we have to have an economy that works and a government \nthat helps that economy work. We have to be efficient and effective. \nBut we simply can't leave to the mercies of the market and fate what \nhappens in our economy. We have to take purposeful action. That means \nwe have to have a government that is prepared and able and has the \nresources to act.\n  If Republicans force a shutdown of the government, it will have \nextraordinarily adverse consequences to thousands of Rhode Island \nworkers, my constituents, and people all across this country. It would \nhurt our economic growth. Rather than doing this, we should be working \nto expand our growth. We should be doing more to get people back to \nwork.\n  But, instead, we have heard Republicans from both Chambers talking \nabout another round of brinkmanship. We saw this in August 2011, and \nthe results there were palpable. It set back our economy. It suppressed \njob creation. It took what looked like growing economic momentum and it \ndeflated that momentum. Our credit rating was downgraded for the first \ntime in anyone's recollection and perhaps in history. It was a \nshortsighted political game that hurt people all across this country. \nYet Republicans are here again, apparently prepared to play the \ngame. People do not want us to gamble with their futures, their \nchildren's futures. They want us to be helping them, both sides \ninvesting in those futures in a positive and collaborative way.\n\n  But we are back arguing over whether to pay existing bills. Will we \npay our bills by voting to raise the debt ceiling? Will we keep the \ngovernment open and working so we can help people who need help, so we \ncontinue to research issues, so we continue to innovate, so we continue \nto build, literally, the country? We believe we must do this.\n  This March, Senate Democrats passed a budget that set spending \nlevels, responsibly replaced the sequester, reduced the deficit, and \nincluded a $100 billion targeted jobs and infrastructure package that \nwould start creating new jobs quickly, begin repairing the worst of our \ncrumbling roads and bridges, and help train our workers to fill 21st \ncentury jobs.\n  The Republican-controlled House also passed a budget. It is in stark \ncontrast to ours, but they have a budget too. The basic constitutional \napproach, the basic procedural approach is to bring those two budgets \nto conference, to iron out the differences, and to have a plan to go \nforward to fund the government.\n  But we cannot do that because repeatedly Republicans here have \nobjected to going to conference. This is ironic since the refrain we \nheard several years ago from Republicans was ``the Senate Democrats \ndon't have a budget, they don't have a budget, et cetera.'' This of \ncourse was a political refrain; it ignored the fact that in the Budget \nControl Act of 2011 we actually set budget limits and effectively had a \nbudget. But now the Republican refrain is sort of, ``never mind, they \nhave a budget,'' and Senate Republicans object to conferencing the \nSenate and House budgets because they do not want the Congress to have \na budget.\n  We need to pass a budget. We need to responsibly deal with \nsequestration. We have to create jobs and strengthen the middle class.\n  Last Friday, the House Republicans played their latest card in this \ngambit, which they have extended over several years, to achieve their \npolitical goals by holding the economy hostage. This time they want to \ndefund health care reform as a condition of keeping the government \nopen--indeed, a tactic that I believe even some Republicans in this \nbody have rejected, and I think sensibly rejected.\n  There is no doubt if the House position prevails it will hurt our \neconomy, it will reduce revenue, it will waste taxpayers' dollars. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, the shutdowns of the mid-\n1990s reduced GDP by half a percent. Those shutdowns during the Clinton \nadministration, again prompted by a Republican political agenda in the \nHouse, not an economic agenda, cost Americans jobs and growth. It is \nestimated every week the government shuts down it will cost the economy \nabout $30 billion. This is a very expensive political gambit--something \nthat should be rejected on its face but also rejected because of the \nharm, the demonstrable economic harm, it will do to the country. If you \ndo care about jobs and the economy, the last thing you want to do is \nshut down the government.\n  First of all, it eliminates directly a lot of people who work for the \nFederal Government--who pay taxes, who provide critical services. The \nsecondary effect is they cannot do their job so economic activity \nstalls. Then the tertiary effect is that the local vendors in the \ncommunity who rely on government contracts lose their business. It is a \ndownward spiral. Everyone here, particularly my colleagues, the chair \nmen and women of the appropriations subcommittees, recognize this.\n  Senator Pryor was articulate about some of the effects on the \nagricultural sector. I have the privilege of chairing the Interior \nappropriations subcommittee. A shutdown would be very disruptive. For \nexample, lease sales and permits for oil, gas and coal and other \nminerals on Federal lands would be stopped. Processing onshore oil and \ngas drilling applications would be stopped. Processing applications for \npermits to drill offshore will stop. Review and approval of offshore \nexploration and development plans will stop. What will be the effect? \nThis will delay\n\n[[Page S6913]]\n\nrevenue, obviously, both to the Federal Government and for the private \nsector, as those private entrepreneurs who are out there investing \ntheir own capital to try to develop natural resources and provide them \nto the marketplace will lose out too.\n  Another example, public access to recreation on Federal lands will \nvirtually cease. The national parks, national monuments, and national \nwildlife refuges will be closed to visitors. Campgrounds, lodging, \nvisitor centers, marinas, food services, and other concessions will be \nclosed, with thousands of people without jobs. Businesses that operate \nin the parks or as outdoor outfitters will not be able to access \npermitted areas.\n  If you go to any national park there is typically around it a group \nof small businessmen and women who provide backpacking gear, who \nprovide rental of rafts and boats and outdoor equipment. What happens \nwhen the park closes? Their business goes to zero, practically. That is \na consequence that is predictable, in fact, inevitable in the event of \na shutdown.\n  There is another aspect to this government shutdown too. While many \nFederal employees will be furloughed--again directly losing their pay, \nnot contributing their tax dollars to the national economy--there are \nsome who will not be. In the Interior Department alone, thousands of \nFederal workers will continue their jobs in order to protect life and \nproperty, but they will not be paid. This will include the Park Police. \nThey were one of the first responders a few days ago to the Navy Yard \nshootings. Typical of their ethic of service and dedication to the \ncountry, they risked their lives, rushed to that place to try to \nprotect fellow Americans. Those men and women of the Park Police will \nstill stand guard, but they will not be paid.\n  It also includes park rangers who provide valuable safety. It would \ninclude tribal law enforcement officers for our tribal police \ndepartments, tribal child protection services, and the oil and gas \ninspectors who have to go out and make sure existing operations are \nbeing conducted in a technically appropriate way.\n  Turning to the EPA, Administrator Gina McCarthy has said, in her \nwords: ``EPA effectively shuts down with only a core group of \nindividuals who are there in the event of a significant emergency.''\n  EPA is planning to furlough approximately 95 percent of its total \nworkforce. Staff will not be reviewing air, water, and hazardous waste \npermit applications or writing such permits. This will slow \nconstruction of new facilities and major improvements to existing ones, \nimpacting jobs and impacting industry's overall willingness to plan \ninvestments.\n\n  This could shrink construction in the United States, it could halt \nmajor construction projects, because you can't just take out the \npermitting process, or nullify it; these projects cannot go forward \nlegally without permits, permits from EPA, permits from local \nregulators. We could have a huge construction contraction. We will have \nprojects that have been planned, that are going forward, that will be \nput on hold, and it will ripple through the economy.\n  EPA, for example, also will stop certifying that manufacturers are \ncomplying with all vehicle emission standards and without EPA \ncertification, automakers will have a difficult time selling products \nin the United States.\n  One of the great examples of what the President's leadership has \ndone, the revitalization of the American automobile industry, could be \njeopardized simply because they cannot have their vehicles certified by \nthe EPA, which has basically closed.\n  A shutdown compounds the hidden costs of the sequester. Sequestration \nis an inefficient and blunt instrument. It forces the Agency to make \ndrastic decisions that frustrate that mission, that do not allow them \nto prioritize their work, and it frustrates our work here and \nthroughout the United States. It will complicate and compound our life \ngoing forward.\n  We are already feeling--put aside for the moment a potential \ngovernment shutdown--the effects of the pending sequestration. We are \nseeing forced furloughs up in Rhode Island at the Newport Navy Base and \nother facilities and we are seeing the ripple effect of that. The local \nbusinesses are seeing demand go down, revenues go down. Their financial \nstability is being threatened. Rhode Islanders who have been laid off \nin private enterprises, through no fault of their own, are seeing their \nunemployment insurance cut by the sequester already. The average weekly \nbenefit of $377 is being cut by $46. The Rhode Island Department of \nLabor and Training estimates 6,000 to 7000 Rhode Islanders are being \naffected, taking $1.4 million per month directly out of our economy. \nOur economy is at 9.1 percent unemployment. This is something that is \ncausing pain and hardship to families throughout my State. The \nsequester is cutting back on the very modest benefits that they might \nbe receiving after losing employment.\n  Head Start is an extraordinarily valuable program that serves more \nthan 2,400 children in my State. For fiscal year 2013, the \nsequestration has reduced funding by $1.3 million, which is a big \nnumber when it comes to the smallest state in the Union. To manage \nthese sequestration cuts, staff have been laid off, transportation has \nbeen reduced, as have other support services. Even with those savings, \n370 slots--children, don't call them slots--children will not gain \naccess to Head Start. That means in many cases their parents cannot \ncontinue to work because they cannot leave their child alone, and the \nproblem becomes more and more complicated. These problems have profound \nimplications and they reach very far across the spectrum.\n  Then there is one other point I wish to make. Some people are saying \nsequestration is bad, but we just have to deal with the defense aspects \nof it because that is the most important thing--that these other \nprograms, they can go away. Norm Augustine is one of the premier \nleaders in the defense industry. He is former chairman of Lockheed \nMartin, former Secretary of the Army. He served on so many different \nboards as one of the great public servants as well as one of the great \nindustrial leaders--National Academy of Engineering, Defense Science \nBoard, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. In his \nspeech recently, Mr. Augustine said that much of the nondefense \nspending people are dismissing as unimportant is more critical to our \nnational security or as critical as some of the defense programs. He \ntalked about how today's youngest generation will be the first in \nhistory to be less well educated than their parents, if trends \ncontinue. They are likely to be less healthy, particularly if we do not \ncontinue to support the health care improvements of the Affordable Care \nAct. One of the startling discoveries is that the military, according \nto Mr. Augustine, is claiming that 70 percent of today's young people \nare ineligible for military service because of mental, physical, and \nmoral shortcomings.\n  The mental and physical shortcomings are a function of two things--\neducation and health care. Republicans are proposing to say: Let's cut \nthem. Let's defund the Affordable Care Act. Who will be the \nbeneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act and better Head Start and \nbetter education? Probably those 70 percent of the young people who \ncannot qualify to be recruits in the Army. So if you think we have a \nproblem of national defense, we do have a problem of defense, but it is \nnot simply solved by buying more platforms, more ships, more planes; it \nis by having a generation of Americans who can stand and serve.\n  I could go on, but I simply want to say we are in a situation where \nwe have to basically do what we have always done, stood and said: We \nare going to keep the government moving. We are going to make choices \nabout priorities, but we are going to keep our government open. We will \ndebate those choices and we will debate those priorities and we will \ncome to a conclusion and we will move forward and we are going to pay \nthe debts we already accumulated.\n  The American people should understand this is not like an initial \noffer of a debt security.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. We are not going out there and saying: Listen, let us \nborrow\n\n[[Page S6914]]\n\nsome more money so we can spend this new money. We are just trying to \npay for programs and appropriations that have been approved by \nCongress, both Republicans and Democrats in both the House and the \nSenate. These are accumulated debt. Many of the debts were accumulated \nin the previous administration while we were fighting two wars.\n  We are not--and we shouldn't--turn our back virtually for the first \ntime in our history on what we have voted previously to spend. Indeed, \nif we do that, it will create chaos in the economic markets. It will \ncreate chaos like we have never seen before. The international markets \nare so fragile that we dare not risk this.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Arnold Garcia\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, before I begin my other remarks today, I \nwould like to say a few words about my friend, Arnold Garcia, who \nrecently announced his retirement as editor of the Austin American-\nStatesman editorial page. During a time of political polarization in \nWashington, Austin, and other cities across the country, Arnold enjoys \nthe respect and admiration of Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  He is a veteran of the United States Army and the Texas National \nGuard, and he spent 40 years at the Austin American-Statesman serving \nas head of the editorial page for more than 2 decades.\n  One of the most prominent and influential journalists in Texas, \nArnold has a great love and respect for our state, his country, and the \nmen and women who defend us. He is, by all accounts, a fair-minded \nreporter--which is saying something if you are in our business, because \nwe know that there is a natural adversarial relationship between the \npress and elected officials. Everyone in Texas who knows Arnold agrees \nthat he is a fair-minded reporter who has always made time to talk to \nalmost anyone and has always had an open door for those who wanted to \nhave a discussion on virtually any topic.\n  I wanted to say a few words today about Arnold Garcia.\n  Arnold, I salute your pioneering accomplishments. I thank you for all \nof these years of your friendship, and I wish you and your family \nnothing but the best in this next chapter of your life.\n  Mr. President, turning to the topic du jour, along with many of my \nRepublican colleagues, I spent the past several days discussing all of \nthe negative consequences of ObamaCare. I think it is important to \nremember that these are human consequences, not just about numbers.\n  When taxes and premiums rise, when doctors are forced to drop their \npatients, when people lose their preexisting insurance coverage, when \nfull-time jobs become part-time jobs, and when our health care safety \nnet is stretched to the breaking point, each has a profound impact on \nthe lives of real people. That's especially true for the neediest and \nmost vulnerable among us who rely on the safety-net programs that the \nPresident's health care law is further weakening.\n  To better appreciate the consequences of ObamaCare, we should \nconsider the following questions:\n  Question No. 1: What does ObamaCare mean to a 28-year-old college \ngraduate who can only find part-time work and living with his parents?\n  It means he will either pay higher insurance premiums or pay higher \ntaxes, and it also means he will have a harder time finding full-time \nemployment and starting a career.\n  Question No. 2: What does ObamaCare mean for a single mom who is \ninsured with Medicaid--that safety-net program I was talking about?\n  It means that her family's primary insurance program, a program that \nis already broken--for example, in my State only one doctor out of \nevery three will see a new Medicaid patient because it reimburses at \nsuch a low rate. So Medicaid is already failing to reliably deliver \naccess to health care. With ObamaCare, and the dumping of millions of \nadditional people into this broken program, it means this program will \nbe flooded with millions of new beneficiaries, and it means Medicaid \nwill soon be even less effective at delivering access to quality health \ncare to the most vulnerable people in our society, the very people it \nwas designed to protect.\n  Question number 3: What does ObamaCare mean to a 70-year-old retiree \nwho is enrolled in Medicare?\n  It means that fewer and fewer doctors will accept him or her as a \npatient, because Medicare pays doctors at a fraction of what private \nhealth insurance pays in terms of reimbursements for their services. \nObamaCare also means that unelected bureaucrats will soon be making \ndecisions about whether they will get the care their doctor believes \nthey need.\n  Question No. 4: What does ObamaCare mean for a working family that \nhas been receiving employer-provided health insurance from their small \nbusiness?\n  It means they very easily could lose their existing coverage and get \ndumped into an ObamaCare exchange. It also means they could very easily \nfind themselves paying higher premiums for lower-quality insurance.\n  The final question I would ask is: What does ObamaCare mean for a \nsmall business owner with 49 employees?\n  It means they have a powerful incentive to stay below that 50-\nemployee cap which would then kick them over into the employer sanction \nif they don't provide government-approved health care for all of their \nemployees. So their incentive is to keep employment low and not hire \nanymore workers because of ObamaCare's extensive regulations and \nfinancial penalties.\n  As we think about each of these questions, we should also think about \nwhat business owners across America are telling us--I daresay all of \nthem--about ObamaCare. For example, a small business owner named Linda \nPeters who runs a radio communications company in Anchorage, AK, \nrecently said ObamaCare's health insurance tax ``hurts our future and \nthreatens the stability of the small-business sector.''\n  In Arkansas, the owner of Little Rock Tours and Travel, a woman named \nGina Martin has said, ``None of us really understand how we are going \nto continue to stay in business.''\n  In Louisiana, the owner of Dots Diner restaurant group, a gentleman \nby the name of Larry Katz recently told a Senate committee that he was \nbeing ``forced to put 16 people out of work just to save himself from \nthe negative effects of [ObamaCare].''\n  In North Carolina, a franchise holder of the popular Five Guys burger \nchain, a man named Mike Ruffed, has estimated that ObamaCare will cost \nhim roughly an additional $60,000 a year.\n  Each of the business owners I mentioned lives in a State with at \nleast one Democratic Senator who voted for ObamaCare back in 2009. I \nwant to emphasize once again that ObamaCare is not inevitable. Any law \nthat Congress passes it can repeal, it can amend, and it can change.\n  The Members of this Chamber now have an opportunity to correct the \nmistake that the Senate Democrats made in 2009 when ObamaCare passed on \na party-line vote. All the Democrats voted for it, and all the \nRepublicans voted against it--including me. We now have an opportunity \nto stop this law before it does any more damage to people like those I \nmentioned and millions more across America.\n  To add insult to injury, yesterday we learned that the IRS has \nsomehow misplaced $67 million that was allocated to the ObamaCare slush \nfund. I daresay, given all of the money being pushed into the \nimplementation of ObamaCare, we can expect more stories like that in \nthe weeks and months ahead, unless Congress acts.\n  As I said, I am proud to say I voted against ObamaCare 4 years ago \nbecause I simply did not see how it could possibly work. I was \nconcerned about the higher taxes on hard-working American families such \nas my constituents in Texas. I was concerned about the command and \ncontrol of Washington, DC, on all the health care decisions that should \nhave been left to doctors, patients, and families trying to work \ntogether to determine what is in the best interests of those \nindividuals and those families.\n  And, yes, I was concerned that the government would continue to cut \nreimbursements to providers which would make it more and more likely \nthat fewer and fewer doctors and hospitals could actually see Medicare \nor Medicaid patients. I was concerned\n\n[[Page S6915]]\n\nthat ObamaCare represented a statement and an attitude that Washington \nknows best and that nothing anybody has done at innovative medical \nfacilities around the country and in different States matters because \nWashington really knows best.\n  Many people had the audacity to say that even though ObamaCare was \nunpopular when it was passed, people would learn to love it--sort of \nlike when Social Security and Medicare were originally passed.\n  Many of our Democratic colleagues who were responsible for giving us \nObamaCare have what we don't have often in life, and that is a second \nchance. These Senate Democrats who voted for ObamaCare--having seen and \nheard the stories I just described--have a second chance to help save \nthe American people from a looming disaster. When we have people like \nSenator Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, on which \nI serve, telling Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of Health and Human \nServices, that the implementation of ObamaCare is like a train wreck, \nwe ought to listen.\n  When some of the biggest cheerleaders for ObamaCare, such as \norganized labor, are now traveling to the White House and saying: \nPlease, Mr. President, won't you give us a waiver or exemption because \nthis is turning out different than you told us it would, we ought to \nlisten.\n  Full-time work--the 40-hour workweek--is in jeopardy because in order \nto protect themselves from employer sanctions, employers are moving \npeople from full-time work to part-time work--if they can hire people \nat all--which may be one reason why the labor participation rate, which \nis a percentage of Americans who are actually in the workforce looking \nfor work, is the lowest it has been in the last 30 years.\n  As I said earlier, each of these stories is a human tragedy, and the \nstories behind the numbers tell a very sobering tale. But we are now \npowerless to deal with this looming disaster and impending train wreck, \nas Senator Baucus said.\n  I hope Senate Democrats will vote with Senate Republicans and take a \nstand, as we will have a chance to do, when we get a chance to vote to \ndefund ObamaCare on the continuing resolution. If we do, we will be \nprotecting the American people from one of the most unpopular, \nunworkable, and unaffordable laws in modern history.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would like to elaborate on the comments \nfrom my colleague from Texas who I think laid out in very clear terms \nwhat is at stake and the debate we are having and really what the vote \nthat we are going to have here in the not-too-distant future means.\n  I think it is pretty clear--if we look at any objective measurement \nor metric--ObamaCare is a huge disaster, and obviously we have seen \ntremendous anecdotal evidence of that. Anybody who travels in their \nState or around the country or talks to anybody who is in business, the \nmessage comes back very clear that ObamaCare is making it more \ndifficult and more expensive for them to create jobs.\n  It is creating uncertainty; there are mandates and requirements \nassociated with the new law because employers are being forced to \nprovide a government-approved plan, and so costs go up. As a result, \nthat means there are people who are not getting hired who otherwise \nmight have gotten hired. Companies are looking at reducing their \nworkforce and obviously creating a tremendous amount of disruption in \nour economy. I think it is pretty evident that the middle class in \nparticular is being crushed by the President's policies, and ObamaCare \nis certainly no exception.\n\n  Yesterday, in Forbes magazine, Avik Roy reported on a recent study \ndone by the Manhattan Institute that ObamaCare will increase insurance \nrates for younger men by an average of 97 to 99 percent and for younger \nwomen by an average of 55 to 62 percent.\n  In my home State of South Dakota, that is more than just a statistic, \nit is a grim reality facing thousands of young men and women. By \ncomparing a typical low-cost plan for a healthy 30-year-old in South \nDakota this year with a bronze plan in South Dakota's health care \nexchange next year, the premium increases are staggering. Younger women \nare going to face a 223-percent premium increase and younger men are \ngoing to face a 393-percent--393-percent--premium increase when \ncomparing new data from the Health and Human Services Department with \ndata that came out from the Government Accountability Office about \npremiums in my State just this year--earlier in January.\n  For those millennials in South Dakota, that is a $1,500 increase in \nhealth care premiums each year for women and a more than $2,000 \nincrease in health care premiums for men. So the money that could be \nused for other things will now be put toward this increase in health \ninsurance premiums that people are going to have to pay to get covered. \nThey could have used that money to pay off a student loan. They could \nhave used it to save for a home or to start a family. So this has a \ntremendous impact on the economy and particularly on those who are \ngoing to get hit hardest, and in my State of South Dakota, not unlike \nother States around the country, it is young people, younger men and \nyounger women.\n  Interestingly enough, the President is talking about how the HHS \nstudy or report confirms what they have been saying, which is that \nsomehow premiums are going to go down. The reason they are saying that \nis because they are comparing the exchange premiums--what they think \npeople are going to pay--with what the Congressional Budget Office \npredicted they might pay earlier this year. So it is a hypothetical. It \nis a mythical comparison. There is nothing to it. It is fiction, if you \nwill.\n  What we have to do is make this real for people. When we make it \nreal, when we compare it to what they are paying today, young people in \nparticular are going to see dramatic increases in their premiums. So \nthe report was a complete fraud in terms of informing people with real \ninformation about what their health insurance premiums are going to be \nunder these exchanges. As I just pointed out, when we compare what they \nwould be paying in the exchange in my State with what people are paying \ntoday with similar-type coverage, the increases are staggering--a 223-\npercent premium increase for younger women and a 393-percent increase \nfor younger men.\n  They are saying that some of these individuals are going to be \neligible for premium tax credits to help cover the increased costs, but \nnot everyone is eligible for those premium tax credits. A lot of people \nare not going to be eligible for the credits, and they don't cover all \nthe costs. According to a new analysis by Avalere Health, Americans \ncould face steep cost-sharing requirements, such as copayments, \ncoinsurance, and deductibles, layered on top of the monthly premiums, \nwhich are going to increase dramatically. It is clear that health care \ncosts are going up, particularly for younger Americans.\n  President Obama promised that health care premiums would go down by \nan average of $2,500 per family. If we look at what the real situation \nis with regard to families, those premiums have actually jumped by more \nthan $2,500 since the President took office and since ObamaCare became \nlaw. So we have costs that continue to increase despite the President's \npromises to the contrary, and household income has been dropping since \nthe time the President has been in office--about $3,700, according to a \nrecent study. So when an American family is looking at their economic \nsituation, they are saying: Let me get this straight. I have higher \ncosts and lower income. How does the President expect that we are going \nto be able to cover these higher costs?\n  That is the reality, as I said, that most Americans are dealing with \nand that people in my State of South Dakota are dealing with, \nparticularly millennials, who are going to be most adversely and \nharmfully impacted by the new plan.\n  With respect to jobs, the other thing I wish to point out--obviously \nthe cost of health care is a very important situation and something \nevery American has to think about as they think about their own \npersonal economic circumstances, but we also have to have jobs, and \nmost people get health insurance coverage--a lot of them do--through \ntheir job. Well, what is the\n\n[[Page S6916]]\n\nObamaCare legislation doing to our jobs and to our economy? Nearly \nthree in four small businesses plan to fire workers or to cut hours as \na result of ObamaCare. According to Investor's Business Daily, more \nthan 250 employers have cut jobs or slashed hours as a direct result of \nObamaCare's high cost and job-killing regulations.\n  Another thing that is important to point out is that 60 percent of \nthe jobs created this year are part-time jobs--not full-time jobs, \npart-time jobs. The way the ObamaCare legislation and the law is \nstructured, there is a disincentive for companies to grow because if \nthey get bigger, if they get more than 50 employees, they will be \nsubject to a lot of new regulations and mandates when they provide \ngovernment-approved health care.\n  There is also a definition in the law of what a full-time employee \nis. If someone works more than 30 hours, they are a full-time employee. \nSo what are companies doing? What are businesses doing? They are hiring \nmore and more people to work 29 hours a week. The President is probably \ngoing to go down in history as the President who created the most part-\ntime jobs. But Americans want full-time jobs, they want to be able to \nhave a job that allows them to make ends meet for their families, to \nplan for their children's education and for their own retirement, and \nhaving to work more than one job--multiple part-time jobs--just doesn't \nget it done for them. So this trend we are seeing occur of part-time \njobs being created is largely because of mandates imposed in ObamaCare.\n  The middle class is being squeezed from both ends. Americans' \npremiums are going up, while their hours and take-home pay are going \ndown.\n  The job impacts are as clear across the country as they are in my \nState of South Dakota. I wish to give one example of a South Dakota \nbusiness owner who was recently interviewed. He was asked in that \ninterview about the higher costs and mandates of ObamaCare, and this is \nwhat he said:\n\n       You'll just have to adjust accordingly and you'll have to \n     cut jobs, and you probably won't hire as many people, and I \n     think you'll see a lot of that.\n\n  That is a small business owner in my State of South Dakota responding \nto a question about the impact of ObamaCare on his ability to hire \npeople, to create jobs, and to help expand his business and grow the \neconomy in my State.\n  It is no wonder the President's approval rating is underwater. Nearly \n60 percent of Americans say they oppose ObamaCare, the President's \nsignature accomplishment. So while support for the President's \nsignature law continues to fade, we are also seeing an impact on the \nPresident's personal approval rating. For the first time, more \nAmericans view the President unfavorably than they do favorably. \nAccording to yesterday's Gallup poll, the President is struggling with \nhis own base. Support among Democrats has dropped 13 points since \nDecember of 2012.\n\n  I say all that to point out that the effects of these policies--\nparticularly ObamaCare in the specific--are having an impact on the \nPresident's standing. I think people are understanding what the impacts \nare, what the effects of this are, what the results of this are, and \nthey are starting to react accordingly.\n  What is also of great concern to anybody who is thinking about going \ninto an exchange or looking to do this next week when the exchanges \n``go live'' or go online is that there are an awful lot of glitches and \nbumps. As I said, premiums are on the rise, workers' jobs, wages, and \nhours are being cut, and now we have glitches and bumps when it comes \nto implementation. The latest example of an ObamaCare glitch comes from \nthe District of Columbia exchanges. A report that came out just \nyesterday said the District of Columbia ObamaCare exchange is \nexperiencing ``a high error rate'' in calculating the tax credits that \nlow- and middle-income people are going to receive. You can't make this \nstuff up. The government-run exchange is experiencing ``a high error \nrate'' in handling health care. Who would have thought that would be \nthe case? These exchange shoppers are not going to have access to the \npremium prices now until mid-November. This is according to the recent \nreport on the District of Columbia.\n  There are similar glitches happening at the Federal level as well and \nin other States. Oregon and Colorado have faced setbacks.\n  Reuters reports:\n\n       On Monday, employees running Connect for Health Colorado \n     told board members that the exchange would not be able to \n     calculate federal subsidies either, at least for the first \n     few weeks.\n\n  Inaccuracies, glitches, and malfunctions mean this law is not ready \nfor prime time.\n  Meanwhile, we have top Democrats here in the Congress who I think are \nin complete denial. The President said earlier this summer, ``I think \nit's important for us to recognize and acknowledge this is working the \nway it is supposed to.'' Representative Pelosi on the House side said, \n``The implementation of this is fabulous.'' Senator Reid said on ``Meet \nthe Press'' not too long ago, ``ObamaCare has been wonderful for \nAmerica.'' Well, that message is being lost on Americans.\n  We have an opportunity to correct that. We get a chance at a do-over. \nWe can fix this. We can correct this wrong. We can do this in a much \nbetter way. It doesn't take a 2,700-page bill and 20,000 pages of \nregulations to fix the problems we have in our health care system \ntoday. What we have now is a government takeover of one-sixth of our \neconomy, and we are seeing what that means for many Americans: higher \npremiums, higher costs, fewer jobs, lower take-home pay, and glitches \nand bumps when it comes to implementation.\n  At a minimum--at a minimum--we ought to delay the implementation of \nthis not just for a favored few, not just for those select constituents \nthe President wants to grant waivers and exceptions for, but we should \nallow a delay of ObamaCare for all Americans because it is not ready \nfor prime time.\n  I think ultimately what maybe drives or motivates people to stay with \nthis in spite of all this--every day, news stories, news organizations \ntalking about the flaws, the errors in implementation; the, I guess, \noverpromises made by the administration when it comes to what costs \nwere going to be for people and whether they would be able to keep \ntheir old insurance--but when we look at all that, the cumulative \neffect of all of that, the wise thing for us to do is to recognize that \nthis was a mistake and, at a minimum, delay its implementation. At \nbest, my favorite scenario would be to repeal it and start over.\n  I think we have a lot of people here, as was mentioned by Senator \nReid not too long ago, whose goal really is to get to a single-payer \nsystem. If that is the goal, then people want this thing to muddle \nalong and get so bad that the only thing people are left with is a \nsingle-payer system--in other words, socialized medicine. I don't think \nthat is consistent with what the American people want. It is certainly \nnot consistent with our history and heritage of freedom and competition \nand giving people in this country more choices. That might explain why \nmany of the things we have proposed, alternatives we have proposed on \nthis side of the aisle, consistently get voted down.\n  Why don't we allow people to buy insurance across State lines and \ncreate interstate competition that drives prices down? Why don't we \nallow pooling for small businesses so they can get the benefit of group \npurchasing power? Why don't we reduce the cost of defensive medicine by \nending junk lawsuits in this country? Why don't we allow people to have \ntheir own refundable tax credit so they can buy their own health \ninsurance? We want to come up with a system that is portable, that \ncreates competition, that allows people to have more choices, and that \nis based upon market impulses and market principle. When we have a free \nmarket and it is working, we get much lower costs because competition \nbrings that about.\n  I hope we can get to the point where we acknowledge that this was the \nwrong direction. We are going to have a chance to vote on that later \ntoday. The vote that is going to be before us--and I am not aware of \nany Republican in this Chamber who is not going to vote to defund \nObamaCare--will present us with an opportunity, as Republicans and \nDemocrats, to acknowledge what the American people have already \nrecognized, which is that this is not working. It is not working as it \nwas intended, it is not working as planned, and the best thing we can \ndo is acknowledge that and give the\n\n[[Page S6917]]\n\nAmerican people a break and give the American economy a break by \ndelaying its implementation or, more importantly, just repealing it and \nstarting over and doing this the right way by building upon the \nstrengths we have in our health care delivery system today, \nacknowledging the challenges and weaknesses but things that can be \nfixed without passing a 2,700-page bill and 20,000 pages of \nregulations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from South \nDakota and his words but also his leadership, not only in this area but \nin so many areas of such importance facing our Nation. Again, we \nappreciate him very much.\n  With the exchanges set to open in a matter of days, we are getting an \nup-close and personal look at how bad this law is for Arkansans.\n  On Monday, the ObamaCare premiums were released for the Arkansas \nexchanges. The exchanges were supposed to provide choices. The \nPresident said it would be like booking travel on Expedia.\n  Do you know how many insurance companies you can pick from in el \nDorado and Magnolia? Two. In Pine Bluff, Helena, and Lake Village? Two. \nIn Jonesboro and Hot Springs? Three.\n  There are not a lot of options, and none of them are affordable. \nSticker shock, I think, is the best way to describe the response I have \nheard from Arkansans.\n  Yesterday, a caller to my Fort Smith office said he could barely \nafford his diabetic medicine. With the new premiums, he simply cannot \nafford it. That is one example of many similar calls i have received \nand am receiving.\n  With a pricetag of nearly $3 trillion, the law creates more problems \nthan it solves. It drives up health care costs, busts our budget, \nbankrupts Medicare, and deflates our economy. On top of that, it does \nnot create economic stability for Arkansans. It raises their taxes.\n  On some level, even President Obama acknowledges this will not work. \nHe has delayed, without legal recourse, the employer health care \nmandate. More relief for other allies will certainly come. It is clear \nthe White House is picking and choosing who has to comply with the law, \nwhich leaves the rest of America asking: Where is my exemption? Why \ncan't everyone get a special deal? They rightfully want to know why \nthey have to follow a law the President's allies are not following.\n  Every Republican in this Chamber wrote the President shortly after he \nmade this decision to delay the employer mandate. We demanded that he \nextend relief to the public. In fact, we asked him to permanently delay \nimplementation for everyone.\n  Senator Coats and I, along with several other of our colleagues, have \nintroduced a bill that would accomplish just that because this law is \nnot just bad for U.S. businesses, it is bad for workers, it is bad for \nAmerican families.\n  The President says he is working for a ``better bargain for the \nmiddle class.'' This law crushes the middle class. It is going to make \ncoverage unaffordable for everyone, including the very people the \nPresident seeks to provide coverage to--low-income workers.\n  Because this law is poorly written, a worker making $21,000 a year \nmay be offered plans with premiums that are near $2,000. How is this \naffordable? For a basic plan they could also face an annual deductible \nupwards of $3,000 before coverage kicks in. That is almost a quarter of \nthe annual salary of a worker making $21,000. And this is supposed to \nbe affordable?\n  One of my constituents hit the nail on the head during a telephone \ntownhall I had on Monday night when he said this law is actually making \nhealth insurance more expensive for the average person.\n  Nowhere in the 20,000 pages of regulations can you find one that \ndrives down the cost of health care. That is the core of the problem.\n  This law has to be replaced with reforms that drive down the cost of \nhealth care and make insurance truly affordable for every American.\n  Instead of allowing the government to dictate our health care needs, \nwe should strive to reward quality health care, encourage healthy \nliving, and minimize waste through patient choice and health care \nownership.\n  We should pass laws that expand health savings accounts. We should \nallow small businesses, people such as my barber, to pool together with \nother barbers and purchase group insurance to cover their employees at \na low rate. We need to allow Americans to purchase insurance across \nState lines, as we do for car insurance.\n  There are other reform avenues we can explore, some I think that we \ncan even get the majority and the President to support.\n  Every Republican in this Chamber wants to do away with this law. We \nmay disagree on strategy, but we all seek the same goal.\n  For me and many of my colleagues, it is hard to find the logic in \nopposing a bill that defunds ObamaCare. Again, this bill the House has \nsent us is exactly what we were trying to accomplish. It defunds \nObamaCare and keeps the government open. We must also ensure it keeps \nus on a path to fiscal responsibility.\n  If the majority leader attempts to restore funding for ObamaCare, you \ncan be assured that I will vote against it.\n  My vocal opposition to the law, my record of voting against the \noriginal bill, and my support of efforts to repeal it are evidence that \nI want to replace this law with real reform that will drive down the \ncost of care and increase coverage for all.\n  However, at the end of the day, it is not wise to force a shutdown by \nholding up a bill to continue the funding of government. Our troops in \nharm's way deserve to be paid. Seniors in Arkansas need their Social \nSecurity checks in a timely manner just to get by. And Arkansans who \nhave jobs that require government action--regardless of the situation--\nwill have their livelihoods at stake as a result of a shutdown.\n  Perhaps most concerning is what a shutdown could do to the markets in \nthis very fragile economy. Our economy is in a far more precarious \nposition than it was during the last shutdown. The retirement and \nsavings of millions of Arkansans could take a dramatic hit.\n  We face a serious crisis. Health care costs are crippling this \ncountry and many Americans lack access to quality affordable care. It \nis stifling our Nation's overall economic development. These are real \ndifficulties patients, physicians, and hospitals face.\n  I understand this problem firsthand. For 24 years, I practiced \noptometry with my brother and my partners in Arkansas. My experience as \nboth a health care practitioner and a clinic owner led me to understand \nthere is a right way and a wrong way to address this crisis. The \nPresident's health care law is the wrong way. Let's move forward by \nsupporting the House-passed continuing resolution that defunds \nObamaCare. Let's work together for affordable and effective health care \nreforms through free market principles.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I rise to discuss the current dilemma \nbefore the Senate with regard to whether to vote on the motion to close \ndebate and go to the debate and final vote, if you will, on the House-\npassed version of the CR which put in the language that defunds \nObamaCare.\n  I will vote yes for cloture so we can go to the vote I have promised \nmy constituents in my State 57 different times in other votes I have \ncast in the Senate in favor of defunding the ObamaCare legislation \nbecause I believe there is a better way to do it.\n  We only have two options before us. One is to end debate and go to a \nvote on legislation passed out of the House that will continue the \ngovernment and defund ObamaCare, understanding the leadership will have \nan amendment to strip out the defunding. I will vote against that \namendment because I want to be consistent with the other 57 votes I \nhave taken.\n  But the other alternative is an alternative not to shut off debate, \nto continue the debate, which means we come up to Monday night, \nmidnight, when the fiscal year ends and the government shuts down. \nGovernment shutdowns are a bad idea. They are bad for the people who \nsend us here to this body to represent them. They are bad for seniors \non Social Security. They are bad for those whose husbands and wives and \nsons and daughters are fighting in harm's way in Afghanistan and\n\n[[Page S6918]]\n\nother parts of the world. It hurts our military. It hurts our health \ncare system. And it does not do anything to stop ObamaCare.\n  What a lot of people do not realize is, if you shut the government \ndown, you are not shutting down ObamaCare. A great percentage of that \nis mandatory funding. If you shut the government down, you are actually \nencouraging ObamaCare and discouraging our government to function as it \nshould.\n  I will not vote to shut the government down. I will vote to end the \ndebate. And I will vote in the way that I have promised every citizen \nof my State since the ObamaCare legislation came before us.\n  Look, I am on the HELP Committee. We did the markup on the Affordable \nCare Act in 2009. Like almost every other Member of the Senate, I was \nhere on Christmas Eve 2009 and voted against the ObamaCare legislation \non the final vote. Since that period of time we have had a plethora of \nvotes and challenges and opportunities, and I have remained consistent. \nI am not going to all of a sudden, in a debate, change my consistency \nand vote to shut down the government and continue ObamaCare. I want to \nbe consistent with the way I voted. I want the Senate to take up its \nresponsibility. I want us to be sure we do not shut down the government \nfor our people. I want to be sure everybody in the Senate has the \nopportunity to cast their vote, both on the continuing resolution and \non whether ObamaCare stays or is defunded. That is the question before \nus--not whether we shut the government down.\n  So while I respect and appreciate everybody's position, I think it is \nirresponsible for us as a Senate to knowingly and voluntarily shut down \nour government and extend ObamaCare when we have the opportunity to \nhave the debate, have the vote, strip out the funding for ObamaCare, \nand move forward as some of us have tried.\n  I do not know how it will end up. I think I know. But I know one \nthing: Inaction and not voting is wrong. The people of Georgia sent me \nhere to take action, not to avoid action. They sent me here to run the \ngovernment, not to shut down the government. In fact, I got to the \nSenate and the House because of a government shutdown, and I want to \ntell that story.\n  In the 1990s, when President Clinton was President and Newt Gingrich \nwas Speaker, many issues came about on fiscal spending, and the Speaker \nand the President and the majority leader of the Senate, Bob Dole, got \nin a conflict over whether to extend the budget. The Republicans took \nthe position: We will shut the government down rather than yield to \nwhat President Clinton wants to do. So the government shut down. About \n3 weeks later, the government was brought back. The Speaker, Mr. \nGingrich, came back and capitulated. We reopened the government, but he \nlost a lot of ground. Two years later he was reelected by a narrow \nmargin but was not reelected Speaker and resigned. I replaced him. Be \ncareful if you shut down the government. You might get another me.\n  So that is what happens when government happens. The voters speak \nout. The voters make sure we are accountable and responsible. It cost \nus a Speakership. It cost us leadership in the House, and politically \nthat is unsustainable and something we should not do.\n  I want to be a part of doing my responsible action, voting like I \nhave told my voters I am going to vote; instead of shutting down the \ngovernment, having the vote we need to have to see which way we are \ngoing to move forward as a country.\n  I yield the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. For this hour of majority time, I ask \nunanimous consent that the following Senators have 15 minutes each: \nSenator Udall of New Mexico, Senator Merkley, Senator Baldwin, and \nSenator Whitehouse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Five years ago, our economy went off a \ncliff. We all remember how bad it was. Wall Street crashed, great \nindustries faced ruin, trillions of dollars in savings of American \nfamilies gone, wiped out. That was the reality. It was a nightmare for \nmillions of Americans. They lost their jobs, they lost their homes. So \nmany saw a lifetime's work disappear through no fault of their own.\n  Five years later we are slowly making our way back. We have seen 42 \nmonths of private sector job growth. That is 7.5 million jobs. That is \na new start for millions of Americans, but as families in New Mexico \nknow, having a job in this economy does not mean the struggles are \nover. We are moving forward, but not fast enough. Too many folks in my \nState are still looking for jobs, or they are working and still \nstruggling to pay for rent, food, and gas. They still have not caught \nup to where they were before, even though they are working harder than \never.\n  New Mexico's unemployment remains too high. It is at 6.9 percent, and \nit has been stuck at around 7 percent for far too long. We still have a \nway to go, so we can't afford any more self-inflicted wounds--no more \nmanufactured crises and no more manufactured government dysfunction.\n  Unfortunately, we are seeing this again and again. A minority of \nradical obstructionists in the House and in the Senate is threatening a \ngovernment shutdown unless they get their way. They wish to repeal the \nlaw of the land even though they lack the votes to do so. They are \ndriving us toward another cliff.\n  They are willing to endanger the full faith and credit of the United \nStates, all for their narrow ideological agenda. The American people \nwill be the ones who feel the consequences.\n  There is no reason for this drama that threatens our struggling \neconomy. The American people don't want this. From Wall Street to Main \nStreet, most Americans are watching this spectacle with disbelief. They \nare looking for progress, for recovery, and they are getting gridlock \nover and over, with no budget, no long-term plan. If this continues, we \nhave a government in paralysis--all this to drive a tank through health \ncare reform.\n  The American people don't want to shut down the government to prevent \npeople from getting their health insurance. They want jobs and they \nwant economic recovery.\n  It is clear to folks on all sides of this desperate stunt that this \nis dangerous. Even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, not exactly a leftist \ngroup, has said, ``Stop.'' Last week they told the Representatives:\n\n       It is not in the best interest of the U.S. business \n     community or the American people to risk even a brief \n     government shutdown. . . . Likewise, the U.S. Chamber \n     respectfully urges the House of Representatives to raise the \n     debt ceiling in a timely manner and thus eliminate any \n     question of threat to the full faith and credit of the United \n     States Government.\n\n  We need to move past these partisan games and get back to working on \nour economy. We need to provide stability so our Nation's families and \nbusinesses can grow and prosper. We need to pass a bill that prevents a \ngovernment shutdown and funds the programs critical to our economic \nhealth.\n  I wish to talk about the effect on my home State of New Mexico. New \nMexico's economy can't afford these partisan games. We are already \nstruggling with sequestration.\n  In New Mexico, sequestration is a painful reality, having a chilling \neffect on our economy. Folks are worried about their jobs. The most \nvulnerable groups--the poor, families with children, seniors, and \nNative Americans--face serious cuts in education and social services.\n  Our State has two great national laboratories, Sandia and Los Alamos. \nTheir work is essential to the security and safety of all Americans, \nkeeping our Nation's nuclear stockpile safe and secure.\n  We are host to three Air Force bases, as well as White Sands Missile \nRange. This budget impasse is damaging to these installations and it \nthreatens economic chaos in the nearby communities.\n  Businesses that rely on Federal contracts wonder if they can keep \ntheir doors open. Sequestration is already\n\n[[Page S6919]]\n\ndamaging small businesses that survived the recession, businesses such \nas Queston Construction, a general contractor. Queston's president, \nTina Cordova, has seen the number of employees shrink from near 40 to \nonly 18 today.\n  Then there are the businesses such as PSC, a 100-percent Native-\nAmerican, woman-owned security personnel business that had to let go \nemployees last year. Threatening shutdowns only makes this worse.\n  These partisan games are also hurting businesses that depend on \ntourism. According to the National Park Service, New Mexico's national \nparks and monuments had 1.5 million visitors last year. We can't afford \nto close down sites such as Bandelier National Monument, Carlsbad \nCanyons, Chaco Canyon, Tent Rocks National Monument, Bosque del Apache \nWildlife Refuge, and a host of other unique and special places. \nCustomers who visit these sites stay in our hotels and eat in our \nrestaurants. Tourism means big dollars for New Mexico and our small \nbusinesses, about $5.9 billion in direct spending.\n  However, here we are with a House resolution that is playing politics \nwith our economy. This is a dead end. We are on the wrong train, the \nwrong track, and going nowhere. Americans understand this, and I think \nthat is why they are so disappointed in us.\n  Our economy can't afford even the threat of government shutdown. Too \nmany businesses and families are still barely making ends meet 5 years \nafter Wall Street crashed.\n  Today's vote is some good news. We are facing obstruction, but we are \nmoving forward. In a bipartisan way, I believe the Senate can do its \njob. It can pass a bill to fund the government without partisan poison \npill amendments. Then it will go back to the House. With little time to \nspare, we can only hope the House leaders will come to their senses and \nallow a bipartisan bill, not a partisan bill, to move forward.\n  When that happens, if it happens, we have more challenges ahead. The \nHouse has drastically underfunded programs that American people depend \non.\n  I spoke about the impact on New Mexico. Now I wish to speak for a \nminute as chairman of an appropriations subcommittee.\n  We see the needs out there. We see the need for investments. We can't \nkeep kicking the can down the road hoping that somehow a miracle will \nhappen and our roads and bridges will fix themselves, that our veterans \nwill get the resources they need without funding, and that our national \nlabs will be able to take on additional responsibilities without \nadditional resources.\n  In the case of my subcommittee, Financial Services and General \nGovernment, we are making sure our financial systems are sound so \nAmericans won't have to worry about a collapse, about losing their \nretirement, their homes, or their life savings. We are making sure we \ndo not need a government bailout again and we are protecting consumers \nagainst fraud.\n  The House bill would put all of those important functions at risk. We \ncan't afford that, the American people can't afford that, and we will \ncontinue fighting for a commonsense path forward.\n  One of the areas in my subcommittee is small business and funding the \nSmall Business Administration. If we go into a government shutdown, the \nSmall Business Administration closes down. All those small businesses \nacross America that rely on loans, rely on advice, and rely on small \nbusiness development centers aren't going to be able to do that, take \nan idea from the beginning of a business through a business plan. It is \ngoing to thwart entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship. We can't afford \nthat.\n  I plead with my friends in the House, when you get our bill this week \nor near the end of the week, please think long and hard. Let's pass it \nand move this forward.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise today to address some of the \nchallenges we face here on September 26. The significance of that date \nis it is only 4 days before September 30, the close of the financial \nyear, and October 1, the following day, starts a new financial year. So \nit has been our responsibility as a Congress to prepare for October 1 \nby passing a budget, reconciling that budget with the House of \nRepresentatives, then using that budget to produce 12 appropriations \nbills, reconciling those 12 appropriations bills, and have a spending \nplan completely in place so that we smoothly begin the start of a new \nfinancial year. No crisis, just adults working out a spending plan for \nthe next 12 months on time.\n  I would like to say that is where we are today. But instead, as I \nstand here on the floor of the Senate, we are only 5 days away from a \nshutdown of the U.S. Government, a shutdown because that spending plan \nhas not been put together. For the many Americans who have been \nfollowing the challenges of the last couple of years, this will sound a \nlittle like deja vu all over again, to quote Yogi Berra, because we \nhave been here before. We have been through this crisis before.\n  Indeed, it was April 2011 when we had a near government shutdown, and \nthat had a huge impact on job creation, and it had a big impact on the \nstock market. In other words, it wounded our economy at a time when \nAmericans wanted us to build a strong foundation for a better economy, \nto create jobs for the middle class, to put people back to work, and to \nget momentum built up to put American families in a better place. \nInstead, we had this manufactured crisis in April 2011, courtesy of my \ncolleagues, who felt more about exercising partisan warfare than caring \nabout the success of our middle-class families. Quite simply, that is \njust wrong.\n  Then it was just months later, in July of 2011, when we had a debt \nceiling crisis. This is quite interesting, because the debt ceiling is \nsimply a term for paying the bills we have already incurred. President \nReagan had something to say about this. President Reagan said: Don't \nmess with the good faith and credit of the United States of America. We \npay our bills on time. And we have always paid our bills on time. We \ndidn't manufacture crises to do damage to the economy because of \nextremely poisoned partisanship gripping this Chamber and the Chamber \non the other side of Capitol Hill.\n  Not only did that combination of crises do significant damage, but in \n2012 we faced the big fiscal cliff. This is where the tax structure \ndeveloped under the Bush Presidency was set to expire, so a new set of \npolicies had to be worked out. We were unable to have that adult, \nresponsible conversation due to the extreme partisanship gripping this \nChamber and gripping the other Chamber. So we had a crisis at the close \nof that year that, quite frankly, did damage as well. Suddenly \nbusinesses were seeing that not only did we have the great recession of \n2008, as a result of out-of-control failures in regulation that allowed \npredatory mortgages and predatory securities--securities that melted \ndown and took a large part of America's financial world with them--but \nwe had this follow-on of not being able to have a reasonable, \nthoughtful, commonsense budget plan in place to take us forward.\n  So 2012 led to March of 2013--3 months later--and now we had the \ndelayed implementation of the sequester. The sequester comes from the \nBudget Control Act--an Act I voted against because Members on both \nsides of the aisle described it as ``dumb and dumber,'' so dumb we will \nnot let it happen. I thought it was so dumb it should never be written \ninto law, so I voted against it. But I was on the losing side of that \nbattle. So this diabolical financial plan exploded onto the American \nscene in March 2013, creating a significant problem for the American \neconomy and doing significant damage to the American economy. And here \nwe are, 6 months later, unable to complete our budget and our \nappropriations bills for the coming financial year.\n  This has become a pattern where we see ourselves lurching from crisis \nto crisis--manufactured crises--due to this poisoning partisanship, \nrather than working together to address the challenges of working \nfamilies and the middle class. The American people are\n\n[[Page S6920]]\n\nquite tired of it. That is why they rate the quality of work we are \ndoing so low. That is why they rate Congress so low.\n  There was a time not so long ago when it was a very different story. \nWhen I was growing up, the story about Congress was that we had had \nthis Great Depression but we came together as a Nation and recognized \nmany of the problems that contributed to that. Those problems included \nallowing banks to stop doing loans and start gambling on risky \nventures, and we stopped that when we put in Glass-Steagall. It \nincluded having mortgages that were balloon mortgages, and those could \nbe called in at any time, which meant an individual had to return to \nthe mortgage market to get a replacement loan. That created a crisis \nfor a family if the loan was called and they couldn't actually get \nanother loan. So we fixed that by creating full amortizing long-term \nmortgages with no balloon payments, and we got rid of that callable \nfeature.\n  We also created the Securities and Exchange Commission to take on the \npredatory scams and practices of Wall Street so people would have faith \nin investing. Faith in investing meant you had the capital to fuel a \nstrong comeback.\n  We created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation so people could \ntrust putting their money in banks, knowing the bank wouldn't collapse \nand take their money with them.\n  We did all these things as a Congress, coming together to respond to \ngreat national problems. Sure, there was some partisanship, some \ndisagreement between the parties, but there was a deeper understanding \nthat we as Americans must work together as Americans, including on the \nfloor of the House and the Senate, for the greater benefit of our \nAmerican families.\n  Unfortunately, that has apparently been lost. It has been lost not \njust in these last few days but in these last few years.\n  When World War II was thrust upon us, in a short period of time, with \ncongressional help, we transformed our economy into a war economy and \nplayed a big role in basically resolving a terrible worldwide crisis. \nAfter World War II we rebuilt, through our loan programs and our trade \nrelationships, much of the world economy as well as our own economy, \ncreating the largest middle class the world has ever known.\n  All of this is what we did in this Chamber and in the Chamber on the \nother side of Capitol Hill--decisions that were made together to put \nAmerica back on track. But today we don't have legislators thinking \nabout the health of America. They are thinking about the next election. \nThey are thinking only about their own election. They are thinking \nabout how to undermine our President. Yet he is our President. He is \nAmerica's President. He is not the Democrats' President or the \nRepublicans' President. He is our President, and he only gets to sign \nor veto bills that we send to him.\n  It is our responsibility in this Chamber to work together in a \nrespectful, responsible fashion to do the basic work that is at the \nfoundation of our ongoing expenditures--to get the budget in place and \nto get the spending bills in place.\n  The story of this year is really one that belongs in a fiction novel, \nbecause here we go: The U.S. Senate passed a budget, the U.S. House \npassed a budget. Immediately, the next day, the conference committee \nshould begin. But, no, it didn't happen because Senators in this \nChamber decided to filibuster that conference committee and stop any \nconversation from occurring between the House and Senate about getting \na common budget.\n  This is really akin to burning down the house--blocking the House and \nthe Senate. And by ``the house'' I mean a house that encompasses this \nwhole legislative process. It is like lighting a bomb and letting it \nblow up. Don't let the budget process proceed; don't let there be a \nconference committee. ``Completely irresponsible'' should be the sign \nworn on every legislator who has blocked there being a conference \ncommittee on the budget. Without a budget we can't get common \nappropriations bills because they are based on different numbers.\n  Let us look at this appropriations process. There are essentially \ntwelve spending bills, called appropriations bills. If we look at the \nperiod from 1988 through 2001--that 13-year period--we passed the vast \nbulk of appropriations bills every year through this Chamber before the \nnext fiscal year started--the vast bulk of them. Some years we got \nevery one done and some years most of them done, but the process \nworked.\n  Now let's come to the modern era: 2008, zero appropriations bills \npassed through here; 2009, we actually got half of them done, six; \n2010, zero; 2011, one; 2012, zero; this year, 2013, zero. Any \nschoolchild in America grading the Senate on their success in getting \nthe spending bills in place would give us an ``F'' for ``failure'' \nbecause we can't come together as responsible parties and have a debate \non this floor, adopt amendments, and have an up-or-down vote.\n  This does enormous damage in multiple ways. The first source of \ndamage is that we end up with late-night emergency continuing \nresolutions. And when you have a continuing resolution, it means you \nkeep doing what you did before whether they made sense or not. So for \nevery person who believes we should spend a dollar wisely--and I \ncertainly do--we should take advantage of a year's worth of \nconversations and testimony about what is not working and we should end \nthose programs, not keep continuing them. And when those hearings show \nthat more money is needed in certain areas to make America work better, \nthen we need to spend more in those areas, not continue spending less.\n  So this effort to blockade the budget process is a determination to \ncontinue government waste and inefficiency. I propose that Senators who \nare blocking the Budget Committee from even getting the numbers and \nblocking the spending bills should come to this floor and say: Yes, I \nam for government waste. Because that is what they are doing. They are \nwasting the taxpayers' dollars. They are investing in inefficiency.\n  Meanwhile, businesses across America are looking at these sets of \ncrises--April 2011, July 2011, December 2012, March 2013, September \n2013--and saying: We are not reinvesting in America until this Chamber \nand the other Chamber on Capitol Hill get their act together--so that \nwe are not legislating from crisis to crisis, doing great damage to the \neconomy. They know they can't sell their wares unless there is a middle \nclass ready to buy them, and there can't be a middle class unless there \nare jobs, and there can't be jobs lurching from crisis to crisis.\n  The end is not in sight. We have colleagues in this Chamber right now \nplanning to have another crisis over the next debt ceiling, the \nresponsibility to pay the bills we have already incurred. We have \nMembers who are not remembering that President Reagan said: Do not mess \nwith the good faith and credit of the United States of America. They \nwant to mess with the good faith and credit of the United States of \nAmerica, which increases interest rates, which puts an essential tax on \nall Americans. So the fact that we don't have momentum of the amount we \nwant in the economy is the result of this deliberative determination to \nforce us to lurch from crisis to crisis.\n  Our middle-class families are worried about a lot. They are deeply \nconcerned about the cost of college. They are deeply concerned about \nliving-wage jobs. They are deeply concerned about funding for K-12. \nThey are concerned about things that affect the real quality of life \nand the success of our families in every way. And they wonder why it is \nthat we are lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis \nrather than getting a spending plan in place and doing more of the \nthings that make sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for an \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I will wrap up. Anywhere you look in America, you see \nproblems for public safety, for public education, for college \neducation, for living-wage jobs. These are the pillars of success of \nthe middle class. Let's focus on those problems and do right by the \nAmerican people and quit the irresponsibility and self-manufactured \ndamage that is happening here on Capitol Hill.\n\n[[Page S6921]]\n\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the remarks of my colleague, Senator \nBaldwin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to speak \nabout the divisive and irresponsible path down which some Members of \nCongress wish to take our country.\n  Last week my former Republican colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives continued to put their own personal partisan politics \nahead of progress for the American people. Some of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle here in the Senate have voiced support for a \nresponsible approach and rejected this path. For that, I applaud their \nindependence. But some here in the Senate are committed to playing the \nsame political games offered by the House, and here are the rules of \nthe games they are playing: crisis-to-crisis governing; uncertainty for \nour economy; and for families and businesses, economic insecurity.\n  Instead of working together across the party aisle to create jobs and \nmove our economy forward, a minority of extremists are intent on \nthreatening our economic recovery with brinkmanship meant to appeal to \na narrow political interests--namely, their own. Instead of working \ntogether to pass a responsible budget that invests in the middle class, \nthis political game calls for locking in the sequester cuts and putting \nup a roadblock to economic growth. Instead of working together to do \nwhat is best for middle-class families, moving health care reform \nforward, this political game of drama and division insists on shutting \ndown the government unless health care is repealed for millions of \nAmericans. And instead of working together to do what is best for \nbusinesses and the economy, they are creating yet another manufactured \ncrisis that threatens the full faith and credit of America with a \ngovernment default, knowing full well that would hurt economic growth \nand the families and businesses who are working so hard to move our \nrecovery forward. Let's be clear about how they would like to see their \ngame end.\n  According to independent economists, the damaging cuts from the \nsequester are slowing down the economy and killing jobs. Locking in \nthese devastating sequester cuts would gut investments in economic \ndevelopment, innovation, and education.\n  The House Republican budget would cut the National Institutes of \nHealth by $8 billion compared to the Senate budget, so it would cost \n25,000 jobs, compromising the next generation of research in our \ncountry and holding back the development of treatments for cancer, \ndiabetes, Alzheimer's, and other chronic diseases.\n  Repealing the Affordable Care Act would mean children with \npreexisting conditions can be denied health care by insurance \ncompanies. Repealing America's new health law would mean many young \npeople would not have health insurance coverage because they could no \nlonger stay on their parents' health insurance until they are 26 years \nold. Repealing ObamaCare would mean women will no longer have free \npreventive health care and we will go back to the day when women could \nbe charged more than men for their health coverage.\n  They will shut down the government unless we agree to increase the \nout-of-pocket costs for seniors on their prescription drugs and deny \nthem wellness programs.\n  They are threatening a government default which would weaken our \neconomy when we should be doing everything we can to strengthen it. \nThey don't seem to care that even the hint of defaulting on our \nobligations by a minority of Republicans in Congress had severe \nconsequences for our economy when it last happened in the summer of \n2011. The stock market plummeted, and the U.S. credit rating was \ndowngraded for the first time in our Nation's history. Businesses froze \nhiring in August of 2011, and that was one of the lowest months of job \ngrowth over the last 2 years. Consumer confidence dropped, and \nwidespread uncertainty was created for middle-class families.\n  What we don't need right now is more political games. The last thing \nwe need right now is to create another self-inflicted economic wound in \nWashington that will hurt middle-class families, small businesses, and \nthose who are working so hard to get ahead. We need to create jobs. We \nneed to invest in the middle class and build an economy that produces \nshared prosperity.\n  Instead of protecting tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans and tax \nloopholes for big corporations, it is time for Republicans to join our \nefforts and ask those at the top to pay their fair share. It is time \nfor Republicans to join our efforts to continue making smart spending \ncuts that reduce the deficit without shortchanging our future. It is \ntime for Republicans to join with us in passing a responsible budget \nthat strengthens the middle class while also giving American businesses \nthe certainty they need to grow our economy. It is time to break this \ndestructive pattern of bringing the country to the brink and instead \nreturn to making Washington work for the American people.\n  Chairwoman Mikulski has called for a return to regular order so that \nCongress can pass individual appropriations bills every year, and she \nis 100 percent correct. I support her efforts because regular order \nallows us to prioritize key investments that support the middle class \nand avoid these annual shutdown showdowns.\n  As I have traveled the State, Wisconsinites have told me that the \npowerful and well-connected seem to get to write their own rules in \nWashington while the concerns and struggles of middle-class families go \nunnoticed here. They feel that our economic system is tilted toward \nthose at the very top, that our political system exists to protect \nthose unfair advantages instead of to make sure everybody gets a fair \nshot.\n  Last week an economic report was released showing that income \nequality has been worsening and expanding, with almost all--in fact, 95 \npercent--of the income gains since our economic collapse 5 years ago \ngoing to the top 1 percent of income earners. The American people would \nbe right to expect that both parties work together to offer solutions \nthat address the challenge of closing this gap, but it has been ignored \nby those playing the game of threats and ``divided we stand'' politics. \nThey are wrong to ignore the gap between the economic security \nAmericans work so hard to achieve and the economic uncertainty they are \nasked to settle for. They are wrong because if we can't close that gap, \nwe might someday talk about the middle class as something we used to \nhave as opposed to something to which every generation can aspire.\n  Unfortunately, the ``divided we stand'' crowd in Congress refuses to \nbe governing partners committed to meeting this challenge and advancing \nour common good. Worse yet, the threats of a government shutdown and a \ngovernment default are immensely disrespectful to the hard work of \npeople who get up every day and through their sheer grit and \ndetermination have helped to move our country forward.\n  The American people deserve better. They deserve to have their hard \nwork respected. Our economy demands better. It demands that hard work \nis rewarded.\n  Senate Democrats have a plan to keep the government running while \nensuring that millions of Americans do not lose access to affordable \nhealth care. Republicans should join us so that we end this shutdown \ncrisis and the irresponsible political game of division.\n  It is my hope that those who choose divisive politics over progress \nfor America's economy reconsider and begin to join us on this bill and \nwork with us to once and for all end the drift from one crisis to the \nnext. This is not a political game, and those who continue to play \nthese games need to stop and get to work, get to work with us to move \nour economy forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as the Senator from Wisconsin has so \neloquently said, we are indeed nearing the brink of the self-imposed \ncatastrophes of government shutdown or government default or both. \nUnless Speaker Boehner can find a way to restrain his rightwing tea \nparty extremists, find a way to work sensibly with Democrats and steer \nus back from the brink, then an unnecessary and self-imposed calamity \nawaits. I should probably be\n\n[[Page S6922]]\n\nmore specific. It is not just self-imposed, it is tea party imposed.\n  While we try to find our way around this unnecessary tea-party-\nimposed disaster, a real disaster is looming. It is a real disaster, it \nis really looming, and we could address it. Instead, we are having to \nfend off totally unnecessary disasters cooked up by rightwing tea party \nextremists. It is infuriating. When the real disaster has fully hit us, \nfolks will look back at this era and they will wonder: What was wrong \nwith them? Who were those people? The warnings were everywhere and they \ndid nothing? Instead, they wasted time threatening each other with \ncooked-up calamities, rather than deal with the real disasters? That is \ndisgraceful.\n  They will be right. Of course the real and looming disaster is what \nunprecedented levels of carbon pollution and unprecedented levels of \natmospheric carbon are doing to our weather and our oceans. That is for \nreal. That is Mother Nature. That is not just political gamesmanship \nand hostage taking. That is what brings me here now for the 44th time \nto say it is time for us to wake up to the threat of climate change.\n  While Congress keeps sleepwalking on this issue, I am proud to say \nPresident Obama has awoken. Last week his administration announced \nimportant new carbon pollution standards for future powerplants. These \nstandards will reduce the carbon pollution that has been wreaking havoc \non our oceans, our atmosphere, and our health.\n  Those of us who believe in science and who are awake to the changes \nalready happening all around us should rally behind the President and \nEPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to support these proposed standards. \nJust look at the evidence of what carbon pollution is doing to our \nplanet.\n  According to news articles, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, or IPCC, will soon announce it is now more certain than ever \nthat human activity is the main cause of the recent climate changes we \nhave seen. This may surprise some of my Republican colleagues who tried \npointing to a recent slowdown in surface temperature as evidence that \nclimate change has stopped. According to the IPCC, this phase is, \nunfortunately, only temporary, as other slowdowns have been in the \npast.\n  If you look at the history of global warming and of temperature, you \ncan see that across time you can add steps in because of the \nvariability that is inherent in our climate. But nobody could look at \nthat and not see the constant rising thread that runs through it. No \nregression analysis, to use the technical term, would not show that \nglobal warming is real. The fact that we are at a step is--well, here \nis what Richard Muller, noted physics professor at UC-Berkeley, had to \nsay in an article that came out today. He quoted himself from 2004 when \nhe wrote:\n\n       If we believed that natural fluctuations in climate are \n     small--then we might conclude (mistakenly) that the cooling \n     could not be just a random fluctuation on top of a long-term \n     warming trend. . . . And that might lead in turn to the \n     mistaken conclusion that global warming predictions are a lot \n     of hooey.\n       If, on the other hand, we . . . recognize that the natural \n     fluctuations can be large, then we will not be misled by a \n     few years of random cooling.\n\n  Which has happened over and over through the progression of climate \nchange.\n  He followed on today:\n\n       The frequent rises and falls, virtually a stairstep \n     pattern, are part of the historic record, and there is no \n     expectation that they will stop, whatever their cause.\n\n  The land temperature record is full of fits and starts that make the \nupward trend vanish for short periods. Regardless of whether we \nunderstand them, there is no reason to expect them to stop. The current \ncause is consistent with numerous prior causes. When walking upstairs \nin a tall building, it is a mistake interpreting a landing as the end \nof the climb.\n  Whatever the cause of these recurring steps, even contrarian \nscientists understand the principle that is operating here: More carbon \ndioxide leads to more warming. It is as simple as that. It is a 150-\nyear-old established basic principle of physics.\n  The oceans, which I talk about a lot in these speeches, have a lot to \ndo with it. The deep oceans absorb excess heat, saving us from a lot \nmore heat here on the surface. Researchers say the oceans have absorbed \nmore than 90 percent of the excess heat over the last 50 years.\n  If the ocean has absorbed this much of the heat, think what a small \nfluctuation in what the ocean is doing will do to our atmospheric \ntemperature: 93.4 percent, only 2.3 percent. You do not have to wiggle \nthis much in order to create the kind of steps and changes and \noscillations that we have seen in the stairstep of climate change. \nOceans don't just absorb the heat, they also absorb about 30 percent of \nour carbon emissions chemically, emissions that would otherwise be in \nour atmosphere, causing more warming. Absorbing those emissions has \nalready made the oceans more acidic, with dangerous consequences for \nmarine life as this continues. But it has spared us even more extreme \nclimate effects here on land.\n  Environment America recently released a report earlier this month \nhighlighting the power sector's pollution, which creates an enormous \namount of this. In 2011, 5.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide were \nemitted in the United States. The blue circle is the whole country.\n  Just over 40 percent of that total, 2.2 billion tons, came from the \npower sector. That is the green sector.\n  The inner circle, the red one, is the emissions just from the 50 \ndirtiest powerplants in America. One out of every 8 tons of America's \ncarbon dioxide emissions, the ones that are causing these changes in \nthe oceans--the ones that are causing these changes in the atmosphere--\ncome from these filthy 50 powerplants, such as Luminant Generation \nCompany's Martin Lake Plant in Texas, emitting the equivalent of 3.9 \nmillion car emissions, or Alabama Power Company's H. Miller, Jr. Plant, \nemitting the equivalent of 4.3 million car emissions, or the champion, \nGeorgia Power's Scherer Plant, the largest emitter of carbon pollution \nin America, which emits as much pollution as 4.4 million cars.\n  If these 50 plants were an independent country, that country would \nalone be the seventh largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, \njust behind Germany, just ahead of South Korea.\n  From my State's perspective, these out-of-State powerplants are a \nhazard. It is out-of-State powerplants that emit the chemicals that \nturn into ground level ozone in downwind Rhode Island. Rhode Islanders \npay the price, particularly on bad air days, and we have had six of \nthem so far in 2013. About 12 percent of Rhode Island's children and 11 \npercent of our adults suffer from asthma, and ground level ozone puts \nthem at greater risk.\n  We have a lot of good Rhode Island reasons to clean up the power \nsector. That is why I support the administration's proposed standards \nfor new powerplants. The standards will limit the effects of climate \nchange on future generations by telling polluting industries it is time \nto clean up your act, it is time to stop dumping toxic carbon \npollution, it is time to get responsible about what you are doing to \nour environment and our health, to our children, our oceans, and our \natmosphere.\n  We can still avoid the worst outcomes of climate change. Some changes \ncannot be avoided; some are already happening. But if we act now, we \ncan avoid the worst predictions for heat waves, sea level rise, ocean \nacidification, storms, and other disruptions. That is why we in \nCongress should support the President's goal to reduce emissions to 17 \npercent below our 2005 output at the end of this decade and to get \nemissions to 80 percent of 1990 levels by 2050.\n  The standard for good powerplants is a good first step, but we also \nneed to clean up existing powerplants, particularly these 50, which I \nwill remind everybody emit more carbon dioxide than South Korea. We \nshould get serious here in Congress and fix the market failure in our \npower sector that ignores the true costs of burning these fossil fuels. \nWe should pass carbon-fee legislation.\n  What do we see instead, here in Congress? Here is an example. Last \nweek a House subcommittee hearing on the President's climate action \nplan brought out these wildly misleading statements, such as: ``We can \nsay over 40 years we've got almost no increase in temperature'' went \none.\n  ``The arctic ice has actually increased by 60 percent'' went another.\n\n[[Page S6923]]\n\n  In reality, surface temperatures are up about 1 full degree \nFahrenheit over the last 40 years. That increase in Arctic sea ice is \nonly relative to last year's all-time record low. The National Snow and \nIce Data Center reported that this year's summer minimum is the sixth \nlowest in the 34 years records have been kept, and it is right in line \nwith the long-term rapidly declining ice cover trend.\n  The Republicans did a lot of complaining at the hearing about the \nPresident's climate action plan. To my Republican colleagues who don't \nlike the President's plan, I say come to the table. Let's negotiate \nclimate legislation in Congress. Republicans in Congress should support \na carbon fee, as many Republicans outside of Congress do. If you do not \nlike polluting interests having to bear 100 percent of the costs of \ncomplying with the carbon pollution standards, let's look at a carbon \nfee. A carbon fee, by contrast, would give those same companies an \nopportunity to work with Congress to share in some of the revenue \ngenerated by the fee. Or the revenue could be returned to the American \npeople as a tax cut, if Republicans prefer; even as a corporate tax \ncut, if Republicans prefer. Or we could use that revenue to forgive all \nFederal student debt in this country--forgive all Federal student debt \nin this country. What a shot in the arm that would be to our economy. \nOr we could give struggling seniors a $1,600 Social Security raise.\n  There are a lot of wonderful things that could be done, but my \ncolleagues must first come to the table. What they cannot do is deny. \nTo deny is to lie. The time for that has passed. It is time to wake up.\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this hour of \ntime for the Republicans be divided as follows: I ask for 12 minutes \nfor myself and then Senator Hatch for 15 minutes, Senator Portman for \n10 minutes, Senator Coats for 10 minutes, and Senator Toomey for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise again in strong support of my no \nWashington exemption from ObamaCare amendment. I have refiled it on the \nCR, which is before us, the spending bill, and it is a germane \namendment as I filed it to the CR. It is amendment No. 1983.\n  We are on a timetable--a collision course--where unless we act, a \nhorrible policy and illegal Obama administration rule will go into \neffect, and so it is important that we vote, we act, and we do that \nnow. That is why as soon as we came back from the August recess, I \nbrought this to the attention of the Senate and the Congress and the \ncountry and I demanded a vote. It wasn't my choice to be on that tight \ntimetable. It certainly wasn't my choice on the administration issue, a \ndraft illegal rule, but that is where we are, and so we must vote and \nact before October 1.\n  After being blocked out of a vote on the previous matter on the \nfloor, the energy efficiency bill, and after being blocked out for 2 \nweeks by the distinguished majority leader and others, I bring it again \nin the context of this spending bill as a germane amendment numbered \n1983 to this spending bill.\n  The principle is clear, and to me it is the first principle of a \ndemocracy--in our case, the United States of America. What is good for \nAmerica should be good for Washington, and what is applied to America \nshould absolutely be applied in the same way to Washington across the \nboard and certainly including ObamaCare.\n  We had a debate about that several years ago during the ObamaCare \ndebate. Actually, that concept won out, and we were able to add a \nGrassley amendment to the bill, which was passed into final law. I was \na strong supporter of that language. I was somewhat amazed that we got \nit included, but it did go through the democratic process, and it is \nnow part of the law, part of the statute.\n  That law says clearly and unequivocally that every Member of Congress \nand all official congressional staff have to go to the exchange for \ntheir health care. They have to go to the same fallback plan as is \nthere for the American people under ObamaCare. I advocated for that \nstrongly since the very beginning of the ObamaCare debate. Whatever the \nfallback plan for America is, that should be the plan for Washington. \nThere should be no other choices, no special privileges or exemptions \nor subsidies for Washington.\n  That was part of the statute that passed into law, but I guess it was \na classic case of what Nancy Pelosi said--we need to pass the law in \norder to figure out what is in it--because after it passed, a lot of \nfolks on Capitol Hill read that provision and said: Oh, you know what, \nwe can't live with this. We can't let this stand. We need to ``fix \nthis.''\n  So there was furious scheming and furious lobbying to fix that simple \nconcept that what applies to America should apply to Washington. Where \nthat ended up after months of scheming and lobbying was the President \nof the United States, President Obama, became personally involved. This \nwas confirmed in numerous news reports. He had his administration issue \na special rule to save Congress from this horrible fate that is being \nvisited on at least 8 million Americans.\n  As Congress was leaving for the August recess--conveniently getting \nout of town and away from the scene of the crime--the Obama \nadministration issued this draft rule. In my opinion, it is clearly and \nunequivocally illegal because it is in conflict with the language of \nthe statute.\n  The rule does two things:\n  First of all, even though the statute clearly says that every Member \nof Congress and all official congressional staff go to the exchange, \nthe draft rule says: We don't know what official staff is, so we are \ngoing to leave that up to every individual Member of Congress to decide \nwho on his or her staff is official staff for purposes of this \nprovision and we are never going to second guess them. So in theory, a \nMember of Congress can say: My committee staff is part of the official \nstaff; my leadership staff is part of the official staff. In fact, in \ntheory, under this proposed rule a Member of Congress can say: Nobody \non my staff is ``official staff'' for purposes of this provision. OPM \nhas made it clear that they are not going to second guess that. That is \nridiculous on its face.\n  Second, the rule says that for Members and any staff who do get to go \nto the exchange, they get to take a big taxpayer-funded subsidy with \nthem--a subsidy that is completely unavailable to any other American at \nthat income level going to the exchange. That is not in the statute at \nall. That is contrary to the statute, the letter and spirit of the law. \nThat is completely contrary to it. Again, that is what provoked me to \nact with many other Members.\n  I wish to recognize and thank all of the cosponsors of this important \nlegislation on the Senate side and also Congressmen DeSantis of Florida \nand all House cosponsors of identical legislation on the House side.\n  Our fix is simple, basic, and important. It is, first of all, let's \nlive by the law with regard to Congress. So every Member of Congress \nand all congressional official staff have to go to the exchange as \nmandated by law with no special deal, exemption, or subsidy. They can \nonly have what is available to other Americans going to the exchange. \nThe whole purpose of that language was for Congress to feel the \ndislocation, inconvenience, and experience of millions of other \nAmericans going to the exchange--8 million or more Americans going \nthere against their will. They had health care. They had employer-\nprovided health care. They heard the President say: If you have \ncoverage you like, you can keep it, and they found out that was a big \nlie. So now they are losing that and going to the exchange. The whole \npurpose of the language was that Congress walk in their shoes.\n  This amendment goes further and applies the same principle of \nfairness to the administration. It says the President, the Vice \nPresident, and all of their political appointees will do the same \nthing--go to the exchange for their health care, just like every other \nAmerican does, with no special deals, exemptions, subsidies, and no \nspecial rules.\n  Again, this is very time-sensitive because this rule is set to be \nmade final October 1. That is not my choice. I \n\n[[Page S6924]]\n\nthink the rule is flatout illegal. That is a decision and action by the \nadministration, but it does demand that we vote and act now. That is \nwhy as soon as we came back from the August recess and went back into \nsession, I filed the fix and demanded a proper up-or-down vote. \nUnfortunately, that was blocked out for 2 weeks by the distinguished \nmajority leader. That is why I am on the floor again in the context of \nthis spending bill. It is very appropriate to have the debate on this \nspending bill. We are talking about spending. I filed it as a germane \namendment to this spending bill, and we need a full debate and vote on \nthis matter before October 1.\n\n  Interestingly, in the previous bill, after blocking me out of any \nvote, the distinguished majority leader said he had no problem with \nthis clean up-or-down vote. I guess he said that in theory because it \nnever happened in practice.\n  This is a perfect and appropriate time to have that up-or-down vote. \nIt won't delay anything. It is perfectly appropriate to have it on the \nspending bill. This is a germane amendment.\n  I urge us to vote and act and not block out this debate and not block \nout this vote. My request is as simple and basic and straightforward as \nthat. I think it is consistent with the distinguished majority leader's \npromise that we would have a vote. He said that. Again, that must have \nbeen in theory because he blocked it in practice.\n  Mr. President, in that spirit, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendments be set aside and that it be in order to call up my \namendment No. 1983.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, I think that is very \nunfortunate. It is very inconsistent with what the distinguished \nmajority leader said. We need a debate and a vote on this matter. It \nshould happen before October 1--and it will happen, I guarantee that. I \ndon't know when. I don't know if it will be before October 1, but it \nwill happen. We will have this debate and vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is no secret that the so-called \nAffordable Care Act is a train wreck waiting to happen. Some of it has \nalready happened. We know that. The American people know that. My \nconstituents all over Utah know that. But sadly the President of the \nUnited States doesn't seem to know it. In fact, the President is out \ntoday trying to convince the American people that his signature \ndomestic achievement is a winner. Few people believe him, however, and \nno amount of spin on his part will change that.\n  Frankly, Republicans have been saying ObamaCare would be a disaster \nsince well before it was enacted. Indeed, if we look back at the \noriginal debates on ObamaCare, we will find that we predicted virtually \nall of the problems we are seeing now as the administration attempts to \nimplement this poorly crafted law.\n  Let's look at some of the predictions we made. We predicted, for \nexample, that in order to avoid the employer mandate, businesses would \ncease hiring new workers and they would move existing employees to part \ntime. ObamaCare requires employers with 50 or more full-time employees \nto offer their workers health coverage of a minimum value or pay a \npenalty. As we predicted, a number of small businesses, which are the \nmain job creators in this country, are simply opting to unilaterally \nlimit their full-time employees in order to avoid the mandate. Just \nthink about that. We have the lowest labor participation rate since the \nCarter administration, but instead of working to create the jobs \nAmerican families and workers need, more and more businesses have \nstopped hiring to avoid the costs that come with ObamaCare.\n  The law defines full-time employees as those working more than 30 \nhours a week. As a result of this bizarre definition, many employers \nhave opted to simply cap workers' hours. That is happening everywhere. \nIt is happening in the private sector and among public schools and \nmunicipalities. In fact, it is happening so often that even the leaders \nof big labor, who are among the biggest supporters of ObamaCare, have \npublicly argued that the law is destroying the 40-hour workweek. That \nis just one Republican prediction about ObamaCare that came true.\n  We also predicted that ObamaCare would cause people who currently \nhave health insurance to lose it. We all remember the President's \ninfamous promise that ``if you like your plan, you can keep it.'' \nSadly, our post-ObamaCare experience hasn't borne that out. At the \ntime, Republicans said there was no way he could fulfill that promise, \nand we were right. According to the Congressional Budget Office, \nmillions of Americans are likely to lose their current employer-\nprovided health insurance under the President's health law.\n  We also predicted that the cost of health insurance premiums would \nskyrocket as insurance companies struggle to comply with all of the new \nmandates under the law. This is also happening. Numerous studies have \nshown that the cost of premiums have continued to go up since ObamaCare \nwas passed and are predicted to go up even further next year as the law \nis more fully implemented.\n  The question is: How high are the costs going to go?\n  Yesterday, the administration released a report claiming that \nObamaCare is bringing down the cost of health insurance premiums. \nSpecifically, the report claims that premiums ``will be 16 percent \nlower than projected.'' Lower than projected is not the same as lower \nthan they are now.\n  If we compare the cost of ObamaCare health plans with the cost of \nplans available on the market today, it is indisputable that costs are \ngoing up under the law. The administration is free to cherry-pick data \nin order to make the best case possible. Indeed, that is what they have \ndone with this most recent report. However, even when they cite the \nmost favorable data available, we see that ObamaCare is making health \ninsurance premiums more expensive in this country.\n  When we look at the more complete picture of the data, we find it is \neven worse. As the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research recently \nfound, individual market premiums will increase 99 percent for men and \n62 percent for women nationwide under ObamaCare. This, once again, was \nnot unforeseen. While the President was claiming his health care plan \nwould reduce premiums by an average of $2,500 a year, Republicans \npredicted costs would actually go up under the law. As it turns out, we \nwere right on that one too.\n  Republicans also predicted that health care spending would increase \nas a result of ObamaCare. The President, if my colleagues recall, \npromised the law would lower the costs of health care. However, health \ncare spending is projected to increase dramatically as a result of \nObamaCare.\n  Republicans also predicted that ObamaCare would increase the deficit. \nWouldn't you know it, a former Director of CBO has projected that the \nhealth care law will add $500 billion to the deficit in the first 10 \nyears and more than $1.5 trillion in the second decade.\n  We predicted middle-class families would see their taxes go up as a \nresult of ObamaCare. When we look at the law, we see it includes no \nfewer than 11 taxes and penalties that directly impact the middle \nclass, including taxes on medical devices, prescription drugs, and \nflexible spending accounts.\n  In addition, Republicans predicted health insurance exchanges, where \npeople go to sign up for ObamaCare's mandated insurance, and the system \nof verifying and approving premium and cost-sharing subsidies for \npeople in those exchanges would be a nightmare to manage. This has been \nconfirmed time and time again as the administration has continually \nmissed deadlines and offered only scant details as to how these \nexchanges are going to work, even as they are set to go live on October \n1.\n  Studies from the Government Accountability Office have confirmed that \nthe exchanges are not likely to be ready in time. In fact, just \nyesterday, the District of Columbia announced it will be delaying the \nimplementation of its exchange because of ``high error rates.'' Two \nother States, Idaho and\n\n[[Page S6925]]\n\nMinnesota, also might delay their exchanges.\n  During the debate over ObamaCare, Republicans predicted that despite \nall the claims that ``health care reform is entitlement reform,'' the \nlaw would not shore up our unsustainable entitlement programs. We are \nset to spend more than $10 trillion on Medicare and Medicaid over the \nnext 10 years. The CBO has called our health care entitlements our \n``fundamental fiscal challenge.'' According to the CBO--the \nCongressional Budget Office--the President's health care law hasn't \ndone anything--has not done anything--to diminish the problems facing \nthese massive programs.\n  As I said, none of the problems we are seeing today were unforeseen. \nRepublicans predicted all of these difficulties years ago. We weren't \npsychic; we just know how markets work and, more important, we have \nlearned from experience just how inept government can be when it \nventures into uncharted territory.\n  The Democrats who drafted this monstrosity and forced it through \nCongress either didn't understand the inherent problems with the \nlegislation or they just plain didn't care. I suspect it was a little \nof both. At the time, they were more concerned with just getting \nsomething passed so the President could claim victory on one of his \ncentral campaign promises than they were with passing something that \nwould actually work. Now we are all seeing the results and only part of \nthe results. I am only mentioning a few things today.\n  Nearly every week we learn of another problem the administration is \nhaving with implementing ObamaCare. As I said, we constantly hear \nannouncements that certain elements of the law are going to be delayed. \nWe have heard this about the employer mandate, the small business \nhealth insurance market, and employee automatic enrollment in the \nexchanges.\n  We got the latest announcement just today. Today we found out the \nObama administration is postponing online enrollment in some of the \nsmall business exchanges that were scheduled to open this coming \nTuesday. The administration makes these announcements almost \nnonchalantly, never acknowledging they are indications of larger \nproblems with the law. Instead, they simply press forward, ignoring the \nwarning signs and pushing our Nation's health care system even further \ntoward the cliff.\n  It is clear what needs to be done. It is not complicated or \nconvoluted. On the contrary, it is quite simple. This law needs to be \neliminated and Congress should do whatever is in its power to get that \ndone. This has been my position since the day the law was passed, and \nit continues to be my position today. I have supported repealing \nObamaCare, I have supported delaying it, and I support defunding it.\n  I have introduced multiple pieces of legislation that would repeal \nthe most egregious parts of ObamaCare, including the individual \nmandate, the employer mandate, the medical device tax, and the health \ninsurance tax. With days to go before the exchanges go live on October \n1, I have legislation backed by 31 of my colleagues delaying them until \nthe GAO can certify that private and personal information of consumers \nand patients will be secure. I have come to the floor on numerous \noccasions to call for either repeal or a permanent delay to the \nimplementation to the law. Regardless of how the debate over the \ncontinuing resolution plays out, I will continue to do so.\n  This law costs more and will do far less than was promised when the \nbill was first drafted, debated, and passed. The Democrats who wrote \nthis law and forced it through Congress may have thought the American \npeople were naive enough to believe all the promises that came with \nObamaCare, but from the beginning polls have shown the majority of \nAmericans do not support it and with good cause. That is why I publicly \napplauded the House of Representatives for passing its continuing \nresolution that defunds ObamaCare.\n  Getting rid of ObamaCare is just the first step. Once we do that, we \nneed to work together on a bipartisan basis to find a way to reduce \nhealth care costs for the American people while also making sure we \ncover the American people. We have seen what happens when one party \ntries to fix health care on its own. What we got was a disaster of a \nlaw that has actually increased health care costs, all while imposing \nnew taxes and mandates on the American people and creating chaos of the \nentire American health care system.\n\n  The American people deserve better, and the legislation before us is \nthe first step toward giving them that.\n  I understand the Democrats are going to peel out the one provision \nthe Republican side supports. Everyone on the Republican side supports \nthe defunding of ObamaCare and starting over and doing it right in a \nbipartisan way, instead of this partisan way that has wound up with the \nbiggest fiasco I have seen around here in my 37 years in Congress.\n  I am concerned. We can do better. This has become too much of a \npartisan exercise and, frankly, I am very concerned that our country is \ngoing to suffer because some of our friends think they have to continue \nto support this dog of a bill, even though day after day after day we \nfind more and more reasons to oppose it.\n  We have brought up these things before, maybe not some of these \nbecause some of them have just occurred, as a matter of fact, just in \nthe last day. Think of the fraud. Think of the open door for scam \nartists because they are going to go ahead on October 1 with \nindividuals saying they think it is fine. But there has been no \nindependent verification done by this administration, or by anybody, to \nmake sure the private information of our individual citizens is \nprotected. It is a disgrace. It is a disgrace that we are letting them \nget away with it, and it is a disgrace that is going to come back to \nhammer us as Members of Congress who didn't do our job right in the \nfirst place and who continuously keep supporting a bill that is eating \nus alive.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, over the next couple of days we will \nhave a chance to vote on ObamaCare. This will be an opportunity for us \nto allow our views to be expressed on both sides of the aisle. I am \nglad we are going to have that opportunity. We will see what happens. \nBut I think it is certainly an opportunity for us to have a good debate \nabout why we think it is important for us not just to change ObamaCare \nbut to actually start over and do it right. It is a time for us to undo \nthe mistake this Senate made 3 years ago when that legislation was \njammed through the process--without a single Republican vote, by the \nway--which is something the American people are tired of. The \npartisanship, on that particular vote, I think has led to a bad result.\n  ObamaCare was sold, by the way, to the Nation under false pretenses. \nWe were promised that ObamaCare would bring premiums down. You remember \nthose discussions: This is a way to get health care costs down and \nreduce premiums. In fact, what we are learning--and there is a new \nreport out this week--is that premiums are going up.\n  We were promised that Americans would be able to keep the insurance \nthey have. That was a specific commitment made. Yet millions of \nAmericans are losing the insurance they have. It is insurance they \nlike, and they cannot keep it.\n  We were promised that if you like your doctor, you can keep your \ndoctor; everything will be fine. In fact, many Ohioans and many \nAmericans are losing their doctors.\n  We were also told that ObamaCare would help grow the economy and \ncreate jobs. Unfortunately, just the opposite is happening. More \nAmericans are looking for work because many of the jobs that are \navailable now are part time, in part because of ObamaCare encouraging \nmore part-time work. There are companies that are not expanding because \nthey do not want to reach that magic number of 50 employees.\n  As we talk today, we are learning that there are even more problems \nwith the implementation of ObamaCare. One of our Democratic colleagues \non the floor said he thought\n\n[[Page S6926]]\n\nthis implementation was going to be difficult. In fact, one Democrat \nwho was prominent in the legislation said it is likely to be a train \nwreck. Well, unfortunately, that train wreck is occurring. We see the \nDistrict of Columbia this week making changes. We see today apparently \nthe administration now saying the small business part of the exchanges \nis not going to go forward as planned. We have already seen a 1-year \ndelay in terms of the business mandate and on and on. So that train \nwreck is already upon us as we move toward October 1.\n  Let me give one example of the impact of ObamaCare. In Columbus, OH--\nmy home State of Ohio--the Wall Street Journal reported that premiums \ncould increase by as much as 436 percent. Some of my colleagues will \ntake issue with that number. Maybe it is not going to be 436 percent, \nbut the point is that we know it is going to be more expensive, we just \ndo not know how much. That is part of the uncertainty the law creates. \nIn other words, sometimes uncertainty is the worst thing, and that is \nwhat we are seeing not just in Ohio but around the country. We do not \nknow what the effect is going to be on our families. We do not know \nwhat the effect is going to be on small businesses. We do not know what \nthe effect is going to be on our economy.\n  Throughout this debate over the continuing resolution, my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle have talked about this uncertainty. They \nhave talked about how a showdown going up to a potential government \nshutdown creates uncertainty in the economy. I agree. I do not think we \nshould shut down. In fact, I am offering an amendment to say we should \nnever be shutting down government. It is called the no government \nshutdown amendment. It is bipartisan. In the budget debate we actually \nhad a few Democrats support it, I am sure against the urging of their \nleadership, and I appreciate that.\n  Uncertainty is a problem, but, boy, talk about uncertainty--in the \nimplementation you have some things delayed, others things not delayed, \na lot of confusion about how the legislation is going to work. Every \nday it seems as if we discover a new wrinkle in the law that is going \nto cost more money and cause more problems in terms of people just \nunderstanding what their options are.\n  The effects of ObamaCare, by the way, do not stop at the hospital \ndoor, and they are not limited to our pocketbooks. If you ask Americans \nwhat is the most important issue to them, they will tell you it is the \nlack of good jobs--jobs and the economy. ObamaCare kills jobs.\n  Take the Cleveland Clinic. The Cleveland Clinic, as some of you know, \nis the largest employer in northeast Ohio. It has been talked about on \nthe floor by other Members. They have about 40,000 employees.\n  By the way, it is one of the few things that both President Obama and \nGovernor Romney agreed on in the campaign, which was that the Cleveland \nClinic is providing cutting-edge health care that should be a model for \nthe rest of the country. They do a terrific job.\n  A week ago the Cleveland Clinic announced it is cutting $330 million \nfrom its budget. What does that mean? That means a bunch of my \nconstituents in the Cleveland area are going to lose their jobs. Why is \nthe Cleveland Clinic having to cut $330 million from their budget? \nAccording to their own spokesperson, to prepare for increased costs and \ndecreased revenues because of ObamaCare.\n  So, look, it is something I have heard about again and again when I \nvisit with small business owners throughout Ohio. I hear it from our \nemployers, who say they have no choice but to freeze growth. I have a \nfriend who runs a small company in the Cleveland area. He has 47 \nemployees. He has confided in me: You know what. I am not going to 50. \nEven though I have some additional business--he is starting to see a \nlittle pickup in his particular sector--I am not going there. I don't \nwant to get to 50 because I simply don't want the uncertainty and the \ncost associated with the new mandates and requirements I would have to \nendure because of ObamaCare.\n  So you have the ``49ers''--employers who are sticking at 49 or fewer \nbecause they do not want the onerous requirements of ObamaCare when \nthey cross that threshold of 50 employees.\n  Others, of course, are reducing the hours of folks who already work \nfor them to well under 40 hours because they have to get under the 30-\nhour-a-week threshold in ObamaCare. It is so very sad.\n  You go to somebody and say: You know what. You have to come in at 28 \nhours now because the health care I am going to have to offer under \nObamaCare is not something I can afford. It does not fit within our \nbottom line.\n  And this person says: I have a car payment or I have a house payment.\n  This is sad, and it is having an effect in my State, and I know it \nfrom talking to people, but I also know it just by looking at what \nthese requirements are doing to small businesses. It is no surprise to \nme that this ``underemployment'' figure we see every month in the \nemployment numbers is growing. Those are the people who are not working \nfull time but working part time. Unfortunately, if you look over the \nlast few months, we have seen a big increase in part-time jobs and not \nfull-time jobs.\n  In 2010, I do not think many of my Democratic friends thought they \nwere voting for a bill that would kill jobs. I really do not. I do not \nthink they would have voted for it. I cannot believe they thought \nObamaCare would drive up premium costs and make health care harder to \nget, as it has, but that is what is happening. That is why I believe it \nneeds to be repealed and replaced with more sensible reforms.\n  The current health care system--before ObamaCare--is far from \nperfect. It cries out for reform. But, unfortunately, the prescription \nof ObamaCare is not making things better but worse.\n  I know this is hard to believe, but sometimes Congress makes \nmistakes. In this case, in my view, Congress made a big mistake. But we \ncan fix it, and we can replace it with real bipartisan health care \nreform that does foster an environment where jobs can be created, that \ndoes provide for health care to be available rather than harder and \nharder to get. We can get there but only if we start by--in this vote \ntoday--saying: Let's defund it, let's repeal it, and let's replace it \nwith something better.\n  As we learn more about the effects of ObamaCare, we are seeing some \ncourage on the other side of the aisle. I know one of my colleagues \ntoday on the Democratic side said he could look to delaying ObamaCare's \nindividual mandate for a year, for instance. That only makes sense. We \nhave already told the businesses they are going to get a 1-year delay, \nbut a woman or a guy who works at that business is told: You have a \nmandate even though your business does not, and you have to pay a fine \nif you do not get health care. So 22 House Democrats voted in favor of \ndelaying the individual mandate as well. So I think on both sides of \nthe aisle you are beginning to see some interest in at least having a \ndelay to be able to try to improve this legislation.\n  But the Senate has the opportunity to speak here this afternoon. We \nare going to vote on this amendment as to whether to defund ObamaCare. \nI have heard from my constituents. I am sure you have heard from yours. \nOverwhelmingly, I say to my colleagues, what I am hearing is they do \nnot want this law to continue. Do they think the health care system is \nperfect? No. But they think what ObamaCare is offering makes it worse, \nnot better.\n  Republicans cannot do it alone. We have 46 votes here. You need 60. \nBut in an act of bipartisanship and real political courage, maybe we \nwill have a good result this afternoon and begin this process of moving \ntoward a better system. I urge my colleagues to show that courage so we \ncan turn to a better way to lower health care costs, to increase health \ncare choices, and ultimately to improve the quality of care for all the \nfamilies we represent.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I wish to take a moment to reflect a \nlittle bit on this impasse where we find ourselves. The Senator from \nIndiana is going to join me in a discussion here, and I will have a \nunanimous consent request along the way.\n  First of all, as to where we are, as we all know, we are at an \nimpasse on how to fund the roughly 40 percent of the\n\n[[Page S6927]]\n\nFederal Government that is funded through discretionary spending--the \nspending that Congress controls, the spending that is supposed to \nhappen through the ordinary appropriations process but does not around \nhere.\n  As we address this issue, it has become obvious that every single \nRepublican in the House and the Senate wants to defund ObamaCare as a \nstep in the direction of completely repealing this completely \nunworkable bill. But all the Democrats support ObamaCare, and they want \nto implement it and they want to fund it and they want to move forward.\n  The impasse arises, obviously, because the Democrats cannot have \ntheir way in the House where the Republicans are in control, and we \nRepublicans cannot have our way in the Senate where the Democrats are \nin control. So I have a suggestion. My suggestion is, maybe--maybe--\nthere is a third way. Maybe this does not have to be completely binary. \nMaybe this does not have to be an all-or-nothing proposition in which \none side completely wins and the other side completely loses.\n  Among my Democratic friends--who are big fans of ObamaCare--I would \nthink there is nobody who actually thinks that is a perfect bill. I \ncannot imagine that when the American public has made clear, \noverwhelmingly, their opposition to this bill. When you cannot pick up \na newspaper in America today without reading a front-page story about \nthe huge problems and costs and negative effects ObamaCare is creating, \nI cannot imagine that anyone thinks this is all perfect.\n  So here is my suggestion: Why not repeal a few of the more egregious \nflaws that have been acknowledged as flaws on both sides of the aisle--\nthose things that are not working that are most problematic--just a \nfew. Couldn't we do that and at least make some progress?\n  So the three items I have in mind are the subject of my unanimous \nconsent request. One would be repeal of the medical device tax, which \nis one of the most egregious flaws in this badly flawed bill, and I \nwill speak some more about this tax in a little while. A second would \nbe to delay for 1 year the individual mandate. I think Senator Coats \nfrom Indiana is going to speak a little bit more about how important it \nwould be to delay that individual mandate. The third would be to \nprotect the religious freedom of those who object based on deeply held \nreligious views. They object to the contraception mandate that is \nimposed on them, including faith-based institutions.\n  So I am going to request that we consider these amendments. That is \nall--just asking for an up-or-down vote on these amendments. I think \nthat is a pretty reasonable request. Every one of these has had \nbipartisan support.\n  By the way, the repeal of the medical device tax was supported by 79 \nSenators. Two-thirds of the Democratic Senators voted in favor of an \namendment to repeal the medical device tax, and every single \nRepublican. That is not even controversial anymore, to repeal the \nmedical device tax.\n  They all have some level of bipartisan support. Taken together, they \nare about budget neutral. Repeal of the Medical device tax would cost \nthe government some revenue, but the delay of the individual mandate \nwould save the government expenses, so it is about revenue neutral.\n  This could probably speed up the whole process. If we allow these \namendments, frankly, they all would probably pass. If they became part \nof the underlying bill and if Senator Reid has the votes to pass the \namendment he wants to pass, what would go back to the House would \nprobably pass the House and it probably would not have to get ping-\nponged back here and risk a government shutdown. Finally, it would \nbreak this impasse, and it would demonstrate that we are at least able \nto come together on the things where there is bipartisan agreement.\n  So I think the most reasonable thing in the world is to have the \nvote. That is all. I do not know for sure how it will turn out. I think \nit will pass because these items have demonstrated bipartisan support \nbefore. But I think it is unreasonable not to be able to have the vote.\n  So, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside and that it be in order to call up the \nfollowing amendments, which are at the desk: No. 1971, to repeal the \nmedical device tax; No. 1972, to delay the individual mandate; and No. \n1973, to protect religious freedom; I further ask consent that each \namendment be limited to up to 1 hour for debate equally divided in the \nusual form; I further ask consent that following use or yielding back \nof time on each of the amendments, the Senate proceed to a vote in \nrelation to each amendment with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. TESTER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania \nfor his efforts here. We very much share the same sentiment and the \nsame concerns going forward here. We are going to vote sometime today, \nperhaps tomorrow, perhaps on Saturday. We have had a week-long effort \nhere undertaking a very important issue, serious to the future of the \nAmerican people's health and to the American economy.\n  I think it is pretty clear that there are a couple of hard truths \nthat we have to recognize as we come to this vote. I am still hopeful \nthat we will be able to see at least five of our colleagues from across \nthe aisle come and join us.\n  For months we have heard about the impact of the health care act and \nthe mess that it has created, the confusion, and the egregious taxes \nthat are attached to it.\n  My colleague has talked about the medical device tax. In Indiana, it \nis one of our key industries which provides high wages and skilled \npositions for people. These are products that are exported around the \nworld which in turn helps our balance of trade. These products are \nsaving the lives of millions of people. Some of these innovations that \ncome out of Warsaw or Bloomington or other parts of Indiana, and the \ncompanies that are in this medical device business, are truly \nextraordinary.\n  Yet they got socked as a ``pay for'' for ObamaCare by a 2.3 percent \ntax on their gross sales, not on their profits. As a company, say they \nare developing a new product and they come to a point where they know \nthey are not going to make a profit for 2 or 3 years, but they know \nthey have something that is really going to work, really going to \nprovide life saving or life enhancing benefits.\n  Say they lose money, but they are selling their product. The sales \nhave not yet caught up with all of the research costs. So they report a \nloss at the end of year, or maybe they break even. These companies are \nbeing taxed 2.3 percent on the total amount of money that they take in, \neven though that money does not reach a profit.\n  That is egregious, offensive, unbelievable. I mean, who could think \nup stuff like this, and who could vote for stuff like this? A repeal of \nthis tax is one of three amendments my colleague from Pennsylvania has \noffered. I regret that it has been objected to. We will not even have a \nchance to debate it. We will not have a chance to vote on it. We will \nnot have a chance to put down our yeas or our nays on where we stand.\n  The real tragedy of this is that a majority of Democrats voted to \nrepeal this egregious tax in the budget.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. The Senator from Indiana pointed out exactly correctly \nthe nature of this tax. It is extremely unusual that we choose to \npunish a company based on its sales, irrespective of whether it is \nmaking any money at all.\n  Senator Coats observed that this is a 2.3 percent tax on sales. I \nwant to touch on some of the real world consequences that are happening \nright now in Pennsylvania because this tax went into effect on January \n1. It is happening now. Here is what is happening in Pennsylvania: \nFujirebio Diagnostics in Mahler, a world leader in the production of \ndiagnostics that detect cancer, had to put on a hiring freeze. They had \nbeen hiring. They were planning on more hiring. They cannot do it now. \nSo there is a hiring freeze there.\n  Cook Medical in Pittsburgh, PA. They manufacture pacemakers. They had \nplans to build five new plants over time in the United States. Those \nplants are all on hold. Everything has been put on the shelf; no new \nplants as long as they have to contend with this.\n\n[[Page S6928]]\n\n  Boehringer Laboratories in Phoenixville, PA. They make surgical \nequipment. No new hires. Hiring freeze at a time when our unemployment \nis so unacceptably high, so many people looking for work.\n  B Braun. They make a wide range of medical equipment, located in the \nLehigh Valley in Pennsylvania. They have a hiring freeze and immediate \nand drastic cuts in research spending. What else can they do? Such a \nhuge new chunk of their revenue has being taken.\n  This is an ill-conceived tax. It is costing us jobs. It is costing us \ninnovation. It is costing us in the quality of health care. Finally, \neverybody gets that, as evidenced by 79 Members of this body voting to \nrepeal it. We are denied the opportunity to have a binding vote.\n  It is shocking to me.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for listing those \ncompanies. Many of those same companies have facilities in Indiana. In \nfact, Cook International was founded by Bill Cook in Bloomington, IN, \ninitially working out of his study in his home. Now it is an \ninternational company providing thousands of jobs across the country, \nin Pennsylvania, in Indiana and other places.\n  Unfortunately, Bill passed away this year. That company is going \nforward. But there were five new facilities hiring that are now put on \nhold as a result of this tax being imposed on their gross sales--not on \ntheir profits, but on their gross sales.\n  So you can take in $1 million, but it costs you $2 million because \nyou are developing a new product. You lose the million and the \ngovernment says: We are going to tax you on every penny that you took \nin regardless of whether you made a profit or not. It is just \nunthinkable.\n  Thankfully, a majority of Democrats have joined us in this effort. We \ngot 79 votes out of 100 to repeal this. Yet we are not able to vote on \nit. Why are we not able to vote on it? Because the White House does not \nwant to lose that money coming in that is so egregiously taxed to pay \nfor some of the unaffordable care act.\n  That is one of many things that we would like to debate. We would \nlike to vote on that. We think we can vote on some of the egregious \nstuff that is in this ObamaCare. The hard truth is this: Despite all of \nour best efforts--I want to make this point clear: Every one of 46 \nRepublicans, our total here in the Senate, is fully 100 percent \ncommitted to the repeal, the defunding of ObamaCare.\n  Unfortunately, it takes 51 in order to achieve our goal, unless we \nget some help from the other side. There is no indication of that now. \nWe have gone through several machinations this week. There will be some \nvotes coming up. I want the vote to be clearly a yea or a nay. People \ngo home and they say: ``You know, do not hide behind this procedural \nprocess of cloture. We do not even know what that means.'' This is a \nprocedural move. Over time, politicians have figured out ways to go \nback and say: ``No, I am really not for that.'' Or to say: ``I am not \nreally against that. We had a procedural move. I was for this or I was \nagainst that procedural move because it denied this amendment or it did \nthis or did that.''\n  The real vote is when it comes down to it--it is as old as the Bible. \nLet your yea be yea and your nay be nay. Are you for ObamaCare or \nagainst ObamaCare? That is the vote we will have when the majority \nleader comes down here and offers a motion to strip the defunding of \nObamaCare out of this bill.\n  I do not support a shutdown. I might support a shutdown if it would \nachieve the goal of actually defeating ObamaCare. But the truth that \nhas not been told to a lot of the American people, by some outside \ngroups promoting this, is the fact that a government shutdown won't \nstop ObamaCare because a majority of the funding is mandatory not \ndiscretionary. Our vote on this matter will not affect that mandatory \nfunding.\n  All of the taxes will go forward. Much of the implementation of \nObamaCare will go forward no matter how we vote on this. So that fact \nhas to be recognized. It also has to be recognized that it does not \nappear that we have the votes. Certainly we do not have the votes to \noverride a veto by the President.\n  He is not going to say: ``Hand me a pen. I am sorry, this is a \nterrible idea. I see what is happening here. Yes, we should cancel this \nprogram.'' I have not heard the White House giving the indication that \nis what is going to happen. So those who say the vote is on a \nprocedural motion, essentially want to shut down the government, No. 1.\n  Maybe that would be worth it if it accomplished the goal. But to do \nit by not accomplishing the goal takes us nowhere. So what we are \ntrying to do is basically say: ``Yes, let's vote to defund it. Let's \nvote to repeal it.'' But if that does not work, if that does not pass, \nthen let's see if we can at least do something. I am not ready to give \nup. I am not ready to say: ``If we do not pass this vote on a cloture \nmotion then that is it. We will never have a chance at this again.''\n  Are you kidding me? I mean, people are just learning about ObamaCare. \nThe public sentiment is building. I commend Senator Cruz for standing \nup and highlighting this issue. I could not have stood here for 21 \nhours. I would not have made it. More power to him. He has brought this \nissue to us. He has focused the attention of Americans on this \nparticular issue.\n  But given that attention, that certainly does not mean we are going \nto give up. Senator Toomey and I are going to go forward. We have some \nprovisions here that we think will make a difference. I have offered, \nand Senator Toomey has also offered, to delay the implementation of \nthis. We delayed it for the employers, big business, but what about the \nindividuals? What about the people in North Dakota, Louisiana, or \nAlaska, just to name a few? I know for sure Indiana and Pennsylvania.\n\n  Why should we impose a mandate on individuals when we do not impose \nit on the businesses? The President has said: ``We cannot get our act \ntogether here with the businesses so we will give you a 1-year \nwaiver.'' In fairness, let's give that to the individuals. That is \nexactly what we are about here.\n  At this point, I would ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside, and it be in order to call up my amendment No. \n1979. I further ask consent that the debate on the amendment be limited \nto up to 1 hour equally divided in the usual form, and I further ask \nconsent that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to a vote on that amendment with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I want to yield back to my colleague \nhere. I regret that we are not able to take this up. I regret that we \nare not able to have a debate or a vote on this matter. We are going to \ndo all we can to continue to address, to work for, and to fight for the \nrepeal and the defunding, however we accomplish it, of the piece of \nlegislation that was jammed through the process without any bipartisan \nsupport, that is now unfolding before our very eyes. We see what a \ncolossal mess it is making.\n  We are not giving up on this process. In fact, we are going forward. \nThis first vote on cloture, that is not the end of this. This is the \nbeginning. As this unfolds for the American people, I think we are \ngoing to gain the support on a bipartisan basis to get rid of this, to \nstart over with more responsible, cost-effective, meaningful, \nworthwhile provisions that address our health care needs and not take \nthis one-piece-fits-all bill and jam it down the throats of the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield back.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I want to commend the Senator from \nIndiana. I agree entirely. I think this is really an outrageous \nprocess. Let's consider where we are and why. We have another \nmanufactured fiscal crisis, manufactured because the majority party \nthat controls this body refuses to bring out appropriations bills.\n  We had one appropriation reach the floor this entire year. If you do \nnot do appropriations bills, you run into this cliff at the end of the \nprocess. So now where are we? We have this giant CR, this huge omnibus, \nwhatever you want to call it, that is going to be here on the floor for \na vote.\n\n[[Page S6929]]\n\n  Senator Reid has decided he would use his power to make sure that he \ngets to have an amendment. Actually, he gets to have a couple of \namendments and gets to gut the language that would defund ObamaCare, \nwhich will be on a party line vote.\n  When I ask for unanimous consent to bring up amendments that have \nbroad bipartisan support, including one which has been supported by \ntwo-thirds of all of the Democrats and every Republican, I am not \nallowed to offer that amendment.\n  We have a completely dysfunctional Senate. It is manifesting itself \nvery clearly today. Frankly, given where this is leading, given the \nfact that one party here is not given an opportunity to weigh in and \nengage in this debate and offer amendments, I cannot support cloture on \nthe underlying bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. For this hour of majority time, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the following Senators have 20 minutes each: Senator Baucus, \nSenator Franken, and Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. On September 26, 1987, 26 years ago this very day, \nPresident Reagan faced a Congress playing politics with the Nation's \ndebt ceiling.\n  Knowing the catastrophic consequences a default would have on \nAmerica's economy, President Reagan addressed the Nation. Speaking from \nthe Oval Office he said:\n\n       Congress consistently brings the government to the edge of \n     default before facing its responsibility.\n\n  He warned:\n\n       This brinksmanship threatens the holders of government \n     bonds and those who rely on Social Security and veterans \n     benefits. Interest rates would skyrocket, instability would \n     occur in financial markets, and the Federal deficit would \n     soar.\n       The United States has a special responsibility to itself \n     and the world to meet its obligations.\n\n  That was a pretty stern warning. While spoken more than a quarter of \na century ago, President Reagan's words, sadly, still ring true today.\n  I hope my colleagues listen to those words of reason. I hope my \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives heed the warning from \nPresident Reagan about using the debt ceiling for brinkmanship.\n  As we know, the Federal Government hits its debt limit on May 19. For \nthe past 130 days, the Treasury Secretary has been using what are known \nas extraordinary measures to continue funding the government. We are \nrunning, therefore, on borrowed time. But those extraordinary measures \nwill be used up by October 17. At that point we will have exhausted \nevery measure. Default--that is the United States not paying its \ndebts--will occur unless Congress acts to raise the debt limit.\n  There will be much debate in the coming days on how to deal with the \ndebt limit. The House continuing resolution which we have before us \ntoday contains a proposal that some claim would avoid the default. What \nis it? What do they claim, what is the provision?\n  It is a dangerous plan that gives the Treasury Secretary the \nunprecedented power to prioritize payments; that is, the Treasury \nSecretary decides what obligations should be paid and not paid; that \nis, once the debt limit is surpassed--in short, the power to pick and \nchoose which bills to pay.\n  The House CR does, however, identify two specific payments as \npriorities they have to pay first. What are they? Social Security and \ninterest to holders of U.S. bonds. They are all first in line. Everyone \nelse has to fight among themselves.\n  We are all familiar with Social Security and its importance. It is a \ngiven. But the American people may not be as familiar with the \nprincipal and interest on U.S. bonds. This is the payment Uncle Sam \nmakes to various persons and countries that hold our debt. It can be \nU.S. citizens who hold our debt or it can be countries such as China, \nJapan, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. I might add that the foreign countries \nthat hold most of the U.S. debt among the countries I listed are China \nand Japan. They hold the most foreign debt.\n  The continuing resolution categorizes the interest to these foreign \nbondholders as a must-pay bill--we must pay those first; that is, \nSocial Security and interest. It leaves all other obligations of the \nFederal budget to be paid only by the revenue Treasury has on hand on \nany given day. Some days revenue comes in and some days revenue comes \nin more than others.\n  Critical programs will be left fighting for the remaining scraps of \nfunding. In effect, the House proposal to prioritize payments would \nresult in the interests of America's veterans, the unemployed, and \nstudents, among others, being left behind the interests of China, \nRussia, and Saudi Arabia. It is pay Russia first, pay U.S. veterans \nsecond--if there is money left over to pay U.S. veterans.\n  This proposal makes no sense. A few of the programs that would \ncompete for funding under the House plan are veterans' benefits, child \nnutrition, military salaries, military operations and maintenance, \nMedicare payments to doctors and hospitals, student loans, highway \nfunding, dollars for air traffic controllers, unemployment insurance, \nand tax refunds, to name a few. They are all going to have to compete \nwith each other for what is left after interest on the debt and Social \nSecurity payments are made under the House measure.\n  Can you imagine the result? Medicare beneficiaries will be pitted \nagainst disabled vets, each fighting the other. Students receiving Pell \ngrants will be up against patients receiving medical care; doctors \nconducting cancer research would be pitted against agents patrolling \nour borders. The chaos that would ensue would be unimaginable. We can't \neven begin to fathom the chaos. When this scheme was first proposed \nduring the debt limit debate in January, it became obvious what it \nwould be like. I compared it to the movie ``The Hunger Games,'' hunger \ngames where individuals were out scrapping, trying to save their own \nlives and killing other people to save their own lives. The sequel \n``The Hunger Games'' is not out until November, but we can now see the \ncoming attractions of the House CR. Their plan for a debt \nprioritization would pit one program against another in a fight for \nsurvival.\n  Under this ill-conceived plan, the Secretary of Treasury would be \ngiven unprecedented power to decide which programs are funded and which \nare eliminated. It is in the Treasury Secretary's hands. He decides, \nthe President decides: Do veterans get paid, do Medicare beneficiaries \nget paid, does the military get paid? That is up to the Treasury \nSecretary and the President.\n\n  No such power should ever be placed in the hands of any Treasury \nSecretary, regardless of party affiliation. No Member of Congress who \nbelieves in our system of checks and balances can honestly advocate for \nthis idea to stand. In article I of the Constitution, Congress decides \nwhat appropriations should be paid, not the executive branch.\n  Finally, this House proposal is wrong for the country. Why? Because \nit ignores the progress we have made over the past 2 years to actually \nreduce America's deficits and debt.\n  With the adoption of the Budget Control Act in 2011 and the fiscal \nyear cliff agreement earlier this year, debt has been stabilized. \nTogether with interest savings, these actions will cut the deficit by \nabout $2.8 trillion over the next 10 years. Add in the savings for \nwinding down operations for Iraq and Afghanistan, and the total deficit \nreduction reaches almost $3.7 trillion over 10 years. These are real \nsavings. All this progress must not be ignored.\n  I agree with many of my colleagues that even more can be done to \nreduce the deficit and promote economic growth. But those actions \nshould be separate from the debt limit debate. It is a different \nsubject.\n  We are in no position to play games with the economy. It is \ncompletely irresponsible to threaten default on the debt. Since 1789, \nthis country has always honored its obligations. We paid our bills. We \nare known for that. Americans know and people around the world know \nthat America, up to this date, anyway, has always paid its bills. Even \nwhen the Capitol burned to the ground in 1814, guess what, America \nstill honored its debts. Yet I heard a Senator say a few weeks ago that \nfailing to raise the debt limit is ``no big deal.''\n\n[[Page S6930]]\n\n  No big deal.\n  I couldn't imagine when I heard those words. It is more than a big \ndeal; it is more than a huge deal. It is a catastrophic deal. It is \nsomething that is so bad it is unimaginable.\n  People have forgotten the summer of 2011. Remember August of 2011? \nPeople have forgotten what happened when Congress failed to address the \ndebt limit decisively. I remember what happened. The dysfunctional \ndebt-ceiling debate led to the first ever downgrade of America's credit \nrating--the first ever downgrade of America's credit rating. I remember \nthe stock market plunged 635 points the day after the S downgrade. I \nremember that 14-day trading period in the summer of 2011 when the Dow \nplummeted more than 2000 points, about 20 percent. Consumer confidence \nback then dropped even lower than it did in the heat of the 2008 \nfinancial crisis, and it took nearly a year to recover.\n  Worst was the impact on jobs. During the months Congress was fighting \nover the debt limit, job creation fell by nearly 50 percent.\n  Remember, Congress did still raise the debt ceiling without \ndefaulting, but the political brinkmanship did all that damage to the \neconomy. We did raise the debt, but look at what damage the \nbrinkmanship caused to our economy. We cannot let that happen again.\n  Time is running short. We need to stop playing games. This will to \nfight is getting us nowhere. Enough with the threat of default; enough \nof the schemes to prioritize payments. As President Reagan said:\n\n       The United States has a special responsibility to itself \n     and to the world to meet its obligations.\n\n  It is time we accept our responsibility. It is time for us to work \ntogether. It is time for us to get the job done.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I wish to talk a little bit about \nhealth reform.\n  Soon over 1 million Minnesotans will have the opportunity to buy \ntheir health insurance on MNsure, Minnesota's health insurance \nmarketplace. Minnesotans who buy their own insurance in the health \ninsurance marketplace, including Franni and me, will have the \nopportunity to compare plans and choose the coverage that works best \nfor their families.\n\n  Not only will MNsure make the options clearer and more accessible, \nbut the health care reform law is also making sure that Minnesotans \nfeel secure in their health care coverage. That is because insurers can \nno longer cap the amount of benefits you can get over the course of \nyour lifetime, they can't drop you if you get sick, and they cannot \ndiscriminate against you based on a preexisting condition.\n  There is a lot in the health care reform law that a lot of Americans \ndon't even know about yet. For example, I championed a couple of key \nprovisions that are improving the quality and the value of health care \ncoverage that we all rely on. I authored a provision requiring health \ninsurers to provide a good value for your premium dollars, and I helped \nto establish a national fund for health care prevention.\n  Why is this especially important right now? Because the House of \nRepresentatives passed a continuing resolution to fund the budget that \nalso defunds the health care reform law. So before we decide on that \nmeasure, I wish to make sure we remember what is in this important law.\n  First, we are requiring insurance companies to give their customers \ngood value for their premium dollars. One thing many Americans don't \nknow is that millions of Americans are getting rebates from their \nhealth insurance companies when those companies don't provide that \nvalue. I wrote the provision that does this. It has the catchy name \n``medical loss ratio,'' which is sometimes called the slightly more \ncatchy 80/20 rule. Because of my medical loss ratio provision, which is \nbased on a Minnesota State law, health insurance companies must spend \nat least 80 percent of their premiums on actual health care--not on \nadministrative costs, not on marketing, not on profits, not on CEO \nsalaries. If insurance companies don't meet the 80 percent for \nindividual and small group markets or the 85 percent for large group \npolicies, then the insurance company has to rebate the difference.\n  The fact is my provision is working. Last year, nearly 13 million \nAmericans benefited from checks from their insurers, and this year \nabout 8\\1/2\\ million Americans benefited from rebates that were sent \nout in July of this year. That is a good thing--fewer people getting \nrebates. This year is a good thing because that means insurers were \nsaving you money on the front end instead of rebating you the money on \nthe back end.\n  That is part of why health care costs have risen in the last 3 years \nat a slower rate than at any time in the last 50 years. Is that \nentirely due to the Affordable Care Act? No. But in contrast with what \nis being put out here and there, we are not seeing the cost of health \ncare spike. In fact, the opposite is true.\n  I will say it again: Health care costs have gone up less--have risen \nat a slower rate--in the last 3 years than at any other time in the \nlast 50 years. The bottom line is that my provision is making insurance \ncompanies more efficient at helping keep health care costs in check for \npeople, and I am very proud of that.\n  People also don't know how much we did to improve access to \npreventive health care in health care reform. Anyone who has ever \ngotten a flu shot knows an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of \ncure. Along with former Republican Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana, I \nfought to get the National Diabetes Prevention Program included in the \nhealth care reform law, and it exemplifies the benefit of this kind of \nreform to our health care system.\n  This program, which was piloted in St. Paul, MN, by the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, involves structured nutrition classes \nand exercise at community-based organizations such as the YMCA. It has \nbeen shown to reduce the likelihood that someone with prediabetes will \nbe diagnosed with full-blown type 2 diabetes by nearly 60 percent. That \nis pretty good.\n  The program doesn't just make people healthier, it also saves \neveryone money. The Diabetes Prevention Program costs about $400 per \nparticipant, as compared to treating type 2 diabetes which costs more \nthan $7,000 every single year. That is why United Health, the largest \nprivate insurer in the country--that also happens to be headquartered \nin Minnesota--is already providing the program to its beneficiaries. In \nfact, the CEO of United Health told me that for every $1 they invest in \nthe Diabetes Prevention Program, they save $4 on health care costs \nlater on.\n  This homegrown program is funded out of the Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund, which is another program in the health care reform law \nthat is designed to invest in evidence-based health care prevention in \ncommunities across the country. In Minnesota, the Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund has supported tobacco cessation programs, it has helped to \nprevent infectious diseases, and it has expanded our desperately needed \nprimary care workforce. Preventing disease while saving money--\npreventing disease while saving money--is smart reform.\n  We did a lot of other things in the health care law too. I worked \nwith several of my colleagues to develop a value index which will \nchange the way Medicare pays physicians to take into account the \nquality of the care the doctor provides--reward quality instead of \nquantity.\n  My home State of Minnesota is the leader in delivering high-value \nhealth care at a relatively low cost. Yet, traditionally, we have been \nwoefully underreimbursed for it. For example, Texas gets reimbursed \nalmost 50 percent more, on average, per Medicare patient than \nMinnesota.\n  This isn't about pitting Minnesota against Texas or Florida. It is \nabout rewarding those States to become more like Minnesota. Imagine if \nwe brought Medicare expenditures down by 30 percent around the country. \nIt would bring enormous benefits not just to Minnesota but across the \ncountry because it will bring down the cost of health care delivery \nnationwide.\n\n[[Page S6931]]\n\n  I am working very hard to make sure health care reform works for \nMinnesota. The implementation of any major reform is going to be a \nchallenge, but I don't think Minnesotans or Americans want us to keep \nlooking backward. They want us to move forward and to implement the law \nas best we can. They do not want the House of Representatives to waste \nprecious time and vote to repeal the law--for the 42nd time.\n  The fact is, if the law is repealed, a lot of things Americans like \nwill be taken away from them. Americans don't want seniors' \nprescription drugs to go back up. They do not want children with \npreexisting conditions to be kicked off their health plans. Those are \njust a couple of things that would happen if the law were repealed.\n  Last year, more than 54,000 seniors in Minnesota got a 50-percent \ndiscount on their covered brand-name prescription drugs when they hit \nthe doughnut hole in Medicare Part D. This discount resulted in an \naverage savings of $644 per person and a total savings of more than $34 \nmillion in Minnesota alone and we are not done. By 2020, the doughnut \nhole will be closed completely. But the closing of the doughnut hole \nwould go away if we repealed the health care reform law.\n\n  Thanks to a provision that allows young adults up to the age of 26 to \nstay on their parents' health insurance, 35,000 young people in \nMinnesota and more than 3 million young people nationally were able to \nkeep their health care coverage. Those young people would be kicked off \nof their coverage if we repealed the health care law.\n  Health care reform also ended insurance companies setting lifetime \nlimits on the amount of care an individual can receive. So if you or a \nloved one gets sick, you can never be told by your health insurer: That \nis it, no more coverage for you. Go ahead and file for bankruptcy. \nGuess what. If Congress repealed the health care reform law, that would \ngo away too.\n  I am not saying the law is perfect. But if there are problems, the \nAmerican people want us to work together to fix them, not refight old \nfights. That is what I hope to do--move forward by implementing the \nlaw, making any changes we need to make along the way.\n  Millions of Americans across the country are already experiencing the \nbenefits of this law. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the \nimplementation of the important provisions I have outlined.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is currently considering H.J. Res. \n59, the continuing budget resolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I listened this week to the distinguished chairwoman \nof the Appropriations Committee, Senator Mikulski, make a compelling \ncase for passing a clean, short-term continuing resolution through \nNovember 15 of this year so we can get on with the business of debating \nand passing appropriations bills.\n  We have a lot of sound and fury here signifying nothing, to quote \nShakespeare, but we ought to vote up or down on something. It is easy \nto give speeches or phony filibusters or whatever and say: Look what we \nare accomplishing. No. It is not accomplishing anything.\n  I agree with everything the chairwoman has said, particularly about \nthe bipartisan way the committee has written and reported bills this \nyear. Any one of those bills could be debated and voted on today. Vote \nyes, vote no--but vote. Conference them with the House, if they pass, \nand send them to the President.\n  Actually, there is some precedent for doing that--a precedent of over \n200 years doing it that way.\n  Instead, we are repeating this all-too-familiar drama where we are \nagain in a high-stakes stalemate over simply keeping the Federal \nGovernment functioning. What was once the regular business of Congress \nhas again been replaced by political theater and another artificial \nmade-in-Congress crisis that threatens the economy and, in ways large \nand small, threatens every single family in America.\n  Don't come on this floor and say you stand for family values when you \nare willing to destroy retirement plans of families, savings for their \nchildren to go to college, and possibly their jobs. Once again, \ngrandstanding prevails over common sense, comity, and cooperation--\nthree values that are vital to the effective functioning of a \nrepresentative government.\n  Those who travel around our States--and I do all the time--and listen \nto our constituents, know the costs of a government shutdown and the \ndevastating effects of sequestration.\n  Vermont is not unique in having fewer children in Head Start \nprograms, medical researchers at our universities who cannot obtain \nresearch grants, seniors cut from Meals On Wheels, or young veterans \nback from Iraq or Afghanistan who can't find jobs, or families living \nin shelters or on the streets because there is no safety net housing \nassistance. But some members of the House and the Senate say we have to \ncut all of this. Is that who we have become as a country?\n  The decisions we make have real and serious consequences for our \neconomy, for our children, and for our community--ranging from St. \nJohnsbury, VT, to Houston, TX.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the \nDepartment of State and foreign operations, I want to speak briefly \nabout the consequences of shutting down the government and a full-year \ncontinuing resolution for U.S. national security. It should make every \nSenator think long and hard about the role they want the United States \nto play in an increasingly competitive and dangerous world.\n  We hear over and over again on this floor the saying, ``freedom isn't \nfree.'' Well, it is not. And the corollary to that is, neither are U.S. \nsecurity and U.S. influence.\n  That is what is at stake: U.S. leadership in the Middle East, at the \nUnited Nations, in Africa, in South and Central Asia, and in our own \nhemisphere. If the government shuts down, the impacts will be felt here \nat home and by our allies, and exploited by our adversaries.\n  It is the worst hypocrisy, because those same Senators who are toying \nwith shutting down the government want the United States to respond \nwhen war breaks out in Syria, or famine in Ethiopia, or an outbreak of \nthe Ebola virus, or a devastating earthquake in Haiti, a terrorist \nattack in Kenya, the false imprisonment of a constituent in Nicaragua, \nor the kidnapping of an American missionary in the Philippines.\n  They expect the United States to solve the problem or to rally others \nto help solve it, but they are willing to do away with paying the \nsalaries of our diplomats, or our aid workers, or our dues to the \nUnited Nations, or emergency food aid, or our support for NATO or the \nWorld Health Organization, or the myriad of other programs and \norganizations that depend on us and that serve our interests around the \nworld. They think that somehow this is going to be paid for with pixie \ndust. We are grown-ups and this is the real world. When we pull back, \nwhen we don't lead, others are only too happy to fill the vacuum.\n  A shutdown would mean that the Export-Import Bank, which provides \nfinancing to United States companies, would immediately stop processing \nnew applications, and would lose $2 to $4 billion in monthly income for \nU.S. exporters, jeopardizing approximately 30,000 American jobs, \nreducing deposits to the U.S. Treasury by $15 to $20 million per month \nas a result of fees that go uncollected by the Bank.\n  The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, that provides financing \nand insurance to American companies that invest overseas, would lose \nits authority to function. No longer could it make disbursements, it \nwould bring to a screeching halt the activities of hundreds of U.S. \nbusinesses that rely on OPIC financing.\n  The State, Foreign Operations bill that Senator Lindsey Graham and I \nwrote that was reported by the Appropriations Committee on July 25 by a \nlopsided bipartisan vote of 23-7, protects U.S. national security \ninterests and responds to compelling humanitarian needs. Americans \nrecognize that we have a moral responsibility as the wealthiest, most \npowerful nation on earth. This is who we are.\n\n[[Page S6932]]\n\n  Senator Graham's and my bill includes $8.5 billion for global health \nprograms. A full-year continuing resolution means $389 million less to \ncombat HIV/AIDS and other preventable diseases like malaria, \ntuberculosis, and pneumonia, and malnutrition. None of us have children \nor grandchildren that have to worry about these illnesses, but with the \nrelatively small amounts that we spend we can save the lives of \ncountless children in other countries.\n  A full year continuing resolution would mean tens of thousands of \nadditional deaths from these diseases. It means tens of thousands of \nadditional children orphaned by AIDS. It means millions fewer life-\nsaving immunizations for children resulting in tens of thousands of \npreventable deaths.\n  For pennies we can vaccinate millions of children around the world. \nAre we going to say, instead, that we can't do that because we have a \npolitical point to make? We are grown ups. We are not sound-bite \naficionados. We should be legislators.\n  The Senate bill includes $2.5 billion, which is $115 million above a \nfull year continuing resolution, for programs in the poorest countries. \nThese have bipartisan support, with Republicans and Democrats, \nsupporting basic and higher education, food security, energy, and water \nand sanitation programs.\n  If you don't agree that we have a moral responsibility, then let's \njust be pragmatic about our own security. Because if we don't do this, \nthe alternative to development and opportunity is poverty, religious \nextremism, transnational crime, and violent insurgencies. It is a \ngrowing reality across the globe, from Somalia to Mexico, and it \nthreatens our economy, our security, and the security of our allies.\n  A government shutdown is a complete failure of our responsibility as \nlegislators. We are sent here to make decisions--not slogans--to make \ngovernment work for the American people and for the good of the Nation, \nincluding our national security and our interests around the globe.\n  Over and over again there are those who want to give speeches, but \nthey don't want to make hard choices. They were elected to serve, yet \nthey make a career of blaming the government.\n  Funding the government by continuing resolution is irresponsible and \nit is dangerous. It diminishes our standing in the world. It erodes our \nleadership. It is unworthy of the Congress. It is a betrayal of the \npeople who sent us here.\n  Let's have, if not the courage, at least the honesty to bring up the \nappropriations bills and vote on them. Vote yes or vote no. Stand up \nand be counted. Stop hiding behind the delaying tactics and partisan \nsloganeering that have become such a tiresome refrain around here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am reminded, when I hear the \ndistinguished President pro tempore of the Senate talk, why the people \nof Vermont so love him.\n  Here is a man who has set all kinds of records in Vermont: the first \nDemocrat elected, and on and on, with all the many accolades that he \nhas. I have always admired and appreciated him. Each day that goes by, \nI understand better than I did the last why the people of Vermont \nrevere this good man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/26/senate-section/article/S6932-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6932-S6933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HELIUM STEWARDSHIP ACT OF 2013\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask the Chair to lay before the Senate a \nmessage from the House with respect to H.R. 527.\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the House of Representatives:\n  Resolved, That the House agreed to the amendment of the Senate to the \nbill (H.R. 527) entitled ``An Act to amend the Helium Act to complete \nthe privatization of the Federal helium reserve in a competitive market \nfashion that ensures stability in the helium markets while protecting \nthe interests of American taxpayers, and for other purposes,'' with an \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the Senate concur in the House \namendment to the Senate amendment; and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, we know that in Washington, DC, it is \nalmost as if there is an inexhaustible capacity to manufacture false \ncrises. I am pleased to say that with today's vote Congress avoided a \nreal crisis for scores of American manufacturing and technology \ncompanies employing millions of American workers. That is because \nwithout the legislation that the Senate just passed, those workers and \ncompanies would no longer have been able to get access to helium, which \nis a critical industrial gas without which these companies cannot \noperate.\n  In addition to avoiding an immediate crisis for these businesses and \nworkers, the bipartisan legislation that passed the House of \nRepresentatives yesterday and the Senate today can be something of a \nmodel for how the Congress can act on must pass bills. Senator \nMurkowski and I have worked for many months on this legislation in the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee to achieve a number of goals \nthat members on both sides of the aisle support.\n  First, our bipartisan legislation gets the Federal Government out of \nthe helium business permanently--something that should have been done \nlong ago. This bill also addresses the need to ensure helium supplies \nin the short term.\n  It does this by requiring the Federal Government to shift from \nselling helium at a government-set price to selling helium at a market-\nbased priced. The bill does this over a 5-year period so that there is \nno panic, no sudden changes in supply, and American businesses can stop \nworrying about whether the helium supply truck is going to show up next \nmonth. The bill phases out commercial sales over the next 7 or 8 years \nand then gets the Federal Government out of the helium business \nentirely within 8 years by selling off the helium reserve. With prices \nfor helium now reflecting their real value in the market place, the \nprivate sector will have the incentives it needs to invest in new \nhelium supplies to replace the Federal reserve.\n  Second, our bipartisan bill ends the Federal helium program in a way \nthat is not only fully paid for but would actually lower the deficit by \n$90 million. I particularly want to point out the contributions of two \nof the members of our committee, Senators Risch and Flake who were \ninstrumental in ensuring that while the helium program gets phased out \nsome of the savings for taxpayers should go to contribute to deficit \nreduction. So I wanted to point out the Senators' role in shaping the \nlegislation to ensure a significant contribution to deficit reduction.\n  Contributing to deficit reduction, getting a better deal for \ntaxpayers by transitioning helium sales to market rates and completely \nending a Federal program that has gone far longer than it should have \nare priorities that all senators can support. And today's vote reflects \nthat.\n  But the benefits of this legislation are not limited to helium users \nand taxpayers. Our bipartisan legislation also provides one-year of \nfunding for the Secure Rural School program that expired earlier this \nyear. This program provides funding for schools, roads and law \nenforcement in hundreds of rural counties in 41 States where there are \nnational forests.\n  The expiration of the Secure Rural Schools Program left rural America \nout in the cold. The program needed to be extended for a year while the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee works on a longer term \napproach to meet the needs of forest dependent communities around the \ncountry.\n  This is a more than 100-year-old commitment that the Federal \nGovernment made to these counties when the national forests were \ncreated and will have to be met one way or another. Our bill pays for a \nshort-term extension of this program without raising taxes or \nincreasing the debt.\n  The bill before the Senate also includes a public-private program to \nhelp address the needs of one of our national treasures--America's \nNational Parks. The bill creates a matching fund to leverage a $50 \nmillion federal investment that must be matched dollar for dollar with \nnon-Federal funding.\n  The Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing earlier \nthis year on the multi-billion funding backlog that our national parks \nare facing.\n\n[[Page S6933]]\n\nSenator Coburn in particular has been a leader in pointing out the need \nto address this funding shortfall. The legislation that the Senate \npassed today makes a down payment toward reducing that backlog and does \nit in a way that brings private resources to the table.\n  With legislation that passed today, the Senate and House have shown \nhow they can act to accomplish a number of important goals on a \nbipartisan basis. The bill completely ends a Federal Government program \nthat has outlived its useful life; it ensures a fair return for \ntaxpayer and meets the needs of helium users; it contributes $90 \nmillion to the Treasury for debt reduction; and it fulfills the Federal \ngovernment's obligations to rural America all without raising taxes or \nincreasing the debt.\n  I also want to recognize the important contributions of the House \nNatural Resources Committee and Chairman Doc Hastings in shaping the \nlegislation. The final bill was truly a bipartisan and bicameral \neffort. That is the way the legislative process is supposed to work.\n  I am pleased that the Senate and House have been able to find a way \nto achieve all these important goals in one bipartisan, bicameral bill \nand I hope as the Congress considers other must-pass bills to keep the \ngovernment open and to raise the debt ceiling, members can work \ntogether in the same type of cooperative bipartisan way, that Senator \nMurkowski and I and the other members of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee have done in passing the helium legislation.\n  Mr. REID. This is a very important piece of legislation. I wish we \ncould do a lot more like this. This is the Helium Stewardship Act of \n2013. It is something we have had in effect since World War II. It is \nso very, very important.\n  Today around America 750,000 people will have MRIs conducted to find \nout how sick they are or if they are hurt or sick. Without this bill \npassing, the big magnets they have in these machines, which are cooled \nonly by one thing--helium--and the people who depend on this, the high-\ntech industry would have to go out on the spot market and buy this \nstuff, which would increase the price of health care delivery, and the \nmaking computer chips and lots of other things.\n  It is a shame it was held up for such a long time for no good reason. \nNow we have passed it, and I am very happy that everybody allowed this \nto happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/26/senate-section/article/S6933-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6933-S6956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    MAKING CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2014--Continued\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am trying to move this along as quickly \nas possible. I am going to come here a little later and ask consent \nthat we move forward very quickly.\n  Each day that we don't complete the CR is a day closer to the \ngovernment shutting down. I want no excuses from anyone about time. I \ndon't want anyone to say that the majority controls the Senate and that \nwe are doing anything to slow down this bill. I think we should move as \nquickly as we can. It is to everyone's advantage. If the House wants to \ntake a look at what we have done, let them do that and get back to us \nas quickly as possible. We have to avoid this shutdown. The American \npeople are afraid of what could happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I know we have been involved in a very \nintense debate, long speeches, time consuming, with an opportunity to \nbring up issues that are very important, particularly as we see that \nthe executive branch of government has made decisions to delay so many \naspects of health care reform. It is very appropriate at this time that \nwe delve into the shortcomings of that great change in health care that \nthe health care reform bill exemplifies.\n  I was here yesterday, hoping to enter into the colloquies that were \ngoing on at that time led by Senator Cruz and time ran out, so I am \nhere to state some points I wanted to make at that particular time. I \nwill start by quoting our second President, John Adams:\n\n       Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, \n     our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot \n     alter the state of facts and evidence.\n\n  The rhetoric surrounding this vote and the underlying issue has \nbecome all too hysterical. I would like us all to step back a little \nbit from the hysteria and focus on the facts.\n  We have all taken to calling this legislation ObamaCare. Sometimes \neven the President does. For some people, attaching the President's \nname to this issue prevents people from paying attention to the facts. \nBut personalizing this issue should not deter us from looking at those \nfacts.\n  I am not going to talk about shutting down the Government. So much \ntime and effort is being devoted to discussing a government shutdown \nthat people are not paying attention to the facts that we ought to be \nlooking at. Instead, I would like to set aside the hyperbolic rhetoric \nfor a few minutes and focus on those facts. Let's talk about the real-\nworld effects of this Affordable Care Act.\n  I will start with a few comments directly from my constituents in \nIowa. My colleagues yesterday referred to constituents in their \nrespective States. I am only going to refer to three constituent \nletters.\n  The first one:\n\n       I just want to share with you another downside caused by \n     the Affordable Care Act. Besides teaching for my School \n     District I also work as an adjunct instructor for various \n     community colleges. Currently I am scheduled to teach four \n     online classes at a community college in the summer. I just \n     received notice that because of the Affordable Care Act I am \n     only allowed to teach two classes because more than that \n     would put me over the 75 percent load of a full-time \n     instructor. So because of ObamaCare I will lose $4,200 of \n     income this summer. It will also affect me at another school \n     I teach at during the regular school year. I know there is \n     not much you can do until the Republicans can regain control \n     of the Senate but I just wanted you to be aware of another \n     example of our current administration's lack of foresight of \n     the impact of this law on the average hard-working American.\n\n  The second letter:\n\n       As superintendent of schools, I would like to express to \n     you the impact of the Affordable Care Act on our local \n     schools. The increase in cost, due directly to the Affordable \n     Care Act will be approximately $180,000 to offer single \n     health insurance to our non-certified staff. We are a \n     combined school district of 750 students. The affected staff \n     members are essentially, part-time, hourly employees who work \n     6.5 hours each day, 180 days per year. The only other option \n     is to reduce hours for employees working directly with our \n     highest need students.\n       Additionally, we are planning on being required to pay an \n     additional $17,500 in additional fees and taxes associated \n     with the Affordable Care Act in the first year.\n       Schools in Iowa can't pass that increase cost on to \n     consumers, like private industry. We are budget restricted, \n     so any increase in employee cost means an equal dollar amount \n     reduction in staff, classroom materials/supplies, curriculum \n     materials, field trips, all areas that strike pretty close to \n     the child.\n       This cost increase associated with the Affordable Care Act \n     will most definitely result in reduced educational \n     opportunities and increased class size.\n\n  One final letter:\n\n       I am a para-educator. I am writing in regards to President \n     Obama's healthcare initiative.\n       I've been told by my employer that next year my hours will \n     be cut from full time to 29 hours a week because if I work \n     more than 30 hours a week, they will be required by the new \n     healthcare plan to provide me with insurance.\n       This bothers me a great deal for a number of reasons: it \n     causes stress, instability, and disruption to the special \n     needs students I work with, I get a smaller paycheck, and \n     it's very unfair. In addition, I'm bothered by the lack of \n     foresight that went into making this law. It seems grossly \n     unfair to me. I do my job well, I'm committed and invested in \n     it, and I want to work, but am now being told that I can't \n     work as much because of a law I didn't ask for and that won't \n     benefit me. I'm sure my employer is not the only one that is \n     cutting hours because of the insurance requirement. It seems \n     that the people that this law was intended to help are being \n     hurt instead.\n       Please consider any actions you can to stop this law.\n\n  My constituents are feeling the impact of this law. This is real. It \nis not some made-up political stunt. It is happening all over this \ngreat country of ours.\n  Let's start with the grocery store chain, Trader Joe's.\n  After extending health care coverage to many of its part-time \nemployees for years, Trader Joe's has told workers who log fewer than \n30 hours a week that they will need to find insurance on the exchanges \nnext year.\n  Then there is Five Guys, the national restaurant chain that started \nhere in Washington, DC. The prices of burgers and hot dogs are going to \nrise to cover\n\n[[Page S6934]]\n\nthe President's mandated insurance coverage.\n  Earlier this year, the medical device manufacturer Smith and Nephew \nannounced they were laying off 100 employees. They cited a new Medical \nDevice Tax, a provision of the Affordable Care Act, as the primary \ncause.\n  SeaWorld is reducing hours for thousands of part-time workers, a move \nthat would allow the theme-park owner to avoid offering those employees \nmedical insurance under the Federal Government's health-care overhaul. \nThe company operates 11 theme parks across the United States and has \nabout 22,000 employees--nearly 18,000 of whom are part-time or seasonal \nworkers.\n  It has more than 4,000 part-time and seasonal workers in Central \nFlorida. Under a new corporate policy, SeaWorld will schedule part-time \nworkers for no more than 28 hours a week, down from a previous limit of \n32 hours a week. The new cap is expected to go into effect by November.\n  With the reduced hours, those employees would not be classified as \nfull-time workers under the Affordable Care Act.\n  Much has been said on the floor by different Members about the \nCleveland Clinic. The Cleveland Clinic said it would cut jobs and slash \nfive to six percent of its $6 billion annual budget to prepare for \nhealth reform.\n  The clinic is Cleveland's largest employer and the second largest in \nOhio after Wal-Mart.\n  It is the largest provider in Ohio of Medicaid health coverage for \nthe poor, the program that will expand to cover uninsured Americans \nunder the Affordable Care Act. The cuts are necessitated by the lower \nreimbursement they are anticipating.\n  There is no doubt; the Affordable Care Act is affecting the way \nbusiness look at their employees.\n  As one recent report notes, U.S. businesses are hiring at a robust \nrate. The only problem is that three out of four of the nearly 1 \nmillion hires this year are part-time and many of the jobs are low-\npaid.\n  Faltering economic growth at home and abroad and concern that the \nAffordable Care Act will drive up business costs are behind the \nwariness about taking on full-time staff, executives at staffing and \npayroll firms say.\n  Employers say part-timers offer them flexibility. If the economy \npicks up, they can quickly offer full-time work. If orders dry up, they \nknow costs are under control. It also helps them to curb costs they \nmight face under the Affordable Care Act.\n  It is not just employers. Let's look at the way major unions view the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  Let me quote from a letter from the heads of the Teamsters, Food and \nCommercial Workers, and UNITE-HERE. This letter was addressed to \nRepresentative Pelosi and Senator Reid.\n\n       When you and the President sought our support for the \n     Affordable Care Act (ACA), you pledged that if we liked the \n     health plans we have now, we could keep them. Sadly, that \n     promise is under threat.\n       Right now, unless you and the Obama Administration enact an \n     equitable fix, the ACA will shatter not only our hard-earned \n     health benefits, but destroy the foundation of the 40 hour \n     work week that is the backbone of the American middle class.\n       Like millions of other Americans, our members are front-\n     line workers in the American economy. We have been strong \n     supporters of the notion that all Americans should have \n     access to quality, affordable health care. We have also been \n     strong supporters of you. That means the President and the \n     Senator and the Congresswoman. In campaign after campaign we \n     have put boots on the ground, gone door-to-door to get out \n     the vote, run phone banks and raised money to secure this \n     vision.\n       Now this vision has come back to haunt us.\n       Time is running out: Congress wrote this law; we voted for \n     you. We have a problem; you need to fix it. The unintended \n     consequences of the ACA are severe. Perverse incentives are \n     already creating nightmare scenarios.\n       On behalf of the millions of working men and women we \n     represent and the families they support, we can no longer \n     stand silent in the face of elements of the Affordable Care \n     Act that will destroy the very health and wellbeing of our \n     members along with millions of other hardworking Americans.\n       We continue to stand behind real health care reform, but \n     the law as it stands will hurt millions of Americans \n     including the members of our respective unions. We are \n     looking to you to make sure that these changes are made.\n\n  That letter was sent to Senator Reid and Representative Pelosi to \nexplain why things very definitely need to be done to this legislation. \nThose are not people with known conservative credentials. They are \nknown for their views of being progressives, liberals, and people \nlooking out for the middle class. They find much fault with this \nAffordable Care Act, and then some wonder why there is so much concern \nbeing expressed by Members of the Senate about why this should be \ndefunded. All of this adds up to what is being said by the people who \nsupported the passage of the health care reform act, which is \nconstituents, employers, and even unions.\n  Let's take this a step further. Let's look at the economic \nresearchers. In March the Federal Reserve said the 2010 health care law \nis being cited as a reason for layoffs and slowdown in hiring.\n\n       Employers in several districts cited unknown effects of the \n     Affordable Care Act as reasons for planned layoffs and \n     reluctance to hire more staff.\n\n  Here is another one: A recent National Bureau of Economic Research \nstudy examined the Affordable Care Act's taxes and its impact on labor. \nBasically, if we want employment to go back to prerecession levels, we \nmust end the Affordable Care Act. The marginal rate increase due to the \nphaseout of premium subsidy and other implicit taxes in the Affordable \nCare Act result in a ``massive 17 percent reduction in the reward to \nworking--akin to erasing a decade of labor productivity growth without \nthe wealth effect--that would be expected to significantly depress the \namounts of labor and consumer spending in the economy even if the \nelasticity of labor supply were small (but not literally zero). The \nlarge tax increases are the primary reason why it is unlikely that the \nlabor market activity will return even near to its prerecession levels \nas long as the ACA's work disincentives remain in place.''\n  Isn't it something to have an organization as respected as this \norganization say that after all the work that went into the Affordable \nCare Act, its very existence is a disincentive to productivity and \nemployment?\n  With all of these concerns from constituents, employers, unions, and \neven the Federal Reserve, we would think that would cause people to \npause. But it is also a legitimate reason for all the discussion we \nhave had this week on what is wrong with the Affordable Care Act and \nthe defunding thereof.\n  On top of that, we keep hearing concerns about the readiness to move \nforward with the law at all.\n  In August the Government Accountability Office noted that testing of \nthe government's ``data service hub'' to support new health insurance \nmarket places was more than a month behind schedule. The report said:\n\n       Several critical tasks remain to be completed in a short \n     period of time, such as final independent testing of the \n     Hub's security controls, remediating security vulnerabilities \n     identified during testing, and obtaining the security \n     authorization decision for the Hub before opening the \n     exchanges. CMS's current schedule is to complete all of its \n     tasks by October 1, 2013, in time for the expected initial \n     open enrollment period.\n\n  It is unclear whether national health insurance plans, which were \nsupposed to give consumers choice and help drive down costs, will be \navailable next year.\n  Under the health care law, the Office of Personnel Management is \nsupposed to oversee the rates and contracts for at least two national \nplans in every State. According to news reports, the White House says \nthere will be a national health plan in at least 31 States. Now, that \nis 31 States, that is not 50 States.\n  Perhaps the most telling sign that the Affordable Care Act as enacted \nisn't working is how much the administration has rewritten the law on \nits own--a highly dubious proposition. The Congressional Research \nService recently noted that President Obama has already signed 14 laws \nthat amend, rescind, or otherwise change parts of his health care. He \nhas also taken five independent steps to delay, which he has been able \nto do on his own. So the Congress has passed or the President has \nsigned into law 14 changes. I say that again for emphasis. Again, the \nCRS report noted that President Obama--totally separate of Congress--\nhas delayed implementation of parts of the health care law five \nseparate times.\n  Congress should be focusing our efforts on creating jobs and \nimproving\n\n[[Page S6935]]\n\nthe economy. Yet the Affordable Care Act is having the opposite effect. \nOur economy cannot handle any more job-killing regulations from \nWashington. It has been 4 years since the end of the recession. For a \nlot of Americans, it is as if the recession never ended.\n  While the unemployment rate now stands at 7.3 percent, which is bad \nenough, that only tells half the story. The fact is that this economy \nis so sluggish that only 63.2 percent of working-age Americans remain \nin the workforce. The labor force participation rate is at its lowest \nin 35 years. The unemployment rate is dropping primarily because people \nhave simply given up finding work.\n  What we should be doing is supporting policies that lead to economic \ngrowth and job creation. We should be supporting things like the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. The initial permit for this job-creating energy \nproject was submitted over 5 years ago. Despite overwhelming support in \nthe Congress for the pipeline, the President has delayed the project \nfor years to appease the extreme left. We have similar job-killing \nregulations coming out of the Environmental Protection Agency. We \nshould be working to create an efficient progrowth Tax Code, one that \nrewards success rather than hinders it. We should be focusing on our \nlong-term fiscal problems. We all know we are on an unsustainable path. \nYet the longer we delay and kick the can down the road, the harder the \njob will become. All of the tax, health care, and fiscal uncertainty is \nacting like a headwind against our economy.\n  So I will support funding our government and avoiding a shutdown. I \nwill support any effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. I will \nsupport any effort to defund the same act. I will support any effort to \ndelay implementation of that same act. I will support the Vitter \namendment and any other amendment that puts 8,000 executive branch \nemployees in the exchange. As I have said again and again, the people \nresponsible for this law should have the opportunity to experience it \njust as the American people will. Perhaps then they, including this \nSenator, will then finally pay attention to the facts surrounding the \nimplementation of the Affordable Care Act. I do so not out of personal \nanimus for the President. I do so not to tear down the so-called \nsignature achievement of the administration. I do so because I am \nlooking at the facts. I do so because I am looking at what is happening \nin health care and with our economy.\n  Let's not stop thinking simply because someone uses the word \n``ObamaCare.'' Let's not talk about shutting down the government. Let's \nturn down the hysteria and look at what is really happening with the \nhealth care and its impact upon the economy.\n  Just this week a Member of the Senate described our efforts to stop \nObamaCare as ``insanity.'' I disagree. A vote to barrel ahead as though \neverything is just fine strikes me as far closer to the definition of \n``insanity.'' A reasonable person can and should conclude that we \nshould stop moving forward on ObamaCare, and that is how I will be \nvoting this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I see Senator Sessions is on the floor. \nIt is my understanding Senator Grassley used some Democratic time that \nwas yielded to him for the beginning of his speech, and I ask that the \nParliamentarian recapture that time for the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If Senator Sessions is prepared to speak now, I will \nwait.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Durbin and appreciate \nhis leadership and courtesy.\n  I want to speak for a few moments about the impact of the President's \nhealth care law, the Affordable Care Act. Although the law hasn't been \nfully implemented yet, this massive overhaul--Federal takeover, \nreally--of the health care system is already proving to be anything but \naffordable.\n  My team on the Budget Committee, where I am the ranking member, did \nsome research on this issue, and we want to know what the real costs \nwould be and how it will play out in the end. So what I will share with \neveryone now are some very important facts that all of us need to know.\n  The President has repeatedly said we have a health-spending problem, \nbut what he hasn't said is that this law will make that problem worse.\n  Last week actuaries from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices--those are our top Federal health care people, CMS--issued a \nreport, and its findings were unequivocal. This law will lead to higher \nhealth care costs. By 2022 the law is projected to increase cumulative \nhealth spending by $621 billion. That is the report from CMS. They \nbasically work for the President of the United States.\n  Next year growth in the private health insurance premiums--the \nincreases in our own private insurance premiums--is expected to \naccelerate to 6 percent from 3.2 percent this year, 2013. So the \nincrease in premiums, CMS projects, will go up from 3.2 percent to 6 \npercent.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, CBO--they work for us here in the \nCongress--also released its annual long-term budget outlook last week. \nIt concluded, 1, that Federal health care spending will ``grow \nconsiderably in 2014 because of changes made by the Affordable Care Act \n. . .'' They says the health care law is by far the single biggest \nfactor driving the growth in Federal health care spending over the next \ndecade--accounting for 53 percent of projected growth.\n  So our own government agencies are finding--which most Americans \nknew, despite promises to the contrary that were repeatedly made when \nit passed on Christmas Eve after it was rammed through this Senate--\nthat this bill can't be done without increased costs, and government \nagencies are making that statement today. It is not my opinion, it is \nwhat our own agencies say.\n  Democrats have repeatedly complained that the law would bend the cost \ncurve. The President said it would slow the growth of health care costs \nfor our families, our businesses, and our government. That is what he \npromised. He said it would ``slow the growth of health care costs for \nour families, our businesses, and our government.'' Democrats--pushing \nthe law, against the wishes of the American people, in 2009--claimed \nthe law would not add to our deficit and would improve our Federal \nbalance sheet, our budget situation. The President promised he would \nnot sign a plan that ``adds one dime to our deficits now or any time in \nthe future.'' That is an unequivocal promise. It sort of reminds me of \nthe promise ``read my lips, no new taxes.'' Surely a colossal \nmisrepresentation of the debt impact of a gargantuan government \ntakeover of health care is a serious matter.\n  The nonpartisan actuaries at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices, CMS, project that this law will increase health care spending \nas a share of our total economy. In other words, the law bends the cost \ncurve in the wrong direction. It bends it alright, but in the wrong \ndirection.\n\n  We need to understand how the Democrats were able to assert that \ntheir plan was financially sound, which they insisted on repeatedly, as \nwe went through weeks of debate on this matter. This is how. This is \nvery important, I say to my colleagues. Senators do not understand this \nfully and Congressmen do not understand this, and I don't think the \nAmerican people fully understand it. The Democrats' claims about the \nfiscal impact of the health care law were based on monumental \naccounting maneuvers and multiple other gimmicks.\n  Before the law passed, the Congressional Budget Office warned that \nthe law would ``maintain and put into effect a number of policies that \nmight be difficult to sustain over a long period of time.''\n  That is careful language from our accountants at the Congressional \nBudget Office. I am sure they were pressured not to say that. At that \ntime, both Houses of Congress were controlled by our Democratic \ncolleagues, with 60 votes in the Senate. They warned us that the law \nwould ``maintain and put into effect a number of policies that might be \ndifficult to sustain over a long period of time.'' Isn't that true.\n  CBO and the CMS Actuary also highlighted that hundreds of billions of \ndollars in Medicare savings were double counted.\n\n[[Page S6936]]\n\n  We need to understand this. This is a key point we need to \nunderstand. I made an inquiry to them. I made an inquiry to them late \nin December 2009. I got the letter from them the night before the \nChristmas Eve vote in the Senate to pass ObamaCare--on December 23--and \nI wanted and insisted that we get a clear answer on the question \ninvolving approximately $500 billion in Medicare savings, which I \ncontended was double counted.\n  They were claiming they were going to use this money to strengthen \nMedicare and they were also claiming the money was available to fund \nObamaCare. Can we do both with the same money? If we are confused about \nthat issue, if we can't understand that issue, now we can begin to \nunderstand why this country is in such disastrous financial shape.\n  This is what the CBO responded by saying on the night of December 23:\n\n       The key point is that savings to the HI trust fund--\n\n  that is Medicare--\n\n     under PPACA--\n\n  that is the Affordable Care Act--\n\n     would be received by the government only once, so that they \n     cannot be set aside for future Medicare spending and, at the \n     same time, pay for current spending on other parts of the \n     legislation or on other programs.''\n\n  How simple is that?\n  They go on:\n\n       To describe the full amount of HI trust fund savings as \n     both improving the government's ability to pay future \n     Medicare benefits and financing new spending outside of \n     Medicare would essentially double-count a large share of \n     those savings and thus overstate the improvement in the \n     government's fiscal position.\n\n  Right before the vote, they said, in effect, you are double-counting \nthis money and you can't use the money simultaneously to benefit \nMedicare, which is where the money is, as well as use the money to fund \nObamaCare, or a new health care plan, or any other policy. This is so \nbasic.\n  The next spring, in March of 2010, CBO estimated that without this \ndouble counting, the health care law increases the deficit over the \nfirst 10 years and the subsequent decade. Under the conventions of \naccounting, it would appear we could have this health care plan, at \nleast for 10 years, and it would appear that it reduces the Federal \ndeficit, but that is because of the conventions of a unified budget \naccounting. The money that comes into Medicare--the money that is saved \nby cutting Medicare providers--is Medicare money. It is not the \nTreasury's money to spend on a new health care program. It is \nMedicare's money.\n  So because it looks as though in the short run we have an advantage, \nthey were able to count it and say, Well, money coming in is equal to \nthe money going out, but they forget that all of the people paying into \nMedicare off their FICA and off their checks each week are going to \ndraw that out in the long run from this trust fund. Everybody who is \npaying in is going to draw out all of that money, and more, because it \nis unsound actuarially.\n  If my colleagues want to see other gimmicks, look at the CLASS Act \nProgram which they counted on to produce $70 billion in premium revenue \nover its first ten 10 years as enrollees began paying premiums into the \nsystem. The program was so actuarially unsound that the Secretary of \nHHS had to notify Congress, as she was required to do, that there was \n``no viable path forward'' to implement the CLASS program. With that \ndecision, and a lot of pressure from some of us in Congress, nearly 60 \npercent of the Democrats claimed deficit reduction in the first 10 \nyears disappeared. We had to eliminate that. So that amounted to 60 \npercent of the so-called surplus that would be produced by the \nlegislation. Those savings from the CLASS program were not real and \nshould never have been counted in the first place.\n  The Wall Street Journal called the CLASS Program ``a special act of \nfiscal corruption.'' One of our Democratic Members--actually, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee at the time, Kent Conrad--said it was \na Ponzi scheme. In the first 10 years, the numbers looked good, but \nover a period of time the money drawn out was going to be far greater \nthan ever was put in. They claimed to produce $70 billion in assets for \nAmerica when over the lifetime of the program it was a devastating, \nunsound program that if a private insurance company had tried to offer \nit and promote it in that fashion, I am sure someone would have gone to \njail. Absolutely unsound financially.\n  Eventually, Congress had no choice but to repeal the CLASS Act, this \nbankrupt entitlement program, as part of the fiscal cliff bill at the \nend of last year. But the case of the CLASS program is but a sign of \nwhat is to come under the rest of the health care law.\n  While the American people always knew this health care bill would \nnever pay for itself, they did not fully understand how the President \nand his supporters could insist otherwise. I wish I had been able to \nbetter explain at the time. I tried, but at the time I was not \nsuccessful in penetrating the media and the administration's view that \nthe bill would create a surplus for America. Maybe we could have \nstopped the legislation from being rammed through Congress if we had \nbeen more effective on that point. But the facts are crystal clear now.\n  A report issued by the Government Accountability Office--that is our \nindependent GAO--in February of this year, at my request, revealed that \nunder a realistic set of assumptions, the health care law is projected \nto increase the Federal deficit by 0.7 of the entire GDP over the next \n75 years, an amount that is equivalent to $6.2 trillion in today's \ndollars. So it would add $6.2 trillion in unfunded liabilities to the \nUnited States of America over the lifetime of the program, over the \nnext 75 years. This estimate excludes debt service or interest on the \ndebt caused by the shortfall.\n  This is an enormous sum, $6.2 trillion. Let's put it into context. We \nall know Social Security is financially unsound. We are in a desperate \neffort now to figure out ways to find the money to make Social Security \nsound so retirees can know they are going to get their benefits in the \nfuture. We all know it must be fixed. At the time this health care law \nwas enacted, the 75-year unfunded liability for Social Security was \n$7.7 trillion. In passing this bill, we add almost as much unfunded \nliabilities over the next 75 years to the U.S. Government as Social \nSecurity. Instead of putting Social Security on a sound path, this bill \nadded another $6.2 trillion in unfunded liabilities to our debt that is \nalmost as large as Social Security's liabilities.\n  It is a monumental problem we have created for ourselves. We have dug \nthe hole deeper financially, which is the worst thing we could be \ndoing. The first thing we should do is stop digging.\n  This finding seems to strike a nerve with some supporters of the law, \nso much so that they tried to attack me and argue with the GAO, but \nattacking the messenger doesn't change the facts. The GAO report is \ncrucial. It clearly answers the question. It sank any validity to the \nPresident's claim that his plan would not ``add one dime to our \ndeficits now or at any time in the future, period.''\n  Health care economist Christopher Conover at Duke University \nexplained that the Government Accountability Office's report did not \n``cook the books'' or use ``wacky assumptions.'' According to Professor \nConover, GAO's assumptions in this more plausible scenario are a \n``carbon copy of those used by the Congressional Budget Office, the \nMedicare trustees, the Treasury Department, and the Medicare Actuary in \ntheir own independently derived long-term budget projections.''\n  Independently derived long-term budget projections are the techniques \nthat were used in the GAO report, and they found $6 trillion added to \nour debt.\n  So despite what we were told by the proponents of this law, the truth \nis that the President's health care law will further increase the cost \nof health care, it will add to our already unsustainable deficits and \ndebt, and, if fully implemented, would forever alter the relationships \nnot only between patients and their doctors but between the American \npeople and their government. Period.\n  It has been 3\\1/2\\ years since its passage, and every day we learn \nmore about how the law is harming Americans. Here are some of the \nimportant facts: Jobs. Part-time is the new normal. Seventy-seven \npercent of the jobs that have been created over the last year have been \npart-time.\n  The Investor's Business Daily has kept a running list of employers \nwho\n\n[[Page S6937]]\n\nare cutting hours and staff levels because of ObamaCare. Currently, the \nIBD tally of businesses, including large firms, affected by ObamaCare \nis 313. This list includes the University of Alabama, which announced \nit was capping the number of hours students could work for the \nuniversity because of ObamaCare.\n  Remember, I just indicated 77 percent of the jobs created this year, \nsince January--and it hasn't been that large a number--are part-time \njobs, and every economist tells us without any doubt that the \nPresident's health care law is driving those decisions by businesses. \nIt is unprecedented. We have never seen this kind of trend.\n  The president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Joseph \nHansen, an original supporter of the law, recently said that ObamaCare \nwould have a ``tremendous impact as workers have their hours reduced \nand their incomes reduced.''\n  ObamaCare penalizes hard work.\n  According to a new paper by Casey Mulligan, an economics professor at \nthe University of Chicago--a premier economics department--the marginal \ntax hikes included in ObamaCare add up to a 17-percent reduction in the \nreward for working for median income families. This penalty American \nworkers will take will essentially, he says, erase all gains in labor \nproductivity made over the last decade.\n  This health care law has also led to the loss of health insurance \ncoverage.\n  On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the largest \nsecurity guard provider in the United States--Securitas--will stop \noffering health insurance because of ObamaCare.\n  We hear that over and over again. This report is in addition to other \nmajor companies that employ millions of Americans. These companies \ninclude Darden Restaurants--owner of Olive Garden and Red Lobster--Home \nDepot, and Trader Joe's.\n  Small businesses and their workers will be penalized.\n  Democratic colleagues have claimed that most firms are not subject to \nObamaCare tax penalties because they have less than 50 workers and are \ntherefore not subject to the employer mandate penalty. But it is not an \naccurate statement. ObamaCare includes a nondeductible fee on insurance \nproviders that the CBO has warned will get passed back to small \nbusiness owners who pay for the health insurance of their employees. It \nis another tax on companies that provide health care to their \nemployees.\n  I recently received a letter from a small business owner in Wetumpka, \nAL, Leesa Williams of Lee's Auto Repair, to let me know she is already \nbeing subjected to this tax even though her business has only 11 \nemployees. She wrote to warn me that if the fee continues, she will be \nforced to reevaluate the offer of insurance to the small number of \npeople at her repair company.\n  Costs are increasing, premiums are rising, and millions of Americans \nwill lose the coverage they have today. Workers are having their \nhours--and their paychecks--reduced. Its countless regulations are \nstifling job creation and adding uncertainty to the already fragile \neconomy.\n  The State director of NFIB/Alabama--a small business group in \nAlabama--says that Washington is doing a ``lousy job'' of keeping small \nbusinesses informed about the law and it will do real damage to them.\n  So where will it end? When will we save ordinary Americans and the \nAmerican economy from this oncoming train wreck?\n  The administration has taken five steps already to delay the \nimplementation of important parts of this law pertaining particularly \nto powerful interest groups that are pushing for delays and changes and \nrelief. Many of them are getting it--but not John Q. Citizen. Big \nbusinesses unilaterally have been given a break from the law for at \nleast 1 year. The Administration is considering a carve-out for Big \nLabor.\n  We need to be considering the overall impact of the law on our \neconomy, on jobs, on the length of hours that Americans are working. We \nneed to consider that.\n  The President's health care law will worsen, not improve, our fiscal \noutlook. That is clear. It is hurting our economy right now. It is \nclear. It is harming millions of Americans right now, and it is growing \nthe size and scope of government in a huge leap forward.\n  Congress must permanently repeal this unworkable law and start over \nwith health care reform that will actually reduce costs and not hurt \neveryday Americans in a way that is in the classical American tradition \nof responsibility and limited government.\n  I wish through this budget and continuing resolution process we could \nhave forced a real debate on this health care law. It is absolutely \nclear that the leadership in this Senate is stonewalling and refusing \nto even acknowledge these problems, will not allow amendments or \nlegislation to be brought up and voted on that would fix this law and \nmake it better and help the American economy.\n  So this has been an effort by Senator Cruz and others, and I think \neverybody on our side is committed to engage in this and to force \nchanges because it will not be, it looks like, accepted voluntarily. \nThere is no consensus that we should even talk about it. Indeed, it is \nthe position of the majority that we will not allow a full and open \ndebate about the way to fix the problems with this law.\n  So the American people, I hope, will continue to relay their views to \nthe Members of this body, and as time goes by we are going to confront \nthis legislation. We are going to be able to force the ability of the \nAmerican people to have their voices heard in this body.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, as I have indicated for the entire week, \neach day that goes by, each hour that goes by, each minute that goes \nby, we are that much closer to a government shutdown. I have been told \nthat the House needs more time to work on this. They are saying that \nmaybe what we need is an extension of the CR.\n  The stock market, the financial community, the Business Roundtable, \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce--all of America--80 percent of the \nAmerican people, including 75 percent of Republicans, think what is \ngoing on, not taking care of the finances of this country, is \nabsolutely wrong. There is no reason to stall this.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that at 6:30 p.m. today there be 1 hour of \ndebate, with the first 40 minutes equally divided between proponents \nand opponents of the motion to invoke cloture and the last 20 minutes \nreserved for the two leaders, with my having the final 10 minutes, and \nSenator McConnell would speak before me, if he so chooses; that upon \nthe use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture on H.J. Res. 59; that if cloture is invoked, \nall postcloture time be yielded back; the pending Reid amendment No. \n1975 be withdrawn; that no other amendments be in order; that the \nmajority leader be recognized to make a motion to waive applicable \nbudget points of order; that if a motion to waive is agreed to, the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to the Reid amendment No. 1974; that \nupon disposition of the Reid amendment, the joint resolution be read a \nthird time and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the joint \nresolution, as amended, if amended; finally, that all after the first \nvote in this sequence of votes be 10-minute votes and there be 2 \nminutes equally divided between the votes.\n  I will alert everyone, if we get this agreement, it means we would \nhave up to four votes starting around 7:30 this evening. The House \nwould get the bill probably tonight or in the morning, as soon as it \ncan be processed.\n  There would be a vote on cloture on H.J. Res. 59, a motion to waive \nbudget points of order, the Mikulski-Reid amendment No. 1974, and \npassage of H.J. Res. 59, as amended, if amended.\n  That is my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, reserving the right to object, if we were \nto vote tomorrow, if we were to have these votes tomorrow, that would \nrepresent the product of waiving two separate 30-hour periods--one in \nconnection with the motion to proceed, the other in connection with the \ncloture vote on the bill.\n  The American people are paying attention to this. The American people\n\n[[Page S6938]]\n\nare watching this. A lot of them have expected this might occur Friday \nor Saturday.\n  So I ask the question, would the majority leader be willing to modify \nthe request slightly, with the same provisions in place but with the \nvotes to occur during tomorrow's session of the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the majority leader so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I appreciate my friend's request to modify \nmy unanimous consent request. But my response to that--reserving the \nright to see if I would accept that--is this: Everyone in America--\neveryone--knows what the issues are before this body.\n  The Mikulski-Reid amendment we are going to be required to vote on is \npretty simple. It says there will be nothing dealing with ObamaCare. We \nhave changed the date to November 15 from December 15, and we have \ngotten rid of the ``pay China first.'' That is it. These so-called \nanomalies--I have met with the Republican leader. Staffs have gone over \nthat--no problems with that.\n  So this is an effort to stall, and I do not know why--an effort to \nstall. It is absolutely unfortunate because, I repeat, every minute \nthat goes by is 1 minute closer to a government shutdown. Because when \nwe finish this, we then have to have the American people focus on \nwhether we are going to have a debt ceiling, whether we are going to \nagain crash the economy, as we did the last time that threat came.\n  Maybe someone thinks they can come with their great speaking ability \ntomorrow and change people's minds. Everybody in this body knows how \nthe votes are going to go. This is going back to the House of \nRepresentatives. The House of Representatives has said--they have said \npublicly and they have said privately--they are going to send something \nback to us.\n  I want to make sure, if they do that, we have time to process it. \nStalling until tomorrow means they are not going to get it until \nSunday. We would try our utmost to get it to them tonight, Friday, \nrather than sometime late Saturday or even maybe--well, we could get it \nto them sometime Saturday. They need time. Is this some kind of a \nsubterfuge to close the government, because that is what is going to \nhappen. We are not the House of Representatives. We have rules here \nthat take a while for us to get places. I understand my friend from \nUtah says that we have two 30 hours and now we are moving this more \nquickly than the rules require.\n  Madam President, what the American people see in the Senate--this new \nSenate--is everything is a big stall: Never do your work now. Wait \nuntil tomorrow. Maybe I will give this great speech that will turn the \nworld around.\n  This is senseless. How many times do we get the American people--80 \npercent of them--agreeing on anything? They think what is going on in \nthis big stall is bad for the country--and it is.\n  So I do not accept the modification. If there is an objection to \nthis, if there is an objection to my request, I will work it out with \nthe Republican leader as to what time we are going to do this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, we have been willing to compromise. The \noffer that was made by my colleague, the junior Senator from Texas \nyesterday, from the floor represented a significant compromise. \nSignificantly, I believe it was the Senator from Nevada, the majority \nleader, who objected to a unanimous consent request made yesterday by \nthe Senator from Texas to proceed with having these votes tomorrow.\n  This still represents a significant compromise offer--a compromise \noffer that consolidates, collapses two separate 30-hour periods \nrequired by the rules. This is not an unreasonable request. Moreover, I \nam not understanding what it is about having a vote tomorrow morning \ninstead of tonight that would make a difference between being able to \nget something to them tomorrow, if we pushed it out, versus Sunday.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am not going to dwell on this because I \nwant to yield to the Senator from Tennessee, but I do wish to say this. \nIt is as obvious to me--and it is as obvious to me as it is to a \nkindergarten student--they did not want a vote yesterday. The big \nspeeches we heard about how if you voted for cloture, you would vote to \nextend ObamaCare--they turned around and voted for it.\n  This is a big charade that is not getting them where they need to go. \nThey want to stop ObamaCare. They want to do everything again. They did \nnot even want a vote on cloture yesterday. Of course, they wanted to \nskip that and just go a couple days so they could talk longer.\n  People are tired of talking. They want us to get something done. The \ngovernment is near the time that it will close. As I said this morning, \na woman who works for the U.S. Park Service came to an event I had. She \nlives in Boulder City, NV. She and everybody who works there are afraid \nthey are going to lose their jobs. They know what happened last time. \nThey were laid off for 29 days and did not get paid for it.\n  So I yield to my friend from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I wonder if it would be appropriate if I \nwere to ask the Senator from Utah a question, if he would take a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. This has been a rather confusing week, I know. I do not \nthink ever in the history of the Senate have we had a 21-hour \nfilibuster and then the persons carrying out the filibuster voted for \nthe issue that they were filibustering.\n  I do not think that has happened in the history of our country. I \njust want to make sure I understand. I was just over at the House. I \ntalked to Members of leadership there. They would like to get the piece \nof legislation from the Senate over there as quickly as possible so \nthey could respond.\n  I think all of us on this side would like to see some changes to the \nCR, changes that we believe to be good policy. Over on the House side, \nwe have a majority of Republicans. I know they would like to send back \nto us some changes that I think many of us would support.\n  In talking earlier with the Senator from Texas, it is my \nunderstanding that the reason he does not want to send the bill over to \nthe House, which could possibly put in place some very good policies \nfor us here, is that he wants the American people and the outside \ngroups that the Senator has been in contact with to be able to watch us \ntomorrow.\n  I am just asking the question: Is it more important to the Senator \nfrom Texas and the Senator from Utah that the people around the country \nwatch this vote or is it more important to us that we have a good \npolicy outcome from our standpoint and actually have a body that has a \nmajority of Republicans to be able to react and send back something of \ngood policy?\n  This is confusing to me because I know the leadership there wishes to \nbe able to respond as quickly as possible. But I am understanding the \nreason we are waiting is the Senators have sent out press releases and \ne-mails and they want everybody to be able to watch. It does not seem \nto me that is in our Nation's interest, nor is it, candidly, in the \ninterests of those who want to see good policy on the conservative side \ncome out of the CR. I wondered if the Senator would respond to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Since the Senator from Tennessee has made reference to me, \nI ask unanimous consent that I might engage in a colloquy with the \nSenator from Tennessee and the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. We need a reasonable time. I would be happy to, but this is \nnot going to be another long performance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. How long do the Senators wish to engage in a \ncolloquy?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I cannot imagine it would extend beyond 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator\n\n[[Page S6939]]\n\nfrom Tennessee supporting the majority leader.\n  Mr. CORKER. I am supporting the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I know the Senator from Tennessee is learned on Senate \nprocedures. I know he must have made a misstatement when he, moments \nago, suggested that those of us who participated in the filibuster the \nother day somehow changed our position in voting for the motion to \nproceed.\n  A reason I know the Senator from Tennessee is mistaken is because \nduring the course of that filibuster, I explicitly stated I support the \nmotion to proceed. I stated that 1 week before the filibuster, \nrepeatedly. I have always stated that the vote on the motion to \nproceed, the vote on cloture to the motion to proceed was going to be \nunanimous. Indeed, I would note I offered a unanimous consent request \nduring that filibuster that we vitiate the cloture and all agree to \nproceed because everyone in this Chamber--I said I expect the vote to \nbe unanimous--everyone in this Chamber wants to proceed to this bill.\n  The Senator from Tennessee being learned in Senate procedure knows \nthat there is a big difference between that vote on Wednesday, which I \nmight note, when the vote tally was done there for Republicans, I put \nmy--not only did I vote yes early, but I put my recommendation for \nevery Republican to vote yes because, of course, we should get on the \nbill.\n  The vote tomorrow on cloture on the bill is a very different bill. I \nknow the Senator from Tennessee is quite aware of that. The vote \ntomorrow is a vote to cut off debate on the bill. So as I said during \nthe filibuster 2 days ago, as I have said for weeks, it is the vote \ntomorrow, cloture on the bill, that matters because anyone voting \ntomorrow in favor of cloture is voting in favor of granting the \nmajority leader the ability to fund ObamaCare.\n  I know my friend from Tennessee understands that. So I am sure his \nstatement suggesting that the vote on the motion to proceed meant \nanything other than what it obviously meant, I know that was a \nstatement in error.\n  Mr. CORKER. Actually, I appreciate this opportunity. What we have \nbefore us is a bill that defunds ObamaCare. It is the bill the House \nhas sent over. So the Senator is right. Tomorrow's vote is a vote to \nend debate in support of exactly what the House of Representatives has \nsent over. That is confusing to a lot of folks, but you are exactly \nright. The House has sent over here policy that I actually support; \nthat is, defunding the health care bill because of the damage it is \ncreating to our country.\n  I wish the CR number was a little number. I wish it was at 967 \ninstead of at 988. But that is exactly right. So we are going to be \ncutting off debate on a bill that the House Republicans have sent over \nto us. So the Senator is exactly right. That is an important vote. That \nis a vote in support of the House. Something in addition. Supporting \nthe House would be getting whatever we are going to do back over to \nthem so they are not jammed. But it is my understanding again, relative \nto this vote tonight happening tomorrow instead, is that my two \ncolleagues whom I respect have sent out e-mails around the world and \nturned this into a show, possibly, and, therefore, they want people \naround the world to watch maybe them and others on the Senate floor, \nand that is taking priority over getting legislation back to the House \nso they can take action before the country's government shuts down and, \nby the way, causing them possibly to put in place again some other good \npolicy.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I appreciate the comments of my friend from Tennessee. I \nwould note that he suggested this is confusing. I guess I do not think \nit is all that confusing. The Senator from Tennessee says a vote in \nfavor of cloture is a vote in favor of the House bill and in favor of \ndefunding ObamaCare. If that is the case, then the question I would \npose to my friend from Tennessee: Why is majority leader Harry Reid \ngoing to vote the same way you are proposing to vote? Why is every \nDemocrat in this Chamber going to vote the way you are proposing to \nvote? If this is a vote in favor of defunding ObamaCare, is it the \nsuggestion of the Senator from Tennessee that the majority leader and \nthe Senate Democrats are confused about this vote?\n  Mr. CORKER. I would respond that after a 21-hour filibuster \nyesterday, the Senator voted in favor of the thing he is filibustering \nand Senator Harry Reid joined the Senator in that too. So it seems to \nme they are very similar.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Does the Senator from Tennessee dispute that the vote \nWednesday was a vote to take up the bill; whereas, the vote tomorrow \nwill be a vote that will do two things--if there are 60 votes. If \nenough Republicans cross the aisle and join majority leader Harry Reid \nand the Democrats, it will, No. 1, cut off all debate, and it will--No. \n2, what makes the vote tomorrow so significant is the majority leader \nhas already filed an amendment.\n  That amendment guts the House continuing resolution and funds \nObamaCare in its entirety. Given that that amendment is pending, and if \ncloture is invoked that amendment can be passed with 51 votes. Does the \nSenator from Tennessee disagree that once cloture is invoked, Harry \nReid, the majority leader, will be able to fund ObamaCare with 51 \nvotes?\n  Mr. CORKER. I agree the Senate rule that is in place allows \npostcloture votes. That 51-vote majority has been there for decades and \ngenerations. It is the same rule we have operated under for decades.\n  Let me just ask this question: We have a bill before us that I \nsupport, I think the Senator from Texas supports, the Senator from Utah \nsupports, I think. So my question is: We have a bill that we support. \nThe rules of the Senate have been here for decades, for generations, \nand for centuries, in many cases. Is the Senator thinking the House of \nRepresentatives would like for us to vote against cloture on their \nbill?\n  If you think that is what they wish for us to do, why is it that they \nare already developing language and legislation to send back over? It \nseems to me they have already indicated they view this strategy as a \nbox canyon because they understand the Senate rules. It looks to me as \nif they are already developing language to send something back over \nbecause even though we are in the Senate--I know all three of us are \nrelatively new--somehow or another they knew the Senate rules before \nthey sent it over.\n  So I am a little confused. Tell me what happens if the Senate were \nnot to invoke cloture on a bill that we support? What then happens? I \nwould like to understand.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I appreciate that question from my friend from Tennessee. \nThere are several pieces of it. One, he asked: Would the House \nRepublicans like for us not to invoke cloture? I can tell the Senator \nthis morning I spoke to over a dozen House Members who explicitly said: \nIt would be fantastic if Senate Republicans could show the same unity \nwe did and vote against cloture because Majority Leader Reid has filed \nan amendment to gut our language.\n  I would also note the Senator from Tennessee keeps expressing \nconfusion. I have to admit, I do not think the American people are \nconfused. I would ask the Senator from Tennessee, you agreed a moment \nago, if I understood you correctly, that if 60 Senators vote in favor \nof cloture, majority leader Harry Reid will be able to fund ObamaCare \nin its entirety.\n  Let me ask the counterpart. If 41 Republicans stood together and \nvoted against cloture, because we said we do not support the amendment \nthat Majority Leader Reid has filed to fund ObamaCare--when we told our \nconstituents we opposed ObamaCare we meant it. So we are not going to \nbe complicit in giving Harry Reid the ability to fund ObamaCare.\n  Would majority leader Harry Reid be able to proceed and fund \nObamaCare if 41 Republicans stood together against cloture?\n  Mr. CORKER. The thing is, I think the Senator from Texas may be \nconfused. We are not going to be voting on the amendment. We have the \nchance to vote on the amendment after the vote on cloture. The vote on \ncloture tomorrow is a vote on ending debate on a bill we support. The \namendment that the Senator is talking about----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the colloquy has expired.\n  Is there objection to the unanimous consent offered by the majority \nleader?\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I requested \nto\n\n[[Page S6940]]\n\nmodify the request made by the majority leader and he turned that down. \nIn light of the fact that he turned it down, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, what we just witnessed was an effort by \nSenator Harry Reid to move the votes--the critical votes--on keeping \nthe government open to this evening. What we have just heard from the \nRepublican side of the aisle is they want to stall and delay this even \nmore.\n  It is not just a matter of losing a legislative day in the Senate----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is still under the control of the \nRepublicans.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time--I know there was time yielded by Senator \nReid to the Republican side for Senator Grassley. How much time is \nremaining at this point on the Republican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The alternating time occurs at 4:30 p.m.\n  Mr. DURBIN. At 4:30, then the Democrats are recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. What time is it now? Would the Chair take notice?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is 4:29. Senators are reminded to address \neach other in the third person, not by their first and last names.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, if I could, I would just like to say in \nresponse to my good friend from Illinois, it is not the Republican side \nasking to stall. We only have two Republican Senators who are wanting \nto push this off.\n  So I do not want that to be mischaracterized. If I could, I wish to \nsay it is my understanding that the reason we are putting this off is \nbecause they would like for people around the country whom they have \nnotified to be able to watch. So it is that process of making sure \neveryone watches that I think is slowing this down. It is not the \nentire Republican side. I think most Republicans--I know all \nRepublicans other than two would actually like to give the House the \nopportunity to respond in an appropriate way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next hour is controlled by the majority.\n  The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me start by acknowledging what the Senator from \nTennessee just said.\n  I have worked with Senator Corker on so many issues, bipartisan \nissues, and I salute him for his efforts to try to find bipartisan \nsolutions. What he said is indicative of the problem we face now.\n  Two Senators--and it is their right under the Senate rules--the \nSenator from Utah and the junior Senator from Texas, have decided that \nthey wish to delay this another day. They want to stall this another \nday. It isn't only losing a legislative day; it is more.\n  Look how long it took us to bring up the House continuing resolution. \nIf I am not mistaken, they voted on it last Friday. We are thinking \nabout voting on it tomorrow, 7 days later.\n  It tells you that the Senate rules, even at their best, with one \nMember objecting, can mean that measures take a long time. Ordinarily, \nit means we waste time, but this time it is critically more important \nbecause the government will not be funded.\n  Tuesday morning, all across America we will not fund the government \nbecause of the actions just taken on the floor of the Senate by Senator \nCruz of Texas and Senator Lee of Utah. They are trying to slow this \ndown and create a political crisis.\n  They are playing high stakes poker with other people's money. The \nvictims of this political crisis will not be the Senators and House \nMembers. It will be a lot of innocent people, a lot of workers across \nAmerica, who only want to get up and do their work for the government \nto make this the greatest nation on Earth.\n  Some of them are risking their lives in uniform. They will be paid, \nbut their paychecks will be delayed. What it means is they have to \ncontact their wives and spouses back home Tuesday--if this delay by \nSenator Cruz and Senator Lee continues--they will have to contact them \nand say: Honey, it may be a little difficult this pay period. It \ndoesn't look like we are going to get a paycheck because Congress has \nshut down the government.\n  There are others too, all across America, thousands of them, doing \ntheir work for this government at the FBI and at intelligence agencies \nthat will go dark. Why have we reached this point? Why do these two \nSenators--two Senators--think this is in the best interests of the \nUnited States of America?\n  We have heard reports from economists, this cannot help our Nation, \nshutting down the government and failing to extend the debt ceiling. We \nare going to find ourselves in a position where this economy is going \nto start to stall.\n  People will start searching their savings accounts and notice their \ninvestments are going down in value. Why? Because two Republican \nSenators insisted that we couldn't speed up this vote and move this \nprocess forward to solve this problem.\n  The best explanation they can give us is they have notified their \nfriends in the media and those on the e-mail to stay tuned for Friday. \nFriday is going to be the big day, their big day in the Sun. So they \nare delaying our actions here for a full day so that they can get \nadequate publicity for what they are about to do.\n  This is not in the best interests of the Senate and it is surely not \nin the best interests of the United States of America.\n  I listened to Senator Reid. He made an effort to come forward and \nexpedite this process. There are people outside this door who warned us \nnot to do that. They said: If you send this back to the House, it gives \nthem time to do something.\n  Senator Reid has said from the start: We will not be party to \ndelaying this critically important decision. There is too much at \nstake. We are going to move this through as quickly as we can, and we \nhave.\n  At this point now, it is on the shoulders of those two Senators, \nthose two tea party Republican Senators, who have decided that they \nwant to close down the government or at least come closer to running \nthe risk of closing down this government.\n  That isn't in the best interests of dealing with the issues that face \nAmerica.\n  My job on the Senate Appropriations Committee is to be the chair of \none of the most important subcommittees, the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee. I never dreamed I would have this responsibility. But \nwith the passing of a genuine American hero, Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, \nthis mantel fell on my shoulders. Almost 60 percent of all domestic \ndiscretionary funds spent by the Federal Government go through this one \nsubcommittee.\n  There is a lot of hard work involved in putting the appropriation \ntogether. But when you consider the responsibility we have, it is even \nmore substantial. This appropriation supports our men and women in \nuniform and the Nation's intelligence agencies that keep our country \nsafe.\n  I wish to state what a government shutdown is going to mean to them. \nA government shutdown is going to mean a lot of hardship. I mentioned \nearlier uniformed troops calling their spouses to say: We are not going \nto get our paychecks on time this month. Try to make do if you need it.\n  This is something totally necessary and something brought on by an \naction on the floor of the Senate just minutes ago by Republican \nSenators.\n  There are more than 700,000 civilian employees in the Department of \nDefense, and half of them will be sent home immediately Tuesday \nmorning--sent home.\n  Men and women who work at military installations and in the Pentagon \nwill be sent home from work. Over 80 percent of Department of Defense \ncivilians work outside of the Pentagon, including 12,000 of them who \nwork in my State. They will be given notice on Tuesday morning: You \nhave to go home. Why? Because there was a promise made for some \npublicity on Friday by a couple of Senators.\n  That is unacceptable.\n  A substantial number of these hard-working men and women are going to \nbe furloughed. They already face furlough because of a sequester. If we \nallow this government to shut down, once again, they will have to \nfigure out\n\n[[Page S6941]]\n\nhow to make ends meet. Men and women who were trying to keep us safe in \nthis country, many of them risking their lives, are now going to be \npawns in this political game. It is an unconscionable breach of faith.\n\n  The risk to national security imposed by a shutdown is not confined \nto the military. It will cripple our intelligence community. These men \nand women serve as our country's first line of defense. We rely on \nthese agencies to warn us of threats, to prevent terrorist attacks, and \ninform leaders making critical, national security decisions.\n  The intelligence community workforce, overwhelmingly made up of \ncivilians, the greatest portion of them will be furloughed because of a \ngovernment shutdown, a government shutdown that is totally unnecessary \nbrought on by the House Republicans and two Senate Republicans. This \nshutdown will be quick, and the principal agencies will largely go dark \nwithin 4 to 8 hours of a shutdown order.\n  In America, these intelligence agencies that keep us safe are going \nto go dark because of this political strategy. If the government shuts \ndown, all DOD work will stop on weapons and equipment maintenance not \ndirectly related to war. Bases will not be maintained, but you will see \na degradation of facilities. We will see massive disruptions all across \nthe country.\n  The Rock Island Arsenal in my State is a critical arsenal that \nsupports more than 54,000 Active, Reserve, and retired military. The \narsenal is the largest employer in the Illinois-Iowa region with more \nthan 7,500 employees and more than 70 Federal and commercial tenants. \nThe facility adds $1 billion to the local economy, supporting 14,000 \njobs in the region.\n  A government shutdown will throw production schedules at Rock Island \ninto chaos as orders get cut back and civilians sit at home under \nfurlough. I cannot imagine going to these men and women and saying: The \nreason you have had this furlough and can't come to work is because two \nSenators decided they needed some publicity on Friday. Putting the \narsenal's capabilities at risk degrades the defense industrial base. It \njeopardizes our national and local economy.\n  The same thing is true at Scott Air Force Base. In a shutdown, its \n5,000 civilian employees would experience the same loss of pay as \neverybody else. Scott's 5,500 active duty military personnel and their \nfamilies would have to get by on savings and reserves while they wait \nfor reimbursement with later paychecks.\n  When we go through these lists--and the lists are long--one thinks \nhow totally unnecessary it is. Senator Reid has come to the floor \nrepeatedly to tell you what the American people think. Eighty percent \nof the American people think this is foolish and wasteful. Seventy-five \npercent of Republicans have given up on this strategy.\n  Yet a handful of willful Members of the House and Senate decided they \nare going to keep going down this road. I hope they will have some \nrevelations in the next few minutes or hours, maybe overnight. I hope \nthey will reconsider what they have done, the risk they are putting \nthis country in.\n  It is not appropriate, it is not fair. I have listened to them try to \nexplain how they can have a filibuster for 21 hours and then turn \naround and unanimously vote for the next item up on business. It may be \nan argument that the Senator from Texas thinks he understands clearly. \nMost Americans don't understand what he was saying for 21 hours and \nthen turning around and voting overwhelmingly to move forward on the \nbill.\n  I wish to make one thing clear before we go any further. ObamaCare as \nwe know it is already funded. Senator Harry Reid is not going to be \nfunding ObamaCare; it is already funded, and it will be. It will be \nunder appropriations bills that we pass in CRs. This notion that he is \ngoing to somehow do something sinister--let me remind critics that we \nbrought this to a vote in the Senate, one of the most historic votes, \npainful votes.\n  Senator Reid may remember when our colleague Senator Ted Kennedy was \nbrought here on the floor of the Senate to vote for the Affordable Care \nAct. The man was literally dying of cancer, but this meant so much to \nhim that he came down here for the vote at great personal risk and \nsacrifice. It was great to see his smiling face come through that door \nagain, but we knew we would never see him again and we didn't.\n  That is the kind of sacrifice that was made. The votes were taken. \nThen in the next presidential election there was a referendum for \nObamaCare. The American people were clear. They reelected President \nObama. They rejected Governor Romney's promise to repeal ObamaCare.\n  These Members, at least two of them, can't accept the verdict of \nhistory. They continue to want to fight this battle. As I have said, \nthey are fighting it at the expense of a lot of innocent people across \nAmerica, at the expense of some of the best workers in the world. Those \nin military uniform and those in the civilian capacity do a great job \nfor us every single day.\n  Picking on them, deciding to make them the object of this political \nexercise, is beneath us as a great institution.\n  Let me close by saying this. I will give credit to Senator Cruz when \nhe was doing his 21 hours. I asked him point blank: So you want to \neliminate the protection in ObamaCare that says that health insurance \ncompanies can't discriminate against children and families that have \npreexisting conditions?\n  He said: Yes, I do. I want to eliminate all of them.\n  I said: You want to eliminate the provision that says you can't limit \nthe coverage in health insurance policies so people will have enough \nmoney for serious illness, cancer therapy and surgery?\n  I want to eliminate it all, he said.\n  You want to eliminate that protection for families to keep their kids \non their own health insurance policies up to age 26--young people \nlooking for jobs who may not have health insurance--you want to \neliminate that too?\n  I want to eliminate every bit of it.\n  He was consistent--consistently wrong--because he fails to understand \nwhat working families across America face every single day, what 50 \nmillion uninsured Americans face with no protection, no peace of mind.\n  God forbid he ever spends a moment as the parent of a sick child \nwithout health insurance. I have been there. You never want that \nexperience in your life for yourself or anybody else.\n  I asked Senator Cruz to tell us about his own personal health \ninsurance since he decided he is going to be the arbiter on health \ninsurance for the rest of America and for Congress. He won't give me a \nstraight answer on how he has his own health insurance for his family. \nI think he owes that to us. He has told us a lot about his great \nfamily--and there are some wonderful stories--but when it comes to this \nissue, he ought to tell us.\n  Where does he get his health insurance? Who pays for it? What is the \nemployer's contribution? What is the tax deduction taken by your \nemployer, if any, for your health insurance? These are legitimate \nquestions.\n  He has raised these questions about millions of families across \nAmerica. He said: They are just fine. We can do without ObamaCare.\n  Let us hear his explanation of how he protects his family when it \ncomes to health insurance. I don't think that is an unreasonable \nquestion. After all, he is the one who raised the issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. I wish to speak for a moment about manufacturing. As you \nknow, I am passionate about manufacturing, about the good-quality jobs \nmanufacturing brings to our communities.\n  What I am also passionate about is that this body needs to stop \nmanufacturing crisis.\n  What we just heard in the last few minutes was an exchange between my \nfriend, the Senator from Tennessee, and two of his colleagues, the \nSenators from Texas and Utah, that summarized that what has happened in \nthis Chamber today is the extension of a manufactured crisis, a purely \nartificial extension that is continuing, as the Senator from Illinois \nsaid in great detail and with great insight, to put at risk our \nrecovering economy, our men- and women-at-arms, and our Nation's \nstanding in the world. This is a wholly manufactured crisis without \npurpose.\n  It seems to me in the 3 years I have been here in the Senate--it \nfeels an awful lot like Groundhog Day. I was\n\n[[Page S6942]]\n\nsitting in that very chair presiding over this body as we were closing \nin on a government shutdown when I had only been here for a few months.\n  I have never forgotten getting a message from a constituent at home. \nHer husband was at that very moment serving our Nation flying Medevac \nmissions in Afghanistan. I got a simple note:\n\n       Is it possible that because you all can't do your jobs that \n     my husband and I won't be getting a paycheck next week while \n     he does his job for our Nation overseas?\n\n  We have, in the 3 years I have been here, seen needless fights, a \nnear default on our Nation's debt, a near defunding of our Federal \nGovernment's operation. Today we see not a difference of meaning but a \ndifference purely of substance and style--purely of superficial style.\n\n  As the Senator from Tennessee pointed out, the objection to the \nmajority leader's request that we proceed now to a vote was purely for \nthe convenience of two Senators who have sent out a lot of press \nreleases and who want more attention. We can't continue to play chicken \nwith the American people, the American economy, and continuing the \nservices of the Federal Government.\n  I know my colleague, the Senator from Louisiana, who is one of the \nleaders from the Appropriations Committee, is here to offer some \ninsight and comments about the value of appropriations, about the great \nwork our chair Senator Mikulski has led us in this year.\n  There are so many other ways that this manufactured crisis is just \nthe latest in a series of disappointing failures to lead by a few of \nour colleagues. The chair has allowed us to go through subcommittee \nmarkups and full committee markups on 11 appropriations subcommittee \nbills. If those bills could be taken up and passed on this floor, we \ncould fix a lot of the things that challenge our Nation.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Louisiana so she might inform \nthis body about some of the important work that she, in her \nsubcommittee on the Appropriations Committee, on which I am honored to \nserve, has been able to do this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator for yielding for a question. I \nappreciate his leadership as an appropriator.\n  Senator Mikulski was on the floor earlier today, the leader of our \ncommittee and the debate about how much to spend and what we should \nspend our money on. Does the Senator understand that that could be done \nand it is done in the appropriations process? And if we could just get \npast this manufactured crisis we could actually accomplish what many \nSenators want to do, which is to discuss the level of spending? We \ncan't even get there because we are stuck in a manufactured crisis by \nthe Senator from Texas.\n  Is that the sense of my colleague as to where we are?\n  Mr. COONS. That is absolutely my understanding. My friend the Senator \nfrom Louisiana knows better than anyone that the role of the \nAppropriations Committee and its subcommittees is to perform oversight, \nto weed through programs in the Federal Government, and to strengthen \nand support those that are effective and making a difference, but to \nnarrow or shut down or trim those that aren't. If we continue to lurch \nfrom crisis to crisis, from short-term continuing resolution to \ncontinuing resolution, we will never get that good work done.\n  Madam President, I welcome any further comments my colleague would \nlike to make about what the Subcommittee on Homeland Security of the \nAppropriations Committee has made possible, and why that matters, what \ndifference that makes to the people of Louisiana and of our country.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator, and let me, if I could, Madam \nPresident, say a few words about the bill I have the privilege and the \nresponsibility of chairing--the Homeland Security bill. This is a $42 \nbillion appropriations bill. I am very proud to say I have worked with \nmy Republican colleague, the Senator from Indiana Dan Coats over the \nlast 6 months to draft and fashion a bill.\n  In many public meetings, in public forums at the appropriations \nsubcommittee level and at the appropriations full committee level, our \nbill was negotiated in good faith--Republicans and Democrats \ncompromising over important issues such as: How many border agents \nshould we have, how many security agents should we have on our border, \nhow many detention beds can taxpayers afford, how many do the \nRepublicans want, how many do the Democrats want, what are some of the \nimportant aspects of immigration reform and how do we build a \ntechnologically superior border that allows trade and commerce but \nkeeps out terrorists and people who are undocumented and who do not \nhave the proper certification to come into the country.\n  That is what we, who ran for public office, wanted to get here to \nwork on, not to sit in an empty Chamber with people who, because they \ncan't get their way 100 percent of the time, all the time, want to shut \ndown the process.\n  So as chair of the Subcommittee on Homeland Security, I most \ncertainly can add my voice to the appropriators and to Members who say: \nIt is time to move on. So let us do so.\n  But before I get into the specifics, I wanted to say a word about an \nissue that is critical to Louisiana and to States such as Texas--\nSenator Cruz's home State. You would never know this, because I don't \nthink he said a word about this issue in the 22 hours he was on the \nfloor, but I know a little something about Texas, my neighboring State. \nI know a lot about Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, from the gulf \ncoast. I have represented my State for now almost 18 years in the \nSenate and grew up along the gulf coast.\n  I want to make sure everybody understands that in 14 days there are \ngoing to be over 1 million people in the United States--many in Texas, \nmany in Louisiana, many in Florida, some in Massachusetts, et cetera, \net cetera, et cetera--who are going to basically see the value of their \nhome, the equity in their home, go poof--poof. Whether their equity \nmight have been $200,000 this week or $400,000 or $600,000 or $2 \nmillion, this is an equal opportunity destroyer.\n  This is because last year Congress passed the Biggert-Waters bill, \nwhich was supposed to fix the National Flood Insurance Program. It was \nsupposed to fix it--make it sustainable, make it go from the red to the \nblack, make the deficit go away, help the program to be more \nsustainable. I understand that. The problem is the way the bill was \npassed it is going to, in a few days, literally go poof for people who \nthought they had equity in their home because of a provision in the \nBiggert-Waters flood insurance bill.\n\n  That provision basically says this: When you put your home up for \nsale--when you sell your home--the grandfathered rate that was attached \nto your home for flood insurance is immediately dispensed with. So \nanyone selling their home who happens to have a subsidized flood \ninsurance rate, which is lower than the private market, for good \nreason--which I will explain in a minute--their house becomes \nvalueless.\n  Let me repeat this. This is not about flood insurance going up, this \nis not about losing your job, it is not about not being able to show up \nfor work because the government shuts down, which is a big problem. But \nthis is a real big problem for 1 million families because the house \nthey have paid for, that they have lived in and thought they had some \nequity in so they could retire on that equity or send their kids to \ncollege is, poof, gone.\n  I would like to focus on fixing that problem. I know there are many \npeople in Texas who would like it fixed as well, because when I go over \nthere, I hear from them. When I go to Louisiana, and Mississippi, and \nFlorida, I hear from people. But we can't even get to a flood insurance \nbill because we are on the floor talking about an issue that is \ncompletely manufactured.\n  This is not manufactured, ladies and gentlemen. The flood insurance \nissue is real. The flood insurance bill is a bill that actually passed \nand we have only 14 days to fix a part of it.\n  At 5 o'clock, in 5 minutes, I am going to a meeting in Senator \nMerkley's office, who is chair of a subcommittee, and we are going to \ntry and work on this. But to do this we need cooperation. We need \ncooperation from all of our Members to say: Well, that might not be a \nproblem in my State, but I can understand what Senator Landrieu is\n\n[[Page S6943]]\n\nsaying and I can understand what some of the Republicans are saying. \nLet's see what we can do to fix this so people's equity does not vanish \ninto thin air and cause lots of pain and suffering.\n  But as I say, we can't even talk about real issues because we have to \ntalk about a manufactured crisis.\n  I see some of my colleagues on the floor, and I know they understand \nthe chairman asked us to come and talk for a few minutes about our \nappropriations bills, so I will try to do this in 4 minutes, because \nwhen Senator Mikulski asks you to do something, you need to go ahead \nand do it. So I need to put this in the Record for my Homeland Security \nbill.\n  As I understand it, this government shutdown could happen because, as \nhas been explained, we have two or three or four or five--not many--\nSenators who have decided to manufacture a crisis about the continuing \nresolution and paying our bills, which we owe.\n  Every responsible, nondeadbeat person in the world pays their bills, \nand I don't know why we can't. But anyway, because of that, the \nHomeland Security bill we have worked on, which has been negotiated, \nmay I say, without disagreement--I mean, this is kind of unheard of. \nLet me say, we had disagreements, but we worked them out. There were \ndifferent views but we worked them out. We had big things to work out, \nsuch as this big new project being built in Kansas. I was not very \nsupportive of it, but I had to listen a lot, I had to think, I had to \nnegotiate, and I ended up putting a big project in this bill that I \ndidn't 100 percent go along with, but I was convinced by colleagues for \ndifferent reasons--and the White House weighed in, and others--to \ncompromise.\n  The bottom line is I have a $42 billion bill that supports our \nborders, that keeps commerce going, and that keeps FEMA going. We have \na terrible flood to deal with in Colorado, and I see the Senator from \nColorado and the Senator from Minnesota are both here, and they \nabsolutely know what floods are all about. FEMA is trying to operate \nthere. What do we tell people there on Monday? Sorry, we can't come \nhelp you get back into your home, get your children in school, get this \nhospital built again?\n  We have phones to answer, we have people to serve, we have borders to \nsecure, we have trade to move next week, and shutting down the \ngovernment is simply not what we should be doing. We should be fixing \nit, making it more efficient, saving money where we can, and serving \nthe 350 million people in this country and around the world who depend \non the American government to function.\n  In conclusion, let me say this. I had Marriott Corporation tell me \ntoday--Marriott, an excellent company, but conservative leaning from \ntheir top--Senator, would you please say, when you can, that the \ngovernment is our biggest customer? When people think of government, \nthey think only of government jobs. The Federal Government is the \nlargest customer of Marriott Corporation, one of the largest \ncorporations in the country. We buy a lot of goods and services from \nthem. When we shut down, when we hesitate, when we don't operate with \nconfidence, it affects every business in the world. If Marriott is \ngoing to take a big hit, imagine the hit smaller companies take, that \ncan't take that hit or that break?\n  So on behalf of Marriott and on behalf of other companies that are \ngoing to get hit, please realize the government has a lot of impact on \nthe private sector, and it is not fair to hurt our economy or any \nbusiness--large, small, conservative, liberal, or moderate.\n  Last week, Mark Zandi of Moody's testified that a 3-4 week shutdown \nwould reduce real GDP by 1.4 percent. This would be a devastating step \nbackwards. In the second quarter of 2013, our GDP grew by 2.5 percent, \nmore than doubling the 1.1 percent growth in GDP in the first quarter \nof 2013. And numerous studies have reported that, based on past \nexperience, ``turning out the Federal government's lights'' would cost \nus $100 million each day. The hostage-taking approach of the House \nmajority threatens such a shutdown and puts our economic viability at \nrisk. We must do better.\n  A government shutdown would have devastating consequences on hundreds \nof thousands of people in Louisiana. Of the 31,000 Federal employees in \nmy State, 18,000 would be temporarily furloughed by a shutdown. That is \n58% of the Federal employees in my State that would be out of the job. \nMore than 24,000 active Louisiana military and civilian personnel and \n320,000 Louisiana veterans could see much needed paychecks and benefits \ndelayed.\n  Social Security services would also be significantly disrupted, which \nwould have major implications for the 860,000 social security \nbeneficiaries in Louisiana. New claims wouldn't be processed and the \nsocial security help line, which many of our seniors rely on, would not \nbe able to take calls.\n  In just 4 days during the 1995 shutdown, 112,000 claims for Social \nSecurity retirement and disability benefits were not taken and 800,000 \ncallers were denied service on the Social Security Administration's 800 \nnumber. Constituents of mine, like Susan Crandall, rely heavily on the \nSocial Security Offices in Louisiana. Ms. Crandall uses the Social \nSecurity Office in Alexandria as a lifeline. A government shutdown \nwould force her to search for help elsewhere. For her and others living \nin my State, this just isn't feasible.\n  A shutdown would also harm Louisiana students. More than 7,800 \nLouisiana students rely on work-study programs and 4,600 receive \nFederal loans to help pay for school. If there is a government \nshutdown, colleges and universities across Louisiana would not be able \nto disburse these funds to students.\n  The Small Business Administration would stop processing new loans, \npreventing nearly 420,000 small businesses in Louisiana from getting \nthe credit they need.\n  The Federal Housing Administration has helped almost 10,000 mortgage \nholders in Louisiana thus far this year. If we allow a shutdown to \nhappen, the FHA would not be able to process new loans, leaving \naspiring homeowners out in the cold. Many potential homeowners in \nLouisiana are already hesitant to purchase because of the fear of flood \ninsurance going up, and this will only add to their stress.\n  One of the core missions of the Appropriations Committee--and of \nCongress at large--is to make sure our Federal government continues to \noperate soundly. By adopting the continuing resolution that the House \npassed last week, with its poison pills that defund the Affordable Care \nAct and play favorites with which bills we pay, we would be failing the \nAmerican people. We need to do our work to make sure the Federal \ngovernment remains open and continue to fund implementation of the \nAffordable Care Act. It is the law of the land. Anything less is ill \nconceived.\n  And let me just say this. Operating the government on continuing \nresolutions is a failure in itself. I am disappointed, as I know \nSenator Mikulski is too, that we find ourselves in this position. When \nwe pass CRs, we put the Nation on autopilot and fly blindly. Instead of \npassing the 12 appropriation bills that set priorities and invest in \nAmerica's future, we fund yesterday's priorities instead.\n  As the chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, \nI hear every day * * * firsthand how important it is to keep our \ncountry safe and secure are at stake. Within the past year, our Nation \nhas experienced a substantial rise in diverse attacks. If DHS continues \nto be funded at the 2013 post sequester level, we would not be able to \nadequately address or respond to these events. For example:\n  While we were all horrified by how simple, homemade explosives could \nwreak such havoc at the Boston marathon this year, we saw how critical \nit was that law enforcement and first responders have the proper \ntraining and equipment to respond to these incidents.\n  Years of robust grant funding for our first responders paid off in \nthis instance. However, under sequester, grant funding would be at the \nlowest level since DHS was formed 10 years ago. If a government \nshutdown were to occur, all activity intended to help build State and \nlocal resiliency would cease.\n  Our cyber networks are under constant attack. There are 6 million \nprobes or attacks on U.S. government networks each day, and among the \nattackers are 140 foreign spy organizations. Let me share some recent \nexamples. Earlier this month the Syrian\n\n[[Page S6944]]\n\nElectronic Army defaced the Marine Corps website and hacked into \nnumerous print media websites. We also heard news reports of large-\nscale espionage acts perpetrated by a group of highly sophisticated \nhackers for hire operating in China. Cyber attacks breach our \ngovernment, military, and private networks to steal information, \nincluding valuable corporate secrets. All of our combined Federal \nresources are needed to strengthen safeguards on our data and detect \nthese malicious efforts before they can disrupt critical government and \nfinancial networks. Without the $108 million increase requested in \nfiscal year 2014 for cybersecurity, DHS would defer implementation of \nthe intrusion detection system for civilian Federal programs, known as \nEinstein, by 1 year; and delay expansion of cyber-attack information-\nsharing with States, leaving 19 without access to timely data. A \nshutdown or continued sequester will threaten progress in this area.\n  In the wake of serious chemical plant incidents in West, TX and in \nAscension Parish, LA, this summer, we are reminded that chemical safety \nand security is imperative, for citizens and first responders. In the \nhands of terrorists, chemical attacks could cause widespread \ndevastation and loss of life. The DHS inspection program to prevent \nwrongdoers from gaining access to harmful chemicals has reduced risk by \n40 percent. But there are still 4,300 facilities for which DHS has the \nresponsibility to ensure a security program is completed and \nmaintained. We cannot afford to delay this important work by \nunderinvesting in it, but that is exactly what would happen under a \nsequester level.\n  The existence of thousands of poorly secured commercial radioactive \nsources globally poses an ongoing challenge to our national security. \nWe continue to face the threat of a weapon of mass destruction or dirty \nbomb being detonated in one of our cities or ports. A radiological \nattack would incite mass panic, shut down our major transportation \nsystems, and cause severe economic damage. We cannot afford to stand \nmeekly by. The Department of Homeland Security program called Securing \nthe Cities, which is a partnership with State and local governments, is \ndesigned to detect and prevent a nuclear attack in our highest risk \ncities. New York has been the test bed for this program over the past \nfew years; but it is now expanding to other major cities--Los Angeles \nbeing the next location. We need to ensure that this expansion is \nfunded, not suspended.\n  For 4 years in a row, the Department of Homeland Security has had to \ntighten its belt and operate with reduced funding. The impacts \nof sequestration have made it worse. Let me highlight just a few \nexamples of why sequestration has been harmful and why it will be \nparticularly damaging to DHS under a long-term continuing resolution:\n\n  The Coast Guard has operated its surface and air assets 25 percent \nbelow planned levels under sequestration. This has resulted in 35 \npercent reduction in drug seizures and a 22 percent reduction in \ninterdiction of undocumented migrants.\n  Customs and Border Protection would not be able to hire any of the \nnew officers for our air, land, and sea ports of entry requested in the \nfiscal year 2014 budget. This is bad for travel and trade. Travel \nvolume to the U.S. is up 12 percent since 2009, and is expected to grow \n4-5 percent in each of the next 5 years. In 2011, international \ntravelers to the U.S. generated a trade surplus of $43 billion--that \nset a U.S. travel and tourism record. Without these new officers, we \ncould once again see spikes in wait times during the spring at gateway \nairports such as New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, Dallas, and \nMiami. In fiscal year 2013 under sequester, wait times for arriving \npassengers at these airports rose over 4 hours on multiple occasions. \nWe must ensure the United States is open for business, or else \ntravelers will take their business elsewhere.\n  Similarly, CBP would not be able to sustain current operations in \nfiscal year 2014 because the agency will not have access to $110 \nmillion in fees collected under the Colombia Free Trade agreement. \nWithout these funds, CBP would have to, No. 1, rely on furloughs of up \nto 16 days per employee to close the gap; No. 2, likely be forced to \ncommence an agency-wide hiring pause for front-line personnel; and No. \n3, fall below the Congressionally mandated staffing levels for CBP \nofficers and Border Patrol agents. This will have the negative impact \nof longer lines at our ports, slower processing and inspection of food \nand other products entering our country, and fewer illegal aliens being \napprehended and removed at our borders.\n  DHS would not be able to implement safeguards to prevent unauthorized \nrelease of classified information. Vulnerabilities in the existing \nsystem were highlighted in the Wikileaks releases and the more recent \ndisclosures by Edward Snowden. There was no funding in fiscal year 2013 \nfor this type of activity so DHS's classified data will not be \nadequately protected without fiscal year 2014 funding.\n  Critical infrastructure protection efforts would be hindered. For \nexample, without the $34 million above the fiscal year 2013 sequester \nlevel, inspections of chemical plants to prevent weaponization by \nterrorists will be delayed. Funding to better coordinate Federal \nchemical programs--in the wake of the West, Texas facility explosion--\nwill not be provided. Increases to prevent catastrophic impacts to \ncritical infrastructure during manmade or natural disasters will be \neliminated.\n  And lastly, on the administrative side, just last week DHS \nUndersecretary for Management, Rafael Borras, testified in front of the \nHouse Homeland Security Subcommittee on Oversight and Management about \nthe difficulties of managing multiyear acquisition programs under a \nnever-ending string of continuing resolutions. While I agree that is \nchallenging, what is worse than a short-term spending bill at sequester \nlevels, would be a government shutdown. Even a short lapse in funding \nhas the potential to drive up costs across the entire DHS acquisition \nportfolio.\n  Because of these impacts, it is critical that we conference our \nfiscal year 2014 Senate bills with our House counterparts that we can \naddress the weaknesses that continuing to operate at sequestration \nlevels would entail. A conference would also ensure a necessary delay \nto flood insurance rate increases since the House and Senate Homeland \nSecurity bills contain identical language on this issue. Time and time \nagain, Senators have heard from their constituents about the \nskyrocketing increases in flood insurance rates. Many homeowners \nthroughout the United States will see their rates rise to unaffordable \nlevels. For example, up to 2.9 million policies nationwide could see \ntheir previously grandfathered rates become absolutely unaffordable. \nWhile data for each homeowner is still incomplete, one resident in my \nState of Louisiana could see rates increase from $633 to over $20,000 \nper year. That makes homeownership unachievable for many Americans and \ntraps others in houses that they cannot sell.\n  Exacerbating the damage caused by irresponsible funding levels under \nthe sequester is the looming threat of a politically-motivated Federal \ngovernment shutdown. While most--about 84 percent--Department of \nHomeland Security employees are deemed mission-essential during a \nshutdown, because they are military or law enforcement personnel or \ndeal with critical safety or security issues, DHS like all other \nFederal agencies would be operating at a greatly reduced capacity. For \nexample:\n  The Department of Homeland Security would not be able to maintain and \noperate E-Verify, the Internet-based system that allows employers to \nvoluntarily determine the eligibility of prospective employees to work \nlegally in the United States.\n  Vital research and development would be delayed. For example, funding \nto develop next generation screening technology for TSA would dry up. \nThis means funding for the development of technologies to improve \ndetection, lower false alarms, and decrease wait times at airports \nwould end. Funding would also end for the development of \ncountermeasures to biological and nuclear threats.\n  Preventative measures and pre-emptive planning efforts with State and \nlocal governments for natural and man-made events with FEMA and \ncritical infrastructure experts will cease. This leaves communities \nless able to respond to catastrophic events in the middle of hurricane \nseason, not to mention for no-notice events like\n\n[[Page S6945]]\n\nearthquakes or bombings such as those at the Boston marathon. A lack of \npreparedness will cost the Federal government more money in recovery \nefforts and lead to unacceptable and unnecessary loss of life.\n  Under a shutdown, law enforcement training would cease, including \ntraining conducted through the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center \nand the Secret Service's J. Rowley Training Center. This would impact \nCBP, ICE, Secret Service, the Federal Air Marshal Service, and would \ndelay their ability to bring new officers and agents into operational \nservice.\n  And as I noted earlier, while the majority of the frontline law \nenforcement personnel such as CBP's Border Patrol, Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement's investigative and detention officers, \nTransportation Security Administration aviation passenger screeners, \nFEMA disaster response personnel, and the U.S. Coast Guard will \ncontinue working under a shutdown, many of these employees live \npaycheck-to-paycheck. Since their biweekly paychecks would be stopped \nduring a Federal funding hiatus, these women and men may not be able to \npay their rent or mortgage or may have to reduce purchases of food or \nmedicine for their families. An unnecessary government shutdown breaks \nfaith with our heroes on the front lines, adversely impacting their \nmorale and distracting them from their important and often dangerous \nduties. No one wants that.\n  We need to get our work done. We need to pass a clean continuing \nresolution that keeps the Federal government open and fully funds the \nAffordable Care Act. After that is done, we need to move to the harder \ntask at hand--agreeing on a budget for fiscal year 2014 and finalizing \nbills so that our agencies have the appropriate funding for their \ncritical missions--instead of lurching from one funding crisis to the \nnext.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I want to thank the Senator from \nLouisiana for her leadership of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nHomeland Security.\n  We just heard a detailed description of how the Senator has worked in \na bipartisan, thoughtful, and in a detailed and decent way--in a way \nthat crafted a bill where there was compromise, where there was give \nand take, and where ultimately the bill that has moved through that \nsubcommittee and full committee and should be ready for action on this \nfloor meets the real needs of our Nation, of our homeland.\n  That bill provides resources and support whether for the State of \nColorado, the State of Minnesota, the State of Delaware, or all over \nthis country. And shutting the government down over a needless \nmanufactured crisis between now and Monday is the height of \nirresponsibility.\n  Madam President, if I might, I will now yield for the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I will be brief. I want to thank the \nSenator from Louisiana while she is here, not just for her words and \nfor reminding us this isn't about who can scream the loudest on cable \ntelevision, it is about the work that actually needs to get done in the \nSenate on behalf of the American people, but I also want to thank her \nfor all the work she has done over the years with FEMA. It has made a \nbig difference in my State already. They are working well with our \nlocal and State officials. We have a long way to go, and the last thing \nwe need to worry about is whether the government is going to shut down.\n  Fortunately, because of the work the Senator and others did around \nhere, the emergency part of this is going to continue to carry through, \neven if there is a shutdown. But there is a lot of uncertainty that is \nrelated to that. So while Senator Landrieu was here, I wanted to thank \nher for that.\n  I am sorry the Senator from Delaware has left the floor for a moment, \nbecause he has been holding it down and I wanted to ask him a question \nabout his previous work. He was a county executive in Delaware before \nhe was here. I was a superintendent of schools. I worked for the mayor. \nSenator Klobuchar, who is here from Minnesota, was a district attorney. \nI think every one of us is completely perplexed by the hostage taking \nthat is going on around this place.\n  I ask the Senator from Delaware, he was the county executive of a \ncounty in Delaware?\n  Mr. COONS. I was.\n  Mr. BENNET. I say through the Chair, does the Senator think that any \ncounty executive or mayor or local official in the Senator's State \nwouldn't be run out of town if they threatened the credit rating of \ntheir community for politics?\n  Mr. COONS. Absolutely. I might say to my friend from Colorado, I had \ndirect experience with this. In the State of Delaware, folks expect us \nto balance our budgets and pass them on time, to deliver good services, \nbut also to defend our credit ratings. The city and county and State in \nwhich I lived and served all enjoyed triple-A credit ratings. The folks \nin my communities understood that meant we could borrow money for \nbuilding sewers, building roads, and building schools less expensively \nand sustain the quality of our community. Our business leaders and \ncivic leaders understood that to put that at risk was reckless and \nirresponsible.\n  Yet for a manufactured crisis by a few Senators, we are facing the \nshutdown of this Federal Government a few days from now--and, I am \nafraid, just a few weeks later the possible default on the sovereign \ndebt of the United States. No responsible elected official where I am \nfrom would do that.\n  Mr. BENNET. That is my point. I think we are dealing with something \nthat is so far outside of the mainstream of what political actors, at \nleast in my State who are elected who are Republicans or Democrats, \nwould support. I think it is important for us to call attention to that \nbecause that is what we are dealing with.\n  I see the Senator from Minnesota is here, so my last observation. If \none of us represented a State government that opened and closed its \ndoors or threatened to open and close its doors every single year, I \ncan assure you that businesses would look to do business in some other \nState, not in the State in which we work.\n  That is what we are doing to the United States of America right now. \nWe have so much going for us. The innovators are out in the economy \ninnovating. Natural gas is cheaper than it has ever been. We could \nbuild this economy if only a few actors in Washington would get out of \nthe way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I would first like to acknowledge \nSenator Coons of Delaware for his leadership, and Senator Mikulski, the \npowerful head of the Appropriations Committee, who has put together a \ngroup this hour to talk about public safety and infrastructure, and \nwhat a government shutdown would mean and what sequestration means when \nit comes to the progress of this country.\n  We heard from Senators from different parts of the country. Senator \nLandrieu from the great State of Louisiana talked about the importance \nof FEMA. No one knows better than she does after Katrina what a \ngovernment shutdown would mean for Louisiana.\n  Senator Bennet of Colorado was here, where right now they are \nexperiencing the horrible aftermath of these floods.\n  Then we look at what happened in the State of Massachusetts with the \nBoston Marathon. What would have happened there if we were in the \nmiddle of a government shutdown and didn't have the resources we \nneeded?\n  Do we want the head of the FBI worried about who he can lay off and \nwho he can't? Or the head of the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms that \ninvestigated that bombing in Boston--do we want them off looking at \nwhat are we going to do if we have a shutdown in the middle of that \nbombing? That is not what we want happening. That is not how this \ncountry runs.\n  I sat and watched the last hour of this debate, and I saw Senator \nCorker come to the floor and do a fine job of explaining that it is not \nevery Republican in this Chamber who is trying to slow this vote down \nso we don't even have it today. He focused on two Republicans who were \ndoing that, and I think it is very important for the\n\n[[Page S6946]]\n\nAmerican people to know that the Senate has tended to work in a \nbipartisan way. We want to move forward, we want to get this bill voted \non, and we want to give a chance for the House to come back. No more \ndelays. We need to get this done.\n  Much of the focus has oftentimes been: I want to shut down \nWashington. But my job today is to talk about what it means in our \nStates. As someone who spent 8 years as the chief prosecutor for \nMinnesota's largest county, I know the pain of this shutdown would be \nfelt by State and local officials, by State and local people, right \ndown the line, and, not least of all, by the first responders and law \nenforcement officers who rely on Federal funding for everything from \ncrime prevention to community corrections programs to drug courts, and \nto simply keeping cops on the beat.\n  There are some who are willing to hold these first responders \nhostage, there are some who are willing to hold our country hostage, to \nscore political points. The fact is a government shutdown would be \npainful and it would be expensive. These men and women go to work every \nday protecting the people. While most people may run away from \ndisasters, calamities, and tragedies, they bravely run toward them, and \nthey do it selflessly--not because they are looking for fame or glory \nbut because they are simply doing their jobs.\n  We in Washington have a responsibility to do our jobs. We have a \nresponsibility to ensure that our cops and firefighters and EMTs have \nthe tools to protect the public safely and effectively. We have a \nresponsibility to pass a resolution that prevents the government from \nshutting down.\n  We simply can't afford another self-inflicted wound to our economy, \nas Senator Bennet was pointing out, especially not at a time when \nthings are finally turning around. At 7.3 percent, our national \nunemployment rate is at its lowest point since December of 2008. In my \nState, it is at 5.1 percent. The housing market is bouncing back. \nRetail sales are up. So far this year we have added 1.5 million private \nsector jobs. We are not where we need to be, but we are headed in the \nright direction and we need to keep moving forward and not move \nbackward. Yet here we are again, facing another manufactured crisis \nthat threatens to shut down the government.\n  Last week, House Republicans sent us a continuing resolution they \nknew had zero chance of passing the Senate. When House Republicans \npassed a budget tied to defunding the Affordable Care Act, they decided \nthey were willing to risk shutting down the government just to \nrelitigate a law that both the House and Senate passed, the President \nsigned, and the Supreme Court upheld.\n  Will there be changes to that law going forward? I am sure there \nwill. There always are with large bills. But the answer is not to \ndefund it on a must-pass bill.\n  Even Members of their own party agree this is the wrong thing to do. \nSenator McCain has called defunding the health care law as part of the \nCR the height of foolishness and not rational. Even a poll conducted by \nthe conservative Crossroads GPS, headed by Karl Rove, found that \nIndependents overwhelmingly oppose shutting the government down to \ndefund ObamaCare on a margin of 58 percent in opposition to 30 percent. \nThat is Independent voters in a poll conducted by Karl Rove's group.\n  In the short term, a government shutdown lasting more than 1 week \nwould have an immediate effect on economic growth, as the Federal \nGovernment would suspend all nonessential spending. Shutting down the \ngovernment for 3 or 4 weeks would reduce real GDP by 1.4 percentage \npoints in the fourth quarter. And a shutdown longer than 2 months would \nlikely precipitate another recession.\n  My colleagues in the House like to talk a big game about reducing the \ndeficit and doing what is fiscally responsible. Yet they are willing to \nmortgage our economy on a political gamble? Pardon me, but that is not \nhow we define fiscal responsibility in my State.\n  Here is something else Minnesotans don't call fiscally responsible: \nclosing our national parks, which generate billions of dollars in \ntourism revenues every year. If the government shuts down, so will all \n368 National Park Service sites.\n  And how about the visa processing centers? During the 1996 government \nshutdown, more than 500,000 visa applications and 200,000 passport \napplications were put on hold. We might say, why would that affect me? \nIt does. It affects jobs in the United States of America. In a State \nsuch as Minnesota where tourism is our fifth largest industry and the \nsource of 11 percent of our private sector jobs, we simply can't afford \nto let that happen. We simply can't afford for this critical industry \nto be hamstrung by political posturing on the other side of the aisle \nin Washington.\n  In addition to the impact on our tourism sector, a government \nshutdown would also have serious repercussions for industries such as \nmedical technology, something that Minnesota and Massachusetts share.\n  Without funding to keep the lights on at the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the process for approving medical devices and other \nbiotech products would grind to a standstill.\n  These are just a few examples of the industries that would be hurt by \na government shutdown.\n  If we use the 1996 impasse as a guide, we can also expect to see \ndelays in the Small Business Administration financing, a suspension of \nFederal Housing Administration insurance for people buying new homes, \nnew patients denied access into clinical research trials at the \nNational Institutes of Health. You heard correctly. If we can't reach a \ncompromise, we will all feel the negative results.\n\n  Now I want to get back to the focus of my earlier remarks, and that \nis law enforcement programs. We must be willing to do the right thing \nfor the safety of our people. When it comes to homeland security, \ncounterterrorism, and Federal law enforcement, rest assured those \nprotections will continue. But in the event of a shutdown, the Federal \nofficers who continue going to work protecting the public from violent \ncrimes, gangs, and terrorists won't be getting a paycheck. Instead, \nthey will be getting an IOU. Basically what we will be saying to these \npeople is: Thanks for putting your lives on the line. We can't pay you \nright now. And if you are lucky, maybe you will get backpay when \nCongress sorts this all out. Is that what we want to say to the people \nwho showed up first at that Boston Marathon bombing, We have an IOU for \nyou? I don't think so.\n  The strain on a shutdown on law enforcement would come at a time when \nagencies are already struggling to make ends meet in the wake of \nsequestration.\n  The new head of the FBI just talked about how sequestration would put \nhim in a position to lay off 3,000 FBI agents. I don't think that is \nwhere we want to be in this country. These are cuts to some of the most \nsuccessful crime prevention and crime-fighting programs out there.\n  Even more frustrating is that Chairman Mikulski and the Senate \nAppropriations Committee worked across party lines to draft spending \nbills for 2014 that would provide additional resources for grant \nprograms important to law enforcement.\n  Under sequestration, the COPS Program has been reduced by $22 million \ncompared to the funding level the Senate approved. Funding for drug \ncourts has also been slashed, despite the fact that drug courts \nactually save money to the tune of $6,000 per person. For every $1 \nspent on drug courts, more than $3 is saved on criminal justice costs \nalone. And when you factor in other things such as costs to victims and \nhealth care, they can save up to $27 per person.\n  Local law enforcement also relies on Byrne grants, which have been \ncut by $20 million due to sequestration.\n  As a former prosecutor, I have always believed that the No. 1 job of \ngovernment is to protect people. It is to keep people safe. It is to \nhave safe roads and bridges. If we continue to cut, to delay, and deny \ncritical funding for programs such as COPS and Byrne grants, we will be \nfailing in this most basic duty, and I refuse to let that happen.\n  Instead of threatening critical services and our economy with poison \npill partisanship, we need to focus on real solutions. This means \nagreeing to go to conference committee on the budget. For many months \nSenator Patty Murray, the head of the Budget Committee, has been asking \npermission to\n\n[[Page S6947]]\n\nsimply bring our Senate-passed budget to conference committee, where it \ncan meet up with the House budget and where we can at least try to work \nout a long-term solution. Senator McCain and Senator Collins have \njoined us in this call to be allowed to bring a long-term budget to a \nconference committee, but we have been met every step of the way with \nopposition from the other side. That is where we should be working \nthese things out. Instead, we are on the floor today to try to end the \nbrinkmanship on simply keeping the government going.\n  Secondly, we have another problem, and that is that our country will \nhit its legal borrowing limit as soon as mid-October. When this \nhappens, we will be asked to do what Congress has routinely done 70 \ntimes over the past 50 years, and that is to pay our country's bills.\n  Let me be clear. This is about making good on commitments we have \nalready made. This is about doing what regular Americans do every month \nwhen they pay their credit card bills.\n  As vice chair of the Joint Economic Committee and the chair on the \nSenate side, last week I held a hearing and released a report examining \nthe economic impact of this brinkmanship. The results aren't pretty and \nthey are based on history. Let's remember what happened the last time \nwhen we had a showdown on the debt ceiling in the summer of 2011: The \nUnited States experienced the cost of protracted brinkmanship on the \ndebt ceiling. As Congress struggled with this issue, the Dow Jones \ndropped more than 2,000 points, and Standard & Poors downgraded the \nU.S. credit rating. Consumer confidence fell, and we were out over $1 \nbillion in borrowing costs. That is on the backs of the taxpayers of \nthis country. That is what happened in 2011.\n  If we face another impasse this year, there could be very real \nramifications for businesses and for people. Interest rates could rise \non everything from credit cards and home mortgages to borrowing costs \nfor businesses, putting a real strain on families and small business \nowners, and stalling the economy just as we are at a time when we can \nexpand it, just when we are at a time when we are starting to see that \nstability grow to real growth.\n  Our country cannot afford to keep lurching from crisis to crisis. It \nis time for both parties to come together and focus on real solutions.\n  Do you know what I learned the last 24 hours, the last 2 days, \nwatching what was going on on this floor? That there are a few of my \ncolleagues who see this place as a battleground. I see it as a place to \nlook for common ground, and that is what we are supposed to be doing on \nbehalf of the American people. The battleground has to give way. We \nneed to do the work for the American people, find that common ground, \nwork together. We are going to pass a good, clean bill so that we can \ncontinue the U.S. Government and move on to work out the details of the \nbudget. That is what we need to do for our first responders, for our \npolice, for our firefighters, for those people who put their lives at \nrisk every day. That is what we need to do for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, any discussion of the \nnational security impacts of a long-term continuing resolution or a \npotential government shutdown would be incomplete without including the \npotential impact on America's 22.3 million veterans.\n  The good news is that under any scenario, veterans would still be \nable to receive health care thanks to advance funding for 2014. The bad \nnews is that most other VA programs would be shortchanged under a CR \nand crippled by a government shutdown. The VA budget would be impacted \nby the funding shortfalls or stoppages, but America's veterans would be \nthe victims.\n  VA advance funding does not extend to such important programs as \ndisability claims processing, hospital and clinic construction, or VA \ncemetery operations, to name but a few examples. Given the gravity of \nbacklogs in the VA claims processing program, the Senate CR includes a \nprovision funding claims processing at the 2014 budget request level. \nBut it does not include a package of reforms and initiatives in the \n2014 Senate MilCon/VA bill intended to improve productivity, accuracy, \nand accountability. For claims processing, a CR is less than optimal. A \ngovernment shutdown could be catastrophic.\n  The current backlog of VA disability claims stands at 435,000, an \nimprovement over the high water mark of 632,000 just 6 months ago.\n  But the strides VA has made in addressing the backlog problem would \nsuffer a severe setback under a government shutdown. Currently, the VA \nprocesses 5,500 to 6,000 claims a day, a massive improvement in \nproductivity that would be stopped in its tracks by a government \nshutdown. The longer the shutdown, the more severe the impact.\n  Think of a fender-bender in the middle of a busy freeway. Traffic \nbehind the accident backs up quickly, and the backup extends farther \nand farther as cars pile up behind it. Once the cars are towed away, \nthe backup does not magically disappear. It takes time for traffic to \nreturn to normal.\n  The same holds true for an interruption in VA claims processing. The \nVA estimates that for every week that claims processing would be halted \nunder a government shutdown, it would lose a month of progress in \nprocessing claims. Our Nation--our veterans--cannot afford this delay.\n  Claims processing would not be the only VA program imperiled by a \ngovernment shutdown. If the government shuts down, funding for payment \nof mandatory VA compensation, pension, and education benefits would run \nout by the end of October, denying a lifeline of support to thousands \nof veterans.\n  For anyone who cares about America's veterans, the notion of forcing \na government shutdown is unthinkable.\n  Passage of a clean CR through November 15 is imperative to give \nCongress time to negotiate a way forward to fund government operations, \nagency by agency, through 2014.\n  My subcommittee also funds the Defense Department's military \nconstruction program. A government shutdown would have serious \nconsequences in this area. The furloughing of civilian personnel \noverseeing construction contracts could not only disrupt and delay \nongoing projects, but could provoke contract interruption and increase \nproject costs. A CR prevents new starts so regardless of the level of \nfunding, no new MilCon projects could be undertaken in 2014 under a CR. \nA CR and government shutdown would bring DOD's MilCon program to a \nscreeching halt.\n  The CR before the Senate today buys time, without any extraneous \nriders or political histrionics. There is a time and a place for \neverything. The place for political statements is elsewhere. The time \nfor keeping the government operating until a comprehensive \nappropriations bill can be crafted is here. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the clean CR pending before the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am sorry that we are going to have to vote \ntomorrow and not today. The House is waiting for us to do something, to \nfinish this, but we have two Senators who will not allow us to do that. \nWe established that an hour or two ago. That is unfortunate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following leader remarks on Friday, \nSeptember 27, the time until 12:10 p.m. be equally divided between the \nproponents and opponents of the motion to invoke cloture on H.J. Res. \n59; that the time from 12:10 p.m. until 12:30 p.m. be reserved for the \ntwo leaders, with the final 10 minutes under the control of the \nmajority leader; that at 12:30 p.m. the Senate proceed to vote on the \nmotion to invoke closure on H.J. Res. 59; that if cloture is invoked, \nall time postcloture be yielded back; that the pending Reid amendment, \nNo. 1975, be withdrawn; that no other amendments be in order; that the \nmajority leader be recognized to make a motion to waive applicable \nbudget points of order; that if a motion to waive is agreed to, the\n\n[[Page S6948]]\n\nSenate proceed to vote in relation to the Reid amendment, No. 1974; \nthat upon disposition of the Reid amendment, the joint resolution be \nread a third time and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the \njoint resolution, as amended, if amended; finally, that all after the \nfirst vote in this sequence be 10-minute votes and there be 2 minutes \nequal divided between the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. This agreement means we will have four votes tomorrow \nbeginning about 12:30: cloture on H.J. Res 59; motion to waive budget \npoints of order; amendment No. 1974; and passage of H.J. Res. 59, as \namended, if amended. I think we will come in tomorrow about 9:30, and \nthe time will be allocated from that time until 12:10.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of the millions of \nmiddle-class families across America who feel they have been left \nbehind. Too many of these people are decent, hard-working folks who are \nunemployed or underemployed. Too many have adult children stuck living \nat home because, despite graduating from college, they are struggling \nto find work. And now, because of ObamaCare, these same young adults--\nmany of whom are older than 26--will be forced to pay more taxes or \npurchase costly government-defined health insurance.\n  In spite of the administration's best salesmanship, the law remains \nextremely unpopular. A poll conducted by the Omaha World-Herald last \nfall showed 55 percent of registered voters still favored the full \nrepeal of ObamaCare. Recent national polls indicate a similar \ndisapproval rating for the law all across the country. Part of the \nreason for the public's continued opposition is the harm that ObamaCare \nis causing our economy.\n  Let me share a story of one woman, a small business owner named \nEileen Marrison. I had the pleasure of meeting Eileen in August when I \nwas traveling my State, and I visited with her in Papillion, NE. The \nMarrison family owns and operates Two Men and a Truck. Those are \nfranchises in Omaha and Lincoln, NE. They have 30 employees in Lincoln \nand 76 in Omaha. The Marrisons provide paychecks for local families, \nand they have earned the respect of their communities.\n  Eileen Marrison, the matriarch of the family, presently offers health \ninsurance to full-time employees--36 individuals working 35 to 45 hours \nper week. She foots more than half the cost of that coverage. Since \nObamaCare changes the definition of a full-time employee, lowering the \nthreshold to 30 hours per week from 40 hours, Eileen now employs 76 \nfull-time equivalents, triggering the employer mandate. Now she must \noffer affordable coverage as defined by ObamaCare. She has to offer \nthat to all of her employees working 30 hours or more.\n  Eileen has been taking care of her employees for years, and she wants \nto continue to do so. However, ObamaCare's mandate is now placing \nadditional burdens on this family business which will require Eileen to \nmake tough decisions or incur those harmful costs.\n  I received thousands of phone calls, e-mails, and letters echoing \nEileen's concerns and urging me to repeal all or pieces of the law.\n  Another constituent, a 61-year-old retired schoolteacher from \nBeatrice, NE, recently wrote me to share that he had just received a \nletter from his insurance carrier. The news was that premiums were set \nto spike 60 percent, to $939 a month. That is half of his monthly \npension check. He says, ``We are dismayed and disappointed.''\n  Another Nebraskan, Roger from Hartington, NE, wrote:\n\n       I just wanted to let you know I got my letter from Blue \n     Cross of Nebraska. My premium went up $160 per month and my \n     total out-of-pocket risk increased from $5,000 to $12,700.\n\n  Roger continued:\n\n       On the positive side, my menopausal wife and I now have \n     maternity, drug, alcohol, pediatric, dental, and vision care!\n       President Obama promised our costs would go down and we \n     could keep our insurance if we liked it. I liked my old plan. \n     I want it back!\n\n  We no longer have to rely on these testimonials to prove that \nObamaCare is driving up the price of insurance premiums.\n  Yesterday, the Federal Department of Health and Human Services \nreleased its long-awaited report on ObamaCare premium prices offered on \nthe exchanges. The numbers for Nebraska proved that premiums will rise \ndramatically. In its analysis of the data, Forbes magazine published an \narticle noting there was a 279-percent increase when comparing the \ncheapest plans offered to Nebraska men. For Nebraska women, there was a \n227-percent increase when comparing the cheapest plans. That is more \nthan triple the current rate. Those numbers are absolutely staggering. \nThe average premium for a 27-year-old for the most basic plan, the \nbronze plan, is $159 before tax credits. Currently, that same 27-year-\nold can find a premium for $68 in Nebraska. So we are looking at a \nsignificant increase in costs.\n  Based on a Manhattan Institute analysis of the report:\n\n       ObamaCare will increase underlying insurance rates for \n     younger men by an average of 97 to 99 percent, and for \n     younger women by an average of 55 to 62 percent. Despite \n     these rates, the plan includes fewer in network doctors and \n     hospitals than current plans. And many of the lowest-cost \n     plans will likely carry high deductibles.\n\n  One insurer found that ``for the cheapest bronze plans, the average \ndeductible was $5,000.'' How is that possibly affordable?\n  In August the administration announced another major delay, this time \nto the part of the health care law limiting patients' out-of-pocket \nexpenses. Rather than capping costs for individuals and families, as \nrequired by the law, the delay of this key provision guarantees \nObamaCare will be anything but affordable.\n  Of course, there are many other problems with the law beyond the \nincreases in premiums, which is why I have been promoting the complete \nrepeal of the law, and I support defunding it.\n  For example, there are serious concerns about possible identity theft \nfor those participating in the new health exchanges. Why? Because the \nadministration failed to independently test the security for its \nFederal Data Services Hub, which will store huge amounts of people's \nprivate, personal information.\n  The report released by the Department of Health and Human Services \ninspector general stated:\n\n       Several critical tasks remain to be completed in a short \n     period of time, such as the final independent testing of the \n     hub's security controls, remediating security vulnerabilities \n     identified during testing, and obtaining the security \n     authorization decision for the hub before opening the \n     exchanges.\n\n  The administration has until this Tuesday to complete these critical \ntasks. I, for one, remain skeptical that these tasks will be completed \nin time, opening up security risks for individuals who do participate \nin the exchanges.\n  Today the administration tacitly admitted once again that ObamaCare \nis not ready for prime time when it announced another delay. This time \nthey are postponing online enrollment in some of the small business \nexchanges scheduled to open on Tuesday.\n  The irony, of course, is that news of this latest delay broke as the \nPresident was delivering a speech criticizing Republicans for their \neffort to defund or delay the law altogether. It seems reasonable to \nask: Where is the delay for the American people? Where is the delay for \nmiddle-class citizens such as the 61-year-old retired teacher from \nBeatrice, NE? Is that an extreme position? I certainly don't think so.\n  In short, this law remains fatally flawed. The American people \ndeserve better than selective delays, unfair treatment, and broken \npromises.\n  For me, the fight over ObamaCare has nothing to do with politics or \nwith ideology. It has to do with standing for small business owners \nsuch as Eileen Marrison. It is about standing for middle-class families \nwho aren't asking government for a hand up, they are just asking that \nthe government stop holding them down.\n\n[[Page S6949]]\n\n  We are a country that looks to build a brighter future for our \npeople. We are a country that looks to help and lift up people. That is \nwhat America is all about. It is about giving voice to millions of \nAmericans--those middle-class families who are feeling left behind--who \nwould rather have the Federal Government focusing on ways to create \njobs so they can bring home a decent paycheck.\n  Let me be perfectly clear: I have no intention of standing down in \nthis fight. It is why I was sent here, and it is what Nebraskans expect \nfrom me. It is the only way we will ever be able to turn our economy \naround and build that brighter future for all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I come here this evening with no notes, so \nhopefully I will be able to communicate my feelings and concerns from \nthe heart and from the brain about the tasks we are about. We have been \nfocused so much on the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, and \nrightfully so. I consider it one of the most damaging pieces of \nlegislation ever to pass a Congress and be signed by a President.\n  I want to start by pointing out something that is receiving, in my \nview, inadequate attention. We are back on the Senate floor with a \ncontinuing resolution. It is almost as if passing a continuing \nresolution has become the norm, and has almost become a way of life.\n  I have the privilege of serving on the Appropriations Committee. Our \ntask--and what I would consider a very basic task--is to pass a budget. \nThis is the first time the Senate in 3--almost 4 years--has passed a \nbudget. The House passed a budget. Yet there is no reconciliation and \nno success in the effort to conference that bill, and so we have no \nbudget framework to go by. The other requirement--again, one that ought \nto be so basic--is to pass appropriations bills within that budgetary \nframework.\n  We are here--almost on September 30--and I would remind my colleagues \nthat not 1 appropriations bill out of the 13 appropriations bills that \nshould be passed by September 30 has passed the Senate. It seems to me \nthat it is important to highlight the fact that this place, once again, \nis failing to do its job. There has not been 1 appropriations bill out \nof 13.\n  Why is passing a continuing resolution important? Without it--or if \nwe just do it at will--the Appropriations Committee and the Senate, on \nbehalf of the American people, are never required to prioritize our \nspending. Does anyone not think the priorities of this Congress should \nhave changed from last year to this year? Have things not changed in \nour country, in which, if we were doing our work, we would decide how \nmuch money each program should receive based upon its effectiveness, \nits efficiency, whether it is a proper role for the Federal Government, \nthe changing nature, the economic environment of our country? Yet, no, \none more time we are here to pass a continuing resolution.\n\n  The thing that troubles me perhaps the most about this topic is that \nit is just a given. We are not complaining about the passage of a \ncontinuing resolution; we are focused on a very significant provision \nin that continuing resolution that very well may be removed tomorrow \nwhen the Senate acts.\n  The Appropriations Committee needs to work. Just as we always raise \nthe debt ceiling every time the debt ceiling is met, if we always agree \nto raise the debt ceiling, what is the effect of a debt ceiling? If we \nalways, every year, pass a continuing resolution, why have an \nappropriations process in which we are to establish priorities on \nbehalf of the American people as far as how their tax dollars are \nspent? We are failing miserably, once again, the American people, and \nit is just happening as if it is of no consequence.\n  I want the appropriations process to work. I want to eliminate \nfunding for some programs that aren't our business, that the Federal \nGovernment should never have been involved in in the first place. I \nwant us to establish the amount of money we can afford to spend on \nprograms within the Federal agencies and departments. It may be true \nthat there are some things on which we might want to spend more money.\n  I would remind our colleagues that, in my view, the primary \nresponsibility of the Federal Government is to defend our country, and \nwhat we do in regard to defense spending has a huge consequence upon \nour ability to fill that vital mission, that constitutional \nresponsibility. We take on too much to deal with.\n  I have always believed the view that if the 10th Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution had ever been enforced in the way I or most Kansans \nwould consider its words to mean, our Federal Government and our \nlives--more importantly, our lives--would be so much different in the \nUnited States. The 10th Amendment says that all those powers not \nspecifically granted to the Federal Government are hereby reserved to \nthe States and people. Yet government continues to grow, and we have an \nappropriations process that has failed to do anything about curbing \nthat spending.\n  The issue that is front and center is the President's health care \nreform measure that passed 3 years ago and is being implemented on \nOctober 1, when many of its provisions will kick in, become viable, and \nthe American people will begin to feel the consequences even more so \nthan they have to date. There is no question the Affordable Care Act, \nas I said earlier, is the most damaging piece of legislation passed, \ncertainly in my time in Congress. Not a surprise: I voted against it. \nPerhaps not a surprise: I offered the first legislation to repeal the \nAffordable Care Act after it was passed.\n  The House is often criticized for time and time again passing \nlegislation to repeal or to defund the Affordable Care Act. Yet, if one \nbelieves it is so damaging to the country, isn't it our responsibility \nto do everything within our power to change the policies of Washington, \nDC?\n  We have before us tomorrow the opportunity to defund the Affordable \nCare Act. Those who count votes around here say that is not going to \nhappen, that it is a lost cause. But it is important for us to do \neverything we can to make certain the consequences that are so damaging \nto America and to Americans are avoided.\n  For most of my time in the House of Representatives and now the U.S. \nSenate, I have chaired the Rural Health Care Coalition. I care about \nthe access to health care by citizens across our country who happen to \nlive in rural areas and core centers of cities and urban centers of our \ncountry--high Medicare populations, high Medicaid populations. Yet I \nhave no doubt that with the passage and implementation of the \nAffordable Care Act, hospitals who serve rural communities will be \ngreatly damaged and we will lose many hospitals. When we lose a \nhospital, we lose the doctor, the pharmacy; we may lose the nursing \nhome or the assisted living center--huge consequences to people who \nhave paid taxes all of their lives through their employment to support \nSocial Security and Medicare. Yet, because they choose to live in a \nrural community, the chances of them being able to access the health \ncare that to a large degree they pay for disappears.\n  It seems to me that the stories being told on the Senate floor--and I \nlistened to the Senator from Nebraska moments ago talk about examples \nwithin her State and her constituents, describing the problems created \nby the Affordable Care Act. We all have those examples. I have no doubt \nthat Democrats hear the same stories Republicans hear. Yet we can't \nseem to be responsible enough to make the changes. We will have the \nopportunity to repeal--to defund, I guess is the better way of saying \nit--the Affordable Care Act, and we ought to do it.\n  The focus today and yesterday and the day before has been on \nRepublicans and the strategy of how to defund the Affordable Care Act. \nIt is pretty irrelevant in the overall scheme of things how we do it; \nit is whether we get it done. And we ought to be expecting Democratic \nSenators, my colleagues from the other side of the aisle, to be just as \nhelpful in trying to change, defund, repeal, alter the Affordable Care \nAct on behalf of our country.\n  The focus ought not to just be on how we do it among Republicans; it \nought to be on questioning my colleagues about whether they are willing \nto step forward and admit there are problems with legislation they \nsupported. It is\n\n[[Page S6950]]\n\nnot just a Democratic problem. I remember legislation that I voted \nagainst that was supported by Republicans overwhelmingly--in fact, \nbroadly supported. After it passed--I was on the losing side, a very \nsmall minority--I spent my next few years trying to get it amended. No \none likes to admit it when they vote for a bill and then it is a \nproblem. But who would be surprised? What American would not think--\nAmericans have great common sense and judgment. What American wouldn't \nthink that the passage of a bill with thousands of pages late at night \nby the slimmest of margins, with no bipartisan support, wouldn't have \nsome problems that need to be addressed?\n  I talked about how our process here is dysfunctional when it comes to \nthe appropriations process. I heard colleagues earlier this afternoon \nsaying we ought to work together and come to the floor and offer \namendments. Here is the problem: There will be no opportunity for any \namendment to be offered other than the amendment offered by the \nmajority leader. So we are saying that we could maybe cooperate to find \nsome solutions to the problems that come from the Affordable Care Act, \nbut, oh, by the way, the only amendment that is really going to be made \nin order is changing the expiration date of the continuing resolution \nand removing the provision that provides for no funding for ObamaCare.\n  This is one of the most important votes I will ever face--or one of \nthe most important issues, is probably a better way of saying it, I \nwill ever deal with as a Member of the Senate. How we deal with the \nhealth care of millions of Americans has a huge consequence--economic, \ntheir health, their well-being, their family, their ability to get a \njob. Yet we are going to dispense with this issue in a matter of \nminutes tomorrow with one vote on an amendment to remove the defunding \nof the Affordable Care Act.\n  Wouldn't the Senate and wouldn't America be better served if we were \ngiven the opportunity--again, if there are Senators on the Democratic \nside who agree there are problems, aren't there issues we could raise \nthat would allow us to have a debate and a vote and determine where we \ncould find some way to get rid of the ominous, threatening nature of \nthe Affordable Care Act?\n  The Senator from Nebraska talked about her examples. Time and time \nagain we hear about the amount of money the Affordable Care Act is \ngoing to cost, about the premiums going up. We have seen the numbers \nthat have just been released. For my State of Kansas, there will be \nsignificant increases in the premiums for anyone who is participating \nin the exchange.\n  I have talked to business folks. I am certainly a rural Kansan, and I \ncare a lot about rural America. I have always tried to explain to my \ncolleagues that where I come from, whether or not there is a grocery \nstore in town determines in many ways the future of the community. Many \nof my urban colleagues have their issues and don't necessarily \nunderstand what happens in a rural community if we lose a grocery \nstore. But the conversation with the grocer just within the last month \nor so was this: The neighboring town is losing its grocery store. They \nhave asked me to come in and buy it. I have looked at it. I could make \nmoney. It would work. I could save the grocery store in the neighboring \ntown, but I am not going to do that because that would put me over 50 \nemployees and the Affordable Care Act would kick in.\n  A competitor who is across the street decided to in a sense quit \ncompeting--at least in one aspect of their business--and share \nemployees so that people now work part-time at one business and work \nfor the competitor the other half of the day to avoid the consequences \nof the Affordable Care Act.\n  Educators, our teachers, our school superintendents, our enterprises \nthat come together and create co-ops for our schools to provide special \neducation to our students, funding is very difficult in education \nacross our country. State legislatures struggle with their budgets. Yet \nthe amount of money necessary to comply with the Affordable Care Act \nmeans there are going to be fewer paraprofessionals in the classroom \nassisting students with disabilities because they no longer can afford \nto have an employee considered a full-time employee and provide their \nhealth care.\n  This legislation is damaging to the country. It is damaging to our \ncountry's future. It is damaging to the American people. It reduces the \nopportunity that I believe Americans always have had to get the best \nhealth care among countries in the world.\n  The Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, needs to be defunded. I would say \nto my Republican colleagues, we then have a responsibility to have a \nsolution, a plan. Our health care system is not perfect. We have the \nopportunity to present better ideas, but that can't happen in a Senate \nthat doesn't allow an amendment to a bill that deals with health care \nbecause of the House amendment. We won't have the opportunity to \npresent our ideas or offer amendments that will make a difference.\n  One could say: Well, this isn't the place. The continuing resolution \nis not the place to have a debate about health care and how to replace \nthe Affordable Care Act.\n  OK. I ask my colleagues, the leaders of the Senate, when is? When is \nthe last time we have had a bill on the floor that would give us the \nopportunity to offer an amendment, to have a debate, to offer ideas \nabout how to fix health care? It hasn't happened. I predict, based upon \nthe Senate's schedule in the time I have been here, we are not going to \nhave that opportunity. We ought to as Republicans. We ought to as \nSenators. It doesn't have to be partisan. There ought to be commonsense \nsolutions. There are. It is not that there ought to be; there are. We \nall have ideas about how to fix our health care system as it was before \nthe passage of the Affordable Care Act, and we need to defund the \nAffordable Care Act to give us a chance to go back and do it right, do \nit better.\n  Again, I would encourage my colleagues, the next time we have the \nopportunity, and perhaps that will--I hope this is not true, but \nperhaps it is only true if we have Senators who are different from the \nSenators we have now. One would think that regardless of one's party \naffiliation, a U.S. Senator ought to be willing to deal with this most \nsignificant, important issue--the lives of Americans. It doesn't matter \nabout one's party affiliation. If one cares about people--well, in this \nSenate, apparently, if the vote counters are right and no Democrat will \nvote to defund ObamaCare, then there will be no opportunity for us in \nthe future to put our ideas, their ideas, all of our ideas on the floor \nfor consideration by Senators and by the American people.\n\n  Common sense tells us that we would fix the health care system a \npiece at a time and do it with commonsense, free market principles that \nwould create a greater opportunity for more Americans to be able to \nafford health care. Health care is expensive. Health care insurance is \nexpensive in this country, no doubt about it. The issue of preexisting \nconditions needs to be addressed. It affects people in their lives and \nin their jobs on a daily basis. But, no, we are going to cast one vote \nthat gives us no opportunity to solve, to address, to deal with piece \nby piece the broken system that now the Affordable Care Act provides \nus.\n  The implementation of this act has been a disaster. No one can \nobjectively look at what has transpired and think this is the way it \nshould be done. No one could look at the consequences of the Affordable \nCare Act and say: This is a great thing. It is perfect. We don't want \nto make any changes.\n  Every Republican will vote tomorrow to defund--at least if the \nprognosticators are true; I expect it to be the case--every Republican \nwill vote to defund the Affordable Care Act. We are united in that. We \nneed colleagues from the other side of the aisle to join us in the \neffort to make sure Americans have access to affordable health care and \nthe Federal Government operates within the limits of the Constitution \nin providing the environment in which that occurs. These are serious \nissues. The Affordable Care Act needs to be defunded. And the Senate \nneeds to operate in a way that then allows all of us to come together \nin a manner that allows us to help Americans better afford health care \nfor themselves and their families.\n\n  This system is broken. The Senate does not function right. Mostly \nwhat I\n\n[[Page S6951]]\n\nknew about the Senate before I came here was what I read in history. \nThis place does not work the way it has for centuries during the life \nof our country.\n  The issues we face are serious. It is not about politics. It is not \nabout posturing. It is about whether every American is going to have \nthe ability with the Affordable Care Act to take care of themselves and \ntheir families in the way they want to.\n  Promises that were made--easily forgotten, apparently; certainly not \nkept. You will be able to keep your health care insurance if you want. \nI have seen so much evidence to the contrary. Your premiums will not go \nup. We know that is not true. Time and time again, the promises that \nwere made about the Affordable Care Act are broken. Yet there is no \nwill on the part of the U.S. Senate to change course.\n  It is time to admit it was a mistake. It is time to admit the bill is \nsignificantly flawed. It is time to admit the Federal Government is \ninvolved in issues that are not well-handled by the Federal Government \nin one broad sweep. It is time to admit that not one sized solution \nfits all problems, that not everyone in the United States is the same, \nthat my colleagues who come from other places are different and their \nconstituents are different and their health care delivery system is \ndifferent than it is in my home State of Kansas.\n  I would make the appeal on behalf of most Kansans to give us the \nchance to set the record straight, to do it right, to begin again. I \nask my colleagues tomorrow to vote to defund the Affordable Care Act. \nIt is time for ObamaCare to come to a conclusion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, I rise to speak to an \namendment I filed on H.J. Res. 59, the continuing resolution. It is a \npretty simple amendment. It simply prohibits that funds be used for a \ngovernment contribution for the health insurance of Members of Congress \nand their staffs under ObamaCare.\n  Now, you might ask, well, why would I, as a former employer, want to \nprevent an employer from contributing to health plans for Members of \nCongress and their staffs?\n  Well, the simple reason is, because of the passage of ObamaCare, it \nexpressly prohibited funds from being contributed by the Federal \nGovernment to Members of Congress and their staff's health care plans.\n  I do not believe the President has any legal authority and I \ncertainly do not believe the Office of Personnel Management has the \nauthority to circumvent the Affordable Care Act.\n  I am exactly on board with Senator Moran in certainly wishing that we \ncould repeal the health care law in its entirety, that we could defund \nit, that we could do anything we could to limit the damage. But the \nfact is, it is the law of the land, and we need to respect the law of \nthe land.\n  I have looked through the legislative history of the passage of the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It seems very clear what \nthe intent of Congress was.\n  Back on September 29, 2009, as this was being debated by the Senate \nFinance Committee, Senator Grassley offered an amendment that was \nadopted without objection that would require Members of Congress and \ntheir staff to ``use their employer contribution . . . to purchase \ncoverage through a state-based exchange, rather than using the \ntraditional selection of plans offered through the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Plan.''\n  Again, that amendment was adopted without objection. Apparently, \nMembers of Congress at that point in time thought that the State-based \nexchanges were going to offer such fabulous health care that they \nwanted to make sure that Members of Congress and their staff could \navail themselves of that opportunity.\n  So on October 19, 2009, that Grassley provision was incorporated into \nthe Finance Committee's America's Healthy Future Act. But there was an \naddition to that amendment made that basically provided for an employer \ncontribution. Section (B)(ii) says:\n\n       the employer contributions may be made directly to an \n     exchange for payment to an offerer.\n  So at that point in time it was the express will of Congress that the \nemployer--the Federal Government--could actually contribute to the \nhealth care plan purchased through the exchange.\n  The problem arises, however, that when Senator Reid actually offered \nthe language for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on \nNovember 18, 2009, it specifically said:\n\n       the only health plans that the Federal Government may make \n     available to Members of Congress and congressional staff with \n     respect to their service as a Member of Congress or \n     congressional staff shall be health plans that are one--\n       (l) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this \n     Act); or\n       (ll) offered through an Exchange established under this Act \n     (or an amendment made by this Act).\n\n  There was absolutely no provision made whatsoever for an employer \ncontribution to those health care plans.\n  On December 24, 2009, Christmas Eve, the Senate passed that bill \nmaking no provision for an employer contribution to those plans \npurchased through an exchange. It was passed on pure party lines, 60 to \n40.\n  On March 21, 2010, the House passed the exact same legislation. But \nthen there was a debate in terms of reconciliation, and Senator \nGrassley once again offered an amendment that would have provided an \nemployer contribution to those plans purchased through the exchange. It \nwas explicitly stated that employer contribution could be made. But \nthat amendment was voted down. It was voted down. The vote was 43 to \n56. All but three Democratic Senators voted no. In the end, the health \ncare law was passed. That reconciliation was passed on March 25, 2010.\n  Now, it happened recently--on July 31, 2013--that President Obama \ncame over here to the Hill and met with Democratic Senators because, as \nNancy Pelosi famously stated, we have to pass this health care law \nbefore we can figure out what is in it, before we know what is in it. \nWell, once Senators found out what was in it--that they were going to \nhave to purchase their health care through an exchange and the Federal \nGovernment could not make any payment for those health care plans--they \npanicked and they asked President Obama to please correct that. So \nPresident Obama heard their plea and directed his Office of Personnel \nManagement to propose a rule that would allow the Federal Government to \npay or make a contribution to those State-based exchange plans.\n  Now, I would argue that the OPM--President Obama--has no legal \nauthority whatsoever to make those contributions, which is the purpose \nof my amendment. There will be millions of Americans who will lose \ntheir employer-sponsored health insurance for various reasons but \nbecause of the passage of the health care law. Once they have lost that \ncoverage, they--every other American--will have to purchase insurance \neither in the open market or through a State-based or Federal exchange. \nTheir employers will be barred. They will not have the opportunity to \nmake an employer-contribution to help pay for those health care plans.\n  The only way a normal American gets to have any subsidy in those \nexchanges is if their income qualifies them for a subsidy under the \nAffordable Care Act. The only Americans who now--because of this OPM \nruling--will actually have their employer be able to make a \ncontribution are Members of Congress and their staffs. That is simply \nwrong. That is special treatment. It really should not stand.\n  So my amendment basically acknowledges that this is the law of land; \nthat President Obama--the Office of Personnel Management--has no legal \nauthority to have that contribution take place. So it simply prohibits \nfunds to be used for a government contribution for the health insurance \nof Members of Congress and their staffs under ObamaCare.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the House-\npassed continuing resolution now pending before the Senate.\n  Once again the Senate is considering a last-minute continuing \nresolution rather than regular-order appropriations bills. Handling the \nannual appropriations process in this way is a bad\n\n[[Page S6952]]\n\ndeal for the American people, and it is a deal we have gone through for \nthe last 4 years now without passing appropriations bills and having to \ndeal with a continuing resolution or an omnibus, which is simply a \nterrible way to run this government.\n  Congress should be passing appropriations bills in regular order \ninstead of waiting until the eleventh hour. I know the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and the ranking member are very much in favor \nof doing that and are ready to come to the floor to do that. But yet \nonce again we are seeing the majority leader not let them come to the \nfloor with those bills. This only creates uncertainty in the financial \nmarket and hampers America's economic recovery.\n  Unless we come to an agreement, the government is going to shut down \nMonday night because Congress failed to pass a bill that would fund the \ngovernment for only a few months. And to what end? We will find \nourselves back in this position in either November or December, when we \nwill have to pass yet another continuing resolution. This is a foolish \nway to run the U.S. Government.\n  I was here in 1995 during the last government shutdown. It cast a \npall on the American people, seeded distrust of government, and \nunnecessarily harmed our economy. It was not a pretty sight from either \na political standpoint on either side of the aisle or from the \nstandpoint of the American people or the government employees. No one \nwins when the government is shut down, least of all the American \npeople.\n  We are all aware of the issues that have thus far slowed down the \nprogress of this bill. While there may be differences of opinion on our \nside of the aisle about tactics, let me tell you--let there be no \ndoubt--we are all unified in believing that ObamaCare should be stopped \nand should be defunded.\n  I was here on this floor a few years back when we fought tooth and \nnail to stop passage of ObamaCare. I believed it to be the worst piece \nof legislation I had seen in my now going on 19 years of serving in the \nU.S. Congress. And it still is the worst piece of legislation and the \nmost damaging piece of legislation to the American people that I have \nseen in those 19 years.\n  As the October 1 enrollment date nears, President Obama's signature \nlaw continues to face several significant problems. Employers are \ncutting jobs and slashing employees' hours; businesses and labor unions \nare unhappy and want to be exempted from the law; families are \nconfused, and insurance premiums for people who cannot afford them in \nthe first place are now skyrocketing. In my home State of Georgia \nalone, our insurance commissioner has warned us that we could see \npremium increases as high as 198 percent on middle-income families. \nOther States have reported similar increases. So it is no surprise that \na majority of Americans believe ObamaCare should be repealed and should \nbe replaced.\n  I remain as committed as ever to dismantle and defund this law before \nit has a chance to further damage our economy and to replace it with a \nmeaningful reform of our health care system.\n  The continuing resolution delivered by the House of Representatives \nto the Senate funds the government while defunding ObamaCare. It is \nwhat the American people want, and it is a bill I support. I will \noppose any attempt by Majority Leader Reid to strip defunding language \nfrom this bill.\n  However, while I believe ObamaCare is a serious threat to the future \nof our Nation's economy, allowing a prolonged government shutdown would \nbe counterproductive. My priority has always been the well-being of \nGeorgians, as well as the American people, and I cannot support a \nstrategy that could cause Americans to suffer unnecessarily. Further \nharm to our already fragile economy is not a course we should pursue, \nnor should it be a price our friends on the other side of the aisle are \nwilling to pay just to uphold the President's signature law.\n  This fight is long from over. It is something Republicans have been \nfighting since 2009, since we first tried to stop ObamaCare from \nbecoming law. I am grateful that this debate has brought the problems \nwith this law back into the spotlight and look forward to repealing and \nreplacing this law at the end of the day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. PRYOR). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, a lot has been said in the last few days. I \nguess the issue is not everybody has said it. I am not sure that two \npeople have been closer to the progress and the process of the \nAffordable Care Act than Dr. Tom Coburn and myself. We were in it in \ncommittee along with other Members.\n  The fact that I am not embracing a strategy to close down the \ngovernment is real important. It is because at the end of the day and \nwe open the government, the way the statute is, there is the Affordable \nCare Act. It is still there. I did not come to Washington to embrace \nstrategies that do not achieve solutions. I came to find solutions to \nbig issues so the next generation can benefit from them.\n  Do not misunderstand me. There is no bigger critic in Washington, DC, \nthan the Senator from North Carolina. As a matter of fact, in the \ncommittee, I counted 58 votes on 58 amendments where we voted to kill \nthe health care bill. I think my record stands for being opposed to \nthis legislation.\n  Senator Coburn and I have introduced more health care proposals than \nthe rest of the Congress combined--options, replacements. We have stood \non this floor hour after hour on the Affordable Care Act and shared \nwith the American people why this was a bad move. We have quoted \nindividuals who lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n  Their Chief Actuary told us, before we passed this bill in this body, \nthat this will close community hospitals, it would increase premiums, \nit would deprive people of health care. But the Congress of the United \nStates and the President of the United States signed this law into \nstatute.\n  There is only one way to kill a law once a law is in statute; that \nis, to pass a bill that is signed by a President that reverses that. To \nsome degree, this is civics 101. It is an understanding of the \nlegislative process. It was not the first time I disagreed with \nsomething this body had done. Let me assure you, it will not be the \nlast time. But I also understand the way that we change this. It is not \nthe way we are attempting to do it right now.\n  So what have we seen in the short period that we have gone through \nthis? As we move up to October 1 and these new exchanges are rolled \nout, we have seen premiums go up. We have seen doctors retire. We have \nseen health care professionals move from rural America to urban areas. \nWe have seen the health care infrastructure scared to death of what is \naround the corner. We have seen premiums rise.\n  If there is anything that is wrong, it is the title of the bill, the \nAffordable Care Act. We have made health care less affordable for more \nAmericans. Let me say that again. This act has made health care less \naffordable for more Americans. It has tripled, at a minimum, the cost \nof a health care premium for somebody 30 years or under--tripled, at a \nminimum.\n  This is a group who is targeted for enrollment. They would not enroll \nwhen the premium was one-third of the cost it is today. We have heard \npeople say that Members of Congress are trying to protect their own \nsubsidy. Members of Congress are not going to take the subsidy. We \npassed legislation, but at the end of the day, the public pressure will \nbe such that no one up here will take the subsidy.\n  But if we are going to treat Federal workers one way, then treat all \nof them the same way. Do not pick and choose who--the ones who work on \nthe Hill, the ones who work in our offices, not ones who are in \ncommittees, not ones who work at the FDA, the EPA or whatever. Let's \ninclude everybody.\n  If we want an exchange to work, then we have to enroll as many people \nand we have to have robust competition. The way this is set up we are \ngoing to have low enrollment. The way insurers have responded to the \nexchanges--in my State, we have one insurer that has\n\n[[Page S6953]]\n\nentered the exchange to insure the entire State and one insurer that is \nrepresenting 10 counties out of 100. That is not competition. That is \nalmost a monopoly. I do not blame the one that is in all by themselves. \nI blame what we designed, where we did not empower States to actually \ndesign things that fit their health care infrastructure and their \nState, where individuals could buy insurance based upon their age and \ntheir income and their health condition.\n  We said, no, if you do not buy this plan, then you are going to pay a \npenalty. We have heard a lot of debate about the process, but we have \nnot heard as much debate about the specifics of this legislation. It is \nbad for the American people. Regardless of the outcome of tomorrow's \nvotes, this legislation is still going to be in statute. It is still \ngoing to be implemented on October 1.\n  I hope all of the thousands and hundreds of thousands of people who \nhave responded to the request to call--and they don't always know why, \nexcept they do not like this health care plan--when tomorrow's vote is \nover, do not go away. The pressure has to be on this institution to \nmake the changes.\n  Most Americans do not know that we are going to start taxing--or we \nare already taxing the manufacturers of medical devices 1.5 percent. \nThey pay a surcharge to fund ObamaCare. We are going to charge, in the \nexchanges, at 2.3 percent, I believe, a health insurance premium tax \nfor every person who purchases health insurance.\n  We have to ask ourselves: If we are going to tax devices and we are \ngoing to tax the insurance premiums, how in the world can the price of \nhealth care go down? It cannot. This is common sense and math matched \nup. It has to force health care costs up. That is, in fact, what every \nAmerican sees.\n  Even your employer's insurance, if you are lucky enough to still have \nan employer that is providing it, your health care premium is going up \nnext year. If you are in an exchange, your premium cost is going up \nnext year. Who does it benefit? It benefited maybe people who had \npreexisting conditions and they could not purchase insurance. You know \nwhat the first act of the Affordable Care Act was? It was to create a \nnational pool of individuals with preexisting conditions and they would \nall be offered insurance.\n  What happened? When about 20-some-percent of them got enrolled, the \nfund ran out of money and the one population that this bill was sold to \nprotect, almost 80 percent of them, were left out in the cold with no \noptions. It has failed since the first step.\n  What I hope is that American people will not leave this debate and \nsay we have done our best. We have not done our best. The Nation is \nbetting on us to continue on this. Our children deserve whatever it \ntakes for us to accomplish it.\n  But as I started, let me say to the body, our strategy to get here \nwas flawed. I know it sounded good, but it does not work. The only way \nto eliminate a bill that is in statute is to pass a bill and have it \nsigned by a President that reverses that statute.\n  I am glad we have had this debate. I am glad the American people are \nnow engaged in it. I do not think this will be the last discussion we \nhave on the Affordable Care Act. I will assure you that as I have been \nbefore, I will be again on this floor debating my colleagues as \naggressively and fairly as I can about what is wrong with this bill and \nwhy it should be reversed and why it should be replaced.\n  I thank my colleague from Alaska.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. To my colleague from North Carolina, thank you for the \npart about explaining the process. Some people think by tomorrow if \nthere is a vote on defunding, suddenly something happens. Thank you for \npointing out the issue of the statute. We may not agree on the total \npicture, but I have presented lots of ideas on how to fix the health \ncare act. I would be anxious to work on that as we pass by tomorrow. I \nthank the Senator for his comments.\n  I know in the last 48 hours or longer we have been talking about a \nlot of issues. We have been talking about health care, and I can read \nall kinds of stories about people who called me, such as the 50-year-\nold male from rural Alaska who was self-employed. He had lung cancer. \nToday, because of ACHIA and the ability to get into that high-risk \npool, he now is living a good life, healthier, and running his \nbusiness.\n  I can go through all kinds of stories, but I don't want us to forget \nthe big issue that is facing us Tuesday; that is, the risk of a \ngovernment shutdown and what that means. We can talk about health care \nfor a long time. We will for generations, and they have done it for \ngenerations before I even got here. We need to focus on the big issue \nthat faces us; that is, this shutdown that is potentially in front of \nus.\n  The inability of Congress to pass a budget, pass annual \nappropriations bills, address these harmful automatic budget cuts known \naround here as sequester, because of true political brinksmanship, is \nhonestly shameful and not why I came to Congress. When the budget \npassed, I didn't vote for it, but it passed.\n  The House has a budget, it passed. Now for some reason we can't get \npeople from the minority to sit down and let us move to a conference \ncommittee to figure this out. To me, it is amazing. It is a simple \nthing.\n  For the time I have been here, 3 years at minimum, we have been \nhearing there is no budget passed. There is one passed. I didn't vote \nfor the one that passed--it had too many taxes--but it did pass.\n  Let's get on with the conference committee and figure it out. The \nPresiding Officer, my colleague from Montana, and I are on the \nAppropriations Committee. We passed bills out of the Appropriations \nCommittee and most of them passed in some form of bipartisanship--not \n100 percent but in some form. Bringing those forward would be helpful. \nIt would help us to do the job we were sent to do on an annual basis; \nthat is, to get our budget moving forward.\n  I came to get the job done. I came to Washington to represent Alaska. \nI didn't come to participate in this back-and-forth showmanship that \nhas to go on in order for someone to get some highlight on TV or be \nable to get some byline on TV or whatever it might be. These games that \nare being played and played on the Senate floor are affecting our \nnational homeland security.\n  Think about it. What is it like for a Federal employee today as they \nwatch these shenanigans that go on. If you are one of the 5,000 \ndedicated Department of Defense employees in Alaska, you didn't get \npaid for 6 days already this year because of sequestration. Now you are \nwondering if you are going to get a paycheck on time or face more \nfurloughs because this institution may not be able to pass a clean \ncontinuing resolution.\n  For those who are watching, the continuing resolution says the budget \nwe have is going to continue for a short time while we try to get our \nappropriations bills to the floor so we can move those forward. It is \nnot complicated. It keeps the government running, and it is the way we \nmove this system forward, but it is not the right approach. We need to \nhave regular order for our appropriations bills and get rid of the \nsequestration issue once and for all. Don't be confused about the \nissue. I know people like to complain about the Federal Government. We \nare the largest service provider in the country. We provide services.\n  We don't make widgets. We produce service. We build roads. We are out \nthere taking care of forest fires when they are happening. We are \ntaking care of our veterans. We are making sure we are protected in the \nhomeland as well as across the world with our national defense. The \nlist goes on and on. We are a service company.\n  As I stand here, I am honestly stunned we are on the verge again. I \ndon't know how many times we have been on the edge, just hanging over \nthe edge of what might happen. Will we close down the government?\n  I am not here to do that. As painful as these days are in going \nthrough the process, we need to move forward. We cannot delay military \nmembers' paychecks, leaving them wondering if they are going to get \npaid again or if they can pay their bills on time, knowing we will face \nthe same situation again and again in a few months. We need to finish \nthis so we can move on to the annual Department of Defense bill to \ncontinue to fund this Federal Government.\n  Many of our military members are also wondering if they will be \ntraining,\n\n[[Page S6954]]\n\nwaiting for the missions we call them out to do. Commanders can't plan \na training exercise now, such as the Red Flag-Alaska, which is a \ncritical training program, not only for our military but our allies. \nThey don't know how much money they will have in the next fiscal year \nto plan. They can't just decide on a Thursday, Friday, and the next \nweek we are doing a massive military mission. It takes months of \nplanning, but they can't plan if they don't have the resources.\n  Military leaders are not only losing sleep over the rogue nations \nsuch as Iran and North Korea, they are losing sleep over not having the \nfunds to pay their workforce and breaking faith with their troops as we \nask them to do so much. We are asking the one organization we rely on \nto be ready 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, and to stay \nready amidst uncertainty and potential shutdowns.\n  We are asking its members to carry on without expecting pay or money \nto train. It is unrealistic, it is unreasonable, and it is risky for \nour national security.\n  Our Nation's veterans--and we have 77,000 veterans in Alaska--are \nwondering what the shutdown means for the claims they are waiting for. \nThey are wondering if the process will create even lengthier delays in \nan already unacceptably slow process. I know the Presiding Officer and \nI have worked to try to streamline this process to get these claims \nresolved after hundreds of days of delay.\n  Our Nation's homeless veterans are wondering if they will be able to \nget their housing vouchers or lose them in budget cuts or if they will \nhave to sleep on the streets after serving our country because we can't \npass a continuing resolution and a budget.\n  In Alaska, let me tell you what that is like in October, moving into \nNovember and into December. Sleeping on the streets is not a \ncomfortable situation. Sleeping on the streets, period, is not a \ncomfortable situation. But when you are in those cold situations, it is \neven worse.\n  We are hurting local economies and stifling potential job growth. We \nhave $202 million of military construction that will be delayed in \nAlaska because we haven't passed an annual Military Construction and \nVeterans Affairs bill. We passed it in appropriations, we are ready, \nand we want to do it, but this back-and-forth of 1 week, 1 month, 2 \nmonths, continuing resolution again delays the regular order so we can \ncreate certainty--certainty with our ability to provide for businesses \nin this country but also for the business community, construction \ncompanies. In Alaska you cannot just start a project in December and \nsay, well, we are going to start doing the foundation work. It is a \nlittle cold. The ground is a little frozen. You have to be doing this \nin the summer. You have to be planning for this in the winter and late \nspring.\n  For us to delay these projects, all we do is hurt the private sector \njobs related to it, the families who depend on this, the veterans, and \nthe military that depend on these important construction projects.\n  When the funding comes too late, the project is delayed, costs go up. \nIt is not complicated.\n  For the Senate, I have learned over time it is almost irrelevant. \nSome people don't care about it. They don't care what it costs. They \ndon't even want to know, because they know when they hear it, it will \nbe an unbelievable cost that we have to bear because of this delay and \nthese tactics.\n  I get it. We are not going to always agree on everything, but we have \nto compromise and solve these problems.\n  As an appropriator, that is what we do in appropriations. It is not \nalways easy. Some things I want to have happen, we can't have. It is \nthe same thing on the other side, but at the end of the day we find \ncommon ground.\n  Sequestration also has hurt the Coast Guard. In Alaska, the Coast \nGuard is the lifeblood of our oceans for the fishing industry, oil and \ngas industry, our recreational industry, our cruise ship industry. I \ncan go through the list. They have lost $200 million from their \noperating expenses because of sequestration and an inability for some \npeople to come to the table to solve this problem. That means about 30 \npercent fewer cutters and aircraft doing things such as enforcing \nfishing laws.\n  We have a reduced presence in the Arctic. They had to cut back on \npatrols to stop drugs coming from South America into this country.\n  When you think about it, the impact is significant. It spreads \nthroughout this whole country. As the drugs come in and the jobs in the \ncountry go out, millions of Americans are watching to see what Congress \ndoes. We have created a situation where not only are we unable to \nbudget for this country, but Americans can't budget for their future. \nThey can't even budget for the holiday season. It is unbelievable.\n  We need to complete this work on this short-term continuing \nresolution, move right into our annual appropriations bills, address \nsequestration once and for all, and finish the budget. We owe it to the \nAmerican people. We owe it to them to ensure they have certainty, and \nwe owe to it our business community to make sure they know. Look at \nlast week in the market. It wasn't a deep slide, but it was a slide.\n  If you read the Wall Street Journal today or last night, there is a \ncommentary and some articles because they weren't sure what the House \nwas doing. The House was playing these games back and forth: Let's tie \nthis to it; let's tie that to it. They are playing with an economy that \nhas come back from the depths of a great recession.\n  Is it a perfect economy? No. Is it better? Absolutely. Do we have a \nfragile moment that we need to continue to build on this? Yes.\n  I am not sure if those folks on the other side care about making sure \nour economy is strong. In some ways, I think they want it to falter so \nthey can go into an election and say: See those guys, they caused the \neconomy to go bad so vote them out. That is all this seems to be.\n  I was presiding earlier and one of my colleagues on the other side \nmentioned a story about Alaska. I was appreciative that he recognized \nAlaska and understood we had some issues in Alaska. Then he mentioned \nthree other Senators and their States--all the ones, to be frank with \nyou, who are being targeted by groups as the ones most at risk this \nelection cycle.\n  I get it, but that is not what people are here to do. If you want to \nhave that conversation, let's go outside this building. Run those ads. \nDo everything you need to do. Do whatever you want on the campaign \ntrail. Do whatever you need to do.\n  To play these games and try to pretend you are doing the government's \nbusiness is very irresponsible. That is not what is going on. What is \ngoing on is picking people and trying to pigeon hole them so they can \nrun commercials against them in campaigns. I get that. I think the \nAmerican people are fed up with it. They are outraged by it. I hear it \nevery time I go back to Alaska. I hear it when I talk to people around \nthe country.\n  We have to do the work we were sent to do. The work here is to get \nour business done. Setting policy is part of it and passing \nappropriations bills. We should be doing these on an annual basis, \ndoing a budget. Again, we passed one out of the Senate. I didn't \nsupport it because it had too many taxes, but we passed it. The House \npassed it. Let's get on with doing the work.\n  Every day I know some sit around and they say: Well, we have to do it \nthis way. This is the only way it works.\n  You don't understand. The Senate is complicated.\n  Hey, life is complicated, get on with it. The public expects us to do \nour job. Quit using process, rules, and gobbledygook to try to get away \nfrom your responsibility in the Senate. It is time we sit down and deal \nwith it.\n  There will be some in my party, and there will be some in their party \nwho--guess what--aren't going to get what they want. That is the way it \nworks. Compromise, find your balance, and move forward.\n  I would love 100 percent of everything. I will try it every day, but \nthat is not how it ends up all the time. Compromise and try to find a \nmiddle ground, that is what we should be doing.\n  As an appropriator, that is what I want to do. This is what I tried \nto do as a member of the Appropriations Committee, and that is what we \nshould be doing on this floor.\n  I get it. There are a couple on each side. It happens. We saw one who \nstood out here for 21 hours or whatever the\n\n[[Page S6955]]\n\nheck it was. I get it. He is passionate. It is important to him to make \nhis point, but I also see what else is going on.\n  Focus on your job. We are Senators. We are not candidates for some \nother office. We are Senators. We are here to do the job. It is time to \nget busy and do the job. The American people want it. Alaskans tell us \nevery day they want us to do this.\n  Let's figure this out and get on with the show.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, as we inch closer and closer to \npotentially shutting down this government, I rise to remind my \ncolleagues what a shutdown would mean for our constituents. I also want \nto remind my colleagues it doesn't have to be this way.\n  Budget battles and debt ceiling debates are the norm in Congress \nright now, but there was a time--there was a time--when both parties \nworked together and the American people benefited.\n  It hasn't always been rosy. The budget battles of the mid-1990s shut \nour government down for nearly 1 month. Personal insults here in the \nworld's greatest deliberative body used to be common. And back in the \n1850s, a Senator was beaten on the Senate floor. But through it all, \nAmericans trusted their government to meet its constitutional \nresponsibility and keep the lights on. After all, if we couldn't agree \non anything else, at least we could agree on keeping the lights on.\n  Today, constant political brinkmanship and grandstanding replace \ncommonsense compromise and actual governing. This is taking a toll on \nall Americans, and Montanans are no exception.\n  With a government shutdown once again a real possibility, America's \nfrustration is reaching new heights. For some folks a shutdown is \nanother opportunity to shake their heads and bemoan the state of \naffairs right here in Washington, DC. They are the lucky ones. For \nothers, a shutdown will hurt their health, their wallets, and their \nbottom lines.\n  I am talking about a veteran--a veteran who could be anywhere in this \ncountry--whose disability case appeal could and probably will be \ndelayed if we have a government shutdown; a senior citizen waiting for \na Social Security check; a small business owner waiting to get a \npotential contract that could fix a decaying road infrastructure.\n  Hotels and other businesses around our national parks, which would be \nclosed if we have a government shutdown, are also holding their breath \nto see what we are doing here these days. If the parks close because of \na government shutdown, the money coming in and out of the wallets of \nthose businesses and those folks who not only drove to the park in \nanticipation of being able to utilize it but the businesses around the \npark would be impacted very negatively.\n  Everybody knows about the Bakken oil plate that is driving the \neconomic growth in North Dakota and eastern Montana. But if the \ngovernment shuts down, the Bureau of Land Management's permitting \noffice would be shut down too. That means wells would be delayed and \nthe jobs that come with it.\n  Since the House Republicans have been unwilling to begin negotiations \non a new farm bill, farmers and ranchers are going to have a lot of \nquestions come October 1. On that day, not only will the government \nshut down but the farm bill will expire as well. So not only could some \nfolks lose critical nutrition assistance, but farmers and ranchers \nwould have no place to go to get their questions answered about the \nfact there is no more farm bill for a commodity type; no more ability \nto get questions answered about conservation, which needs to be planned \nfar ahead of time. Why? Because their local farm service agency office \nwill be closed. Like the other government offices, nobody is going to \nbe there to answer the phone.\n  In Montana, Washington now is shorthand for uncertainty, Congress is \nshorthand for dysfunction, and faith in government is being eroded \nbecause some folks around here are more concerned about raising money \non C-SPAN than the people of this great country and the American \neconomy. It needs to stop.\n  The American people expect Members of Congress to make smart, \nresponsible decisions based on the best information we have. That means \nadvocating for issues that matter but compromising to get something \ndone. That means giving a little and getting a whole lot in return. It \nis called governing. That is a lesson some folks around here need to \nlearn.\n  I would have thought flirting with a government shutdown and costing \ntaxpayers billions of dollars in 2011 would have been sufficient enough \na lesson or maybe coming within a few hours of falling off the so-\ncalled fiscal cliff in 2012 would have been a sufficient lesson. I \nwould have thought that causing an unprecedented credit downgrade 2 \nyears ago by threatening not to raise the debt ceiling would have \nknocked some sense into some folks. And I would think the American \npeople's overwhelming desire not to shut the government down come \nOctober 1 would cause my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to \nuse common sense. But here we are, playing politics once again as \nregular Americans twist in the wind.\n  There is a way forward, and it doesn't have to start with political \ngames at the eleventh hour. It starts with working through the regular \nbudgets and appropriations process and not proposing amendments just to \nslow the process down.\n  But funding the government is the easy part. In less than 1 month, we \nwill once again be reaching a debt ceiling--a much more serious issue. \nIf we don't raise it before then, we will not be able to pay our bills \nand the economy will be devastated. Crashing into the debt ceiling will \ncause our credit rating to drop, increase the interest rates not only \non our government debt but for anybody who has debt.\n  If you don't believe a farmer from Big Sandy, MT, maybe you will \nbelieve a guy by the name of Mark Zandi, an economist who has advised \nPresidents, Presidential candidates, and Fortune 500 companies. He said \nthat failing to raise the debt ceiling will hurt consumer and business \nconfidence, force businesses to stop hiring, and raise borrowing costs \nfor average Americans.\n  He is far from alone. Former Republican Senator Judd Gregg says \nfailing to pay our bills would ``lead to job losses and more debt.'' He \ncalls failing to raise the debt ceiling a ``terrible policy that would \nproduce difficult times for people on Main Street.''\n  Senator Gregg, whom I had the opportunity to serve with, spent 18 \nyears here in the Senate. He knows as long as Congress fails to provide \nthe American people with political and economic certainty by funding \nthe government and raising the debt limit, we will not be able to \ntackle other important issues, such as replacing the sequester the \nSenator from Alaska talked about, and replacing it with smart budget \ncuts or striking a long-term budget agreement that will put this Nation \non solid economic footing.\n  A government shutdown would be irresponsible and it would be \nunnecessary. Congress needs to do its job by finding a way to \nresponsibly keep the government running. We cannot keep holding \nbusinesses, seniors, working families, veterans, students, and our \nmilitary men and women hostage to the political whims and aspirations \nof a select few.\n  When I was a member of the Montana Senate, my colleagues and I knew \nwhat we had to get done every session. Passing a budget was at the top \nof the list. Even if we didn't agree where to cut or where to spend, we \nworked together to figure it out. And just like my former colleagues in \nMontana did this spring, we passed a budget and kept the State \ngovernment running. Here in Washington there are a lot of pressures we \ndon't face at the State level. There are news channels that give any \nSenator a chance to get on TV, and every issue has an advocacy group \nfighting for its share of the pie. But real leaders make tough \ndecisions. Real leaders work together to find common ground and move \nour Nation forward. Real leaders put their constituents first.\n\n[[Page S6956]]\n\n  It is not too late. It is not too late for us to regain the trust of \nthe American people. But it is going to take some work. We won't be \nable to do it right away, but we ought to start this week, and we can \nstart by responsibly funding the government, providing our economy and \nour Nation with the confidence they need. That is what we did in \nMontana, and that is what we need to do here in Washington.\n  The American people are calling for an end to the brinkmanship and an \nend to the gridlock, and it is time we start to listen to them.\n  I also want to thank Senator Mikulski, the chair of the \nAppropriations Committee, for agreeing to end a special-interest \nprovision that was included by the House of Representatives in last \nyear's government funding bill a few months ago and the one that was \nsent over here recently.\n  A few years ago the committee voluntarily agreed to match the House's \nearmark moratorium, and I think it is interesting our friends in the \nHouse make very serious statements about the need to get rid of \nearmarks, then stuffed a few items in the spending bill last year that \ndirectly benefited a couple of the biggest multinational businesses in \nthis country. I spoke to Chairwoman Mikulski about this issue this \nspring and she was very gracious and listened to my concerns. I am \npleased to see she and Senator Reid have eliminated one of those \ncorporate earmarks, and I want to thank them for that. It will make \nthis bill a lot cleaner.\n  In closing, I know there are people in this body who want to work \ntogether to make this country all it can be. I also know there are \npeople in this body who would love to see a government shutdown because \nthey might be able to pad their own PACs or political coffers. And \nmaybe it would take a government shutdown to make them understand how \nbad this would be for the American people, its businesses and its \nworking families. But I certainly hope that doesn't happen. The \nAmerican people don't deserve it. This country doesn't deserve it, as \nit comes out of one of the worst economic times since the 1930s. Quite \nfrankly, being a businessman myself, I look at what goes on in \nWashington, DC, and all the challenges businesses have in this country, \nand the biggest challenge we have right now is Washington, DC.\n  Let's start moving the country forward by working together. Let's \nfund the government. Let's not shut it down. And let's do what is right \nwhen the debt limit debate comes around.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/26/senate-section/article/S6956-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. TESTER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Southern \nNevada Employment Education Outreach, EMPLEO, program for their decade \nof commitment to fair and just working conditions for all workers.\n  In 2003, EMPLEO piloted a toll-free hotline for immigrant workers to \nreport alleged discrimination, and other wage, and workplace abuses in \nNevada. The hotline number was created in partnership with the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, OSHA, EEOC, the Mexican \nConsulate of Las Vegas, and other private and public agencies.\n  Today, EMPLEO partners with more than 17 different government \nagencies that share the same common goal of providing access and \nawareness to employers and employees. EMPLEO staff and volunteers are \ndiligent in their outreach to help educate workers about their labor \nrights. Through its work, EMPLEO has grown the number of workers it \nservices, and in some instances, has helped workers acquire back wages. \nAs a trusted source in the community, EMPLEO is bridging the \nrelationship between employees and employers.\n  I commend EMPLEO and its many community partners for their commitment \nto workers' rights and safety. I also extend my gratitude to Southern \nNevada District Director, Mr. Gaspar Montanez, for his leadership and \ncommitment to the mission of EMPLEO along with the Department of Labor, \nand staff at the Office of the Mexican and Salvadorian Consulate. I \nlook forward to the continuation of EMPLEO's services and education to \nworkers and those who employ them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/26/senate-section/article/S6956-3", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN.

We have seen the devastating \nimpact of tornadoes, flooding, ice storms, and other natural disasters.\n  This devastation can be overwhelming. Surveying the damage sometimes \nreveals the need to rebuild parts of the community, infrastructure, and \nneighborhoods. Oftentimes this causes difficulties for families who may \nbe displaced from their homes or even their jobs.\n  Time and again when we are faced with these catastrophes, the \nArkansas Department of Emergency Management has been there to activate \nthe resources necessary to protect people and communities and provide \nthem with the basic needs as rebuilding efforts occur.\n  This year we recognize the 60th anniversary of the agency tasked with \nresponding to emergencies.

They were willing \nto put on a uniform, answer the call of duty, and sacrifice their very \nlives on the altar of freedom. There is no higher virtue than that \nwhich was displayed by these 18 brave Nevadans, and the thousands of \nothers with whom they served. And although years have passed since \nthese American warriors gave their lives, their selfless sacrifice is \nnot forgotten, but lives on in the hearts of those whom they died to \ndefend. The very least we can do is express our profound gratitude and \nappreciation for these heroes by giving them an honorable military \nburial.\n  We can never thank our veterans enough for the immeasurable \nsacrifices they and their families have made on our behalf. As a member \nof the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, I can personally attest to \nthe importance of providing every available resource and benefit to \nAmerica's veterans. I applaud the Missing in America Project for \nhelping to advance this effort by working diligently to ensure that \nlost veterans receive the honorable burial they deserve. I invite my \ncolleagues to join me in thanking this organization for its efforts, \nand I join my fellow Nevadans in remembering the 18 heroes\n\n[[Page S6957]]\n\nwho will be laid to rest in a manner consistent with our Nation's high \nesteem for their valiant service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/26/senate-section/article/S6957-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO RYAN AND RHONDA KELLY\n\n   Mr. THUNE. Mr. President today I wish to recognize Ryan and \nRhonda Kelly of Rapid City, SD, as my nominees for the 2013 Angels in \nAdoption Award. Since 1999, the Angels in Adoption program, through the \nCongressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, has honored nearly 2,000 \nindividuals, couples, and organizations nationwide for their work in \nproviding children with loving, stable homes.\n  Since 2005, 6 girls from China have come to know the love and \ncompassion of high school sweethearts Ryan and Rhonda Kelly. One \nmorning in January 2005, Rhonda woke up and felt a calling to pursue an \nadoption of a baby girl in China.\n  That calling has since developed into a deep passion for providing a \nloving, Christian home to girls from China. Over the last 8 years, \nRhonda and Ryan have joyfully welcomed 6 girls from China into their \nfamily: Jenna, Jocelyn, Jade, Jolise, Janelle, and Joy. They have \nadopted girls as young as 18 months to age 14. Each adoption has given \nthe Kellys a new opportunity to meet the unique physical and emotional \nneeds of each child, a task they have faced with grace, determination, \nand humility. These girls joined biological children Jacob, Joshua, \nJulia, and Jonah.\n  Ryan, Rhonda, and their 10 children, now ranging in age from 22 to 4, \nare shining examples of what it means to make the dream of a family a \nreality for every child. Adoption has given the girls the opportunity \nto receive the medical care they need, a family to love and care for \nthem forever, and a chance for a bright future. Adoption has given the \nKelly family an entirely different outlook on life: they look at the \nbig picture and choose not to sweat the small things. This family \nclearly loves each other, supports each other, has empathy for each \nother, and gets to witness the miracle of adoption each and every day.\n  With National Adoption Day just around the corner on November 23, \n2013, it is important that we recognize the compassionate families who \nfulfill the roles of foster and adoptive parents. Thus, it brings me \ngreat pride to honor South Dakotans Ryan and Rhonda Kelly as my \nnominees for the 2013 Angels in Adoption award, as they have bestowed a \ngift onto others in an immeasurable way and the impact their love has \nhad is profound.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/26/senate-section/article/S6957-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:10 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1961.

A memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State \n     of Florida urging Congress to award the United States 65th \n     Infantry Regiment, the Borinqueneers, the Congressional Gold \n     Medal; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                          Senate Memorial 1266\n\n       Whereas, the Borinqueneers trace their lineage to the \n     ``Puerto Rico Regiment of Volunteer Infantry,'' authorized by \n     Congress on March 2, 1899, as the first body of native troops \n     in Puerto Rico, the only Hispanic-segregated unit in the \n     United States Armed Forces that played a prominent role in \n     American military history; and\n       Whereas, during World War I, the Borinqueneers rallied a \n     force of over 1,500 to defend the Panama Canal, and upon \n     their return to Puerto Rico were renamed ``The 65th Infantry \n     Regiment;'' and\n       Whereas, during World War II, the Borinqueneers served in \n     North Africa and Europe, winning Naples-Foggia, Rome-Arne, \n     Central Europe, and Rhineland battle campaign awards; and \n     were assigned security, anti-sabotage, and other occupation \n     missions around Kaiserslautern and Mannheim, Germany after \n     the war; and\n       Whereas, during the Korean War, the Borinqueneers were the \n     only all-Hispanic unit; joined the United States 3rd Infantry \n     Division to be among the first infantry to engage in battle \n     with North Korean troops; served with distinction to earn 4 \n     Distinguished Service Crosses, 124 Silver Stars, 9 Korean \n     battle campaign awards, the Presidential and Meritorious Unit \n     Commendations, 2 Korean Presidential Unit Citations, and the \n     Greek Gold Medal for Bravery; and are credited with launching \n     the last recorded battalion-sized bayonet assault in United \n     States Army history; and\n       Whereas, legendary United States Army General Douglas \n     MacArthur lauded the Borinqueneers, crediting them with a \n     resolute will to victory and loyalty to the United States, \n     saying, ``They are writing a brilliant record of heroism in \n     battle and I am indeed proud to have them under my command. I \n     wish that we could count on many more like them;'' and\n       Whereas, in 1959, the Borinqueneers passed their colors to \n     the National Guard of the United States Territory of Puerto \n     Rico, withdrawing from the Regular Army, the only time in \n     United States Army history that active unit colors were not \n     retired, but, instead, turned over to a National Guard unit; \n     and\n       Whereas, today, the legacy of the Borinqueneers lives on in \n     the National Guard in Puerto Rico, which continues to defend \n     the United States in the ongoing War on Terrorism; and\n       Whereas, the Borinqueneers served and sacrificed, shedding \n     blood for our democracy and helping to ensure our prosperity \n     as they faced segregation and discrimination, protecting our \n     nation and fighting for the good of all; and\n       Whereas, these warriors, the Borinqueneers, deserve a place \n     with all American heroes, and should be honored, commended, \n     and never forgotten for their feats; and\n       Whereas, the Congressional Gold Medal is the highest \n     civilian award given by the United States Congress, awarded \n     as an expression of public gratitude on behalf of the nation \n     for distinguished contributions: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Florida, That, \n     in recognition of the bravery and sacrifice of the United \n     States 65th Infantry Regiment, the Borinqueneers, the \n     President and the Congress of the United States are urged to \n     award the Congressional Gold Medal to these true heroes and \n     defenders of our great nation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this memorial be dispatched to the \n     President of the United States, to the President of the \n     United States Senate, to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, to each member of the Florida \n     delegation to the United States Congress, to the Puerto Rico \n     Resident Commissioner, to the President of the United States \n     65th Infantry Regiment Association, the chairman of the \n     Hispanic Achievers Grant Council, the chairman of the \n     Borinqueneers Congressional Gold Medal Alliance, and the \n     National Association for Uniformed Services.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-136.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio urging Congress to reconsider \n     the statute and appropriations creating FirstNet; to the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 15\n\n       Whereas, Ohio's first responders require mission critical \n     communications infrastructure to effectively do their jobs; \n     and\n       Whereas, Ohio has invested over $500,000,000 in system \n     assets that include over 200 tower sites, shelters, \n     generators, mobile towers, microwave backhaul consoles, and \n     mobile and portable radios; and\n       Whereas, Over 55,000 first responders and public service \n     users at the federal, state, and local government levels rely \n     on the assets that Ohio has invested in; and\n       Whereas, The federal Middle Class Tax Relief and Job \n     Creation Act of 2012 created the First Responder Network \n     Authority (FirstNet) within the United States Department of \n     Commerce National Telecommunications and Information \n     Administration and tasked FirstNet with building and \n     maintaining a single, nationwide, interoperable broadband \n     public safety network; and\n       Whereas, FirstNet is requiring states to inventory their \n     assets and develop statewide plans to allow federal use or \n     takeover of those assets for the undetermine nationwide \n     broadband public safety network; and\n       Whereas, FirstNet is requiring states to opt into, and \n     provide an undetermined level of financial support to, the \n     nationwide broadband public safety network; and\n       Whereas, FirstNet appears to lack sufficient funding for \n     the nationwide broadband public safety network, but is \n     requiring a self-sustaining model; and\n       Whereas, FirstNet lacks planning and did not seek input \n     from Ohio as evidenced by the witnesses who testified before, \n     and submitted testimony to, the United States House of \n     Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee \n     on Communications and Technology in a March 2013, hearing \n     entitled ``Oversight of FirstNet and Emergency \n     Communications'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 130th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, respectfully urge the \n     Subcommittee on Communications and Technology to hold regular \n     hearings regarding the nationwide broadband public safety \n     network and require that FirstNet create a publicly vetted \n     business plan that identifies the exact costs that Ohio will \n     be mandated to appropriate or obligate for the nationwide \n     broadband public safety network; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 130th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, respectfully urge the \n     Subcommittee on Communications and Technology to include \n     amendments to the law that would allow Ohio to opt-out of the \n     nationwide broadband public safety network with no net costs; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 130th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, respectfully urge the \n     Subcommittee on Communications and Technology to include \n     amendments to the law that require FirstNet to provide full \n     written assurances that communications provided by the \n     nationwide broadband public safety network will meet and \n     exceed the current level of service for Ohio's state and \n     local public safety officers in the areas of reliability, \n     redundancy, and state-based system control; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 130th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, respectfully urge the \n     Subcommittee on Communications and Technology to include \n     amendments to the law that require FirstNet to provide fair \n     market compensation to Ohio for access and utilization of \n     state-owned assets in support of the network's deployment; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 130th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, respectfully urge the United \n     States Congress to reconsider the statute and appropriations \n     creating FirstNet; and be if further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit duly \n     authenticated copies of this resolution to the Speaker and \n     Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, the \n     President Pro Tempore and Secretary of the United States \n     Senate, all members of the United States House of \n     Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee, the members of \n     the Ohio Congressional delegation, and the news media of \n     Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-138. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah urging Congress to pass legislation that \n     would reduce the federal tax on fuels by the amount of any \n     increase in the rate of the tax on fuels by the states; to \n     the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 6\n\n       Whereas, federal fuel taxes associated with the Federal Aid \n     Highway Act of 1956 were implemented to construct a 41,250-\n     mile National System of Interstate and Defense Highways, \n     commonly called the Interstate System;\n       Whereas, the Interstate System, with more than 46,000 miles \n     open to traffic, has been completed for more than 20 years;\n       Whereas, federal highway user fees are increasingly used \n     for nonhighway purposes;\n       Whereas, states are required to adopt federal labor \n     regulations, such as Davis-Bacon rules, that can \n     substantially increase project costs; and to the members of \n     Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-139. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     enact amendments to the federal Electronic Communications \n     Privacy Act to require law enforcement authorities to have a \n     warrant to access e-mail, no matter the age or location of \n     the email; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 30\n\n       Whereas, More and more citizens rely on electronic mail \n     communication to conduct both private and professional \n     business. Our ability to store communications at locations \n     other than where the communication originated, such as ``in \n     the cloud,'' has contributed to new challenges in protecting \n     individual's privacy. ECPA fails to adequately protect \n     Americans from unreasonable searches of their private \n     information stored with cloud and mobile providers; and\n       Whereas, The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled \n     that law enforcement must have a valid warrant to access e-\n     mail stored on a provider's server, no matter the age of the \n     e-mail. However, rulings in the lower courts have limited \n     jurisdiction. E-mail providers and storage location can be \n     anywhere in the United States and possibly the world; and\n       Whereas, Google, Inc. has stated that it will not release \n     any e-mails, regardless of age, without a warrant. Google \n     officials note that the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment \n     protects against unreasonable searches and seizures and that \n     Amendment takes priority over ECPA;\n       Whereas, The United States Senate had before it an \n     amendment last November that would have required warrants for \n     all e-mail seizures. However, that amendment was stripped \n     from the vehicle bill before passage; and\n       Whereas, The legislature finds that, in an era where \n     technology dominates communication and increasingly more \n     business-related and sensitive information is being stored \n     via cloud-based email, more than ever, it is important for \n     government to protect the rights of privacy and due process \n     afforded to all of our state's residents: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge \n     Congress to enact amendments to the federal Electronic \n     Communications Privacy Act to require law enforcement \n     authorities to have a warrant to access email, no matter the \n     age or location of the e-mail; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-140. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the Congress of the \n     United States to enact legislation that promotes growth of \n     domestic alternative fuel sources, such as natural gas, and \n     reduces dependence on foreign oil; to the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 132\n\n       Whereas, the United States needs a balanced and sensible \n     domestic energy policy; and\n       Whereas, the Renewable Fuel Standard, established by the \n     Energy Policy Act of 2005 and expanded and extended by the \n     Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, requires the \n     blending of increasing volumes of designated renewable fuels \n     into the total transportation fuel supply, in a large part, \n     as a way to reduce our country's dependence on foreign \n     petroleum; and\n       Whereas, reducing dependence on foreign oil is not only a \n     matter of national security but a significant opportunity to \n     enhance economic prosperity and job growth in Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, currently there are multiple routes to ethanol, \n     including several from traditional fossil fuels such as \n     natural gas, which is plentiful in Louisiana and several \n     other states in the country; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is committed to being a leader in \n     development of a sustainable national energy policy: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to enact legislation that promotes growth of \n     domestic alternative fuel sources, such as natural gas, and \n     reduces dependence on foreign oil; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-141.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the State of \n     Delaware memorializing a commitment to the strong and \n     deepening relationship between Taiwan and Delaware; to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 12\n\n       Whereas, Taiwan and the United States are long-standing \n     friends with a shared historical relationship and dearly \n     cherished values of freedom, democracy, and human rights; and\n       Whereas, 2013 will mark the 13th anniversary of the sister-\n     state relationship between Delaware and Taiwan; and\n       Whereas, for the past 12 years, the sister-state \n     relationship with Taiwan has been strengthened through the \n     efforts of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative \n     Office (TECRO) resulting in better mutual understanding; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan is the world's eighteenth largest economy, \n     one of the key trading partners of the United States, and the \n     two-way trade volume between the United States and Taiwan \n     reached sixty-three billion dollars in 2012; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan is now a member of the U.S. Visa Waiver \n     program (effective November 1st, 2012); reflecting our \n     friendship, trust, and cooperation, and making travel between \n     Taiwan and the United States for business and tourism even \n     more convenient; and\n       Whereas, negotiations for a Bilateral Investment Agreement \n     (BIA) between Taiwan and the United States are ongoing and \n     are an important step towards strengthening bilateral trade \n     and paving the way for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA); and\n       Whereas, President Barack Obama and the leaders of eight \n     Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) countries announced the \n     achievement of the broad outlines for a 21st century TPP \n     agreement on November 12, 2011, and Taiwan has expressed a \n     keen interest to participate, so as to forge close linkages \n     among economics, enhance competitiveness, and benefit \n     consumers: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the 147th \n     General Assembly of the State of Delaware, that we hereby \n     reaffirm our commitment to the strong and deepening \n     relationship between Taiwan and Delaware; and be it further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the President of the United \n     States Senate, and the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-146. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of West Virginia urging the United \n     States Congress to begin the process of amending the \n     Constitution to provide that corporations are not entitled to \n     the entirety of protections or rights of natural persons, \n     specifically so that the expenditure of corporate money to \n     influence the electoral process is no longer a form of \n     constitutionally protected speech; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 24\n\n       Calling upon the United States Congress to propose a \n     constitutional amendment addressing the Supreme Court \n     decision in Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission.\n       Whereas, in 2010, the United States Supreme Court issued \n     its ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission \n     that enabled corporations and unions to spend unlimited \n     amounts of money in support of or in opposition to candidates \n     for election; and\n       Whereas, the people of West Virginia and all other states \n     should have the power to limit by law the extent to which \n     money can be spent in their political systems: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate: That the Senate hereby calls upon \n     the United States Congress to propose a constitutional \n     amendment addressing the Supreme Court decision in Citizens \n     United v. Federal Elections Commission; and be it further\n       Resolved, that the West Virginia Senate supports an \n     amendment to the United States Constitution to establish that \n     corporations and unions are not entitled to the same rights \n     and protections as natural persons under the Constitution; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, that such an amendment should assure the power of \n     the federal, state and local governments to limit, regulate \n     and require disclosure of sources of all money spent in the \n     course of political elections; and be it further\n       Resolved, that the West Virginia Senate requests that the \n     West Virginia Congressional Delegation support such an the \n     United States had the opportunity to vote on state and local \n     ballot measures, including the states of Montana and \n     Colorado, calling for a constitutional amendment to limit \n     money in politics, including the entire states of Montana and \n     Colorado, and all proposed resolutions passed with \n     overwhelming and bipartisan support, averaging seventy-five \n     percent of voters in favor: Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate: That the Senate calls upon the \n     United States Congress to propose a constitutional amendment \n     overturning the United States Supreme Court's Citizens United \n     v. Federal Election Commission ruling and related cases; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, that the West Virginia Senate supports an \n     amendment to the United States Constitution to establish that \n     corporations and unions are not entitled to the same rights \n     and protections as natural persons under the Constitution; \n     and, be it\n       Resolved, that such an amendment should assure the power of \n     the federal, state and local governments to limit, regulate \n     and require disclosure of sources of all money spent to \n     influence elections; and, be it\n       Resolved, that the West Virginia Senate requests that the \n     West Virginia Congressional Delegation support such an \n     amendment, work diligently towards its passage and vote at \n     all stages to advance such legislation in the Congress; and, \n     be it\n       Further Resolved, that the Clerk is hereby directed to \n     forward a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States and the President pro Tempore of the United \n     States Senate, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the majority and minority leaders of both \n     houses of Congress and to each United States Senator and \n     Member of the House of Representatives from West Virginia.\n                                  ____\n\n       Opposing the United States Supreme Court's interpretation \n     of the Constitution in Citizens United v. Federal Election \n     Commission regarding the constitutional rights of \n     corporations; supporting an amendment to the Constitution to \n     provide that corporations are not entitled to the entirety of \n     protections or rights of natural persons, specifically so \n     that the expenditure of corporate money to influence the \n     electoral process is no longer a form of constitutionally \n     protected speech; and calling on Congress to begin the \n     process of amending the Constitution.\n       Whereas, in 2010 the United States Supreme Court issued its \n     decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, \n     holding that independent spending on elections by \n     corporations and other groups could not be limited by \n     government regulations; and\n       Whereas, this decision rolled back the legal restrictions \n     on corporate spending in the electoral process, allowing for \n     the unlimited corporate spending to influence elections, \n     candidate selection and policy decisions; and\n       Whereas, in reaching this decision, a narrow majority of \n     the Supreme Court, relying on and expanding prior decisions, \n     interpreted the First Amendment of the Constitution to afford \n     corporations the same free speech protections as natural \n     persons; and\n       Whereas, the Supreme Court relied on other prior decisions \n     which afforded the spending of money to influence elections \n     the full protection of the First Amendment and disregarded \n     the distorting and corrupting effects of unlimited money in \n     elections; and\n       Whereas, in his eloquent dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens \n     rightly recognized that, ``corporations have no consciences, \n     no beliefs, no feelings, no thoughts, no desires. \n     Corporations help structure and facilitate the activities of \n     human beings, to be sure, and their `personhood' often serves \n     as a useful legal fiction. But they are not themselves \n     members of `We the People' by whom and for whom our \n     Constitution was established''; and\n       Whereas, the court's decision in Citizens United severely \n     hampers the ability of federal, state and local governments \n     to enact reasonable campaign finance reforms and regulations \n     regarding corporate political activity; and\n       Whereas, corporations should not be afforded the entirety \n     of protections or rights of natural persons, such that the \n     expenditure of corporate money to influence the electoral \n     process is a form of constitutionally protected speech; and\n       Whereas, in 2012 the same narrow majority of the Supreme \n     Court voted to strike down longstanding campaign finance laws \n     in the State of Montana without hearing any evidence or \n     argument on that state's own history and experience with \n     corporate spending and corruption; and\n       Whereas, several proposed amendments to the Constitution \n     have been introduced in Congress that would allow government \n     to regulate the raising and spending of money by corporations \n     to influence elections; and\n       Whereas, on Election Day, 2012, over six million voters \n     across the United States, including the states of Colorado \n     and Montana, had the opportunity to vote on state and local \n     ballot measures calling for a constitutional amendment to \n     limit money in politics, and all proposed initiatives passed \n     overwhelmingly, averaging seventy-five percent support: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That the Senate opposes the United \n     States Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution in \n     Citizens United V. Federal Election Commission regarding the \n     constitutional rights of corporations; supports an amendment \n     to the Constitution to provide that corporations are not \n     entitled to the entirety of protections or rights of natural \n     persons, specifically so that the expenditure of corporate \n     money to influence the electoral process is no longer a form \n     of constitutionally protected speech; and calls on Congress \n     to begin the process of amending the Constitution; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, that the Senate respectfully opposes the United \n     States Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution in \n     Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission and related \n     cases allowing unlimited corporate election spending; and be \n     it further\n\n[[Page S6960]]\n\n       Resolved, that the Senate supports an amendment to the \n     United States Constitution to establish that corporations are \n     not entitled to the same rights and protection as natural \n     persons under the Constitution; and, be it\n       Further Resolved, that such an amendment should assure the \n     power of the federal, state and local governments to limit, \n     regulate and require disclosure of sources of all money spent \n     to influence elections; and be it further\n       Resolved, that the Senate charges the West Virginia \n     Congressional Delegation with the duty to support such an \n     amendment, to work diligently towards its passage and to vote \n     at all stages to advance such legislation in the Congress; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, that the Senate declares its intention to ratify \n     such an amendment if and when the Congress shall submit it to \n     the states; and be it further\n       Resolved, that the Clerk is hereby directed to deliver a \n     copy of this resolution to the Vice President of the United \n     States and the President pro tempore of the United States \n     Senate, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, to \n     the Majority and Minority Leaders of both houses of Congress \n     and to each United States Senator and Member of the House of \n     Representatives from West Virginia.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-147.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to take such actions as are necessary to operate the \n     fleet of the United States Postal Service vehicles on natural \n     gas; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n     Affairs.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 180\n\n       Whereas, since its founding in 1775, the United States \n     Postal Service has been an indispensable part of the \n     country's communication network; and\n       Whereas, the modern United States Postal Office has \n     struggled to compete with the package delivery services of \n     the Federal Express and the United Parcel Service; and\n       Whereas, with the decline in first class mail volume and \n     increased competition in package delivery, the United States \n     Postal Office loses billions every year; and\n       Whereas, in attempts to stay solvent the United States \n     Postal Office has delivered more junk mail, closed smaller \n     postal offices, and considered ending mail deliveries on \n     Saturdays; and\n       Whereas, one avenue that the United States Postal Office \n     has not explored is the operation of the Postal Service motor \n     vehicle fleet on natural gas; and\n       Whereas, on average natural gas costs one-third less than \n     gasoline at the pump and natural gas is convenient and \n     abundant; and\n       Whereas, natural gas prices have exhibited significant \n     stability compared to oil prices and this stability makes it \n     easier to plan accurately for long-term costs; and\n       Whereas, natural gas vehicles have lower maintenance costs \n     because the gas burns cleanly resulting in less wear and tear \n     on engines; and\n       Whereas, the operation of the fleet of the United States \n     Postal Service vehicles on natural gas would be an excellent \n     way to save the United States Postal Service millions of \n     dollars each year while making their vehicles safer and more \n     efficient: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to operate the fleet of the United States \n     Postal Service vehicles on natural gas; and be it further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/26/senate-section/article/S6960-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEE\n\n  The following executive reports of nominations were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LEAHY for the Committee on the Judiciary.\n       Zachary Thomas Fardon, of Illinois, to be United States \n     Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois for the term \n     of four years.\n       Patricia M.

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The fiscal crisis faced by the Federal Government \n     demands immediate action.\n       (2) The dramatic growth in spending and debt in recent \n     years threatens our economic and national security:\n       (A) Federal spending has grown from 18 percent of GDP in \n     2001 to nearly 23 percent of GDP in 2012.\n       (B) Total Federal debt exceeds $16,000,000,000,000 and is \n     projected to increase each year over the next 10 years.\n       (C) Without action, the Federal Government will continue to \n     run massive deficits in the next decade and total Federal \n     debt will rise to approximately $25,000,000,000,000 by 2023.\n       (D) Interest payments on this debt will soon rise to the \n     point where balancing the budget as a matter of policy is \n     beyond the reach of Congress.\n       (3) Due to recent tax hikes, Federal revenues are scheduled \n     to rise to approximately 19 percent of GDP, a full percentage \n     point above the average of about 18 percent of GDP over the \n     past 40 years.\n       (4) Absent reform, the growth of Social Security, Medicare, \n     Medicaid, and other health-related spending will overwhelm \n     all other Federal programs and consume all projected tax \n     revenues.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to address the \n     fiscal crisis by--\n       (1) acting quickly to balance the Federal budget and \n     eliminate the parade of deficits and ballooning interest \n     payments;\n       (2) achieving balance by reducing spending one percent per \n     year until spending equals projected long-term revenues; and\n       (3) reforming entitlement programs to ensure long-term \n     fiscal stability and balance.\n\n     SEC. _03.

Mr. President, September is Suicide Prevention Month.\n\n[[Page S6969]]\n\nAs chairman of the Senate Committee on Veteran's Affairs, I would like \nto take a moment to discuss the importance of suicide prevention and \nways in which we can all help our Nation's veterans cope with the \ninvisible wounds of war.\n  Serving in defense of our Nation, particularly during a time of war, \ncan place tremendous strains on servicemen and women, sometimes leading \nto mental health conditions ranging from mild depression to severe \npost-traumatic stress disorder. These conditions are reasonable \nreactions to very abnormal situations.\n  While behavioral health conditions rarely lead to suicide, it is \nclear the consequences of failing to properly address and treat these \nconditions are dire. According to a report released earlier this year \nby the Department of Veterans Affairs, 22 veterans take their own lives \neach day. This is tragic and unacceptable.\n  For veterans and their families struggling with mental health \nconditions, there is hope. Help is available through VA and dozens of \nnon-profit organizations who have made it their mission to serve those \nwho have served our Nation.\n  VA has made great strides to improve its suicide prevention efforts. \nAs of June, the Department has hired over 1,600 new mental health \nprofessionals to provide care and treatment to our veterans. These \nadded positions are essential as VA works to meet the requirements \nestablished by Congress to provide initial mental health evaluations \nwithin 24 hours and comprehensive evaluations within 14 days of a \nveteran's request. Moreover, VA has put a priority on patient-centered \ncare, which includes mental health as part of primary care and involves \nfamily members in the treatment process.\n  Additionally, VA operates the Veterans Crisis Line, a critical \nresource for veterans and their loved ones. The Veterans Crisis Line is \na toll-free, confidential resource that connects veterans in distress \nwith qualified, caring VA responders. Family members and friends can \nalso use this resource to learn how to recognize the signs of suicide, \nspeak to a suicide prevention coordinator, and receive information \nregarding the services available in their area.\n  The Veterans Crisis Line has a history of success. Approximately 93 \npercent of all Veterans Crisis Line referrals are made to callers with \na history of using VA health care facilities in the past 12 months. \nVeterans who call the hotline are more likely to access intervention \nand treatment services following a rescue through the hotline. More \nimportantly, those who have been rescued or received a referral for \nfollow up care have a reduced rate of repeated suicide attempts over a \n12-month period.\n  In addition to VA, veteran service organizations, non-profit \norganizations, and local health care providers can also help. In my \nhome State of Vermont, the Vermont Veterans Outreach Program, operated \nby the Vermont National Guard, has played a critical role in supporting \nthe needs of Guard members and veterans, and helping to prevent \nsuicide. I am proud to have secured the initial funding to establish \nthis program in 2007 and am thankful for their efforts. Aside from \nworking directly with veterans and their families to determine their \nneeds, the outreach program provides a liaison to help these \nindividuals better navigate the VA system. Team members meet frequently \nwith VA officials to ensure they are aware of any new VA initiatives in \norder to better inform veterans and their families of the options for \ncare and support available. The Vermont Veterans Outreach Program has \nhelped countless veterans return from war to become successful \ncontributing members of their communities. I am tremendously proud of \nthe outreach programs' work and am pleased other States have begun \nsimilar programs.\n  Just as these organizations provide assistance, friends and family \ncan also ensure veterans receive the help they need. We must each be \naware of the signs, symptoms, and risk factors of suicide. We must not \nbe afraid to take action to assist friends and neighbors in crisis. \nSuicide is preventable and we all have a role to play. Providing \nsupport can mean lending a compassionate ear, listening for concerning \nanswers, and guiding veterans to resources that can help.\n  Even one veteran taking his or her life is too many. As a long \nstanding advocate for veterans, I will continue to work to counter \nissues that prevent veterans and their families from seeking care, such \nas the stigma surrounding mental illness, negative perceptions of \ntreatment and other barriers that may result in prematurely dropping \nout of treatment.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in committing themselves to ensuring \nthat the brave men and women who have worn our Nation's uniform receive \ntimely access to high quality mental health care. Our veterans have \nalready sacrificed so much in defense of our country. They should not \nbe left to fend for themselves when coping with the invisible wounds of \nwar.\n  Mr. TESTER. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.
