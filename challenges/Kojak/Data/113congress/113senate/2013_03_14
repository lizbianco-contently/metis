Yesterday I asked Senate Democrats to forward a \nthoughtful budget that Americans of both parties could rally around, \none that controls spending, gets our economy healthy again, and \nadvances the serious reforms necessary to make government programs more \nefficient, effective, and responsive to the needs of 21st-century \nAmericans. I asked them to please shelve the tax hikes. That is because \nwe understand the negative effect more taxes would have on our fragile \neconomy and the millions of Americans still looking for work. It is \nalso because we know Washington Democrats already got $600 billion in \ntaxes they demanded earlier this year. Remember, that is in addition to \nthe\n\n[[Page S1828]]\n\nmore than $1 trillion they got in taxes from ObamaCare as well. So now \nit is time for the balance they promised. Washington does not need to \ntax more; it needs to finally figure out how to spend less.\n  I said that these things were the least Senate Democrats owed the \nAmerican people, given their lack of responsibility in not producing a \nbudget for the last 4 years. I am sorry to report that the plan they \nput forward yesterday will do none of these things. Instead of getting \nWashington spending under control, their proposed budget doubles down \non the same wasteful stimulus spending we already know does not work. \nWe have tried that. In fact, at a time when Americans believe that \nabout half of every dollar they send to Washington is wasted, the \nDemocratic budget would increase spending by nearly 62 percent. Their \nbudget will do more to harm the economy than to help it, and it will \nlet Medicare and Social Security drift ever closer to bankruptcy.\n  Then there is the Democrats' $1.5 trillion tax hike--that is trillion \nwith a ``t.'' Let me repeat that. Any Senator who votes for that budget \nis voting for a $1.5 trillion tax hike--the largest tax hike in \nAmerica's history. So the Senate Democratic budget is more than just \ndisappointing, it is extreme. It is really one of the most extreme, \nmost leftwing budgets of the modern era.\n  I think it says something about today's Washington Democrats. There \nwas a time when the Democratic Party cared about fiscal responsibility, \nwhen Democrats understood the need to be concerned about the impact \ntheir policies would have on hard-working taxpayers, a time when they \nwould have rejected this budget as a joke. But those voices of reason \nhave been mostly chased out of today's DC Democrats. The few who remain \nhave been sidelined and silenced throughout the budget process. Even \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee has been pushed aside so his \nfellow Democrats can quickly ram through their massive tax hike.\n  It will be no surprise to hear that my conference opposes a leftwing \nmanifesto masquerading as a responsible budget, and when Americans get \na chance to digest their budget and the one House Republicans put \nforward earlier this week, they will see some very clear differences \nbetween a budget that balances and one that enshrines waste and \ncronyism; between a budget that helps bring the economy back to health \nand one that kills jobs; between a budget that measures compassion in \nhow many people it helps and one that counts compassion in how many \nhard-earned tax dollars are sent to Washington for politicians to \nwaste; between a budget that strengthens Medicare and one that would \nput Medicare even further out of reach for future generations. In \nshort, they will see a bold, reformist Republican budget centered on \ntheir needs and an extreme Democratic budget centered on the needs of \nWashington bureaucrats and politicians.\n  I hope Senate Democrats think again before they choose to push such \nan extreme budget forward because I think they will find that Americans \nagree with Republicans on the most important point: We need to grow the \neconomy, not the Government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/14/senate-section/article/S1828-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1828-S1829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN McCAIN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, more than four decades ago, millions \nof people watched in awe as Neil Armstrong took his first steps on the \nMoon. I remember that day still, and I am sure many of you do. It \nremains one of our country's proudest moments. But not every American \nwas able to share in the excitement. As the senior Senator from Arizona \nput it, when the momentous event occurred, I had no idea it was \nhappening. I and several hundred comrades were otherwise engaged. That \nis because 2 years earlier, on his 23rd bombing run over Vietnam, a \nmissile hit Lieutenant Commander McCain's plane. He ejected, his body \nspiraling through the air until it hit water thousands of feet below--a \nlake right in the center of Hanoi.\n  An angry mob set upon him. They ripped off his clothes; they hit, \nkicked, and spat upon him. They bayoneted his ankle and his groin. The \nSenator was left with two broken arms and a broken leg, and he passed \nsort of in and out of consciousness. But he has never forgotten what \ncame next, when Vietnamese forces gathered him up and took him to the \nso-called Hanoi Hilton. As the massive steel doors locked shut behind \nhim, Senator McCain said he felt ``a deeper dread than [he has] ever \nfelt since.''\n  He would remain an enemy captive for the next 5\\1/2\\ years, cut off \nfrom family and friends, from even the simplest joys of life, things \nyou and I take for granted: the aromas of Thanksgiving, the far-away \nthrill of cheering a hometown team on to victory, the sounds that let \nus know the world around us is alive with action, with movement, with \nhope. But John McCain never lost hope even when he was locked in \nsolitary confinement and even when he was tortured. His captors poorly \ncast his broken arms on purpose. They broke an arm again and hung the \nyoung captive by his lifeless limbs so they could torture him some \nmore.\n  Eventually, Vietnamese officials discovered he was the son of a high-\nranking Navy officer and offered him a release. He turned their offers \ndown. It was partly because he knew an early release would be used \ncynically by the Communist propaganda machine but, more importantly, \nbecause he refused to skip the line ahead of his fellow POWs.\n  It is one thing to talk about attributes such as courage and bravery \nin the abstract, it is quite another to demonstrate those qualities in \nthe most trying of circumstances. It reminds me of an old saying: ``The \nsuperior man is modest in his speech but exceeds in his actions.'' That \nkind of man--well, that is just who John McCain is.\n  His campaign motto in 2008 was ``Country First.'' For some \npoliticians that might have been just a slogan, but for my colleague \nfrom Arizona I know it was authentically and truly him. Senator McCain \nstill wears the scars of his long detention. He cannot raise his arms \nabove shoulder level. One of his legs still has not fully healed. I can \nonly imagine the weight of the memories he still must carry with him. \nYet he endures--a man who has always seen his life in service, \ntransformed from a captive of the enemy into a servant of the people.\n  For more than 30 years he has represented Arizona with great \ndistinction, in both the House and Senate. He is a valued member of the \nSenate Republican Conference, especially when it comes to issues he \ncares about most passionately--defense being at the top of the list. As \nsomeone who experienced the horrors of war in the truest sense, he \nunderstands what it means to send young Americans into harm's way, and \nhe never takes those decisions lightly.\n  Because he knows what it means to be in chains, he also understands \nwhat it means to be free. He was able to leave his prison behind, but \nfor millions around the world there is no escape from suffering and \ndespair. That is why Senator McCain has always been so outspoken about \nhis view of the responsibility we, as a free people, have to help \nothers secure their own liberty, whether in Pyongyang, Libya, Damascus, \nor--a cause close to my own heart as well--Burma.\n  He has been absolutely unafraid to take unpopular and sometimes \nsolitary stands on issues when he believes in the cause. He never \nwavered in his support for the surge in Iraq, for instance, even when \nothers said it would take a ``willing suspension of disbelief'' for the \npolicy to succeed, but it did. That is why when he speaks, others \nlisten--even when they may not agree with him.\n  Senator McCain provides a unique and much needed perspective in the \nSenate, and we are fortunate to have him as our colleague. He certainly \nknows I am grateful for his contributions. Let's take a moment today to \nmark the 40th anniversary of Senator McCain's release from captivity \nand to thank him for his sacrifice on behalf of all of us for enduring \nthe unendurable, for keeping faith with his fellow POWs, and for \nbelieving in our country when others had given up hope. We honor him \nfor his service, service that began as a plebe so many years ago, and \nservice that continues today as a Member of the Senate.\n  We thank you, Senator McCain.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n[[Page S1829]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I am grateful for the kind words and \nsentiment expressed by my leader Senator McConnell, and I appreciate \nvery much his kind remarks. On this anniversary day, I still think the \ngreatest honor of my life was the privilege of serving in the company \nof heroes who inspired all of us to things that otherwise we may not \nhave been capable of. It has been a great honor for me to serve with \nSenator McConnell as my leader in the Senate. On this particular day, I \nappreciate his very kind sentiments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, what a wonderful speech. I am proud to \nserve with Senator McCain. America has so few heroes. America needs all \nthe heroes we can get, and people whom we can identify with--not comic \nbook figures wearing weird costumes. There are men and women who put \nthemselves in harm's way and do daring and dashing things for the good \nof other people, and it is just an honor. We have our dustups, but that \nis part of the fun.\n  I just want to salute Senator McCain in the warmest and most sincere \nway. God bless Senator McCain, and we wish him good health--and even a \ngood voice and occasionally a good amendment. Again, it is an honor.\n  If I might speak to the Republican leader, I am so glad Senator \nMcConnell did this today because I think we need to take a pause to \nunderstand why we are in it together, why we should respect each other, \nwork with each other, and take a moment or two to recall a great story \nabout a great hero.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Maryland. I can \nassure her that if she and I had served together in that place faraway, \nshe would have been a very tough and courageous resister.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn], for himself and Mr. \n     McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 66.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To temporarily freeze the hiring of nonessential Federal \n                               employees)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. FREEZE ON HIRING OF NONESSENTIAL FEDERAL EMPLOYEES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), none \n     of the funds made available under division A, B, C, D, E, or \n     F of this Act may be used by any Executive agency (as defined \n     under section 105 of title 5, United States Code, except that \n     such term shall not include the Government Accountability \n     Office) to hire any new employee.\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to the \n     hiring of an excepted employee or an employee performing \n     emergency work, as such terms are defined by the Office of \n     Personnel Management.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this is a fairly straightforward \namendment. It actually follows the guidelines of the recommendations of \nthe Office of Management and Budget. The administration claims that \nduring this sequestration period we will have to furlough essential \nworkers, which will negatively impact the daily lives of the American \npeople.\n  Despite dire warnings to cut TSA agents--by the way, Director Pistole \nthinks they will be just fine, which is totally opposite of what the \nrest of the administration has said. Air traffic controllers, food \ninspectors, and thousands of new Federal jobs have been posted since \nthe sequester went into effect.\n  Let me spend a minute on this issue. Since the sequester has been in \neffect, the Department of Treasury is looking to hire a leadership \ndevelopment specialist with a salary of $182,000. The FDA advertised \nfor a social media management service to streamline management of \nmultiple social media platforms. There are 23 openings on the Federal \njobs list for recreation, which includes: recreation aide, recreation \nspecialist, and recreation assistant. The Air Force is looking to hire \nseveral full-time painters. There is a search to pay $165,000 for a \ndirector of history and museum policies and programs.\n  The list continues: The Department of Treasury is currently \nadvertising for an outreach manager. The Department of Labor is looking \nfor a staff assistant at $81,000 a year to answer the phone. There is a \nsearch for a policy coordinator for the Department of Health and Human \nServices to attend and facilitate meetings at $81,000 a year. There is \nan opening for a director for the Air Force history and museums \npolicies and programs at $165,000 a year. There is another opening for \nan analyst for the Legislative Affairs Office at the Marine Corps for \n$90,000 a year. The Department of Agriculture is looking for a director \nof the government employee services at a range of $179,000 a year.\n  There is an opening for counsel for the Morris K. Udall Scholarship \nFoundation at $155,000 a year, an opening for an executive assistant at \nthe Department of Agriculture Forest Service to prepare itineraries for \ntravel plans, an opening for an executive staff officer for the Air \nForce to represent the director of staff at meetings to write draft \nreports and memos at $93,000.\n  These are all nonpriority hirings at a time when we are in sequester. \nWhat this amendment would do is simply implement OMB's guidance and \nfreeze hiring for nonessential Federal positions during sequestration \nbut still allow hiring of employees defined by the Office of Personnel \nManagement as exempted or emergency personnel.\n  If this amendment does not freeze hiring of exempted or emergency \nemployees as defined by OPM--and we all know what that means--there is \nalso an exemption in here that gives agencies the flexibility to know \nwhich positions are critical to performing duties and allows their \nprogression.\n  Right now the agencies are not following OMB's guidance. We hear \nabout possible furloughs, but a good portion\n\n[[Page S1830]]\n\nof those furloughs would never be necessary if, in fact, the agencies \nwould follow OMB's guidance. The government is seeking to hire travel \nspecialists, recreation aides, public affairs specialists, outreach \nmanagers, librarians, historians, administrative assistants, and many \nother nonessential positions.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services has posted a job opening \nfor a travel specialist with a salary of $97,000 a year, and the job is \nto obtain domestic and international travel for HHS officials. It is \nnot essential to their overall mission and actually facilitates more \ntravel, which is one of the things also recommended by OMB in their \nguidance that they are not to do.\n  All we are saying is follow the OMB guidance in freezing nonessential \nnew hiring and we could prevent furloughs to the government workers \ncarrying out essential services and mission-critical duties today.\n  I have no question that some of these positions can be helpful to the \nagency which they have advertised for, but they are not necessary at \nthis time until we get past this pothole in the road. Canceling job \nopenings at the FAA of two community planners and four management \nprogram assistants would spare 1,000 air traffic controllers from \nfurlough. Let me say that again. Just canceling and not hiring these \nfour people at FAA could affect 1,000 Federal employees. Canceling just \none job opening for a librarian at the Department of Agriculture could \noffset one furlough a day for as many as 750 entry-level workers at the \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  What we are asking is simply for the agencies to follow the guidance \nthat has already been out there, and we would mandate that as part of \nthis continuing resolution omnibus appropriations bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Coburn \namendment. I am not going to go into the process of wanting to keep the \nbill as free of amendments as possible which has been something the \nHouse has requested us to do. This is the continuing resolution. It is \nnot the authorization legislation and so on. We have to get this funded \nfor the rest of the fiscal year 2013.\n  I wish to comment about the Senator from Oklahoma in that he is often \non to something very good. Sometimes we are so worried about clinging \nto party positions we don't listen to one another. He has been a big \nhelp to me on my Commerce-Justice-Science bill, where we uncovered just \nridiculous catering situations, and we had a very good amendment one \ntime that addressed an agency paying $4 for each meatball at some \nreception. I mean, truly folly, truly stupidity. So at this time, \nwhether it is big government or small government but smart government, \nwe do have to have a sense of frugality.\n  However, I will come back to this: The Coburn amendment would propose \na hiring freeze on all Federal employees except those deemed essential.\n  In late February, OMB issued guidance instructing agencies to apply \nincreased scrutiny to areas such as new hiring and to ensure that such \nactions were taken only when vital to carrying out the agency's mission \nas a result of the uncertainty in terms of agencies facing a possible \ngovernment shutdown on March 27 and the Draconian sword of sequester \nthat is already underway. The Coburn amendment would force agencies to \nrely on contracting out functions the Federal Government should be \nhandling or that are more expensive to outsource simply because they \nare not allowed to hire necessary staff.\n  We can debate essentials, but we are not going to do that this \nmorning. What is an essential Federal employee? I have close to 300 \npeople working as Federal prison guards in Garrett County this morning. \nThey have increasingly violent prisons. We are increasingly overcrowded \nbecause of the skimpy funding that even I and the Justice Department \nhave to put into the prisons. We had a prison guard killed just a few \nweeks ago in our neighboring State of Pennsylvania.\n  In any organization, whether it is a Federal agency or Microsoft, \nthere might be a position we don't want or need or when we hear about \nit, it seems to have no value. Let's take the travel specialist. I am \nnot standing here with a manual of all the civil service jobs, but here \nis what I think a travel specialist does.\n  The Department of HHS has to travel, whether it is the CDC, whether \nit is NIH. They are involved with other agencies in other parts of the \ncountry and they are involved with counterparts in other parts of the \nworld. They have to get the best deal when they travel. How many of us, \nwhen we have tried to book an airline--booking an airline is similar to \ncommodity trading; one day it is this, one minute it is that if I call \nDelta. Maybe American is going the way I want to go, but they only land \nat 7:17, when I have to be there at 12:14. So it is akin to being a \ncommodity trader. Should Sebelius be doing that on her own? I don't \nthink so. Should the head of CDC be doing that? No. They need a travel \nspecialist who knows how to work it and maybe, in the long run, provide \nsafe travel.\n  I support the direction the Senator is going in. He told me something \nI didn't know about, where some of these VA international conferences \ntake over 50 people, for which I don't know what more than 50 people \nwould do. So he is on the right track with many things. I think we have \nto be very careful when we are dealing with the entire civil service--\nmillions of people, 2 million people who work for the Federal \nGovernment--and put a freeze on them. Some Federal agencies have had a \nhiring freeze for some time. The Department of Defense is already under \na civilian hiring freeze.\n  It is important to recognize a hiring freeze would only have limited \nsavings. A hiring freeze does not solve these problems, and it is just \none more blow to a battered civil service. Remember, we have had civil \nservice pay freezes in effect. So we have now frozen their pay for \nseveral years. They are facing increased costs in their pension program \nand now they are going to face furlough, and then we are going to tell \nthem we don't think a lot of you are essential.\n  I come back to what I said a few days ago. If we are going to have a \ndemocratic government, we need to have an independent civil service. We \nmight not always like what they do. We might not like every position \nthat is in an agency. We need a civil service that goes beyond party, \ngoes beyond the administration, and performs their jobs based on \neducational qualification and a skill set, and one that is meritocracy \nbased. We then can focus on making sure we have the best civil service \nin the world so we can point to what a real civil service is; thereby, \nencouraging new, emerging democracies to be able to follow our lead.\n  I hope we do not accept the Coburn amendment. I hope if we are going \nto talk about the size of the government, we should do that next week \non the budget bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. First of all, I am so excited with the chairman and \nranking member of the Appropriations Committee. I have to say, since I \nhave been in the Senate, I have found these two individuals more than \ncapable to work with and more than willing to work with me and I wish \nto congratulate them on bringing their bill to the floor.\n  I have to very adamantly disagree because I think the chairman of the \ncommittee has missed my point. Every American family over the last 5 \nyears has been making tough decisions about priorities. By not hiring \nsome of what most Americans--a wall can get painted 6 months later. It \ndoesn't have to be painted today. As a matter of fact, if we go over to \nall the Senate and House office buildings, we see the Architect of the \nCapitol repainting all the walls, with wet signs out there, while we \ncan't let the visitors into our buildings. There is something wrong \nwith us in the way we are managing. We are painting walls that don't \nhave to be painted at the same time we make citizens wait in line for \nan hour and a half to get into our buildings.\n  It is about priorities. The fact is, if we don't fill some of these \nsuperfluous positions that are not absolutely necessary right now, many \nFederal employees will not get furloughed. That is the point I am \nmaking. I can't believe\n\n[[Page S1831]]\n\nwe have to have a research librarian right now at the Air Force at a \ntime when we don't have the money to put our pilots in the air to keep \nthem trained.\n  So we are not talking about essential employees. By the way, \nessential and excepted employees are prison guards. Not one of them \nwill be furloughed. So if we care about Federal employees, we do not \nwant to spend money on positions that are truly not necessary right \nnow, given the priorities, so the rest of the Federal workforce can be \nthere.\n  Let me go back through this list again. Is it important to hire a \nlawyer for the Morris K. Udall Scholarship Foundation at a salary of \n$155,000 right now? Is that important? How many people in the Federal \nGovernment would that keep from being furloughed and the services \ncontinue if we don't fill that position? How about an executive \nassistant to the Department of Agriculture Forest Service to prepare \nitineraries and briefing and information material packages at $57,000.\n  What we don't get is all the rest of America is doing this already \nand now the OMB has recommended we do it and the agencies will not do \nit. We ought to tell them to do it for the benefit of the Federal \nemployees who are working for us right now because they are the ones \nwho are going to get furloughed. By not hiring these absolutely--I \ndon't doubt they are positions we can use and are effective in many \nareas, but they are not a priority right now. I would think the \npriority right now would be having the people we have employed working.\n  How about a leadership development specialist at Treasury; is that \nreally a priority right now, at $182,000 a year? That is a priority, \nwhile laying off IRS employees so people get their refund back? Tell me \nwhich one is more important. I would think the American taxpayers would \nrather get an answer than a busy signal when they call the IRS versus \nus hiring a leadership development specialist. There are 23 openings \nrelated to recreation at the FDA right now--for recreation. Is that \ntruly a priority for us right now?\n  We have a 60-vote limit on this. I am fine with a 60-vote threshold. \nBut America is going to vote 80 percent or 90 percent with what I am \nrecommending. We have a 60-vote threshold so we can make sure it \ndoesn't happen, so we don't apply priorities, so we don't apply common \nsense, and everybody knows that if this was at a 50-vote margin, it \nwould fly through here. The reason it is 60 is so we can protect people \npolitically and not do the best right thing for America.\n  This bill is going to go through here. We are going to pass it. The \ngovernment isn't going to be shut down. We are going to conference it \nand get it worked out. Senator Shelby and Senator Mikulski will get \nthat job done. We have absolute confidence in them.\n  This isn't a deal killer; this is common sense. This is what every \nbusiness, every family in America is doing right now. They don't spend \nmoney they don't have on things that aren't absolutely necessary, and \nthat is all this amendment does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COBURN. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the first amendment vote today will be on \nthe amendment I laid down yesterday on the Labor-HHS part of this so-\ncalled continuing resolution.\n  As I pointed out yesterday, the amount of money I am dealing with in \nmy amendment is exactly what is in the CR. There is no additional money \nin there, but you need to understand whoever negotiated this package \nkept Labor-HHS, NIH, and others in a CR rather than in a bill form.\n  Interestingly enough, in the package before us Defense receives a \nfull-length appropriations bill, as well as Homeland Security, \nAgriculture, Military Construction, Commerce-Justice-Science. They \nreceive a full appropriations bill but not Labor, Health and Human \nServices, Education and Related Agencies. Interesting.\n  The one bill which speaks to educating our young, ensuring working \nfamilies have adequate childcare protection, increasing our medical \nresearch to NIH, protecting food safety and drug safety through the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention--this must be on autopilot \nfrom last year and the year before. Therefore, my amendment costs \nexactly what is in the underlying CR.\n  What is in this amendment was agreed upon by the House Democrats and \nHouse Republicans, Senate Republicans, Senate Democrats in our \nnegotiations last December in the Appropriations Committee.\n  There is a lot of talk about being bipartisan around here. We engaged \nin bipartisan negotiations last fall. It took us months, and we reached \nan agreement in December. That is bipartisan work. My amendment mirrors \nexactly what that agreement was. I am told now all Republicans are \ngoing to vote no. Why? Why, I ask?\n  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act under the CR contains \nno increase. Under my amendment, there would be a $125 million \nincrease.\n  Title I for poor kids in school has a $107 million increase in my \namendment and no increase in the underlying bill.\n  NIH in the underlying bill contains a $71 million increase and under \nmy amendment a $211 million increase.\n  Childcare in the underlying bill is $50 million and my amendment is \n$107 million.\n  AIDS drugs, there is no increase in the underlying bill but a $29 \nmillion increase in my amendment.\n  These are things we hammered out through tough negotiations last \nDecember.\n  I know the Senator from Alabama has said there were some open items \nwe didn't include. No, of course I didn't include open items, because \nthey weren't agreed to. What I have in my amendment is what we agreed \nto, with one exception. As I said yesterday, there is no additional \nfunding for health care reform, which Republicans are objecting to. It \nis not in my amendment, and still they are objecting.\n  Republicans say this amendment will kill the whole package. I must \nask why funding these and keeping within the same dollar level as in \nthe underlying bill kills the bill?\n  Chairman Rogers, a Republican on the House side, helped negotiate \nthese numbers last December. I hear a lot of talk on both sides of the \naisle about how much they support NIH, how much they support biomedical \nresearch. I say to my Republican friends, here is the time to prove it, \n$211 million versus $71 million. There is no increase in my amendment \nof the underlying bill at all. Because we did a bill rather than a CR, \nwe may move numbers around a little bit.\n  I want to know, where are the champions of NIH? Where are they? This \nis the chance to vote on it and not increase spending one single dime.\n  I would point out a number of medical groups and research groups have \nendorsed this amendment: the American Cancer Society, the American \nDental Association, the American Diabetes Association, the American \nHeart Association, the Association of American Medical Colleges, BIO, \nParkinson's Action Network, and more. Almost 300 patient advocacy \ngroups and scientific societies support this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent a list of these groups be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                   Groups Supporting Harkin Amendment\n\n       Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research Funding, AIDS Institute, \n     AIDS United, American Association of Community Colleges, \n     American Association of School Administrators, American \n     Cancer Society, American Dental Association, American \n     Diabetes Association, American Federation of Government \n     Employees, AFL-CIO, AFSCME, American Federation of Teachers \n     American Heart Association.\n       Association of American Medical Colleges, Association of \n     Assistive Technology Act Programs, Association of Community \n     College Trustees, Association of Farmworker Opportunity \n     Programs, BIO, Center for Law and\n\n[[Page S1832]]\n\n     Social Policy, Child Care Aware of America, Coalition on \n     Human Needs, College Board, Committee for Education Funding, \n     Community Action Partnership, Council for Adult and \n     Experiential Learning, Council for Advancement of Adult \n     Literacy.\n       Corporate Voices for Working Families, Corporation for a \n     Skilled Workforce, Council for Exceptional Children, Council \n     for Opportunity in Education (TRIO), Council of Chief State \n     School Officers, Council of the Great City Schools, Early \n     Care and Education Consortium, First Five Years Fund, Friends \n     of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research \n     (FNIDCR), Great City Schools, Insight Center for Community \n     Economic Development, Jobs for the Future, National \n     Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC).\n       National Association of Federally Impacted Schools (NAFIS), \n     National Association of State Alcohol & Drug Abuse Directors, \n     National Association for the Education of Young Children, \n     National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, National \n     Coalition for Literacy, National College Transition Network \n     at World Education, Inc., National Council for Workforce \n     Education, National Education Association, National Head \n     Start Association, National League of Cities, National \n     Network to End Domestic Violence, National PTA.\n       National School Boards Association, National Skills \n     Coalition, National Title I Association, National Transitions \n     of Care Coalition, National Women's Law Center, Ovarian \n     Cancer National Alliance, Parkinson's Action Network, PACER \n     Center (Minnesota), Sargent Shriver National Center on \n     Poverty Law, Teach for America, The Corps Network, Trust for \n     America's Health, Wider Opportunities for Women, Zero to \n     Three.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again I say why would this amendment kill \nthe bill? It was agreed to by the distinguished chairman of the House \nAppropriations Committee, Chairman Rogers, last December. This is what \nwe agreed to. Why is it the one bill in Appropriations which speaks to \nthe human needs of our country, the educational needs of our kids, the \nscientific and research needs we need for addressing some of our \nchronic illnesses in this country--why is this bill singled out? Why is \nit singled out to not have a full-standing bill but must be in the \ncontinuing resolution at the same level on autopilot as last year? I \nsubmit we can make these decisions. We can decide we are going to do \nthese kinds of increases, keeping within the same dollar level as we \nhave in the underlying bill.\n  I don't believe this will kill the bill. I believe those who don't \nwant these increases, who don't want to see an increase in NIH will \nhold us up and say, yes, it will kill the bill. This is an idle threat. \nThat is what it is, simply an idle threat. This is the third year now \nwhere they have put these programs on autopilot.\n  I daresay if we don't do this, this will be the last, we have seen \nthe last of the Labor-HHS appropriations bills ever passed in this body \nor the other body for many years into the future. We will still be on \nautopilot. Now is the time to step up, break that trend of putting us \non autopilot every year. Now is the time for us to make these \ndecisions. I hope the champions of NIH, who say they are champions of \nNIH, will step up and support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 53 offered by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nHarkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 2 minutes. After my remarks, I ask that the senior Senator from \nArizona be recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask that I be recognized when the \nsenior Senator from Arizona has finished his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modified request? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I don't yet want to call up my \namendment--I have been working with Chairman Mikulski on this--until \nthey get an agreement. However, I will discuss for a moment amendment \nNo. 83, which I am cosponsoring with Senator Isakson of Georgia. It \ndoes help us restore what Senator Mikulski has been working toward, \nwhich is regular order in this Chamber.\n  This is an amendment having to do with some language dealing with a\n\n[[Page S1833]]\n\npilot project with customs and privatization that Senator Landrieu has \nsupported. I have spoken to Senator Landrieu about this issue, and we \nneed to talk through some other things. If we are going to do regular \norder the way we need to, this language should come in front of the \nFinance Committee to work out these issues, where Senator Isakson and I \nsit. I think we should not succumb to the temptation to legislate \nthrough appropriations, and this would be one way of doing that.\n  Later I will ask my colleagues to support amendment No. 83, sponsored \nby me and Senator Isakson. I appreciate the forbearance of Senator \nMcCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. BROWN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the chairwoman, Senator \nMikulski, for allowing me to speak as if in morning business.\n\n\n                                 Syria\n\n  On March 15, 2011, thousands of Syrian men, women, and children in \nthe city of Deraa gathered together in a public square that is known \ntoday as Dignity Square. They came together to peacefully protest \nagainst the Syrian regime's decision to arrest and torture a group of \n15 teenagers whose crime had been exercising their universally \nrecognized rights to free speech. Their crime was speaking truth to \nthose in power in Syria. They sketched on the wall of their school a \nstatement that remains true in Syria today: ``The people want the \nregime to fall.''\n  Since these peaceful calls for change were first heard in Syria 2 \nyears ago, more than 70,000 men, women, and children have been \nmassacred by the Assad regime. More than 1 million refugees have fled \ntheir country at a rate of 8,000 people each day as of last month, and \n2.5 million people have been displaced within their country. Only the \ngenocide in Rwanda and the first Iraq war have driven more people to \nrefugee status over a similar period of time.\n  These facts and figures are startling. Behind each statistic is a \nprofound human tragedy to which we cannot grow numb as the conflict in \nSyria presses on into a third year. I certainly cannot.\n  Last April Senator Joe Lieberman and I visited a Syrian refugee camp \nin southern Turkey, and earlier this year I traveled together with \nSenators Whitehouse, Ayotte, Blumenthal, and Coons to the Zaatari \nrefugee camp in Jordan. I have seen my share of suffering and death, \nbut the horror I saw in those camps and the stories I heard still haunt \nme today. There were men who had lost all their children, women and \ngirls who had been gang-raped, children who had been tortured, and none \nof these were the random acts of cruelty that sadly occur in war. \nSyrian Army defectors told us that killing, raping, and torture was \nwhat they were instructed to do as a tactic of terror and intimidation. \nSo if I get a little emotional when I talk about Syria, that is why.\n  The cost--both strategic and humanitarian--of this conflict has been \nand will continue to be devastating. Earlier this week UNICEF released \na report detailing the impact of Syria's 2-year conflict on the \nchildren of Syria. The report states:\n\n       In Syria, children have been exposed to grave human rights \n     violations, including killing and maiming, sexual violence, \n     torture, arbitrary detention, recruitment and use by armed \n     forces and groups, and exposure to explosive remnants of war. \n     . . . As millions of children inside Syria and across the \n     region witness their past and their future disappear amidst \n     the rubble and destruction of this prolonged conflict, the \n     risk of them becoming a lost generation grows every day.\n\n  The conflict in Syria is breeding a lost generation--a whole new \ngeneration of extremists. Earlier this year I met a Syrian teacher in \nthe Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan who told me that the generation of \nyoung Syrians growing up in these camps and inside Syria will take \nrevenge on those who did nothing to help them in their hour of greatest \nneed. We should be ashamed of our collective failure to come to the aid \nof the Syrian people. But more than that, we should be deeply \nconcerned. As much as I want to disagree with that Syrian teacher, I am \nhaunted by the belief that she is exactly right.\n  As the conflict of Syria enters its third year, we cannot lose sight \nof the clear trend toward escalation both in the nature and quality of \nthe killing. In recent months the use of SCUD missiles against \ncivilians fits into a pattern of forced escalation by the Assad regime \nover the past year.\n  In January 2012 the regime began to use artillery as Syrian \nopposition forces became more capable against regime ground forces. In \nJune 2012 Assad escalated his use of air power because the rebels were \ngaining control of the countryside. Today the regime is intensifying \nits air campaign by firing SCUD missiles at civilian populations, which \nis taking a deadly toll, particularly in the north where thousands of \ncivilians have been killed over the past several weeks.\n  The regime's escalation to Scud missiles--which can be used as \ndelivery vehicles for chemical weapons--should be alarming to us all. \nAccording to a recent report from the Washington Institute for Near \nEast Policy, Scud missiles can deliver a 1,000-pound, high-explosive \nwarhead or a chemical agent and, as the report states:\n\n       The rebels have no means of knowing when the missiles have \n     been fired, where they are going, or what kinds of warheads \n     are on board. In fact, even with good intelligence \n     collection, there is no reliable way to know which Scuds have \n     been uploaded with chemical warheads.\n\n  Let there be no doubt that the threat of chemical weapons is real. I \nnote this morning's headline from the Associated Press: ``Israel's \nMilitary Intelligence Chief says Syria's Assad readying to use chemical \nweapons.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article from the Washington Post be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nIsrael's Military Intelligence Chief says Syria's Assad Readying to Use \n                            Chemical Weapons\n\n                         (By Associated Press)\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 14, 2013]\n\n       Jerusalem.--Israel's military intelligence chief says \n     Syria's embattled president, Bashar Assad, is preparing to \n     use chemical weapons.\n       Maj. Gen. Aviv Kochavi told a security conference in the \n     coastal town of Herzliya that Assad is stepping up his \n     offensive against rebels trying to oust him.\n       Kochavi claims Assad is making advanced preparations to use \n     chemical weapons, but has not yet given the order to deploy \n     them.\n       He did not disclose information about why he thinks Assad \n     is preparing to use them.\n       Israel has long expressed concerns that Assad's stockpile \n     of chemical weapons could end up in the hands of groups \n     hostile to Israel like Hezbollah or al-Qaida inspired \n     organizations.\n       Israel has kept out of Syria's civil war, but it is \n     concerned that violence could spill over the border into \n     northern Israel.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. This is a dangerous and unfair fight, and the costs to \nthe United States are significant. Russia and Iran are Assad's \nlifelines in this brutal fight. Iran continues to use Iraqi airspace to \nfly fighters and large quantities of weapons to Syria to help Assad \nwith the killing. As many as 50,000 Syrians, militiamen, in Syria are \nbeing supported by Tehran and Hezbollah, according to a Washington Post \nreport. Meanwhile, Russia continues to ship heavy weapons to Assad--\nincluding, as senior Obama administration officials have stated, the \nvery helicopter gunships the regime is currently using to bomb and \nshatter civilians.\n  As the United States and the international community stand idle, the \nconsequences are clear. Syria will become a failed State in the heart \nof the Middle East, threatening both our ally Israel and our NATO ally \nTurkey. With or without Assad, the country will continue to devolve \ninto a full-scale civil war that is increasingly sectarian, repressive, \nand unstable. In the meantime, more and more ungoverned space will come \nunder the control of al-Qaida and its allies. Violence and radicalism \nwill spill even more into Lebanon and Iraq, fueling sectarian conflicts \nthat are still burning in both countries. Syria will turn into a \nbattlefield between Sunni and Shia extremists, each backed by foreign \npowers which will ignite sectarian tensions from North America to the \ngulf and risk a wider regional conflict. This is the course we are on \nin Syria, and in the absence of international action, the situation \nwill only get worse.\n  Although Secretary Kerry and other administration officials have said \nour goal in Syria is to ``change Assad's calculus'' and make room for a \nnegotiated transition, the truth is, in the absence\n\n[[Page S1834]]\n\nof a shift in the balance of military power on the ground, that is a \nhopeless goal. What the administration does not seem to realize is what \nPresident Bill Clinton came to understand in Bosnia--that a diplomatic \nresolution in conflict such as this is not possible until the military \nbalance of power changes on the ground. As long as a murderous \ndictator, be it Slobodan Milosevic or Bashar al-Assad, believes he is \nwinning on the battlefield, he has no incentive to stop fighting and \nnegotiate.\n  Our European powers--led by the French and British--seem to \nunderstand this clearly, which is why they are urgently working to \npersuade their allies to lift an embargo to supply arms to the Syrian \nopposition. They understand that only a change in military power will \nbring this conflict to an end.\n  The same is true for the regime's foreign supporters. Despite \ndestroying Russia's reputation in the Arab world, the Russian \nGovernment has stuck with Assad for nearly 2 years now. What makes us \nthink President Putin is about to change course now, when Assad is \nstill a dominant power on the ground?\n  The Syrian opposition needs our help to change the balance of power \non the ground. I have had the honor of meeting one of the key leaders \nof the Syrian opposition led by a man named Sheikh al-Khatib, the \nPresident of the Syrian National Coalition. Sheikh al-Khatib and the \nnational coalition are doing everything the international community \nasks of them. They have worked to bring together credible moderate \nmembers of the Syrian opposition. They are building institutions, both \ncivilian and military.\n  While the United States and our partners deserve credit in helping \nand pushing them to do so, when the opposition coalition asks \nresponsible nations for support--when they ask us to help them in \ncoordinating the distribution of aid, governing the liberated areas, \nand ultimately forming a transitional government--when they have asked \nus for this assistance, what have we done for them? Next to nothing.\n  Sheikh al-Khatib and the other moderate leaders of the Syrian \nopposition are struggling desperately to be relevant to their fellow \ncitizens who are fighting and dying every day inside the country. I \nbelieve most Syrians do not support al-Qaida. But many of us in the \nWest are still mired in our own internal debates about whether to \nprovide nonlethal assistance or whether to continue to provide \nassistance through international NGOs--many of which, I would add, \nstill function with the permission of the Assad regime and deliver most \nof their aid in Damascus--the fight in Syria is being won by \nextremists.\n  Al-Qaida fighters are showing up in greater numbers in the liberated \nareas of Syria with capable fighters and food and medicine and other \naid. Is it any wonder, then, that extremists are gaining ground in \nSyria?\n  It is this simple: What is left of the moderate Syrian opposition is \nin a race against time to survive the radicalization of this conflict \nand, right now, the world is failing them. The longer we fail them, the \nworse the outcome will be for us all.\n  The time to act is long overdue, but it is not too late. I know many \nwish to avoid this reality by telling themselves and others there is \nnothing we can do in Syria, that our only options are to let the \nSyrians fight it out alone to the bitter end or to launch a massive and \ncostly military intervention. But the truth is there are many options \nthat we have the capability to undertake that would save lives and \nprotect our important strategic interests in Syria.\n  First, the fact that the opposition in Syria is doing better \nmilitarily thanks to external support seems to validate what many of us \nhave been arguing for months; that opposition forces have enough \norganization to be supportable and that our support can help them to \nfurther improve their organization and command and control. This is an \nargument for doing more, not less, to aid the rebel fighters in Syria, \nincluding providing responsible members of the armed opposition who \nshare our goals and our values with the arms they need to succeed.\n  In a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee last month, I \nasked Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey whether they agreed with a proposal \nreportedly developed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and \nformer CIA Director David Petraeus last summer to have the United \nStates arm and train members of the Syrian opposition. I was very \npleased to hear both Secretary Panetta and Chairman Dempsey state that \nthey supported this proposal which, unfortunately, was refused by the \nWhite House. What this means is that the President overruled the senior \nleaders of his own national security team who were in unanimous \nagreement that America needs to take greater action to change the \nmilitary balance of power in Syria.\n\n  Beyond providing arms to the opposition, we have other capabilities \nat our disposal that could make a decisive difference on the ground and \nsave lives. I will give just two examples. NATO has deployed PATRIOT \nmissile batteries in Turkey that are capable of shooting down Syrian \naircraft as far south as Aleppo. We could establish a limited no-fly \nzone using these systems and, believe me, after the first few Syrian \naircraft are shot down, I doubt Assad's pilots will be lining up to fly \nmissions anymore. Another option would be to destroy Assad's aircraft \non their runways with cruise missiles and other standoff weapons. \nEither way, we can take Syrian air power off the table.\n  Once defended, these safe havens could become platforms for increased \ndeliveries of food and medicine, communications equipment, doctors to \ntreat the wounded, and other nonlethal assistance. They could also \nserve as staging areas for armed opposition groups to receive \nbattlefield intelligence, body armor, and weapons--from small arms and \nammunition to antitank rockets--and to train and organize themselves \nmore effectively, perhaps with foreign assistance. The goal would be to \nexpand the reach of these safe havens across more of the country.\n  Would these actions immediately end the conflict? No. But would they \nsave lives in Syria? Would they give the moderate opposition a better \nchance to succeed and marginalize the radicals? Would they help the \nWest regain the trust of the Syrian people? Do we have the capability \nto make a difference? To me, the answer to all these questions is \nclearly yes. Yes, there are risks to greater involvement in Syria. The \nopposition is still struggling to get organized. Al-Qaida and the other \nextremists are working to hijack the revolution, and there are already \nreports of reprisal killings of Alawites. These risks are real and \nserious, but the risks of continuing to do nothing are worse.\n  What is needed is American leadership. What is needed is a reminder \nof the words Abraham Lincoln spoke in his annual message to Congress in \n1862: ``We--even we here--hold the power, and bear the \nresponsibility.''\n  As we mark 2 years of this horrific conflict, if there were ever a \ncase that should remind us of this responsibility, it is that of Syria.\n  A few months ago, The Washington Post interviewed a young Bosnian man \nwho had survived the genocide of Srebrenica in 1995. This is how he \nsees the ongoing slaughter in Syria:\n\n       It's bazaar how ``never again'' has come to mean ``again \n     and again,'' he said. It's obvious that we live in a world \n     where Srebrenicas are still possible. What's happening in \n     Syria today is almost identical to what happened in Bosnia \n     two decades ago.\n\n  He could not be more correct. The conflict in Syria today is nearly \nindistinguishable from that in Bosnia during the 1990s. As Leon \nWieseltier wrote earlier this week in ``The New Republic''--I ask \nunanimous consent that the complete column by Leon Wieseltier be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Syria, Bosnia, and the Old Mistakes\n\n                          (By Leon Wieseltier)\n\n       ``One could never have supposed that, after passing through \n     so many trials, after being schooled by the skepticism of our \n     times, we had so much left in our souls to be destroyed.'' \n     Alexander Herzen wrote those words in 1848, after he \n     witnessed the savage crackdown on the workers' rebellion in \n     Paris. Having been disabused by history of any illusions \n     about the probabilities of justice, the great man was \n     surprised to discover that he had not yet been completely \n     disabused--that his belief in the betterment of human \n     affairs, however mutilated by experience, was still intact; \n     and what apprised him of his irreducible idealism was his \n     broken\n\n[[Page S1835]]\n\n     heart. In 1995, I cited Herzen's pessimistic optimism, or \n     optimistic pessimism, in an angry article about Bosnia and \n     the Western failure there, and glossed the lacerating \n     sentence this way: ``They did not suppose that they had so \n     much left in their souls to be destroyed! What basis for \n     bitterness do those words leave us, who have witnessed \n     atrocities of which the nineteenth century only dreamed, who \n     have watched totalitarian slaughter give way to post-\n     totalitarian slaughter, and the racial and tribal wars of \n     empire give way to the racial and tribal wars of empire's \n     aftermath? But bitterness is regularly refreshed . . .'' \n     Forgive my quotation of myself, but I have been reading in \n     the old Bosnian materials, in the writings of the reporters \n     and the intellectuals who campaigned for American action to \n     stop a genocide. I have been doing so because my Bosnian \n     bitterness has been refreshed by Syria.\n       I am finding crushing parallels: a president who is \n     satisfied to be a bystander, and ornaments his prevarications \n     with high moral pronouncements; an extenuation of American \n     passivity by appeals to insurmountable complexities and \n     obscurities on the ground, and to ethnic and religious \n     divisions too deep and too old to be modified by statecraft, \n     and to ominous warnings of unanticipated consequences, as if \n     consequences are ever all anticipated; an arms embargo \n     against the people who require arms most, who are the victims \n     of state power; the use of rape and torture and murder \n     against civilians as open instruments of war; the universal \n     knowledge of crimes against humanity and the failure of that \n     knowledge to affect the policy-making will; the dailiness of \n     the atrocity, its unimpeded progress, the long duration of \n     our shame in doing nothing about it. The parallels are not \n     perfect, of course. Only 70,000 people have been killed in \n     Syria, so what's the rush? Strategically speaking, moreover, \n     the imperative to intervene in Syria is far more considerable \n     than the imperative to intervene in Bosnia was. Assad is the \n     client of Iran and the patron of Hezbollah: his destruction \n     is an American dream. But his replacement by an Al Qaeda \n     regime is an American nightmare, and our incomprehensible \n     refusal to arm the Syrian rebels who oppose Al Qaeda even as \n     they oppose Assad will have the effect of bringing the \n     nightmare to pass. Secretary of State Kerry seems to desire a \n     new Syrian policy, but he is busily giving our side in the \n     conflict--if we are to have a side by the time this is over--\n     everything but what it really needs.\n       We must mark an anniversary. It has been two years since \n     fifteen teenagers in the town of Dara'a scrawled ``the people \n     want the regime to fall'' on the wall of a school, and were \n     arrested and then tortured for their temerity. The protest \n     that erupted in Dara'a, in the area in front of a mosque that \n     was dubbed ``Dignity Square,'' was a democratic rebellion, \n     and it swiftly spread. In Dara'a it was met by a crackdown \n     whose brutalities were documented in an unforgettably \n     chilling report by Human Rights Watch a few months later. \n     Dissolve now to Aleppo in ruins, where the dictator is \n     hurling ballistic missiles at his own population. Two years. \n     The Obama administration may as well not have existed. Though \n     two years into the Bosnian genocide Bill Clinton was still \n     more than a year away from bestirring himself morally and \n     militarily, so what's the rush? Clinton acted after the \n     massacre at Srebrenica. But Syria has already had its \n     Srebrenicas, and Obama is still elaborate and unmoved. He \n     also worries about a Russian response to American action, \n     when Putin's obstructionism in fact perfectly suits Obama's \n     preference for American inaction. People around the White \n     House tell me that Syria is agonizing for him. So what? It is \n     hard to admire the agony of the bystander, especially if the \n     bystander has the capability to act against the horror. Obama \n     likes to drape himself in Lincoln's language, so he should \n     ponder these words, from the Annual Message to Congress in \n     1862: ``We--even we here--hold the power, and bear the \n     responsibility.'' Obama wants the power but not the \n     responsibility. Unfortunately for him, the one brings the \n     other.\n       Not even the advent of Barack Obama can abrogate what was \n     learned in Bosnia in the antiquity of the twentieth century: \n     that in the case of moral emergencies, those with the ability \n     to act have the duty to act; that even justified action is \n     attended by uncertainty; that military force can do good as \n     well as evil, and that war is not the only, or the worst, \n     evil; that the withdrawal of the United States from global \n     leadership is an invitation to tyranny and inhumanity; that \n     American foreign policy must be animated by principle as well \n     by prudence, though there is nothing historically imprudent \n     about setting oneself resolutely on the side of decency and \n     democracy. ``How do I weigh tens of thousands who've been \n     killed in Syria versus the tens of thousands who are \n     currently being killed in the Congo?'' Obama recently told \n     this magazine, as an example of how he ``wrestle[s]'' with \n     the problem. Do not be fooled. It is not wrestling. It is \n     casuistry. He has no intention of coming to the assistance of \n     Congo, either. Obama is a strong cosmopolitan but a weak \n     internationalist. And he is, with his inclination to \n     disinvolvement, and his almost clinical confidence in his own \n     sagacity, implicating us in a disgrace, even we here.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Again, as Leon Wieseltier wrote earlier this week in the \nNew Republic:\n\n       I am finding crushing parallels: A President who is \n     satisfied to be a bystander, and ornaments his prevarications \n     with high moral pronouncements; an extenuation of American \n     passivity by appeals to insurmountable complexities and \n     obscurities on the ground, and to ethnic and religious \n     divisions too deep and too old to be modified by statecraft, \n     and to ominous warnings of anticipated consequences, as if \n     consequences are ever all anticipated; an arms embargo \n     against the people who require arms most, who are the victims \n     of state power; the use of rape and torture and murder \n     against civilians as open instruments of war; the universal \n     knowledge of crimes against humanity and the failure of that \n     knowledge to affect the policy-making will; the dailiness of \n     the atrocity, its unimpeded progress, the long duration of \n     our shame in doing nothing about it. The parallels are not \n     perfect, of course. Only 70,000 people have been killed in \n     Syria, so what's the rush?\n\n  We must ask ourselves: How many more innocent people must die before \nwe take action?\n  Amidst these crushing parallels, there is one key difference. In \nBosnia, President Clinton finally summoned the courage to lead the \nworld to intervene and stop the killing. It is worth recalling his \nwords upon ordering military action in Bosnia in 1995:\n\n       There are times and places where our leadership can mean \n     the difference between peace and war, and where we can defend \n     our fundamental values as a people and serve our most basic, \n     strategic interests. [T]here are still times when America and \n     America alone can and should make the difference for peace.\n\n  Those were the words of a Democratic President who led America to do \nthe right thing in stopping mass atrocities in Bosnia, and I remember \nworking with my Republican colleague Senator Bob Dole to support \nPresident Clinton in that endeavor.\n  The question for another Democratic President today, and for all of \nus in a position of responsibility, is whether we will again answer the \ndesperate pleas for rescue that are made uniquely to us as the United \nStates of America, and whether we will use our great power, as we have \ndone before at our best, not simply to advance our own interests but to \nserve a just cause that is greater than our interests alone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, may I take this opportunity to thank \nSenator McCain for his call to our consciences on the massacres in \nSyria by the tyrant Assad. I thank him for his reminder to us all that \nin the case of moral emergencies, those with the ability to act have \nthe duty to act, and I thank him for his efforts to call us to that \nduty.\n  While he is here on the floor, I would like to also take this chance \nto join in the warm remarks from colleagues on both sides of the aisle \non this 40th anniversary of his release from captivity in North \nVietnam--an anniversary that could have come a good deal sooner had he \nnot been so courageously stubborn in refusing to leave his comrades in \ncaptivity.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate recess \nfollowing my statement until 2:15 p.m. and that the first-degree \namendment filing deadline be at 3 o'clock today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Climate Change Obstructionism\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I rise today, as I have at least two \ndozen times in the past year, to say again that it is time for us to \nwake up to the stark reality of the climate changes carbon pollution is \ncausing.\n  Elected officials bear a responsibility every once in a while to \nescape the grip of the polluting special interests and to act in the \ninterests of regular Americans. We need to wake up and start talking \nabout the negative consequences, the harms of climate change. We need \nto wake up and mitigate--take steps to protect ourselves--and adapt to \nthe consequences that are already hitting our coasts and our forests, \nour cities and our farms, our economy and our way of life.\n\n[[Page S1836]]\n\n  But, of course, the climate deniers and the polluters do not want \nthat. The deniers want to prevent discussion of climate change \naltogether. In the past few years, in this body, climate science has \nbecome a taboo topic.\n  I watched, when my back was out in the last few days, one of the \nHarry Potter movies on television. Lord Voldemort was called ``He-Who-\nShall-Not-Be-Named'' in those Harry Potter stories. Well, carbon \npollution is the ``Pollution Which Shall Not Be Named.'' Climate \nchange--the harm that is caused by that pollution--is the ``Harm That \nShall Not Be Named.''\n  The obstructionists want to squelch any discussion of the ``Pollution \nWhich Shall Not Be Named'' so as to let big polluters continue dumping \ncarbon and other greenhouse gas into our oceans and atmosphere.\n  Take, for instance, the House Select Committee on Energy Independence \nand Global Warming, created in 2007 as a forum for confronting the \neconomic and security challenges of our dependence on foreign fuels. \nWhen Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in 2011, \nthey disbanded that committee. End of discussion.\n  Between May 2011 and December 2012, our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives, Henry Waxman and Bobby Rush, who were the Democratic \nranking members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and of the \nSubcommittee on Energy and Power, wrote 21 letters--21 letters--to \nChairmen Fred Upton and Ed Whitfield requesting hearings on climate \nchange. To date, there has been no response, no hearings. End of \ndiscussion.\n  House Republicans have tried to prevent the Department of the \nInterior and the Department of Agriculture from funding their climate \nadaptation plans--commonsense efforts to preserve our resources, \nprotect our farmers, and save taxpayer dollars. But, no, end of \ndiscussion.\n  I am sad to say that it is not just the House of Representatives. In \nthe Senate, in the Environment and Public Works Committee, Democrats \nhave been informed that there will be opposition to any legislation \nthat mentions climate change. It is one thing to want to oppose any \nlegislation that does anything about climate change. This is a further \nstep. The mere mention of climate change is enough to provoke \nRepublican opposition. End of discussion.\n  The taboo is being applied elsewhere in this Chamber. Just this week \na Republican Senator demanded that the following language be stricken \nfrom a noncontroversial Senate resolution. We pass resolutions here in \nthe Senate all the time by unanimous consent. A Republican Senator \nsaid: No, I am going to withhold my consent. I am going to deny the \nability of the resolution unless this offending language is removed. \nWhat was the offending language? I will quote:\n\n       [W]omen in developing countries are disproportionately \n     affected by changes in climate because of their need to \n     secure water, food, and fuel for their livelihood.\n\n  This body unanimously approved identical language in the last \nCongress, but today that mention of climate change in an otherwise \nnoncontroversial resolution draws automatic Republican opposition. \nAgain, end of discussion.\n  And they are not just trying to squelch the legislative branch. In \nthe executive branch, they have tried to defund salaries for White \nHouse climate advisers and withhold U.S. funds from the United Nations \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Again, end of discussion.\n  Now, you might think that in these efforts to attack funding, at \nleast they are motivated by a desire to cut spending. But then what \nwould be the motivation behind House Republicans blocking a no-cost \nrestructuring of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \nthat would have created a National Climate Service that is akin to the \nNational Weather Service--a simple reorganization that would have \ncentralized information about climate change, information which is in \nhigh demand by State and local governments and by the business \ncommunity? Again, the purpose is obvious: try to end the discussion.\n  I would remind my colleagues who are trying to silence this \ndiscussion with political power that history teaches, quite plainly, \nthat in contests between power and truth, truth always wins in the end. \nThe Inquisition tried to silence Galileo, but the Enlightenment \nhappened anyway, and the Earth does still spin around the Sun.\n  Chris McEntee, who is the executive director of the American \nGeophysical Union, said:\n\n       Limiting access to this kind of climate information won't \n     make climate change go away.\n\n  And shareholders and directors of corporations should consider what \nit will mean for the corporations that used their power to suppress the \ntruth once that truth becomes inescapable, once it is undeniable and \nthe denial campaign is seen as a fraud.\n  This Republican policy of climate change denial is alive and well at \nthe State level too. In 2010 Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli \nused his powers of office to harass former University of Virginia \nclimatologist Michael Mann and 39 other climate scientists and staff. \nAs a UVA grad, I am proud that the university fought back against this \npolitical attack on science and on academic freedom.\n  Said UVA:\n\n       [The attorney general's] action and the potential threat of \n     legal prosecution of scientific endeavor that has satisfied \n     peer-review standards send a chilling message to scientists \n     engaged in basic research involving Earth's climate and \n     indeed to scholars in any discipline. Such actions directly \n     threaten academic freedom and, thus, our ability to generate \n     the knowledge upon which informed public policy relies.\n\n  The victim of this harassment, Professor Mann, was more blunt. He \ncalled out this witch hunt as ``a coordinated assault against the \nscientific community by powerful vested interests who simply want to \nstick their heads in the sand and deny the problem of human-caused \nclimate change, rather than engage in the good faith debate about what \nto do about it.''\n  I would note that the Virginia Supreme Court ruled Attorney General \nCuccinelli's so-called investigation groundless. But that was not \nenough for obstructionists in Virginia. Last year the Republican \nVirginia Senate struck from a joint resolution titled ``Requesting the \nVirginia Institute of Marine Science to study strategies for adaptation \nto relative sea-level rise in Tidewater Virginia localities''--they \nstruck from that title the phrase ``sea-level rise'' both in the title \nand again in the text of the resolution. News outlets reported--get \nthis--that this was because ``sea-level rise'' was believed to be a \n``left-wing term.'' Add ``sea-level rise'' to the ``Harms Which Shall \nNot Be Named.''\n  In North Carolina, you can still say ``sea-level rise,'' but you \ncannot predict it or plan for it. That is because last year North \nCarolina's Republican-dominated legislature passed a bill requiring, as \na matter of law, that North Carolina coastal policy be based on \nhistoric rates of sea-level rise rather than on what North Carolina \nscientists actually predict. This means that even though North Carolina \nscientists predict 39 inches of sea-level rise within the century, \nNorth Carolina, by its own law, is only allowed to prepare for 8. King \nCanute would be so proud.\n  Further down, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources \nwrote a report more than a year ago on the risks climate change poses \nto the Palmetto State, but it was never released to the public. The \nState newspaper managed to obtain a copy of that study. The report \ncalls for South Carolina to prepare for increases in wildlife disease, \nloss of prime hunting habitat, and the invasion of non-native species. \nBut to Republicans, these are more ``Problems Which Shall Not Be \nNamed.''\n  In South Dakota, the Republican legislature, in 2010, even passed a \nnonbinding resolution calling for teaching in public schools that \nrelies on a number of common and thoroughly debunked climate denier \nclaims--in short, bringing climate denier propaganda into public high \nschool science classes.\n  Who might be behind this concerted effort to make climate science and \nclimate change taboo subjects--``Problems Which Shall Not Be Named''? \nWell, look at ALEC, the conservative American Legislative Exchange \nCouncil, which peddles climate denier legislation and undermines local \nand national efforts to protect against climate change. Look at ALEC's \nboard of directors, comprised of lobbyists from ExxonMobil, Peabody \nEnergy, and Koch Industries. Look at the array of\n\n[[Page S1837]]\n\nbogus denial organizations propped up to create doubt in this debate.\n  Against this tide of propaganda and nonsense stands States, including \nRhode Island, that already cap and reduce carbon emissions. Nineteen \nStates have climate adaptation plans completed or in progress. Thirty-\none States have a renewable and/or alternative energy portfolio \nstandard.\n  Twenty-three States require State buildings to meet Leadership in \nEnergy and Environmental Design or LEED standards.\n  The obstructionists may be well funded by the polluting special \ninterests, but the majority of the American people--the vast majority \nof the American people--understand that climate change is a very real \nproblem. They want their leaders to take action. Americans want their \nleaders to listen to the climate scientists. They want us to plan and \nto prepare, to limit, to mitigate, and to adapt to the changes that are \ncoming.\n  Here in Congress it is long past time to move forward with meaningful \naction. That is why I am working with several colleagues to establish a \nfee on carbon pollution. As I said in my remarks last week, the idea is \na simple one. It is basic market 101, law 101, and fairness 101. If you \nare creating a cost that someone else has to bear, that cost should be \nput back into the price of the product.\n  The big carbon polluters should pay a fee to the American people to \ncover the cost of their dumping their waste into our oceans and air. It \nis a cost they now happily push off onto the rest of us, allowing them \nan unfair and improper market advantage, in effect to cheat against \nrival energy sources. The deniers want to make this the problem which \nshall not be named. But I am here to name it, as are many others. I am \nhere to shame them if I can, if shame is a feeling a big corporation \ncan even have. I am here to see to it that we wake up and that we get \nto work.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/14/senate-section/article/S1837-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Maryland and I \nask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN McCAIN\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I note that today is the 40th anniversary \nof the release of John McCain from a prisoner of war camp in Vietnam. I \nwanted to take a moment in this body to thank Senator McCain for his \nextraordinary service to our Nation.\n  On October 26, 1967, John McCain, then a young man, volunteered to \nserve his country, to put himself in harm's way. He found himself very \ndirectly in harm's way, captured and imprisoned in the infamous Hanoi \nHilton and subject to unspeakable torture and abuse.\n  He did so for our country. He did so for every American. When midway \nthrough his imprisonment he was offered early release, John McCain \nshowed extraordinary courage and valor, turning that down, believing it \ninconsistent with his obligations as an officer.\n  That is the sort of bravery that those of us who have never endured \nimprisonment and torture can only imagine. Yet he continued to remain \nin harrowing circumstances, suffering beatings and abuse that to this \nday limit his mobility. Forty years ago, John McCain was released, able \nto come home to America and return a hero. Since that time, since being \nreleased from Vietnam, he has been a leader on a great many issues. He \nhas been a public servant in this body and he has repeatedly \nexemplified courage and integrity. I thought it only fitting that we as \na body, I have no doubt, would unanimously agree in commending his \nvalor and integrity and sacrifice for his country and recognize this \nvery important milestone, this 40th anniversary.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I want to tell my colleagues and \nanyone watching that just because Senators are not speaking on the \nSenate floor doesn't mean nothing is going on. I am incredibly \nimpressed by the cooperation on both sides of the aisle as we try to \nget a finite list of amendments, as well as the proper sequence of \nthose amendments in order to complete the business of moving to the \ncontinuing resolution. So there is a lot going on in other offices. \nThese are not back rooms; they are not deal cutting. This is the \nworkman-like way a parliamentary democratic institution does business.\n  There are Senators who have ideas to improve the bill. Senator Shelby \nand I think our bill needs no improvement. We think we ought to just \nmove to it, do it, send it to the House, and avoid any kind of gridlock \nof a government shutdown. However, Senators do have the right to offer \namendments, and they have now offered their amendments. People are \nscrutinizing the amendments to make sure they understand the policy \nconsequences and also that we don't have unintended consequences. \nAlthough it looks as though there is no debate going on here on the \nfloor, there is a lot of discussion going on in Member offices. We hope \nthat in a very short time we will be able to move to amendments so we \ncan discuss and dispose of those amendments in a way that satisfies \nboth parties.\n  I just wanted people to know that. When we talk to folks back home, \nthey say: I watch C-SPAN, all I hear is Senators' names called out in \nalphabetical order. They also may know that there might not be an \nofficial hearing going on, though we do know some are going on today. I \njust wanted to talk about some of what is going on and that this is \npart of the process. This is a big bill, and I hope that a big bill--\none that includes every aspect of the Federal\n\n[[Page S1838]]\n\nfunding--is not done this way in fiscal 2014. I want to continue the \ncooperation that has begun between Senator Shelby and myself and the \nmutual leadership. For the funding bills, we wish to move them in a \nregular order.\n  For instance, the two biggest departments are the Department of \nDefense and Labor, Education, Health and Human Services. We want to go \nthrough them and look at what is the appropriate funding level and is \nthere any way we are going to achieve more frugality and more value.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is on the floor, and he is my red-team guy. \nHe often takes a look at the bill and has pointed out some things that \ncause heartburn. This is the way a democracy should work. I want to get \nback to a regular order where we know what we are doing and the \nAmerican public understands what we are doing.\n  We are moving expeditiously. I would dearly love to be able to bring \nthis bill to a closure tonight. I am not sure it is possible. That is \nwhy we are scrutinizing and scrubbing these amendments now. We cannot \nproceed to any other amendments until we see the whole package and look \nat the best way to organize it and sequence it.\n  I wanted to share this with my colleagues who are watching from their \noffices and committee rooms.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I want to compliment the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee. She has done a good job. She does want to get back to \nregular order.\n  As we can see, nothing has happened. There is a reason nothing has \nhappened. It is not in her control. Nothing is happening because there \nare a lot of amendments and they are not sure they want to take votes. \nRather than the regular process of offering amendments that are germane \nand agreeing to a 60-vote level for their passage--having had that \nagreement--now we are not allowed to offer amendments because \nsupposedly somebody has to agree with them.\n  Well, that is not what the Senate is about. The way we decide whether \nthe Senate agrees to it is to offer the amendment, vote on it, and \nstand up and defend your vote. It is not the chairman who is doing \nthis, and it is not Senator Shelby who is doing this, it is the \nleadership. We were criticized because we wanted to read the bill. We \nnow have amendments. We have been waiting to offer amendments. I waited \naround here an hour last night to offer amendments, and then I had \nanother commitment so I could not do it. I offered to come over here at \n9:30 this morning, and could not do it. We have offered one amendment, \nand we have five other amendments. We could not get a vote. If we stay \nin a quorum call, people's business will not get done. People will \nstart to be furloughed in the next 2 weeks, and it is because somebody \nwants to take away the individual right of a Senator to offer an \namendment. We are not postcloture, so even amendments that are not \ngermane are adequate to be filed against this bill.\n  I have no animus at all against the chairman. I am thankful she is \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I trust her implicitly to \nmove on regular order. This bill is out of her committee and we need to \nbring amendments to the floor. The idea that we have to have permission \nfrom somebody in the Senate to offer an amendment goes totally counter \nto what the Senate is all about. We have a lot of problems to solve. We \ncould finish this bill. We are sitting here. I could offer all of my \namendments in 15 minutes, and we could stack them and vote on them--60 \nvotes, I don't care.\n  The fact is we cannot offer an amendment. If I ask to bring up an \namendment right now, the chairman has been instructed to object to \nthat. I understand. I will not make her go through that exercise.\n  I think it is important that the American people know what is going \non. It is not out in the open; it is behind the scenes. They are \nnegotiating away amendments so we won't know what could have happened \nor what might happen. Had we been in regular order, we would have been \nthrough with this bill. We are wasting time trying to play behind-the-\nscenes, nontransparent negotiation about a bill that is vitally \nimportant to this country. The process is not working well. I trust the \nchairman to bring that process back, but she is handicapped by the \ninstructions she has received.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, next week the Senate will for the first \ntime in over 4 years----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The CR is on the floor. Does the Senator wish to speak \nin morning business?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am sorry, I thought we were in morning business.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. How long does the Senator wish to speak?\n  Mr. HATCH. Approximately 15 minutes. Is that too long?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. It could be.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will withdraw.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum so we \ncan discuss how we are going to proceed on the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, next week the Senate will, for the first \ntime in over 4 years, debate a budget resolution on the Senate floor. \nWhile I have many qualms as to the substance of the budget we will be \ndebating, I have to say that in terms of the process, this is a welcome \ndevelopment.\n  The American people have waited too long for the Senate to fulfill \nits basic legal obligation to produce a budget every year. Yesterday, \nwith the release of the Democrats' budget plan, that delay officially \ncame to an end.\n  Of course, now that I have had a chance to look over that budget, my \npraise for it ends there. The budget we will be debating next week is, \nto put it bluntly, a cynical political document. It is not designed to \naddress our Nation's pressing fiscal challenges but, rather, it is to \nprovide a Democratic base and have a fresh supply of political talking \npoints.\n  Rather than addressing our government's problems and runaway \nentitlements, the Democratic budget contains yet more wasteful \nspending. In order to pay for that spending, the budget contains what \ncould be around $1.5 trillion in tax hikes, much of which will \nnecessarily impact the middle class and small businesses. It would \nhijack the bipartisan tax reform efforts currently underway in both the \nHouse and Senate by instructing the Senate Finance Committee to abandon \nthese efforts in order to scour the Tax Code for additional revenues to \nthe tune of nearly $1 trillion.\n  In addition to the reconciliation instructions, the budget includes \npotentially $\\1/2\\ trillion in additional tax hikes in order to replace \nthe sequester and to offset more stimulus spending.\n  Even with all of these new revenues in place, the Democratic budget \ndoes not balance--not at any point. Under this budget, the government \nwould be still be spending more than it takes in at the end of the 10-\nyear budget window. By the end of it all, our national debt would be \nover $24 trillion, an increase of more than $7 trillion, with no relief \nin sight.\n  Gross debt, relative to the size of our economy, never dips below 94 \npercent in this budget. As the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nwarns, when the debt is that high, we as a Nation have less flexibility \nto respond to unexpected challenges. CBO also warns that when the debt \nis that high, there is increased risk of a fiscal crisis and soaring \ninterest rates. Make no mistake: If interest rates rise even slightly \nmore than assumed in this budget, Federal spending on interest payments \nwould increase substantially, moving us even closer to a fiscal crisis.\n  One of the most disappointing and disheartening parts of the budget \nproduced by the majority in the Budget Committee is that it makes no \nattempt whatsoever to address entitlement spending. Instead, it would \nkeep programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and\n\n[[Page S1839]]\n\nSocial Security on autopilot, making it far more difficult to preserve \nthem for future generations.\n  Let's take a look at the numbers, because they are astounding. Over \nthe next 10 years, we will spend $6.8 trillion on Medicare, $5.9 \ntrillion on Medicaid, and $11.2 trillion on Social Security, for a \ncombined total of $24 trillion.\n  The Democratic budget would reduce that spending by only $56 billion \nover 10 years, which amounts to a minuscule 0.2 percent reduction--that \nis right, 0.2 percent. Let's put that number in perspective.\n  Despite the acknowledgment of the administration, the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office, and any sane analyst on the Federal budget \nthat entitlement spending is unsustainable, the Democratic budget \nproposes to do next to nothing about it. Rather, they settle for \nspending reductions over a 10-year period that amount to about 5 days' \nworth of Federal spending.\n  This lack of attention to entitlements sends a clear message to \nyounger generations. That message, unfortunately, is, we don't care \nthat the social safety net will not be there for you. And it won't be \nfor our young people, especially if we keep going this way. Federal \nentitlement spending is the biggest driver of our debts and deficits, \nand absent real structural reforms, these programs threaten to swallow \nup our government and take our economy down with it.\n  This is not rhetoric or supposition. These are cold, hard facts. Yet, \nwith their budget, the Democrats have apparently opted to ignore \nreality and let these programs continue on their current unsustainable \ntrajectory. On that trajectory, the safety net frays. On that \ntrajectory, disabled American workers face benefit cuts of over 20 \npercent in 2016. And on that trajectory, trust funds associated with \nthe safety net become exhausted.\n  The course charted by this budget is simply irresponsible. No one \nserious about governing would choose to ignore entitlement spending for \nanother 10 years. Even President Obama--hardly a picture of bravery \nwhen it comes to taking on entitlements--has proposed as much as $530 \nbillion in Medicare and Social Security reforms. This budget undercuts \nthe President's proposal by nearly 90 percent.\n  So once again this budget is not about dealing with reality; it is \nabout politics, pure and simple. Instead of working with Republicans on \nbipartisan solutions to our Nation's problems, the Democrats have \ndecided to reveal their campaign talking points for next year.\n  There are some of us here in the Senate who have been looking for \nopportunities to work with those on the other side to address what are, \nin the view of many, the defining challenges of our time. For example, \non January 1, I came to the floor to propose five bipartisan solutions \nto reform Medicare and Medicaid and asked my colleagues to work with me \non this effort. These proposals are not my ideal solutions to the \nproblems facing these programs. Instead, they are five solid ideas that \nhave all had bipartisan support in the recent past.\n  For example, I propose raising the Medicare eligibility age--\nsomething President Obama and several other Democrats have at one time \nor another supported. I also suggest limiting Medigap plans from \nproviding first-dollar coverage in order to prevent overutilization of \nMedicare benefits. This was supported by the Simpson-Bowles Commission \nand was also included in the Biden-Cantor fiscal negotiations in 2011.\n  Another one of my proposals is to streamline cost-sharing for \nMedicare Part A and Part B. Like the Medigap proposal, this idea was \nalso supported by the Simpson-Bowles Commission.\n  In addition, I propose introducing competitive bidding into Medicare \nto allow for greater competition in order to reduce costs and improve \nquality of care. While some have deemed this idea controversial, \nPresident Clinton proposed a similar idea in 1999 as part of a major \nset of Medicare reforms--President Clinton, no less.\n  Finally, I propose instituting per capita caps on Federal Medicaid \nspending. This was another Democratic Party idea. It was first proposed \nby President Clinton in 1995, and at that time all 46 Democratic \nSenators signed a letter supporting this very policy.\n  I came to the floor in January in hopes that I could bring some of my \nDemocratic colleagues on board with these proposals so we could at \nleast start a bipartisan conversation on entitlement reform on the \nfloor. My door and my mind remain open to my colleagues across the \naisle on these ideas.\n  Today, as I look at this proposed budget, it is clear I shouldn't be \nlooking to anyone supporting this budget to work on anything resembling \na bipartisan approach. Indeed, if this budget passes as is, without any \nsignificant changes, I may have to look outside of the Senate entirely.\n  That is why earlier today I reached out to President Obama and asked \nhim to seriously consider my five bipartisan entitlement reforms. The \nPresident talks a lot about grand bargains and balanced approaches, and \nhe has a very winning personality, as was evidenced as he spoke to us \nRepublican Senators today. The budget unveiled yesterday, however, is a \nstep in the wrong direction. I hope he will demonstrate real leadership \nand engage in these enormous challenges in a meaningful way.\n  The budget proposed by the Democrats on the Budget Committee is \nfiscally irresponsible and will be detrimental to the current and \nfuture generations of American workers who depend on the social safety \nnet and who want to see it preserved for the future. This budget grows \ngovernment, not the private economy. This budget taxes too much and \nspends too much. This budget doesn't balance today, tomorrow, or ever. \nThis budget keeps us at the edge of a fiscal crisis, with no \nflexibility to respond to future emergencies. That being the case, this \nbudget should be soundly rejected by anyone who cares about our \nNation's future and about prosperity and opportunity for America's \nmiddle class.\n\n\n                                  TANF\n\n  Now I wish to take a few minutes to talk about the Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families, or TANF, Program.\n  Authority for TANF expired at the end of fiscal year 2010. Since that \ntime, the program has limped along on a series of short-term \nextensions. President Obama has never submitted a TANF reauthorization \nto Congress for consideration. Senate Democrats, who have been in the \nmajority since 2007, have never proposed a reauthorization of TANF. \nInstead of submitting a reauthorization proposal that can be considered \nin regular order on a bipartisan basis, the Obama administration \ninstead unilaterally granted themselves the authority to waive critical \nFederal welfare work requirements. As I have said many times here on \nthe Senate floor, there is no provision in the TANF statute granting \nthis administration this authority.\n\n  Aided by Democrats in Congress, the administration has resisted any \nattempt to replace their waiver scheme with an actual legislative \nproposal. Rather than trying to explain what specific policy \nimprovements cannot occur under the flexibility States have under \ncurrent law, the Obama administration and Democrats in Congress have \nopted to issue a series of platitudes about State flexibility.\n  In addition, they point to a letter delivered by the Republican \nGovernors Association to Majority Leader Frist in 2005 asking for more \nflexibility under TANF, ignoring the fact that the main focus of the \nletter was to urge floor consideration of welfare legislation reported \nby the Senate Finance Committee. This is hardly adequate justification \nfor an unprecedented power grab by the executive branch.\n  The Senate Finance Committee needs to act on welfare reform. The TANF \nProgram has languished for nearly a decade without a robust debate on \nreauthorization. Programs that benefit low-income families have \nsuffered as a result of Congress's inattention to TANF.\n  The legislation before us contains yet another short-term extension, \nwhich would ensure that the program will go through the rest of this \nyear without a reauthorization. This is simply unacceptable. The Senate \nFinance Committee, which has jurisdiction over TANF, needs to get to \nwork on a full 5-year TANF reauthorization.\n  Several times over the past few months I have come to the floor to \nargue in favor of regular order and in support of reinstituting the \ncommittee\n\n[[Page S1840]]\n\nprocess. For too long now major policy decisions have been made not in \nthe committees of jurisdiction but in the office of the majority \nleader. As I have said, I think the results speak for themselves.\n  This shouldn't be the case. If we want bipartisan solutions, we need \nto restore the deliberative decisions of the Senate and allow the \ncommittees to do their work. For this reason I prepared a motion to \ncommit H.R. 933 to the Finance Committee in hopes that, once the bill \nwas moved to the committee, we could roll up our sleeves and work on a \nbipartisan basis to strengthen the work requirement in TANF and give \nStates the flexibility they claim they need while providing greater \ntransparency, coordination, and accountability.\n  I understand there is a bipartisan process under way with regard to \nthe continuing resolution, so I won't be seeking a vote on this motion \ntoday. And I wish to personally praise the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland and the distinguished Senator from Alabama for the work they \nhave done on the Appropriations Committee. I am really impressed. I \nthink they have shown the whole Senate that things can get done if we \njust work together, and they are two of our great Senators here in the \nSenate. That doesn't mean I am relenting in my efforts to restore \nregular order here in the Senate. I hope more of my colleagues will \njoin me in this cause.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cowan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the \npending Inhofe amendment, No. 29, as modified, be agreed to; and that \nupon disposition of the Inhofe amendment, Senator Toomey or his \ndesignee be recognized to call up amendment No. 115.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Amendment No. 29, as modified, was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we note the Senator from Pennsylvania is \ncoming to offer his amendment. While we are waiting for him to get \nready to proceed, I would like to thank Senator Inhofe, Senator Boxer, \nand all who worked on a satisfactory resolution of the Inhofe \namendment. It shows if the Senate takes a minute or two, keeps its \npowder dry and sticks to the issues, we can move this bill forward.\n  We now look forward to a discussion on Toomey No. 115. I note the \nSenator from Pennsylvania is on the floor to offer his amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 115 to Amendment No. 26\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 115, which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Toomey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 115 to amendment No. 26.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 83.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Landrieu and \nmyself, I object to the Senator's request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The amendment (No. 115) is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To increase by $60,000,000 the amount appropriated for \n Operation and Maintenance for the Department of Defense for programs, \n   projects, and activities in the continental United States, and to \n                           provide an offset)\n\n       At the end of title VIII of division C, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 8131. (a) Additional Amount for O for Activities in \n     CONUS.--The aggregate amount appropriated by title II of this \n     division for operation and maintenance is hereby increased by \n     $60,000,000, with the amount to be available, as determined \n     by the Secretary of Defense, for operation and maintenance \n     expenses of the Department of Defense in connection with \n     programs, projects, and activities in the continental United \n     States.\n       (b) Offset.--The amount appropriated by title III of this \n     division under the heading ``Procurement, Defense-Wide'' is \n     hereby decreased by $60,000,000, with the amount of the \n     reduction to be allocated to amounts available under that \n     heading for Advanced Drop in Biofuel Production.\n       (c) For the purposes of section, is determined by the \n     Secretary of Defense means a spend-out rate in compliance \n     with the aggregate outlay levels as set forth in the Budget \n     Control Act of 2011.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, before we proceed to debate on the \nToomey amendment, I say to my colleague from Ohio that his strong \nadvocacy for working people is appreciated. From the standpoint of \ndiscussion, the Senator has some excellent ideas, and I hope he and the \nSenator who chairs the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee can talk about how we can reach some type of consensus to \ngenerate jobs, retain the integrity of a professional workforce, and \nkeep our economy going. I salute him for the work he does every day in \nthat area.\n  Mr. BROWN. I would say to Chairwoman Mikulski that the amendment I \nwould have offered along with Senator Isakson would strike the language \non the pilot projects that expire at the end of the year with \nprivatization of customs services. It is something I will work on with \nSenator Landrieu, and I appreciate Senator Mikulski's input on that. It \nis about public services and creating jobs and assisting with imports \nand exports.\n  I thank the chairwoman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, let me just briefly describe my amendment. \nThis will not take very long, but I think it is an important movement \nin the right direction. It has come to my attention that the CR, \nprobably for a variety of reasons, underfunds the DOD's operations and \nmaintenance account relative to what the Army staff certainly has \nrequested--actually to the tune of $2 billion relative to what the Army \nstaff would prefer. This affects salaries, vital maintenance, and \ncombat training. It affects certainly skilled defense contractors, \nemployees, at our military facilities.\n  Obviously, we have very significant maintenance requirements for the \nvery sophisticated equipment on which our troops rely, and so this is a \nvery important account. The operations and maintenance account also \nincludes training exercises that help make sure our forces are the best \nin the world.\n  Unfortunately, at the same time that we are underfunding this \naccount, we are also spending money on alternative energy at DOD that \nis of very dubious value, in my mind. We have much more affordable \nenergy than the kinds of energy we require the DOD to use, in some \ninstances. And what this amendment would do is provide a modest \ntransfer of $60 million from the DOD's account from the Pentagon \nbiofuels program and allow that money to go over to the operations and \nmaintenance account.\n  Now, I know there are some people who are big fans of spending money \nto develop biofuels and build the plants and refineries that create \nthese biofuels. I would point out this is a much more expensive source \nof fuel than alternatives already readily available, and so I would ask \na more basic question: If we believe this is a good and appropriate \nactivity, wouldn't it be better to handle this at the Department of \nEnergy rather than take the precious resources from our Defense \nDepartment and have it spent on the construction of plants for biofuel \ncapability?\n  I think it makes more sense to move this over to the operations and \nmaintenance account, and that is what my amendment does.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Pennsylvania, and at the appropriate moment \nI will offer a budget point of order which will require an \nextraordinary vote on the floor of the Senate, but I first want to \naddress the merits of Senator Toomey's amendment.\n  Senator Toomey's amendment proposes to cut $60 million from the \nAdvanced Drop-In Biofuels Production\n\n[[Page S1841]]\n\nProgram in the procurement defense fund and move these funds to the \noperations and maintenance account. The Senator has, unfortunately, an \nerror in his amendment, and he cuts funding from the wrong account. He \nhas rewritten it several times. Unfortunately, he is still cutting \nfunding from the wrong account. That is an error which he may be able \nto resolve.\n\n  The appropriations account that would be cut by this amendment has \nnothing to do with alternative energy or biofuels. The account provides \nfor funds for Special Operations Command equipment, DOD communications \ninfrastructure, and the Chemical and Biological Defense Program. This \nis a very serious mistake in the creation of this amendment.\n  New language added to this version tries to correct an additional \nproblem with outlays but does not. The amendment still violates the \nbudget cap on outlays and is subject to a point of order, which I will \nmake at a later time.\n  This amendment, which is being offered by the Senator from \nPennsylvania, is opposed not only by me but also by Senator Levin, the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, and of course Senator \nMikulski, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  Let's address the substance of the amendment if it were drafted \nproperly. The Senate has already made it clear it supports biofuels and \nending our Nation's dependence on foreign oil. We look at the challenge \nof foreign oil every time we drive by a gas station and we think to \nourselves: How high can these prices go? They were knocking on the door \nof $5 a gallon in Chicago just a couple weeks ago. They have come down \na little bit, but they are worse in other parts of the country, and we \nthink to ourselves: When is this country going to reach the point where \nwe are not held captive by OPEC nations and other suppliers of oil? \nThat is the frustration we feel. That is the impact we have as \nconsumers in America.\n  Now take this into a theater of war. Now it is a different story. We \ncannot manage and run our professional military without energy and \nfuel. The price we have paid to transfer fuel to the field of battle is \ndramatic, hundreds of dollars a gallon--not $5 a gallon, hundreds of \ndollars a gallon--because, unfortunately, if we are going to keep our \nmen and women safe, we have to fuel the vehicles, the vehicles they \nrely on, whether it is the humvees or the tanks, airplanes or whatever \nthey are using, and we have to move the fuel to where they need it and \nwe have to move it now.\n  Let me also tell you something. Moving that fuel is not without \ndanger. The first National Guard unit I visited in Iraq from my State \nof Illinois was a transport unit. They were driving these tanker \ntrucks. Well, you think, these are soldiers driving trucks? They risked \ntheir lives every time they did it. That is where the roadside bombs \nwere planted.\n  So when we start talking about moving energy to the military, we are \ntalking about a life-and-death challenge. Unfortunately, many Americans \nhave lost their lives moving that fuel to the field of battle.\n  So what do the generals and secretaries in the Pentagon tell us? We \nhave to take a look at our energy consumption and find ways to have \nmore fuel-efficient vehicles for our troops to reduce the need to keep \nmoving this fuel, and we have to find better sources for fuel--fuel \nthat might work better in one theater of battle than in another. That \nis what they have asked for, and that is what the Senator from \nPennsylvania says--no, we can't afford that. We shouldn't do that. We \nought to cut the $60 million involved in this research.\n  The Senate voted twice on Senator Toomey's proposal, and it voted \nboth times in support of the Department of Defense initiative biofuels \nprogram. That was during the debate of the Senate Armed Services \nauthorization bill. But no ideas ever go away in the Senate. This one \nis back again for the third try by Senator Toomey. I hope it reaches \nthe same fate as the other two tries.\n  The conference agreement that was reached after the Department's \nauthorization bill said that the Departments of Energy and Agriculture \nhad to provide matching funds, and due to budget constraints they are \nnot going to go that this year. However, the money that is appropriated \nfor this purpose is going to continue to be able to be spent in other \nyears and the research can continue.\n  Why would we stop this? Why would we say we are not going to do the \nresearch necessary to find more efficient fuels? Why are we going to \ntry to stop the research in more efficient vehicles that keep our \ntroops safe and reduce the likelihood that the men and women in uniform \ntransporting these fuels are risking their lives to do so? Why in the \nworld do we want to subject them to roadside bombs for the transport of \nfuels if we are told by the military they want to look at other \noptions? Why wouldn't we do that? Sadly, the Senator from Pennsylvania \njust thinks we shouldn't do it, and that is why he has offered this \namendment.\n  The funds appropriated for this project are available until expended. \nWhen other agencies are able to meet their own cost shares, they will \ncertainly be used. The chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Carl Levin, agrees with me on this. There is no conflict \nbetween the Defense Appropriations and the Defense Authorization \ncommittees.\n  Keeping the funds in this bill supports the Senate's clear position \non giving to our military the authority they need to protect our troops \nand to lessen their need for using these energy sources. Reducing DOD \nenergy costs and reducing the volatility of gasoline supplies is \ncritical--critical to making sure the best military in the world is the \nsafest military in the world.\n  The Defense Department is the Federal Government's largest energy \nconsumer by far. The events of the Arab Spring and Iran's continued \nthreats to deny access to the Strait of Hormuz demonstrate the security \nrisk of relying on foreign oil sources. That is why this is a critical \ndecision--it is a life-and-death decision--to look to other energy \nsources.\n  The Senator may say we can move $60 million to operations and \nmaintenance. I am sure they need it. But they literally need much more \nthan that. It is better we keep this research moving forward.\n  A 2012 report from the Congressional Research Service noted that \nsince the early 1990s, the cost of buying fuel has increased faster \nthan any other major Department of Defense budget category. That \nincludes health care and military personnel. Between fiscal years 2005 \nand 2011, the Department's petroleum use decreased by 4 percent, but \nthe Department's spending on petroleum rose 381 percent over that same \nperiod of time. Recall that we paid for our wars under the previous \nadministration on a credit card. Part of that credit card charge \nrelated to the cost of fuel--a dramatic cost--which we are still paying \noff.\n  The Department of Defense estimates that every 25-cent increase in \nthe price of a gallon of oil means an additional $1 billion a year in \nfuel costs. The $60 million in this bill for biofuels is such a small \ninvestment of the Navy's annual cost for petroleum-based fuel, \napproximately $4.5 billion in fiscal year 2011, and an even smaller \nfraction of the Navy's total budget of $173 billion. Sixty million \ndollars in research against the Navy's fuel costs of $4.5 billion--\npenny wise and pound foolish with this Toomey amendment.\n  This modest investment is worth the potential of being able to \nprovide a secure alternative to the national security risk of petroleum \ndependence.\n  For the sake of reducing the cost of protecting America, for the sake \nof protecting the lives of men and women who serve our Nation and risk \ntheir lives every day and depend on this energy and fuel, for the sake \nof at least being thoughtful enough to put money into research to find \nways for more fuel efficiency and better sources of fuel, please vote \nno on the Toomey amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I know there are people who are very \npassionately interested in developing any kind of alternative energy. I \nwould just suggest there are research facilities where that is probably \nappropriate. I suppose the Department of Energy might be a candidate. \nBut the kind of biofuels that are generated cost far more than \nconventional fuels. We have a tremendous volume of conventional fuels, \nand it is a savings to be able to use conventional fuels.\n\n[[Page S1842]]\n\n  In this case, my suggestion is that this money goes to where it is \nvitally needed, in the operations and maintenance accounts. But I would \nlike to discuss with the Senator from Illinois the concern he has about \na budget point of order, so I will suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I would like to speak today \non the Toomey amendment, No. 115. I rise to argue against the Toomey \namendment.\n  This is an amendment about energy. As we all know, energy is a \nstrategic resource for us. Every member of our Armed Forces understands \nthis, and they understand it well. Energy is essential to our national \nsecurity mission. Everybody knows you do not go out there and move in \nan aggressive way without good, solid energy supplies behind you. \nHaving access to reliable energy supplies to protect our men and women \nin uniform is absolutely essential. No matter where they may be in the \nworld, it is critical to our Nation that we have these good energy \nsupplies.\n  Each branch of the Armed Forces recognizes the importance of biofuels \nas a critical part of its energy needs. Our military faces numerous \nlogistical challenges with its dependence on fossil fuels. Increasing \ndiversification through investment in alternative fuels will help the \nmilitary carry out its mission safely and without the need to rely \nexclusively on foreign sources of fuel from countries that do not share \nour interests overseas.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Toomey, the Senator from \nPennsylvania, trades some short-term benefits at the cost of our long-\nterm needs. Reducing the Department of Defense's ability to procure \nbiofuels by $60 million is a step in the wrong direction. Biofuels are \nan American industry, growing energy right here in our own backyard--\nenergy at home, made in America.\n  In my own State, the Los Alamos National Lab is growing the next \ngeneration of algae feedstocks for future biofuels. We are doing some \ngreat research in this area of biofuels. We also have a biorefinery \nfacility operated by Sapphire Energy near Columbus, NM. This facility \nis up and running and can produce 1.5 million gallons per year of fuel. \nThat is fuel derived from these advanced-generation algae. This story \nis not unique to New Mexico. Texas, California, Missouri, and Iowa lead \nthe United States in the number of biorefineries per State.\n  This amendment limits opportunities for bioenergy companies across \nthe United States. Biofuels are a significant source of energy for the \nDepartment of Defense. We should provide as many opportunities as \npossible to grow this industry. We should maximize the long-term \neconomic and national security benefits of U.S. biofuels.\n  It is for those reasons that I urge a ``no'' vote on the Toomey \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Toomey amendment.\n  I want to reiterate what my colleague from Illinois said about this \namendment. Senator Durbin chairs the Subcommittee on Defense. He \nrecently took this over with the passing of Senator Dan Inouye. Senator \nDick Durbin has now assumed the Chair. It is a committee we are now \nlooking at funding.\n  I too have met with the Department of Defense--whether it was \nSecretary Hagel, Deputy Secretary Ash Carter. I have talked things over \nwith General Dempsey. When they talk about what are the big-buck \nexpenditures in defense--is it guns? Is it bullets? Is it body armor? \nIs it tanks or planes? The exploding costs are in the area of military \npersonnel. We have to pay our people, so we agree with that. Then there \nis the issue of providing health care. Wow, after a 10-year war where \nwe have asked too much from too few for too long, people are coming \nback with the permanent wounds of war. All are coming back with the \npermanent impact of war. Health care problems are showing up among \nthem. But to my surprise--I was not surprised about that--I was \nsurprised that one of the largest expenditures in DOD is energy. I \nalready knew that DOD is the Federal Government's largest energy \nconsumer and that the Congressional Research Service notes that since \nearly 1990, the cost of buying fuel has increased faster than any other \nDOD budget category. Isn't that a surprise, that it is increasing \nfaster than health care? I actually believed health care would be the \nfastest because of what our troops and their families have endured. But \nit is the fastest growing category.\n  Some numbers. I know a lot of our colleagues are numbers people. \nBetween fiscal years 2005 and 2011, the Department's petroleum use \nactually went down. Their use of petroleum went down by 4 percent. You \nwould think their costs went down. But guess what. Their spending on \npetroleum rose 381 percent in that same period. What an amazing number. \nWhen your use goes down but your cost goes up 381 percent, it is time \nto take a new look and begin to find new ways to deal with this \nchallenge. Our Department of Defense went right to work.\n  DOD tells us that for every 25-cent increase in the price of a gallon \nof oil, the Federal Government and DOD incur over $1 billion in \nadditional fuel costs. Every time a gallon of oil goes up 25 cents, the \nFederal Government ends up spending $1 billion more at only DOD. That \nis $1 billion that could go a long way in either making sure we have \nmodern weapons or for our returning troops--and they are returning--to \nhave the health care they need.\n  We need to modernize the military. Senator McCain has challenged us. \nWe need to make sure we don't hollow out the military.\n  We need to make sure we address the new emerging threats not only in \ngeographic areas but in cyber space. I am on the Select Committee on \nIntelligence. Those cyber threats are eye-popping when you study the \nissue.\n\n  We need to do something about our cost of fuel. The Navy had planned \nto spend close to $200 million on advanced biofuels between fiscal year \n2009 and 2012. The $60 million we are talking about is a small fraction \nof the Navy's annual cost for petroleum-based fuel--approximately $4.5 \nbillion in fiscal year 2011.\n  Secretary of the Navy Mabus has talked about how energy security is a \ngrowing national security issue not only for our country but also \nspecifically for the DOD. What is the answer to that? We have to be \nable to look at funding for the advanced biofuel program. As Senator \nDurbin said, the Senate has already voted twice in support of DOD's \nbiofuels programs. The Department continues to spend money in fiscal \n2012 for biofuels. The fiscal 2013 year will maintain funding to pursue \nthe program in future years.\n  I hope we understand what are the real costs facing the Department of \nDefense. Just because you do not like a program--let's look at these \nprograms in terms of the challenges facing our military. We think the \nchallenge facing our military is terrorism, and it is al-Qaida. Gosh, \nwhen one thinks about those marines up there, as we speak, in the \nmountains of Afghanistan, it just gives you chills. When they are up \nthere fighting for us, they need to have resources. They need to have \nthe weapons, they need to have the armor to protect themselves, but \nthey also need to have the fuel to get around. As Senator Durbin said, \nthey are often incredibly at risk because they are riding over roads \nloaded with these mines. We have come a long way in learning how to \ndeal with IEDs, but the hurt locker continues to exist. We have to do \nsomething to protect our military, protect those in the military who \nsupport the frontline troops. That means they need to have the fuel on \nwhich the DOD will continue to run.\n  We need to look for alternative sources. The policy is a good one. I \nthink the amendment of Senator\n\n[[Page S1843]]\n\nToomey is well intentioned, to fund operations and maintenance, but \noperations and maintenance is really also having the right fuel, which \nmeans we have to develop alternatives to what we have now.\n  I wanted to comment on this. As I have taken over the chair of the \nfull committee, I have learned a lot more about the funding of the \nDepartment of Defense and the challenges they face. The more we \nscrutinize it, some of the really big-buck expenditures that support \nthe troops are not visible in the public eye, but they are visible as \nwe look at our expenditures.\n  We need to support our military, and we need to do it not only in the \nway we are supporting them today, but to have the new technologies for \nthe kind of support they will need in the future.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, that also takes me to the fact that \nthere are these growing issues in the area of health care that we need \nto take a look at. There are a variety of challenges facing the \nDepartment of Defense that we need to look at and address, but let's do \nit through the regular order, through our appropriate authorizing \ncommittee, and through our appropriate Appropriations Committee.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 123 to Amendment No. 115\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment in the nature of a \nsecond-degree to the desk and ask that it be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the clerk will \nreport the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 123 to amendment No. 115.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n       (d) This section shall become effective 1 day after the \n     date of enactment.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. This is a second-degree amendment to the Toomey amendment \nnumbered 115.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I rise today in the midst of a \nprofoundly important conversation on the floor of this body about the \nfuture of our financial situation with the Federal Government, and I \nwant to thank the Senator from Maryland for her extraordinarily \nimpressive work. I thank her on behalf of myself, Connecticut, and the \nNation for her very diligent and dedicated labors to bring us to this \nconclusion, which all of us hope will take place in the next few hours.\n\n\n                               DREAM Act\n\n  I want to deal with a separate issue of equal importance that will be \nenabled on the floor of the Senate if we are able to overcome our \ndifferences on this fiscal issue. The issue I am referring to is \ncomprehensive and accountable immigration reform, which this Nation \ndesperately needs. I am working to achieve it, as I know my colleagues \nare.\n  The President of the United States has advanced that agenda very \ncompellingly in his proposals that include a path to earned citizenship \nfor the 11 million or more undocumented people in this country, \nstronger enforcement at the borders against illegal immigration into \nthis country, and stronger enforcement within our borders against \nillegal employment of undocumented people already here. Of course, we \nalso need a streamlined and fairer immigration process so we can \nprovide a process that comports not only with our due process \nobligations, but also with the fundamental concept of fairness.\n  This is not the first time I have come to the floor to deal with one \narea of immigration reform that ought to be expedited as part of that \nagenda. I am here to talk about Connecticut DREAMers and their \ninvaluable contributions to their communities and DREAMers across the \nUnited States who make those same kind of contributions to our \ncommunities and my colleagues on the Senate floor.\n  Over the last couple of months a tremendous momentum has developed in \nfavor of comprehensive and accountable immigration reform. I am \nthrilled by these developments. They are tremendously heartening, and I \ncommend my colleagues for their profoundly significant work. Most \nimportantly, I look forward to seizing this unique and historic moment \nand the opportunity to reform our broken immigration system.\n  The DREAM Act would give young immigrants who have been brought to \nthis country as children a chance to earn their citizenship through \neducation or military service. The idea about immigration reform is to \nachieve earned citizenship. These young people--or DREAMers, as they \nare often called--are undocumented immigrants who were brought to this \ncountry at a young age, as infants, or young children through no fault \nor choice of their own. America is the only home they have ever known. \nEnglish is the only language many of them know. Their friends are here, \ntheir life is in this country, and they make invaluable contributions \nto this great Nation.\n  I thank one of my colleagues and friend, Senator Durbin, for his \nchampioning this cause over many years, and in fact, he introduced the \nDREAM Act 11 years ago and has tirelessly and relentlessly fought for \nits passage. He has come close to success, and my hope is that \nimmigration reform will include this vitally important measure.\n  The immigrants who would benefit from the DREAM Act identify as \nAmerican. But our immigration system affords them no direct path to \nachieving legal immigration status, let alone citizenship.\n  The DREAM Act would give them a chance to earn legal status if they \nmeet several requirements such as having come to America as children, \nhaving good moral character, having graduated from high school, and \ncompleted 2 years of college or military service.\n  A DREAMer who meets these requirements can apply for legal permanent \nresidency and pursue a path to citizenship.\n  DREAMers who live in our communities but fear deportation have been \ngiven some relief by the President of the United States, in effect, a \ntemporary reprieve. But they still lack the security and permanency, \nand they should be given it, even after the President's program. \nBecause just as they were given that reprieve administratively, they \ncan also lose it in the same way at the end of 2 years, which is the \nlimit currently of the reprieve from deportation they have been \ngranted.\n  Two million immigrants nationwide would benefit from the DREAM Act. \nThere are between 11,000 and 20,000 DREAMers living in Connecticut, and \none of them is Vanessa Bautista. I am going to place her photograph on \nthis stand and say to the people of Connecticut, we should be proud of \nVanessa. I am proud of Vanessa. She was born in Ecuador and came to \nAmerica at the age of 10, raised by her grandmother and reunited with \nher parents here in America. Soon after joining her parents in \nConnecticut, Vanessa learned English and she began school. She had a \ndream to go to college and become a nurse. As a teenager, she worked \ncleaning houses. She babysat. She saved money as much as she could for \ncollege because it was part of her dream of becoming a U.S. citizen and \ngiving back to the greatest Nation in the history of the world.\n  She was accepted to Southern Connecticut State University, having to\n\n[[Page S1844]]\n\npay the entire tuition. During her first year at Southern, she worked \nfull time and went to school full time. She did both full time--had a \njob and sought an education. She doesn't remember having any rest \nduring that year, not surprisingly. She went to school in the morning \nand then worked and babysat every night until midnight. Even with this \nchallenge, she achieved a 3.9 GPA that year. She dreams of graduating \nfrom college and one day working as a registered nurse. She wants to \ngive back, which she will do, and she will give back to the country she \ncalls home. But she understands these dreams will be out of reach \nunless this body, this Congress, this Nation, approves the DREAM Act \nand the rights she is seeking.\n  I say in conclusion, I urge my colleagues to work hard on the issues \nat hand, which are fiscal in nature. They are key to our future in this \ncountry. But equally important to this great Nation of immigrants is \nproviding a path to earned citizenship for young men and women such as \nVanessa, their parents, and the 11 million people in this country who \nnow live in the shadows. Let us enable them to come out of the shadows, \npay fines and pay back taxes, show they have no criminal record, and \notherwise meet the strong criteria we should establish as part of that \npathway to earned citizenship, and truly achieve for Vanessa and the \nDREAMers what is certainly the American dream: Work hard, play by the \nrules, and you will be recognized for what you achieve, what you earn, \nwhat you give back and contribute to the greatest Nation in the history \nof the world.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to \namendment No. 115, the Toomey amendment. This amendment would reduce \nfunding for advanced drop in biofuels production.\n  I strongly oppose this amendment for several reasons. First, this \namendment undermines our long-term national security. The 2010 \nQuadrennial Defense Review outlines several areas where reforms are \nimperative to improving our national security. Implementing reforms to \nstrengthen our energy security was one of these areas.\n  Right now, our military is almost totally dependent on fossil fuels. \nThese resources are finite, priced on a global marketplace, and \nproduced by nations with whom we don't always see eye to eye. There are \nalso new powers rising and new challenges evolving. So to preserve a \n21st century force, we need to invest in 21st century priorities. This \nmeans we must diversify how we power our military.\n  The project this amendment seeks to cut is fairly modest in the \nscheme of the military budget, but the overall benefits to our forces \nwill be well worth it. Our Nation has always invested in technologies \nthat produce long-term benefits and address changing circumstances--\nfrom more advanced tanks and aircraft to faster communications and \nlighter armor. We have to innovate now in order for our military to \nhave the capabilities to protect our Nation. We need to make the same \nkinds of investments now in our military's long-term energy needs.\n  Already the research and deployment of alternative energy is \nbenefiting our long-term capabilities, improving troop safety, and \nmaking security operations more affordable. In fact, just last summer, \nat the Rim of the Pacific Exercise--RIMPAC--the U.S. Navy demonstrated \nits ``Great Green Fleet'' with surface combatants and aircraft using \nadvanced biofuels for the first time. This exercise--the largest \ninternational exercise in the world--proved that our military platforms \ncan use these fuels.\n  Prior to this exercise, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said of the biofuels \ndemonstration:\n\n       The Navy has always led the nation in transforming the way \n     we use energy, not because it is popular, but because it \n     makes us better war fighters.\n\n  Clearly, continuing to support this type of investment will pay \nadditional dividends that will help ensure the United States remains \nthe world's preeminent military and technological power in the 21st \ncentury.\n  However, there is another reason to oppose this amendment and support \nthe military's ongoing efforts to improve its energy security. That \nreason is that it makes good long-run budgetary sense. Fossil fuels are \na finite resource that are priced on a global market. Increasingly, as \nI mentioned, this fuel is produced by nations with whom we don't see \neye to eye. As global competition for fuel resources intensifies, it is \nvital that we reduce the amount necessary to power our military.\n  Not only does our reliance on fossil fuels constrain our assets and \nresources from an operational perspective, it also puts significant \nstrains on already stretched budgets. For example, between fiscal year \n2005 and fiscal year 2011, the Department of Defense spending on \npetroleum rose from $4.5 billion to $17.3 billion. That is a 381-\npercent increase. While that number is shocking, another shocking fact \nis that during this time the Department of Defense was actually using 4 \npercent less petroleum. In other words, we are paying nearly four times \nmore money for less fuel.\n\n  In addition, global price spikes make budgeting for our current \nenergy costs extremely challenging. According to the Navy, every time \noil prices rise by $1, their fuel budget inflates by $30 million. In \nfiscal year 2012, the U.S. Pacific Command, which is based in Hawaii, \nfaced a $200 million shortfall in operation and maintenance funds. This \nis directly related to spiking fuel costs. These unforeseen \ncircumstances reduce our military's capabilities and readiness. It is \nalso unsustainable in today's budget environment.\n  So while the Senator from Pennsylvania argues that biofuels are too \nexpensive now, new technologies are always more expensive at first. \nThat is exactly why we need to invest in scaling up instead of scaling \nback. The first fighter jets off the assembly line are always more \nexpensive than the 100th fighter off that line. The fact is that it is \nthe height of irresponsibility for us to rely on fuel sources with such \nunstable costs.\n  That is why the military is already working to reduce its fossil fuel \nusage and to develop and deploy alternatives wherever possible. At the \nU.S. Pacific Command, investments in renewable energy, energy-efficient \nbuildings, and fuel cell or hybrid vehicles are making installations \nmore cost-effective. In fact, PACOM expects to reduce its reliance on \nfossil fuels for electricity by 80 percent. That would reduce the total \nDOD electricity demand in Hawaii by 34 percent and save the DOD $42 \nmillion per year in electricity costs. This $42 million could be put to \nbetter uses.\n  These are savings that can be replicated on a servicewide scale and \nwill save far more money that could be used to support O than the \nToomey amendment will. The military recognizes this. This is why GEN \nJames Mattis has stated:\n\n       I remain committed to unleash the burden of fuel from our \n     operational and tactical commanders to the greatest extent \n     possible.\n\n  These investments are about improving our national security by \nchanging the way we power our military. Advanced biofuels is an \ninvestment in that goal and one we should continue.\n  As U.S. Marine Corps Gen. John Allen has said:\n\n       Operational energy equates exactly to operational \n     capability. Let's all work this hard, together!\n\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote against the Toomey amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I too rise, as my colleague \nfrom Hawaii just did, to speak in support of the Department of Defense \nand in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from \nPennsylvania. As has been outlined, this amendment would strike funding \nfor a very important and effective Navy program which now works with \nprivate industry along with the Department of Energy and the Department \nof Agriculture to produce alternative fuels. As we work together to \novercome the harm that has been done by sequestration, it is essential \nwe provide the military with the flexibility to\n\n[[Page S1845]]\n\novercome current and future threats. That includes allowing the DOD to \ninvest in energy sources and fuel technologies that reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  Unfortunately, the Toomey amendment does the opposite. So accepting \nit would do real harm to our military. It would cost more money than it \nwould save and it would damage the military's strong and necessary \nefforts to reduce its dependence on foreign oil.\n  In carrying out the work of our Nation, the Department of Defense \nconsumes approximately 330,000 barrels of oil every single day. That \nworks out to be 120 million barrels per year. What does that cost us? \nLast year, the military spent over $16 billion on fuel. Because of \nrising global oil prices, that was about $2.5 billion more than they \nforecasted. Those rising costs--in dollars and in operational \ncapability--are staggering. I think that is the only word that applies.\n  If we think about it, we realize that for every 25-percent increase \nin the price per gallon of oil, the military's fuel costs increase by \n$1 billion. In order to make up for that shortfall, the DOD has to pull \nmoney from operations and maintenance, which means that rising fuel \ncosts result in less training, deferred maintenance, and reduced \noperational capability. That is a terrible triad if there ever was one. \nThat means our troops, then, are also less prepared when they go into \nharm's way. They are less ready to fight when it matters most.\n\n  The Toomey amendment would undercut efforts to end that cycle. It \nwould delay the development of technologies that would clearly bring \nlower costs, more domestic production, and more American jobs. That is \nwhy the DOD is investing in these domestic alternatives to foreign oil.\n  It should tell us something that in an era of reduced Department of \nDefense budgets our senior leaders remain fully committed to this \neffort. Even when we have to tighten our belts, they think this is an \ninvestment that makes sense.\n  What are we doing? We are investing in research and development that \nwill develop new fuels that can be made from biologic feedstocks. These \nare fuels that can be grown and then refined here at home.\n  I want to be clear, these are not programs that are being forced on \nthe DOD through earmarks or by environmentalists or other groups that \nsome like to demonize. These are DOD initiatives, undertaken to protect \nthe military from rising fuel costs and an increasingly volatile \ninternational marketplace.\n  So even under the threat of sequestration, investments in new energy \ntechnologies and alternative fuels remain a priority.\n  I would say to my friends who say we cannot afford to spend money on \nalternative fuels, our uniformed senior leaders tell us we cannot \nafford not to.\n  Think about it another way. We send $300 billion overseas every year \nfor oil. If we could keep about one-twentieth of a percent of that \nmoney at home, we would pay for this program.\n  For about half of what we spend on military bands each year, we could \nbe establishing a domestic energy industry.\n  For about one-sixth of the cost of this year's funding for the MEADS \nmissile system--a system that the DOD has no intention of putting into \noperational use--we could diversify our energy portfolio and drive down \ncosts.\n  We would be taking billions out of the hands of terrorists and \nreducing the risk, at the same time, to our military personnel.\n  The proponents for cutting off these investments in alternative fuels \nwould argue that the Defense Department should not be involved in the \ndevelopment of new energy sources. I could not disagree more. Let me \ntell you why.\n  These biofuels could not be used as leverage against us. The \nrefineries could not be taken over by al-Qaida-backed extremists or \nblockaded by Iranian gunboats.\n  Energy security is national security, and this is exactly the right \nkind of investment that our military should be making.\n  Just think historically: Military research and development has \nsustained the enormous technological advantage we maintain over our \nadversaries. Our willingness to invest in the future has helped keep us \nsafe.\n  It has also been said that the DOD should not be spending money on \nenergy development. If that were the case, we would not have a nuclear-\npowered Navy. Without military investment in emerging technologies, we \nwould not have jet engines, microchips, microwave ovens, radar, or GPS \nnavigation.\n  Ensuring our energy security ought to be a national priority. Our \nreliance on foreign oil is a threat to our security and our economy, \nand I suggest even our very way of life.\n  We need a whole-of-America solution to this national problem, and the \nDepartment of Defense absolutely has a critical role to play in that \neffort.\n  If you believe that the DOD has a vested interest in having reliable \nsources of fuel and energy, then you should agree that they have a role \nto play in ensuring that new fuels meet their needs.\n  As I mentioned, we are all concerned about the effect of \nsequestration on our troops, but we cannot solve our problems with the \nsame kind of shortsighted thinking that got us here in the first place.\n  Killing the Navy's biofuels program--and make no mistake, that is \nexactly what this amendment would do--will cost more money than it \nsaves. It will set back an industry that is poised to provide our \ncountry with enormous and important benefits. And it will make sure--it \nwill ensure--that we keep pouring money into foreign coffers.\n  So I urge my colleagues to continue to support smart investments in \nour future, like the Navy's biofuels initiative. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the Toomey amendment.\n  Mr. President, thank you for your attention.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I am here to speak to an amendment that I \npreviously filed, amendment No. 41.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to help provide the White House with \nthe opportunity to reopen its doors to the American people. It \ncertainly has received a lot of attention, which demonstrates to me--\nand I am sure to my colleagues--how important a visit to the White \nHouse is to so many Americans.\n  In my view, we can be much smarter, and we must be much smarter, with \nour spending decisions and make cuts in ways that do not intentionally \nor unnecessarily inflict hardship or aggravation upon the citizens of \nour country.\n  Canceling White House tours is one of those unnecessary and unfair \nways for the Department of Homeland Security to meet its budget-cutting \nobligations--particularly if the necessary savings can be found \nsomeplace else within their budget.\n  The self-guided White House tours were canceled either by the Secret \nService or the White House--I have not been able to get a clear answer \nto actually who made that decision. But, regardless, they were canceled \nin order to save a minimum of $2.14 million, according to the Secret \nService.\n  This amendment proposes to transfer $2.5 million from TSA to the U.S. \nSecret Service to pay for the security staff necessary for the White \nHouse tours to continue for the remainder of fiscal year 2013.\n  Why go after TSA? In my view, TSA can absorb these costs. Just last \nweek, TSA signed a contract--just last week TSA signed a contract--that \nwould allow it to spend up to $50 million on uniform-related expenses \nover the course of the next 2 years. So last week, TSA spends $50 \nmillion for new uniforms, and now we have no money for tours at the \nWhite House.\n\n  Prior to signing that $50 million uniform contract, the TSA uniform \nallowance for security officers had already doubled last November as \npart of a new TSA collective bargaining agreement to an estimated $9.57 \nmillion annually. This works out to $443 per TSA employee per year. By \ncomparison, officers in the U.S. Armed Forces receive either no uniform \nallowance or a one-time $400 allowance over the lifetime of their \nservice.\n  There is no reason why American taxpayers should spend more on TSA \nuniforms every year than a U.S. Marine Corps lieutenant spends in a \nlifetime. And the same taxpayers who are\n\n[[Page S1846]]\n\nfunding the TSA officers' uniforms are being denied the opportunity to \ntour the White House--the people's house.\n  This amendment has been scored by CBO, which found it would result in \nno net change in budget authority and would result in an estimated \ndecrease in fiscal year 2013 outlays of $1 million. So it is an \namendment that saves money.\n  These White House tour closings are actually falling on the burden of \nMembers of Congress because it is our responsibility to organize the \ntours, get the permission, and we are the ones who are now telling our \nconstituents that tours that were previously approved--we have to call \nand give them the bad news.\n  In fact, today I had a couple of Kansans and their three young boys \non the Capitol steps for a photograph and conversation, and these \nconstituents with their family from Kansas were indicating how sad it \nwas to tell their boys, even though they were here in Washington, DC, \nthey could not see the White House. In fact, they said: We played by \nthe rules. We signed up. We went through the security. For months we \nwere planning to come to Washington, DC, but now that we have arrived, \nthe White House is something that is not available to us and our boys.\n  It is often that we are the ones now providing that news to families \nin Kansas and across the country. My office has received lots of e-\nmails from concerned constituents, including some whose tours are not \neven scheduled until next May or June, sometime in the summer, asking \nwhether we believe the White House will be reopened to them by that \ntime.\n  Between March 9 and March 21--just in that short period of time--we \nhave already canceled 16 previously approved White House tours. \nMultiply that--assuming we are normal or average--by 100 Senate offices \nand 435 House Members, and that is a lot of Americans who had hoped or \nthought they were going to see the White House on their visit to our \nNation's Capitol.\n  I read today that the White House has indicated they are going to try \nto find ways. I think the President said he is going to try to find \nways to get young people, children, into the White House. I certainly \nexpress my desire to see that happen. But I was thinking, if we make \nthat the case, then what happens to the Kansan who is the 91-year-old \nWorld War II veteran who is back here to see the World War II Memorial \nand while here wants to see the White House?\n  Again, the White House should be available to all Americans--in fact, \npeople from around the globe--to see the home of our President.\n  Shaking up our entire tour scheduling process at a time in which the \ntourists are soon coming--or coming now with spring break and cherry \nblossoms--is something, in my view, we can avoid. This amendment would \ntake money that we believe is less wisely spent and reopen the White \nHouse to the American people.\n  So I appreciate the opportunity to explain my amendment and would \nhope we can find a way, in working with the White House and working \nwith the Secret Service, to make sure that noble building at 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue is something that is available for Americans to \nsee, to view, and to be inspired.\n  One of those kids, one of those folks who walks through that White \nHouse, someday might be the President of the United States. And we do \nnot want to do anything that hinders the opportunity for that \ninspiration to occur and for Americans to continue to be proud in their \nExecutive Officer--the President--and to be proud of the system of \ngovernment we have. Let's not lose the inspiration. Let's not deny the \nAmerican taxpayer, the American family the opportunity to see the White \nHouse at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 115\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I chair the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, and in that capacity, I want to take a couple of minutes to \nspeak against the Toomey amendment. That is amendment No. 115 that \nwould slash, in effect, the biofuels program at the Department of \nDefense.\n  Of course, we are going to hear that this will save money, that with \nthe sequester and a very tough set of financial circumstances, which \nthe Presiding Officer knows all too well, the argument will be we \ncannot afford to have this biofuels program in the Department of \nDefense.\n  My argument would be, we cannot afford not to have this program, and \nI am going to take a couple minutes to try to describe why that is the \ncase.\n  Right now, the Department of Defense is the single largest user of \nenergy in our country, with annual fuel expenditures in excess of $16 \nbillion. So you have this massive need for energy at the Pentagon--\nreally a thirst for energy at the Pentagon--and fluctuations in global \nenergy prices have, in effect, enormous effects on defense spending. \nEvery $10 increase in a barrel of oil costs the American military \nannually an extra $1.3 billion.\n  For some time there has been a recognition among military experts--\nand some are in the Presiding Officer's home State of Massachusetts, \nwhere they have spent a lot of time looking at these issues--there has \nbeen a recognition that the military, particularly the Pentagon, is \nexactly the place where we ought to be looking for fresh innovative \napproaches in order to cut energy use and find alternative sources.\n  For the life of me, I cannot figure out how somehow this effort by \nthe Pentagon--let me repeat: by our country's military--has somehow \nbeen conflated into some kind of green plot, some kind of plot by those \nwho are obsessed with green energy and are simply interested in \npromoting programs to satisfy their ideological interests.\n  I can tell you the reason this is being pursued at the Pentagon is \nnot because this is somehow some sort of green plot, some sort of \nsubversive green plot. This is being pursued at the Pentagon because \nthey have made the judgment that these kinds of alternative fuels and \nsupporting them is a vital national security matter. This is not about \nsome kind of ideological green agenda. This is about national security. \nTheir judgment is we need exactly this kind of effort.\n  DOD contracts are particularly crucial because they help promote \nresearch and development efforts. What we have seen repeatedly is a lot \nof the most exciting alternative fuels. The biofuels have enormous \npotential. The challenge is to keep driving down the costs and do it in \na cost-effective kind of way. That is exactly what goes on now at the \nDepartment of Defense as relates to biofuels. It is exactly what would \nbe undermined if the Toomey amendment, amendment No. 115, was passed \nand signed into law.\n  The last point I would make is that Bloomberg, which has a new energy \nfinance unit, a special unit that looks at these issues, their analysts \npredict that some aviation biofuels are going to be cost competitive \nwith standard jet fuel in just a few years. That will happen if we do \nnot undermine current development rates in this area of biofuels at the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  That is why, colleagues, I feel so strongly about opposing the Toomey \namendment on biofuels at the Pentagon. I hope my colleagues will agree.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to \naddress Senator Toomey's amendment, which would remove the provisions \naround biofuels, amendment No. 115. I think it is important to point \nout that this is really more than a budget issue. The Presiding Officer \nunderstands, as he and I worked together to address this when we passed \nthe Defense authorization bill. This is really a national security \nissue.\n  I had the opportunity, as chair of the Water and Power Subcommittee \nin Energy, to go down to Norfolk to have a hearing aboard the USS \nKearsarge to talk about exactly what the Navy--and they are reflective \nof the military--is doing to address energy use. I saw some very \namazing progress in terms of their\n\n[[Page S1847]]\n\nreduction in energy use, their energy efficiency. I saw some of the \nthings they are doing, such as using solar blankets and small, compact \nbatteries out in the field. This allows them to do their mission much \nbetter.\n  They pointed out that our access to energy is complicated by \npolitical unrest and by threats to our supply lines around the globe. \nWe spend billions to protect these fragile supply lines.\n  Oil prices are set on a global market, often driven by speculation \nand rumor. Our military is too often exposed to price shocks. The \nmilitary consumes about 300,000 barrels of oil a day, which is about \n$30 million a day.\n  The Federal Government is the largest consumer of energy in the \nUnited States, with 93 percent consumed by the military. For every \ndollar rise in a barrel of oil, the Navy incurs a cost of $30 million \nat current prices. Last year the Navy incurred a $1.1 billion budget \nshortfall because the cost of a barrel of oil increased by $38. The \ncommander of the Pacific Fleet was forced to cut $200 million from its \nflying and steaming costs because of those cost increases.\n  In fiscal years 2011 and 2012, the Department of Defense came up $5.6 \nbillion short for military operations and maintenance because it needed \nto spend more on fuel than anticipated.\n  As I saw in Norfolk on the Kearsarge, each of our services is making \nreal progress on energy efficiency and moving to alternative fuels. \nThis is not the time to hinder those efforts.\n  The per-gallon cost of test quantities of advanced biofuels under \nNavy contracts has declined more than 90 percent over the past 2 years, \nand it is going to continue to decline. The Navy and the Department of \nDefense have been on the leading edge of innovation and technological \nachievements over the last 200 years. This is another example of \ninnovation and technological advancement.\n  Last year the Chief of Naval Operations, ADM Jonathan Greenert, sent \na letter to my office advocating his strong support for the Navy's \nefforts on biofuels and urging Congress to provide him with the \nflexibility to continue this effort. He states:\n\n       I support the Secretary of the Navy's efforts . . . to \n     accelerate the establishment of a domestic alternative fuels \n     industry through DPA, Title III. This effort will enhance our \n     energy security by diversifying the supply of fuels.\n       Restricting this biofuel effort will ``impede America's \n     energy security.''\n\n  I applaud my colleague Senator Toomey for the efforts he made to look \nat what we are spending in government to attempt to reduce those costs. \nHe and I are working very closely in an attempt to reduce the cost of \nsugar subsidies in this country. This is a situation where, for short-\nterm gain, they would risk the long-term benefit.\n  I would urge my colleagues to oppose the Toomey amendment and ensure \nour military continues to be on the leading edge of energy security for \nthe world.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        In Memory of Andy Athens\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to remember a \nfriend of mine who passed away last night. Andy Athens was a civic \ninstitution in Chicago. He was a brilliant business leader. He was also \n``the Dean'' of the Greek American community--a founder and former \npresident and the cofounder of the National Coordinated Effort of \nHellenes.\n  We are so grateful that when Andy's father left Greece in 1904 he \ncame to Chicago. With his brother Tom, Andy built a business that \nprovided steel to the world and good jobs and dignity for generations \nof Chicago's American families. But Andy's contributions went far \nbeyond Chicago. Growing up, Andy attended school at St. Constantine and \nHelen Greek Orthodox Church in Chicago, where he learned the importance \nof Greek culture and the Greek Orthodox Church.\n  When World War II came, Andy served as a captain in the U.S. Army in \nEurope and Africa and was awarded the Bronze Star. But he brought more \nthan a Bronze Star home from that experience. He stayed on in Belgium \nafter the war ended to run a liberated Ford Motor Company plant that \nwas rebuilding American-made cars and trucks for sale to European \ngovernments. Landing that job was the second best thing that happened \nto him in Belgium. By far, his greatest source of luck was when he met \nhis beautiful wife Louise.\n  Before Andy retired from the steel business, he used to have to carry \ntwo briefcases to keep all his activities straight. In one briefcase \nwere the things he needed for his business. The other briefcase held \nhis blueprints and details for all the extraordinary works of \nphilanthropy and diplomacy by the American Council of Hellenics.\n  During the tragic invasion of Cyprus by Turkey in 1974, Andy founded \nthe United Hellenic American Congress in Chicago to organize the Greek-\nAmerican community and press for peace and justice in Cyprus. He served \nas president or chairman or both over the years, and every Greek-\nAmerican organization wanted Andy to be part of it.\n  In 1995, leaders of organizations representing the 7 million Hellenes \nliving outside of Greece met in Greece to create an organization \nuniting all Greeks around the world. The result was the World Council \nof Hellenes. Who did the new council choose as its first president? The \nDean, Andy Athens.\n  If it is discovered there are Hellenes living on other planets, I am \nsure Andy would have organized them and would have been elected first \npresident of their group as well.\n  Andy Athens was a global ambassador for the shared values on which \nHellenism in America is based: freedom, democracy, human rights, human \ndignity, and service to others. He and the organizations he helped to \nestablish brought hope, opportunity and justice, and the priceless gift \nof health to millions around the world.\n  Last year, I traveled to Eastern Europe and met with leaders in \nseveral nations who not so long ago were part of the Soviet Union. As \nso often happens when I visit other lands, I found myself following in \nAndy's footsteps. I traveled to the Nation of Georgia, where \nHelennicare, the medical philanthropy Andy founded, supports a number \nof health care centers.\n  I visited the Ukraine, home to Hellenicare's visiting nurses' \nprogram. I went to Armenia, where thousands of people each month \nreceive care at a health clinic established by Hellenicare. This was a \nman whose good works are known throughout the world. As our friend \nSenator Mikulski says, ``Andy Athens was a one-man foreign aid \nprogram.''\n  Other than faith and family, no cause was dearer to Andy than the \ncause of freedom and justice for Cyprus. Andy Athens did more than any \nother American to end the division and occupation of Cyprus and to keep \nthe cause of justice for Cyprus on our Nation's agenda. For his \nefforts, he received countless honors, including the Grand Cross of the \nOrder of Merit of the Republic of Cyprus and the Hellenic Republic's \nhighest honor, the Gold Cross of the Order of the Phoenix.\n  Andy was 91 years old when he passed away. Loretta and I want to \noffer our condolences to Andy's wife Louise, their children and \ngrandchildren, and to Andy's legions of friends. Andy Athens was a hero \nnot only of this Nation but of Greece, Cyprus, and so many other \nnations. I am proud to say he was my friend, and I will miss him.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, to my colleague and friend from \nIllinois, through you, I also express my condolences to the Athens \nfamily. Andy was a good friend to me. We had such a warm, cordial, \naffectionate relationship. But he made that easy because of the kind of \nman he was--a real entrepreneur in that immigrant sense, starting with \nvery little and really creating a business. But along the way, he not \nonly built a business, he raised a family and he built a community. And \nI enjoyed so much working with him on the issues.\n  Yes, we did work on Cyprus, the fact that Cyprus is yet to be unified \nand is still occupied in northern Cyprus. But was the Senator from \nIllinois aware of his work in creating health services in Russia and in \nthe Orthodox community there--he was like a one-man NGO in\n\n[[Page S1848]]\n\nwhat he did. Was the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I tried to read some of them, but I couldn't read the \nentire list. And I actually quoted the Senator from Maryland, who once \nreferred to him as a one-man foreign aid program.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am going to put that in neon here this evening, yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. He was an extraordinary man. What a legacy he leaves \naround the world, not just in Chicago and in Washington.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. What did he pass away from?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was told he passed away peacefully in the night. The \nlast time I saw him was in the Capitol Building about a year ago, and \nyou could tell he was struggling a little bit. But it was a day when he \nwas honored and everyone cheered him on and was happy to be there.\n  He was such an extraordinarily good man. And when the Senator and I \nvalue our own heritage and the fact that so many people from different \nparts of the world come here, proud to be American but also proud of \ntheir roots and try to do something for the country they came from or \ntheir family came from--Andy was one of those people.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Absolutely. I am so pleased, if I may comment, that the \nSenator brought this to the attention of the full Senate. I will submit \nmy own statement. We would welcome to know how to get in touch with the \nAthens family. But let me say it to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Maryland. I might also add that \nher former colleague Senator Paul Sarbanes was a dear close friend to \nAndy Athens. Whenever we would have a meeting of the Hellenic group \nhere in the Capitol, you always knew Paul Sarbanes and Andy Athens were \ngoing to be right there in front with the Manatos families and others--\na wonderful group, both in Chicago and here.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, at the end of a long, hard few days, people \nprobably aren't expecting me to say some positive things about \nRepublicans, but I think it is appropriate to do so.\n  First of all, the Speaker sent us this bill in a time where we had an \nopportunity to look at it and work on it. He should be commended, as I \ndo commend him for doing that rather than trying to jam us with \nsomething right before the CR expires.\n  We valiantly tried to make this a better bill, and that has been done \nbecause of the outstanding work of Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby. \nThe product we have is a good product. It funds the government for 6 \nmonths, that is all. But it is good because not only does it fund the \ngovernment for 6 months, it allows us to get back to regular order \nhere, which we have all been talking about doing. Not only is this \nlegislation important but what we are going to do to follow up, to do \nregular appropriations bills, to fund the government for the fiscal \nyear 2014.\n  So we have made progress on this bill. We voted on some important \nmatters. But I have to say that I am disappointed in a number of my \nDemocrats and a number of Republicans because we have to compromise and \nwork together to get this done.\n  As an example, we have five different amendments that have been \noffered on Egypt. This is a CR for 6 months. We have a functioning \nForeign Relations Committee. That is where this should take place. I \nhave spoken with Chairman Menendez. There are people on his committee \nwho are offering various versions of what should happen on Egypt. We \nall have concerns about Egypt, our funding of Egypt, maintaining \nstability in the region, supporting Israel. As I have indicated, we \nhave five Senators who have filed five separate, distinct amendments, \nand, literally, staffs, with Senators, have worked all day coming up \nwith amendments that Democrats and Republicans could agree on. It \nhasn't been done. That doesn't mean it can't be done, but it hasn't \nbeen done.\n  I would again remind Senators that this is a continuing resolution. A \nlong-term solution to the situation in the Middle East is not a short-\nterm CR. Whatever we do on this bill would expire in 6 months anyway. \nThe issue should be brought up in committee and worked on there and \nbrought to us. That is what my Republican friends have said they \nwanted, and that is what my Democratic friends have said they wanted. \nThey want to get back to where we do that kind of work.\n  I thank very much Senators Menendez, Rubio, Leahy, McCain--remember, \ntwo and two: two Democrats and two Republicans. I appreciate the work \nthey have done. But we haven't been able to merge these different \napproaches to get something done.\n  We are behind the scenes around here. Just because you don't see a \nlot of talking going on here doesn't mean there isn't a lot of work \ngoing on. There have been numerous discussions about how to get the \namendments into shape so they can be voted on. We can't even get \nSenators to agree that we should have votes on amendments, unless, ``I \nwant mine.'' ``If he gets his, I want mine.'' So we have had difficulty \non both sides to agree on a path forward.\n  Now, the Speaker has been pretty clear. He has said that unless we \nget a bill that doesn't have a lot of junk in it--I am paraphrasing \nwhat he said to make the point--he is going to strike everything and \nsend us back a straight CR. He said that publicly, not privately. So we \nneed to move forward, cautiously but quickly.\n  Next week we have something on which we have had speeches on both \nsides of the Senate--we need to do a budget. As we speak, the Budget \nCommittee is in session working to get a budget so that we can work on \nit next week.\n  Now, the budget is defined, how we do it. There is a statute that \nsays there are no filibusters. There are certain ways you can slow it \ndown a little bit, but there is 50 hours. That is how much time we have \non it, plus the vote-athon afterward.\n  So yesterday I filed a motion on the pending substitute and the \nunderlying bill. What I would request--and I have spoken to the \nmanagers of this bill--is that they and their staffs make themselves \navailable to Senators and Senators' staff to try to come up with a \nfinite list of amendments--not hundreds but a finite, small list of \namendments that we think would improve this bill and not further \ndevelop the ire of the Speaker, who is kind of in charge of a lot of \nwhat we do around here even though we are on the other side of the \nCapitol than he is.\n  The managers have already agreed to be available and their staffs \nwill be available to work on a finite list of amendments. Staffs need \nto be reasonable, and Senators need to be reasonable.\n  It is doable. We can do this. If we have a finite list of amendments, \nwe will complete work on this matter Monday. If we don't, then there is \nnot much choice we have except to vote on cloture on Monday. One way or \nthe other, we are going to move forward with this bill on Monday. I \nhope the Senate will be able to come to a resolution on this important \nappropriations matter on Monday. We need to do that. I hope this Senate \ncan turn immediately after that to the budget resolution.\n  I can't say enough how much I appreciate the efforts of Senators \nMikulski and Shelby. They have had a very difficult time trying to \nmanage people who at times are unmanageable.\n  So that is it for tonight. Again, we will go out tonight and have \npeople work to try to come up with a list of amendments that will allow \nus to move forward on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know we are going to go out. I thank \nthe majority leader for his kind words. I assure the leader and the \nRepublican leader that the staffs on the Appropriations Committee will \nbe working once again through another weekend to scrutinize these \namendments.\n  We now have 99 amendments pending. In order to properly advise the \nSenate and to ensure that they would get good scrutiny from both a \nbudgetary standpoint and policy, to be able to consult with one \nanother, it requires us working through the weekend. We are ready to do \nit. We worked last weekend. Senator Shelby and I were in frequent \ncontact. We were in frequent contact with our House counterparts, \nCongressman Rogers and Congresswoman Nita, who graciously made \nthemselves available to get their view on their lay of the land. So we \nwill do it again.\n\n[[Page S1849]]\n\n  Every Senator has a right to offer amendments. Every Senator has a \nright to have his or her day. But I would hope they wouldn't do it all \non this amendment or all on this bill.\n  This is the continuing funding resolution. We have worked with such \ndiligence and such a sense of cooperation and bipartisanship. Our goal \nis to get the Federal Government funded through the fiscal year October \n1 to avoid a government shutdown. This isn't a Barbara Mikulski threat. \nWe have a due date on March 27, when it expires. Congress leaves for \nthe Easter-Passover break next Friday, March 22.\n  So I would say to my colleagues, now that we have the amendments, we \nwill do our due diligence, and Senators will know our analysis and \ntheir own respective staff's analysis.\n  So on Monday, once again, on the floor will be Shelby-Mikulski, \nMikulski-Shelby. We will be ready to move amendments. We need our \ncolleagues ready to move on their own amendments and to cooperate with \nus on offering them, debating them, and putting them in the sequence \nthat has the greatest leverage to get the job done.\n  I really can't say enough about the help I have gotten from Senator \nShelby, my vice chairman, the distinguished Senator from Alabama, his \nstaff, and the cooperation we have received from the minority. This is \nnot the usual slamdown party politics. This is a big bill. It is the \nfunding for the government of the United States. There is a lot of \npent-up desire to participate in policymaking. Let's keep it not to \nwhat we would like to do, but let's keep it to what we must do. What we \nwould like to do can come on the budget next week and can come as we \nbring up individual bills, where we can really dive deep into the \nissues and policies and the funding. So let's do what we can.\n  I would hope that on Monday Senators come ready to really wrap it up \nbecause we would have liked to have sent our bill to the House at noon \ntoday. Well, it didn't work out that way. So we are ready to do \nbusiness. We are ready to get the job done. We would love to get this \njob done Monday night, if we could.\n  Mr. President, I again thank everyone. I also thank our staffs on \nboth sides of the aisle who have been working so assiduously for the \nlast several weeks to get this bill ready to present to the Senate on \nthe floor and for what they will continue to do to help us do our jobs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes this evening \nto thank the majority leader, Senator Reid, and also the Republican \nleader, Senator McConnell, for helping us come together, being where we \nare thus far. I also wish to thank Senator Mikulski, the chairperson of \nthe full Committee on Appropriations. We have been working and we have \nmade some progress. We would have liked to have finished this bill \ntonight. There are a lot of amendments--I think 90-something that \nSenator Mikulski said. I hope people will try to work this weekend and \ntry to get through this.\n  We need to pass this bill. This is one of the cleanest appropriations \nbills I have seen since I have been up here. We said no to the \nDemocrats, Senator Mikulski has, and I have said no to the Republicans \non some things. We have a continuing resolution--I call it a hybrid--\nwith five appropriations bills. We can do this. This would take care of \nthe government--in other words, not go from crisis to crisis--until the \nend of this fiscal year, September 30, where we can get on the budget \nand other things.\n  America is watching us. We are trying to respond in a bipartisan way. \nI hope we can make a lot of progress this weekend. Our staffs are going \nto be here working. We are going to be here working. Come Monday, we \nneed to move this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I apologize for \nnot mentioning Senator McConnell. Senator McConnell, when the bill came \nfrom the House, stood up for the prerogatives of the Senate.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. He said they have done subcommittees. We are going to do \nour own. I failed to mention my friend Senator McConnell. I am glad you \ndid. Because we are here today, making as much progress as we have, \nbecause of Senator McConnell standing up for the Senate.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Because of both of them. I thank the Senator.\n Mr. COWAN. Mr. President, Senator Elizabeth Warren, the \ndistinguished Senior Senator from Massachusetts and I are cosponsors of \nthe Murkowski amendment to the Continuing Appropriations bill. This \namendment would provide $150 million in disaster assistance for the \nfishermen and the fishing communities which received a Department of \nCommerce disaster declaration last year. This amendment is offset by an \nacross-the-board cut to the Department of Commerce budget in Fiscal \nYear 2013.\n  While Senator Warren and I are cosponsors of this bipartisan \namendment, we would strongly prefer that this amendment use an \nemergency funding designation instead of the offset included in this \namendment.\n  In recent years, Massachusetts fishermen and fishing communities have \nbeen struggling to survive amid Federal regulations and environmental \nchanges that have limited fishing opportunities. Last year, the \nDepartment of Commerce declared a fishery failure for the Northeast \nmultispecies fishery for the 2013 season.\n  Last year, the Senate included a $150 million fund in the Senate \nHurricane Sandy Supplemental Appropriations bill to assist fisheries \ndisasters, like those in the Northeast using an emergency designation. \nUnfortunately, this provision was not included in the final Hurricane \nSandy Supplemental Appropriations bill due to opposition from \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives.\n  Senator Warren and I will continue to do all that we can to provide \ndisaster assistance funding for Massachusetts fishermen and fishing \ncommunities.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \namendment sponsored by my friend from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, which \nwould provide $150 million in disaster funding for officially declared \nfisheries disasters.\n  The funding for declared fisheries disasters is necessary to address \nthe devastating economic consequences of significant projected \nreductions in the total allowable catch for critical groundfish stocks. \nIn September of last year, the acting Secretary of Commerce, \nrecognizing the economic difficulty fishing communities have faced and \nwill continue to face, declared a federal fisheries disaster for Maine, \nRhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, and Connecticut \nfor the 2013 fishing year. This authority is provided under the \nMagnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act and the \nInterjurisdictional Fisheries Act.\n  Fishing is more than just a profession in New England. Fishing is a \nway of life and a significant part of Maine's heritage. There are 45 \nvessels based in Maine which are actively fishing with Federal \ngroundfish permits. Last year, more than five million pounds of \ngroundfish, with a dockside value approaching $5.8 million, were landed \nin Maine. Despite strict adherence to rigorous management practices by \nfishermen, the projected reductions, which may be as high as 73 \npercent, could devastate groundfishing communities.\n  The requested funding would be used to provide economic relief to the \nregion's struggling groundfish industry and to make targeted \ninvestments which will allow the fleet to survive and become more \nsustainable in the years ahead. These funds could also be used to fully \ncover the costs of at-sea monitoring and to address long-term \novercapacity in the fishing industry. This is critical to rebuilding \nfish stocks and preserving a thriving fishing industry well into the \nfuture.\n  Slow recovery and declining fish stocks continue to have a negative \nimpact on commercial fishing, which harms local communities and \neconomies. This federal disaster assistance is vital to the long-term \nsuccess and short-term survival of fishing communities throughout the \nregion.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n\n[[Page S1850]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/14/senate-section/article/S1850-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I have spoken many times on the floor of \nthe Senate about Antonio Pomerleau of Burlington, VT. As my wife, \nMarcelle, has often said, he is her ``favorite Uncle Tony.'' Given his \nextraordinary service and dedication to the people of our state, it is \nsafe to say that he is every Vermonter's ``favorite Uncle Tony.''\n  Tony has done so much for so many, from his enormously generous \ncontribution to help the survivors of Hurricane Irene, through his \nconstant and generous support of our Vermont National Guard and their \nfamilies, to most recently his large donation to the Community Health \nCenters of Burlington, in memory of his daughter, Anne Marie.\n  Marcelle and I of course knew her cousin Anne Marie, and we warmly \nremember her spirit and her life. Even though health problems nearly \nimmobilized her toward the end, the cheer, love and friendship she \ngave--not only to members of the family but to everyone else--was a \ntreasure in all of our lives. Tony continues to lift Vermonters' \nspirits and make lives better in so many ways. I have an article from \nThe Burlington Free Press that highlights yet another token of Uncle \nTony's generosity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Burlington Free Press, \n                             Mar. 6, 2013]\n\n    Pomerleau Gives to Health Centers--Community Health Centers of \n                    Burlington Receive $200,000 Gift\n\n       ``You people deserve the thanks for the outstanding work \n     you do,'' Burlington businessman Tony Pomerleau told a small \n     crowd Wednesday afternoon at the Riverside Health Center. ``I \n     just come up with the money, that's all.''\n       Applause and cheers greeted Pomerleau's announcement of a \n     $200,000 donation to Community Health Centers of Burlington \n     in memory of his daughter, Anne Marie.\n       ``This is a large gift for us,'' beamed Jack Donnelly, the \n     executive director of the centers.\n       He said the sum would be dedicated to the nonprofit's \n     Homeless Health Care Program.\n       Specifically, Donnelly said, it will fund improvements to \n     the basement at Safe Harbor Health Center at South Winooski \n     Avenue and King Street--one of the Community Health Centers' \n     four facilities in Burlington.\n       Director of Community Relations Alison Calderara summarized \n     the centers' mission: It provides sliding-scale health, \n     dental and human services; and includes low-cost prescription \n     programs, social work support and interpreters for non-\n     English speaking patients.\n       Soon after Wednesday's fanfare subsided, it segued into \n     mid-day sandwiches.\n       The philanthropist made himself comfortable in an armchair \n     and indulged in a little storytelling.\n       It turns out that Pomerleau has good reason to be grateful \n     for easy access to health care: When he was 2 or 3 years old \n     he tumbled into the basement of his family's summer kitchen.\n       ``I wore a cast iron brace for four years,'' he said.\n       His parents regularly took the boy 50 miles north by train \n     to Sherbrooke, Quebec, for treatment.\n       For Pomerleau, who is in his mid-90s now, the half-dozen \n     years after the accident remain a blank.\n       ``The lights came on when I was seven or eight,'' he said. \n     ``The doctors told my parents I might reach 10, but I'd never \n     reach 12.''\n       ``I'd been awake, of course,'' Pomerleau continued. ``I'd \n     learned English in school; I'd grown--but I don't remember \n     anything.\n       ``Now, people say I remember too much,'' he said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/14/senate-section/article/S1850-3", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1850-S1851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SEQUESTER MITIGATION\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the \nbipartisan UdallCollins flexibility plan, which is designed to help \nmitigate the damaging effects of the automatic spending cuts our \ncountry now faces, commonly called the sequester. If left unchanged, \nthese indiscriminate sequester cuts will undermine services that \nhardworking families rely on and harm our economic growth during this \nfragile recovery.\n  So what is the sequester and how did our politics deteriorate so \nbadly that we are left to watch as this self-inflicted wound is leveled \non our country? It boils down to two problems that both Democrats and \nRepublicans readily acknowledge deserve our attention: our national \ndeficit and debt. In some ways it is just as the President has \ndescribed it: a matter of pure math. The Federal Government is spending \nmore than it is taking in and that picture is not projected to change \nin the long run--in fact, it is projected to get worse.\n  And this has been a long time coming. In 2010, I was part of a core \ngroup of Senators who urged the White House to establish a bipartisan \nfiscal commission that would help us address our debt and deficit. The \nadministration heard our call and established a debt and deficit panel \nto recommend a balanced and comprehensive way to get our fiscal house \nin order. Their plan, as you know Mr. President, is now commonly \nreferred to as the Simpson-Bowles plan. Former Republican Wyoming \nSenator Al Simpson and Former Clinton Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles led \nthe effort and both Democrats and Republicans here in the Senate \nembraced the framework that pushed for spending cuts, raising revenue \nand responsibly reforming our entitlements. With bipartisan support for \nsuch a balanced plan, it should have been an open-and-shut case, which \nis why I endorsed the idea and repeatedly encouraged my colleagues to \nbring it to the floor for a vote.\n  The problem is that it doesn't just take some bipartisanship to get \nanything done around here; it takes a lot of bipartisanship--60 votes \nin the Senate and 218 votes in the House of Representatives. Ideologues \non both sides of the aisle and in both chambers have since dug in their \nheels, totally unwilling to set aside differences to reach a \ncompromise.\n  So that brings us back to the sequester. Because Congress cannot \nagree on a balanced and bipartisan plan to reduce the deficit, we are \nleft with these automatic and blunt across-the-board cuts.\n  There is no doubt that we must reduce the deficit, which is why I \nhave been saying for months that we ought to bring forward the Simpson-\nBowles plan and find a way to achieve deficit reduction in a more \nthoughtful and strategic way. That approach would include additional \nrevenue and shoring up our entitlements. In theory, many of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle agree with this approach. But at \nthe end of the day, there just aren't enough of them with the courage \nto support a balanced, deficit-reduction plan. We owe it to the \nAmerican people to be honest. Let's just acknowledge that we have \nreached an impasse.\n  And until there are enough Members willing to make the difficult \ndecisions we are left with these terrible and indiscriminate cuts to \nour Government. Let's get it straight: the sequester is not a solution. \nIt is neither smart, nor strategic--it wasn't designed to be. I firmly \nbelieve that the sequester will leave our Government frayed and our \neconomy weakened.\n  The sheer magnitude of the sequester cuts will not only damage our \neconomy, but will also put our national security at a level of risk \nthat could have been avoided had Congress exercised the courage to pass \na bipartisan and balanced plan. We can do better, and the Udall-Collins \nplans suggests that there are more reasonable ways to find these \nsavings than implementing blunt, thoughtless cuts.\n  Our plan says, ``Wait a minute, if we really have to live with these \nterrible cuts, shouldn't we at least be strategic about how and where \nwe make them?''\n  The proposal that Senator Collins and I have put forward is not about \nproviding flexibility to choose between cutting children's education \nfunding in New York City versus Kansas City. Our plan simply provides \nthe administration and Congress with the flexibility to look at where \nour Government's highest-value investments are so we can continue to \ninvest in them, while cutting back in areas that do not provide \nmission-critical value for Americans.\n  While there are still difficult decisions to make and tough choices \nto confront, the best way forward is through a collaborative process \nbetween the administration and Congress--as the Udall-Collins plan \nwould provide.\n  Last week, the Senate voted down a politically motivated flexibility \nproposal. Senator Collins and I are not\n\n[[Page S1851]]\n\ninterested in proposing a partisan plan. Instead, we offer a plan that \nis both reasonable and feasible because it calls for strategic \ndecision-making that allows for the least disruption possible for our \nconstituents as the executive branch implements $85 billion in spending \ncuts over the next 7 months.\n  Further underscoring the need for a comprehensive flexibility plan, \nseveral members of Congress introduced this week amendments to a \nfunding bill called a continuing resolution that propose flexibility in \nimplementing sequestration for individual agencies or departments that \nwere immediately hit by the effects of the automatic budget cuts. These \namendments are mainly focused on providing flexibility for particular \nagencies, while the bipartisan Udall-Collins approach proactively \nprovides for strategic decision-making and flexibility across all \nagencies in our Government.\n  Coloradans know we are all in this together. When the pioneers had a \nwagon train breakdown, they didn't quibble about who was to blame. They \nfixed the wheel. When bad weather rolled in while crossing the divide, \nthey didn't argue about who put them in harm's way--they came together \nand supported each other in order to survive.\n  In that vein, we ought to continue working on a Simpson-Bowles \ninspired plan that raises revenue by closing tax loopholes and asks the \nwell-off to do a little more, reforms our entitlements to shore them up \nover the long term, and finds areas of our budget where we can pare \nback Government spending. If we can finally agree on a balanced \nsolution like this, we would--in effect--fix the wagon wheel and get us \nthrough the storm so that we can move on to the other serious \nchallenges confronting our country, like energy and immigration reform, \nfighting terrorists and building an economy that is set to lead the \nglobal economic race.\n  At this point, we are left with very few workable options. The \nsequester will be damaging no matter what, but let's work together to \nensure its impact is not unnecessarily debilitating to our Government, \nour national security, and our economy. Most importantly, let's not do \nunnecessary harm to hardworking, middle-class families across this \nNation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Collins and me in supporting our \namendment to give Congress and the White House the authority to more \nstrategically implement the sequestration cuts. By working together, we \ncan make the best out of a bad situation and agree on a wholesale, \nbalanced and bipartisan plan to address our fiscal imbalances.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/14/senate-section/article/S1851-1", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WHITE CLAY CREEK WILD AND SCENIC RIVER EXPANSION ACT\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, today the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee voted to endorse a bill I introduced that would add \napproximately 9 miles of White Clay Creek and its tributaries to the \nexisting Wild and Scenic Rivers designation for the waterway. The White \nClay Creek Wild and Scenic River Expansion Act of 2013 (S.393) now \nawaits consideration by the full Senate, which passed this legislation \nwith bipartisan support during the 112th Congress.\n  Growing up, I spent considerable time in the White Clay Creek \nwatershed and know that it is an important resource for Delaware and \nthe region. Years ago, my grandmother donated some of her land along \nthe banks of White Clay Creek to help protect it. It is up to all of us \nto fight to protect our natural resources. I look forward to continuing \nto work with my colleagues to get this legislation passed by the full \nSenate.\n  The legislation, which comes at no cost to taxpayers, would expand \nthe original Wild and Scenic Rivers designation to include two small \nstream sections that were omitted from the original designation, \nincluding a 1.6-mile stretch of Lamborn Run in Delaware that was \noriginally omitted due to its consideration as an option for a dam to \nsupply drinking water for northern Delaware. It has since been removed \nfrom consideration and New Castle County is supportive of the \ndesignation.\n  The bill also includes a 7.4-mile stretch of stream in Pennsylvania's \nNew Garden Township that was originally omitted due to its \nconsideration for a dam. That consideration has since been withdrawn \nand the township is now supportive of the designation.\n  In February, Representative Joseph Pitts (R-Pa.) and I reintroduced \nthe White Clay Creek Wild and Scenic River Expansion Act in our \nrespective chambers. Senator Tom Carper, as well as Rep. John Carney \nare cosponsors.\n  In 2000, Congress designated a large majority of White Clay Creek and \nits tributaries as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. \nThen-Senator Joe Biden was the lead sponsor for the Senate bill and \nRepresentative Mike Castle was the lead sponsor for the House version. \nThis marked the first time a whole watershed, rather than individual \nriver segments, had been designated into the system. The proposal to \nexpand the designation was led by former Senator Ted Kaufman in the \nSenate and Representative Pitts in the House.\n  The 69,000-acre White Clay Creek watershed is home to 33 species of \nmammals, 21 species of fish, 27 species of reptiles and amphibians, and \nover 90 species of birds. White Clay Creek is also stocked with brown \nand rainbow trout, and is an important resource for fishermen. \nProtected land in the watershed also provides recreational \nopportunities for hikers, bikers, birders, hunters, and others. White \nClay Creek and the Cockeysville aquifer that lies beneath portions of \nthe watershed are important sources of drinking water for over 128,000 \ncitizens in Pennsylvania and Delaware.\n  The bill is supported by the White Clay Creek Watershed Management \nCommittee, which is comprised of 40 local, State, and Federal agency \nrepresentatives, as well as organizations and businesses. Among its \nmembers are the National Park Service, Delaware Department of Natural \nResources and Environmental Control, New Castle County Department of \nLand Use, London Britain Township, United Water Delaware, White Clay \nOutfitters, the Brandywine Conservancy, the Delaware Ornithological \nSociety, Stroud Water Research Center, Chester County Planning \nDivision, and SE Regional Office Pennsylvania Department of \nConservation & Natural Resources.\n  The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources also voted to \npass the First State National Historical Park Act (S. 347), a bill \nauthored by Senator Carper, of which I am an original cosponsor. I was \nproud to lead my colleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee in voting to bring Delaware one step closer to its first \nnational park. For more than a decade, Senator Carper has worked \ntirelessly to bring a national park to our State. A national park will \npreserve and celebrate our State's vibrant history while boosting \nDelaware's economy and creating jobs. Senator Carper and I will \ncontinue to work together toward passage in the full Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/03/14/senate-section/article/S1851-2", "month": "03", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NANCY LEE BASS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, I am proud to honor on the floor \nof the Senate, Mr. Preston ``Pres'' Henne, for his\n\n[[Page S1852]]\n\n44-year career in the aerospace industry as he prepares for his \nretirement from Gulfstream Aerospace on March 31, 2013, as senior vice \npresident for Programs, Engineering and Test.\n  During Pres' 19 years with Gulfstream, he was responsible for leading \nthe teams that designed, developed, tested and certified the Gulfstream \nV and G550 aircraft. This earned him the Robert J. Collier trophies \nfrom the National Aeronautics Association in 1997 and 2003, \nrespectively, which are awarded annually for the greatest achievement \nin aeronautics and astronautics in North America.\n  Under Pres' direction, Gulfstream developed and certified six new \naircraft, the G650, G550, GV, G450, G280 and G150. In conjunction with \nthese new products, Pres was also responsible for launching a number of \nindustry-leading product enhancements, including the Gulfstream \nEnhanced Vision System and Synthetic Vision-Primary Flight Display.\n  Most recently, Pres oversaw the development of the company's much-\nanticipated G650, one of the world's most sophisticated business-jet \naircraft. The G650, which entered service in 2012, was designed with \ntechnological advances such as a digital fly-by-wire system, triplex \nflight management systems, auto emergency descent and enhanced and \nsynthetic vision systems. Pres also supervised the design and \ndevelopment of the G280, an aircraft that has been noted for its best-\nin-class performance, cabin comfort and technology.\n  From my conversations with Gulfstream officials and my knowledge of \nPres' tremendous accomplishments, I know that the loss will be great. \nHowever, with the team Pres has led and his strong vision, I have no \ndoubt the future of Gulfstream is as bright as Pres' own future beyond \nGulfstream.

INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Barrasso, and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 562. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the coverage of marriage and family therapist services and \nmental health counselor services under part B of the Medicare program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleague from \nWyoming, Senator John Barrasso, in introducing a bill essential to \nenhancing the delivery of mental health services to our senior \ncitizens, The Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act.\n  Currently, there are limitations on the types of mental health \npractitioners who may be reimbursed for services in the Medicare \nprogram. Our legislation permits mental health counselors and marriage \nand family therapists to bill Medicare for their services, and it pays \nthem at the rate of clinical social workers. With this legislation, \nseniors will have more opportunities as part of their Medicare benefit \nto access professional mental health counseling assistance.\n  Throughout the United States there are approximately 77 million older \nadults living in 3,000 so-called ``mental health profession shortage \nareas.'' Moreover, 50 percent of rural counties have no practicing \npsychiatrists or psychologists. Seniors living in these areas will be \nthe primary beneficiaries of our efforts.\n  Mental health counselors and marriage and family therapists are often \nthe only mental health providers in some communities, and yet presently \nthey are not recognized as covered providers within the Medicare \nprogram. These therapists have equivalent or greater training, \neducation and practice rights as some existing provider groups that can \nbill for their services through Medicare.\n  Additionally, other government agencies, including The National \nHealth Service Corps, the Veteran's Administration and TRICARE, already \nrecognize these mental health professionals and reimburse for their \nservices. We need to utilize the skills of these providers and ensure \nthat seniors have access to them. These professionals play a critical \nrole in the delivery of our Nation's mental health care.\n  In Oregon, the passage of this legislation will focus the talents of \nover 2,000 additional qualified providers on the mental health issues \nof one of our most vulnerable populations. This represents a \ncommonsense approach to relieving a persistent and chronic healthcare \nworkforce shortage.\n  Finally, I commend our mental health professionals nationwide, for \ntheir dedicated work and efforts, and I encourage passage of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 562\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to remove the authority \nof the Federal Energy Commission to collect land use fees for land that \nhas been sold, exchanged, or otherwise transferred from Federal \nownership but that is subject to a power site reservation; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we often hear refrains of the need to \nmake government policies more fair, clear, or simple--especially when \nthese policies involve the collection of fees or taxes. Today I rise to \nintroduce legislation to fix an inherently unfair policy by prohibiting \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from charging land-use fees \nfor hydropower projects that are no longer located on Federal land.\n  FERC is responsible for licensing private, municipal and state \nhydropower projects. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, the Commission \nis authorized to collect fees from project owners for those hydro \nprojects located on Federal lands. The rationale behind these land-use \nfees is to recompense the United States for the ``use, occupancy, or \nenjoyment'' of its Federal lands. The Federal Government is, in some \nsense, a landlord for these types of projects, and can collect just and \nreasonable rent from its tenants. The current level of these rents is a \nseparate issue but today I am focused on how a technicality in Federal \nlaw allows the government to continue to collect land-use fees even \nwhen the land at issue has been transferred out of Federal ownership. \nUnder current law, if the Federal Government sold the land underneath a \nhydropower project to the operator, or transferred it into state \nownership, FERC can continue to assess full land use fees against the \noperator. This untenable situation is like a landlord continuing to \ncollect rent from a tenant even after the tenant buys the house \noutright.\n  While the inherent unfairness of such a scenario is clear, the \nstatutory and regulatory web that has created this snare is extremely \ncomplex. In addition to allowing for the collection of Federal land-use \nfees, the Federal Power Act also contains a section regarding Power \nSite Classifications, or PSCs. A PSC attaches to the land when a \npreliminary hydropower license application is made, and entitles the \ngovernment, or its designees, to enter the associated land and develop \na hydropower project if some other person or operation is occupying it. \nThese classifications are similar to easements, in that they \npermanently attach to the title of the lands. The purpose of PSCs is to \nmake sure that hydropower can be developed in the limited number of \nareas on Federal land that are suitable, and furthermore that once such \nan area is identified by a preliminary application, that the site is \nnot then diverted to an alternate use.\n  However, FERC has interpreted the statutory fee collection provisions \nto give these PSCs another affect that is not in keeping with this \npurpose--to charge land-use fees from existing hydropower operators in \ncases where the Federal Government no longer owns the land. In such a \ncase, there is no need for a PSC to preserve the hydropower value of \nland as it is already being used for power production. Nor is the \nFederal Government somehow missing out on other beneficial uses of the \nland, because it no longer owns the land at issue.\n  When I first learned of this issue, I asked FERC for a list of the \nhydropower projects for which it was collecting these PSC-based Federal \nland-use fees. I also asked the Department of the Interior, which \nmaintains our Federal lands, for assistance. Unfortunately it appears \nthat the government has not been diligent in keeping track of which \nprojects are located on lands that have since been transferred away \nfrom Federal ownership as neither agency was able to produce a list of \nimpacted projects.\n  Consequently, my staff attempted to survey the number of affected \nprojects by consulting with both the National Hydropower Association \nand the Alaska Power Association. This search identified 15 possible \nprojects subject to these PSC land use fee collections--11 of which are \nlocated in my home State of Alaska. While some may dismiss these fees \nas being relatively minor, I can tell you that these annual Federal \nfees for land not even owned by the Federal Government can represent a \nsignificant hardship for my constituents.\n  The bill I am introducing today would put a halt to this kind of fee \ncollection. It simply says that when FERC is making fee determinations, \nit cannot take PSCs into account. Therefore, the only land that the \nFederal Government will be able to collect ``use, occupancy, and \nenjoyment'' fees for is land that it actually owns. I hope all of my \ncolleagues can agree this treatment is a fair resolution of the issue \nand I ask for their support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 565. A bill to provide for the safe and reliable navigation of the \nMississippi River, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss two bills I am \nintroducing--one to maintain navigation on the Mississippi River during \nextreme weather and the second, to improve the Nation's water \ninfrastructure, including locks and dams on the Mississippi and \nIllinois Rivers.\n  For many of us, last year's low water event on the Mississippi River \nis still fresh in our minds. We came close to economic catastrophe when \nongoing drought conditions in the Midwest led to the lowest water \nlevels seen on the Mississippi River since World War II and threatened \nto disrupt the movement of billions of dollars in goods on the river. \nAt the height of the crisis at the end of 2012, Waterways Council and \nthe American Waterways Operators estimated that up to $7 billion in \ngoods could be effected by a river closure from December to January.\n  The worst conditions for navigation were near Thebes, IL, in a \nstretch of river referred to as the Middle Mississippi. It begins at \nthe confluence of the Missouri River and ends at Cairo, IL where the \nOhio and Mississippi Rivers merge. The natural bends and twists of the \nriver here combined with naturally occurring rock formations on the \nriver bed make this stretch particularly difficult to navigate during \nperiods of extreme low water. To pass, barges were forced to carry \nlighter loads than normal, reducing efficiency and costing them money.\n  Only through better than expected rainfall, Congress pushing the Army \nCorps to expedite removal of rock pinnacles at Thebes, and some \ncreative reservoir management was the river able to stay open and the \nworst case scenarios able to be avoided this time. For the Corps' part, \nit was an amazing fete and they should be commended for their \nsuccessful efforts.\n  But we know from Hurricane Katrina to Sandy, from severe flooding on \nthe Mississippi River in 2011 to the historic low water in 2012, \nextreme weather seems to be the new normal--becoming more frequent and \nmore severe.\n  The Mississippi River Navigation Sustainment Act seeks to make \ngovernment and commercial navigation users better prepared for the next \nextreme weather event that threatens navigation. I am pleased that \nRepresentatives Bill Enyart and Rodney Davis are introducing companion \nlegislation in the House.\n  The bill authorizes the Corps to conduct a study to better coordinate \nmanagement of the entire Mississippi River Basin during periods of \nextreme weather. This will ensure that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \ntakes into account the effect the entire basin has on navigation and \nflood control efforts on the Mississippi River.\n  The Mississippi River Basin is the third largest watershed in the \nworld and covers more than 40 percent of the contiguous United States. \nIt doesn't take a PhD in hydrology to know that what happens on other \nsystems in the\n\n[[Page S1857]]\n\nwatershed affects the Mississippi River and activities on it.\n  This bill will also improve river forecasting capabilities through \nthe increased use of tools like sedimentation ranges and the deployment \nof additional automated river gages on he Mississippi and its \ntributaries. During the latest low water event, many of the manual \ngages--sometimes literally lines painted on bridges--became unusable \nbecause the water was so low. lmproving the ability to accurately \nforecast and provide information on current river conditions will help \nbarge operators and shippers who have to make long term business \ndecisions based on this information. Operators leaving Minnesota need \nto know that when they get to Thebes, river conditions will allow them \nto pass.\n  The bill will also provide flexibility to the Army Corps to conduct \ncertain operations outside of the authorized channel if such action is \ndeemed necessary to maintaining commercial navigation. This authority \nwould be used to maintain access to loading docks and other critical \ninfrastructure during periods of low water. In addition, it will allow \nthe Corps to better assist the Coast Guard in managing traffic on the \nriver during low water events by providing areas for barge operators to \nmoor their vessels farther away from the navigation channel, leading to \nincreased safety and greater ability to keep the navigation channel \nclear.\n  Finally, recognizing that the Mississippi River is a vital natural \nresource, this bill will create an environmental pilot program in the \nMiddle Mississippi River. This will give the Army Corps the authority \nto restore and protect fish and wildlife habitat in this portion of the \nriver while conducting activities to maintain navigation.\n  Also key to maintaining navigation and commerce on the Mississippi \nand other inland waterways, is continued investment in water \ninfrastructure.\n  For example, the locks and dams on the upper Mississippi River and \nIllinois Rivers, built in the 30's and 40's, are aging, making the risk \nof failure an ever increasing prospect. In addition, the lock chambers \nare too small to accommodate today's standard barge configuration \nhelping lead to an average delay of more than 4 hours for passing \nvessels.\n  That is why I worked with my colleagues in Missouri and Iowa in the \n2007 Water Resources and Development Act to authorize the Navigation \nand Ecosystem Sustainability Program which would expand and modernize \nthese locks while restoring the ecosystem on the Upper Mississippi.\n  Modernizing these locks means safer, more reliable, and drastically \nmore efficient navigation. Operators and shippers alike would benefit--\nbarge companies could maximize efficiency while Illinois farmers and \nothers could reliably get their products to market.\n  Unfortunately, under current project delivery processes and Federal \nfiscal realities, the first benefits of this modernization are not \nexpected to be felt by the navigation industry before 2047. And that \nwas before sequestration. Between sequestration and the continuing \nresolution being debates on the Senate floor now, the Corps' \nconstruction budget for fiscal year 13 would be cut by approximately \n$80 million. Even before all of that, the Corps estimated a project \nbacklog of approximately $60 billion.\n  It is clear we need a new model--one that speeds up the process of \nplanning and constructing these projects in the face of an often slow \nbureaucratic process and brings to the table greater private investment \nwhile the Federal Government is cutting back.\n  That is what Senator Kirk and I are proposing with the Water \nInfrastructure Now Public-Private Partnership Act. I am proud that \nRepresentatives Bustos and Davis have introduced companion legislation \nin the House.\n  The bill will create a pilot program to allow the Army Corps of \nEngineers to enter into agreements with non-federal partners using new \nand creative models to finance and construct up to 15 previously-\nauthorized flood damage reduction, hurricane and storm damage \nreduction, and navigation projects.\n  I am hopeful that this program will provide a way to maintain our \ninvestments in important water infrastructure projects even as we face \nsevere fiscal restraints by creating a greater opportunity for private \ninterests to come to the table.\n  At the same time, the bill would take care to protect previous \ntaxpayer investments by prohibiting any privatization of Federal assets \nand requiring a study to show that any proposed agreement would \nactually provide a public benefit.\n  For many of these long-stalled, large scale infrastructure projects, \nlike the Locks and Dams on the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers, this \ncommon sense bill could provide a way forward.\n  Together, the Mississippi River Navigation Sustainment Act and the \nWater Infrastructure Now Public-Private Partnership Act, represent \npositive steps forward in the effort to maintain the economic viability \nof the Mississippi River and protect our inland waterway system against \nthreats from extreme weather and aging infrastructure. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in cosponsoring these common sense measures.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bills was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 565\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary to \n     carry out this Act such sums as are necessary.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KIRK (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 571. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nestablish a deadline for restricting sewage dumping into the Great \nLakes and to fund programs and activities for improving wastewater \ndischarges into the Great Lakes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, today I rise to join with Senator Durbin to \nintroduce the Great Lakes Water Protection Act. This bipartisan \nlegislation would set a date certain to end sewage dumping in the Great \nLakes, America's largest source of surface fresh water. The Great Lakes \nare home to more than 3,500 species of plants and animals and are the \nsource of drinking water for more than 30 million Americans. It is time \nthat we put a stop to the poisoning of our water supply. Cities along \nthe Great Lakes must become environmental stewards of our country's \nmost precious freshwater ecosystem and take action to reverse the trend \nof discharging sewage into the Great Lakes.\n  The Great Lakes Water Protection Act gives cities until 2033 to build \nthe necessary infrastructure to prevent sewage dumping in the Great \nLakes. Those who violate the EPA's sewage dumping regulations after \nthis deadline will be subject to fines up to $100,000 for every day \nthey are in violation. These fines would be directed into a Great Lakes \nClean-Up Fund within the Clean Water State Revolving Fund to be used \nfor wastewater treatment options, with a special focus on greener \nsolutions such as habitat protection and wetland restoration.\n  Many cities along the Great Lakes Basin lack the critical \ninfrastructure needed to divert sewage overflows during times of heavy \nrainfall. Some reports estimate that as much as 24 billion gallons of \ncombined sewage and storm water runoff are dumped into the Great Lakes \nevery year. Loaded with a mix of bacteria and other pathogens, \nuntreated sewage poses a serious threat to public health and safety and \nis one of the leading causes of beach closings and contamination \nadvisories at Great Lakes beaches.\n  According to data collected over the past 5 years by the Illinois \nDepartment of Public Health, it is not uncommon to see the total number \nof beach closures and contamination advisories across the Lake Michigan \nbeaches in our State exceed 500 in a single swim season. These events \nthreaten the health of our children and families and cost local \neconomies millions. A University of Chicago study concluded the \nclosings due to high levels of harmful pathogens like E.coli cost the \nlocal economy about $2.4 million each year in lost revenue.\n  Protecting the Great Lakes is one of my top priorities in Congress. \nAs an original cosponsor of the Great Lakes Restoration Act, I support \na broad approach to address some of the greatest challenges to the \nGreat Lakes ecosystem and the economic growth of the region. However, \nwhile we continue to push for comprehensive Great Lakes restoration, we \nmust also move forward with tailored approaches to tackle specific \nproblems.\n  I am proud to introduce this important legislation to end the \ndisastrous practice of releasing billions of gallons of untreated \nsewage into our Nation's most abundant source of freshwater. It is my \nhope that my colleagues will work with me to to preserve the Great \nLakes and ensure this source of safe drinking water is safeguarded for \nfuture generations.\n\n[[Page S1860]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 571\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, among Chicago's most treasured assets is \nLake Michigan. The Great Lakes are among this country's most valuable \nnatural resources, but the lakes face many natural and man-made \nthreats. I'm pleased to join my Illinois colleague, Senator Mark Kirk, \nin introducing today the Great Lakes Water Protection Act to address \none of those threats--municipal sewage.\n  A recent report found that from January 2010 through January 2011, 7 \nU.S. cities dumped a combined 18.7 billion gallons of waste water into \nthe Great Lakes. Sewage and storm water discharges have been associated \nwith elevated levels of bacterial pollutants. For the 40 million people \nwho depend on the Great Lakes for their drinking water, that is no \nsmall matter.\n  When bacterial counts go too high, beaches have to be closed. In \nIllinois, we have 52 public beaches along the Lake Michigan shoreline. \nPeople use these beaches for swimming, boating, fishing and many \ncommunities generate revenue from the public beaches. Every lost \nvisitor to a public beach costs the local economy between $20 and $36 \nin revenue.\n  Our legislation would quadruple fines for municipalities that dump \nraw sewage in the Great Lakes and direct the revenue from these \npenalties to projects that improve water quality. The bill also \nincludes new reporting requirements to provide a more complete \nunderstanding of the frequency and impact of sewage dumping on this \ncritical water system.\n  The Great Lakes are a national treasure. Illinoisans know that. They \nwant to protect Lake Michigan and they are willing to fight for the \nLake. Three and a half years ago, when we learned that BP was planning \nto increase the pollutants it puts into Lake Michigan--the people of \nIllinois stood up and said no. Polluting our lake further is not an \noption.\n  Senator Kirk and I agree. Protecting the Great Lakes is not a \npartisan issue, and this is not a partisan bill. We will work together \nto ensure that this national treasure is around for generations, \nproviding drinking water, recreation and commerce for Illinois and \nother Great Lakes States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Carper):\n  S. 573. A bill to amend title 40, United States Code, to improve \nveterans service organizations access to Federal surplus personal \nproperty; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Formerly \nOwned Resources for Veterans to Express Thanks for Service Act of 2013, \nalso known as the FOR VETS Act of 2013. I am pleased that Senators \nLeahy and Carper have joined me in cosponsoring this bill. This bill is \nnecessary to ensure that veterans' service organizations are provided \naccess to federal surplus personal property as the Senate intended when \nit passed the FOR VETS Act of 2010. The FOR VETS Act of 2010 provides \nthat veterans' service organizations should be categorized as eligible \nnonprofit, tax-exempt organizations that may acquire surplus personal \nproperty for the purposes of education or public health.\n  Unfortunately, the General Services Administration, or GSA, has \ninterpreted this law in the strictest of terms. In its published \nguidelines, veterans' service organizations may acquire the surplus \nproperty for the purposes of education or public health, but with \nminimal flexibility in what an educational or public health service may \nbe. For example, acquiring a van to transport a disabled veteran to a \ndoctor's appointment may not be considered an eligible use for a \nveterans' organization under current guidelines.\n  The bill that we are introducing today makes the legislative \nmodification necessary for GSA to carry out the original intent of the \nFOR VETS Act of 2010.\n  The National Association of State Agencies for Surplus Property, \nNASASP, has identified the need for this legislation to ensure that \nveterans' service organizations are able to receive surplus equipment \nto enable them to improve their provision of critical services to our \nnation's veterans. The American Legion has said that this bill would \nenable them to better serve our veterans, their families, and the \ncommunities in which they live.\n  Veterans' groups--whose work enhances the lives of countless veterans \nevery day--should benefit from access to these goods just as other \nservice organizations do. Many veterans' organizations offer career \ndevelopment and job training assistance to our nation's veterans, yet \noften lack the computer equipment needed to assist our veterans in the \noften difficult transition from military service to the civilian work \nforce.\n  These are just a couple of examples of the needs of veterans' service \norganizations. This bill is one way to say ``thank you'' to those \nAmericans who have worn the uniform and to the families that supported \nthem. In these challenging fiscal times, the need for excess federal \nproperty to be used for job training, rehabilitation, and other \nimportant assistance to our veterans is greater now than ever. I am \nproud to introduce this legislation with Senators Leahy and Carper, and \nI look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this bill through \nthe Senate and into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 575. A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to provide an \nInspector General for the judicial branch, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Judicial \nTransparency and Ethics Enhancement Act, a bill that would establish \nwithin the judicial branch an Office of Inspector General to assist the \nJudiciary with its ethical obligations as well as to ensure taxpayer \ndollars are not lost to waste, fraud, or abuse. Representative \nSensenbrenner is introducing the companion bill in the House. This bill \nwill help make sure that our Federal judicial system remains free of \ncorruption, bias, and hypocrisy.\n  The facts demonstrate that the institution of the Inspector General \nhas been crucial in detecting, exposing and deterring problems within \nour government. The job of the Inspector General is to be the first \nline of defense against fraud, waste and abuse. In collaboration with \nwhistleblowers, Inspectors General have been extremely effective in \ntheir efforts to expose and help correct these wrongs.\n  That is why, during my 30 years in Congress I have worked hard to \nstrengthen the oversight role of Inspectors General throughout the \nFederal Government. I have come to rely on IGs and whistleblowers to \nensure that our tax dollars are spent according to the letter and \nspirit of the law. When that doesn't happen, we in Congress need to \nknow about it and take corrective action.\n  During the past fiscal year, Congress appropriated nearly $7 billion \nin taxpayer money to the Federal judiciary. To put this in context, the \nNational Science Foundation, the Small Business Administration, and the \nCorporation for National and Community Service each received a similar \nor less amount than the judiciary. Yet all three of these entities have \nan Office of Inspector General. If we in Congress believed that these \nentities could use an Inspector General, I cannot see why the Judiciary \nwouldn't deserve the same assistance.\n  But there is an additional reason why the Judiciary needs an \nInspector General. The fact remains that the current practice of self-\nregulation of judges with respect to ethics and the judicial code of \nconduct has time and time again proven inadequate. I would point out to \nmy colleagues two recent events here in the Senate that support this \nconclusion.\n  In the past 5 years, the Senate received articles of impeachment for \nnot one but two Federal judges. In the first case, former Judge Samuel \nB. Kent, although charged with multiple counts of sexual assault, pled \nguilty to obstruction of justice. Who did he obstruct?\n\n[[Page S1862]]\n\nWho did he lie to? He did this to his fellow judges, who were assembled \nto investigate the allegations of his obscene and criminal behavior. \nBut it took a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice to \nuncover his false statements to his colleagues as well as substantiate \nthe horrendous claims made against him.\n  In the second case, the Senate found that former Judge G. Thomas \nPorteous, Jr. was guilty of a number of things, including accepting \nmoney from attorneys who had a case pending before him in his court and \ncommitting perjury by falsifying his name on bankruptcy filings. Once \nagain, this Judge's misbehavior came to light through a Federal \ncriminal investigation, after which another judicial committee had to \nbe organized to investigate their fellow judge.\n  What's more, in each case the disgraced judge tried to game the \nsystem in order to retain his $174,000 salary. Rather than resign their \ncommissions, each first tried to claim disability status what would \nallow each to continue to receive payment, even if in prison. Then both \nplayed chicken with Congress daring us to strip them of their pay by \nimpeaching and convicting them. I am pleased that we put our foot down \nand said ``No.''\n  The judicial misconduct committees are simply inadequate for \ninvestigating claims of misconduct. These judges are not given the \nresources necessary nor do they have the expertise in conducting a \ncomplete investigation. They cannot, despite their best intentions, \nremove the inherent biases that develop from working closely with other \njudges. This duty would be better suited to an independent entity \nwithin the Judiciary.\n  The Judicial Transparency and Ethics Enhancement Act is the answer. \nThis bill would establish an Office of Inspector General for the \njudicial branch. The IG's responsibilities would include conducting \ninvestigations of possible judicial misconduct, investigating waste \nfraud and abuse, and recommending changes in laws and regulations \ngoverning the Federal judiciary. The bill would require the IG to \nprovide the Chief Justice and Congress with an annual report on its \nactivities, as well as refer matters that may constitute a criminal \nviolation to the Department of Justice. In addition, the bill \nestablishes whistleblower protections for judicial branch employees.\n  Ensuring a fair and independent judiciary is critical to our \nConstitutional system of checks and balances. Judges are supposed to \nmaintain impartiality. They are supposed to be free from conflicts of \ninterest. An independent watchdog for the Federal judiciary will help \nits members comply with the ethics rules and promote credibility within \nthe judicial branch of government. Whistleblower protections for \njudiciary branch employees will help keep the judiciary accountable. \nThe Judicial Transparency and Ethics Enhancement Act will not only \nensure continued public confidence in our Federal courts and keep them \nbeyond reproach, it will strengthen our judicial branch.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 575\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
