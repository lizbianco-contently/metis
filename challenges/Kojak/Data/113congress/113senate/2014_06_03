The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                             Energy Policy\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 4 years ago Washington Democrats sold \nthis country a bill of goods. Like a Ginsu knife pitchman, they \npromised that ObamaCare would create jobs, improve the economy, lower \npremiums, and reduce health spending--all for the low, low price of not \ncausing Americans to lose their insurance, their doctors or the \nhospitals they liked.\n  Today, Americans know the truth. It was a sham, the lie of the year, \nconvenient deceits told to advance the far left's agenda.\n  The people we represent just want the pain of ObamaCare to go away, \nbut the Democrats who run Washington have other ideas. Just yesterday \nthey rolled out the red carpet for a sequel. That is just what we saw \nwhen the Obama administration announced its latest front in the war on \nKentucky coal jobs.\n  The newest attack is the most extreme yet. The President wants \nAmericans to believe that his national energy tax can somehow heal the \nplanet and regulate the oceans, and he wants you to believe that it can \nbe done without harming middle-class families; that, in fact, his \nmassive regulatory scheme will actually create jobs and bring billions \nin economic benefits and shrink--you heard that right, shrink--\nAmerica's energy bills.\n  Well, if you believe that, I have some ObamaCare to sell you. This is \nthe same President, remember, who boasted as a candidate that his \nenergy tax policies would make electricity prices skyrocket. The truth \nis the President's energy tax won't even have an appreciable effect on \nglobal carbon emissions anyway.\n\n[[Page S3346]]\n\n  President Obama's last Environmental Protection Agency head told us \nas much, saying: ``U.S. action alone will not impact world \nCO2 levels.'' That is a quote from her. She said: ``U.S. \naction alone will not impact world CO2 levels.'' That was \nspoken by the previous EPA Administrator.\n  You need emissions-heavy countries such as India and China on board \nfirst. That is just a scientific fact, although I suspect our friends \non the left will conveniently ignore it because the point of this whole \nexercise is sadly obvious. It is not about science or global warming at \nall. It is all about making privileged elitists--elitists who may not \nfeel the pinch of a higher utility bill or the pain of a lost job--feel \nas if they did something.\n  There is another reason why the echoes of ObamaCare here are so \nunmistakable. The President's national energy tax represents a direct \nattack on the American middle class.\n  Experts say it would devastate entire swaths of our economy and could \nlead to a loss of nearly half a million jobs, according to one AFL-CIO \nlabor union estimate. In fact, the head of that union, the United Mine \nWorkers of America, said this energy tax would lead to long-term and \nirreversible job losses.\n  The national energy tax would also shift middle class jobs overseas, \nshatter our manufacturing base, and drive up energy costs for families. \nIt is a dagger aimed right at the heart of the American middle class, \nat a time when our constituents are already struggling under the weight \nof so many of this administration's other failed policies.\n  Let's not forget: Opportunity has already decreased for too many \nfamilies under this President's watch. Millions of our friends and \nneighbors are still out of work, and the economy is at a standstill.\n  This is President Obama's plan, to squeeze the middle class even \nharder, ship American jobs overseas and to do it by going around \nCongress? It is clear that the President is trying to impose this \nnational energy tax via Executive order because he knows the \nrepresentatives of the people would never vote for it.\n  He knows that Congress already rejected a similar national energy tax \nwhen he tried to pass it back in his first term. Maybe he is avoiding \nlegislative accountability because he knows this energy tax is too \ncruel, because he knows it would have an especially devastating impact \non the most vulnerable members of our society--the poor, the \nunemployed, and seniors on a fixed income.\n  It is a curious thing. The same elites who like to lecture us from \ntheir privileged perches about helping others are often the same people \nwho seem to care the least about who their extreme policies hurt. To \nthem the American people are just hoi polloi, the commoners who these \nelites think need their enlightened guidance.\n  That is especially true when it comes to coal-mining families in my \nState, good people who this administration hasn't even bothered to hear \nfrom. Kentucky miners know that coal keeps the lights on. All they want \nto do is provide for their families and put food on the table.\n  They have committed no crime, they have done nothing wrong, but the \nObama administration has declared a war on them all the same. A White \nHouse advisor was quoted as saying that a war on coal is ``exactly \nwhat's needed.''\n  These are callous positions, to be sure, but they are easy things to \nsay when you live hundreds of miles away, when you don't have to live \nwith the real-world consequences of your ivory tower ideological \nfantasies, when you don't have to see the raw human costs of your \nschemes. That certainly was the approach the administration took when \nit scheduled listening sessions to discuss its anti-coal regulations. \nIt only wanted to hear applause from fellow leftwing elites, so it \ndidn't schedule a single listening session in coal country--not one.\n  This is what one miner said at a coal listening session that I hosted \nin Eastern Kentucky after the administration refused to attend: ``Our \nbiggest worries now are just trying to keep a roof over our heads [and] \nfood on the table.''\n  He is not alone, and he needs to know this: We are on the side of the \naisle that hears him. We are not going to let this administration's \nanti-middle class policies go unchallenged.\n  That is why today I am introducing legislation, the Coal Country \nProtection Act, that would push back against the President's extreme \nanti-coal scheme. It would require that simple but important benchmarks \nbe met before his rules could take effect.\n  The Secretary of Labor would have to certify that it would not \ngenerate loss of employment. The Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice would have to certify that it would not result in any loss in \nthe American gross domestic product.\n  The Administrator of the Energy Information Administration would have \nto certify it would not increase electricity rates, and the Chairman of \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the president of the North \nAmerican Electric Reliability Corporation would have to certify that \nelectricity delivery would remain reliable.\n  It is just common sense. That is why I call upon the majority leader \nto schedule a vote on this legislation immediately and to help us pass \nit, because Kentucky mining families are counting on him and so are \ncountless middle-class families in my State and across the country who \nstand to get hurt by this administration's cold ideological attacks.\n  If the majority leader and Senate Democrats stand in the way of \npassing this bill, Kentuckians and the American people will remember \nwho stood with them and who worked against them. I imagine they will \nwant to send a majority to Washington that would actually work for the \nmiddle class for a change, instead of hurting seniors and shipping jobs \noverseas.\n  At the end of the day it comes down to this: The President's national \nenergy tax is ObamaCare 2.0. It is a massive big-government boondoggle \nthat is being marketed as something it isn't. It is an idea that will \nnot even solve the larger problem it purports to address, and it will \nhurt the middle class.\n  So the President can pretend his national energy tax is about helping \nthe environment, but we know better. It is not going to do a thing to \nmeaningfully control global carbon emissions. This is really about \ngrowing government. It is really about making leftwing elitists feel \nbetter about themselves, and it is really about helping political \nsupporters in places such as California and New York while inflicting \nserious pain on people and places like Kentucky.\n  I am going to continue to fight. Kentuckians deserve no less. I am \ngoing to keep vigorously fighting against the Obama administration's \ncontinued war on coal jobs and this extreme, extreme anti-middle class \nnational energy tax in particular.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King).

Mr. President, I rise in morning business to respond to \nthe Republican Senate leader who just spoke.\n  I preface my remarks by making the claim that I have made on the \nfloor now three different times, and I am still waiting for the first \nMember of the other party to come to this Senate Chamber and to dispute \nwhat I am about to say.\n  The Republican Party of the United States of America is the only \nmajor political party in the world today that denies global warming.\n  I have said it. I am waiting for them to come forward and say: No, \nthere is another one somewhere. One said: Well, we think there is one \nin Australia.\n  Really? So the entire world understands that global warming is a \nchallenge except for one political party, the Republican Party of the \nUnited States of America.\n\n[[Page S3347]]\n\n  And what have we seen with global warming? We have seen a change in \nthe world we live in. Weather is more extreme; things are changing.\n  We have from time to time young people who come and visit the Senate \nChamber and sit in the galleries. They are always welcomed, but of \ncourse our debate today is about them. It is about the world they will \nlive in and a question of whether it will be habitable, a world they \ncan live in and prosper. Don't we have an obligation, our generation, \nto leave that world to them and, if nothing else, a world as good as \nwhat we inherited from our parents and grandparents?\n  That is what this debate about. And if we are going to do that, we \nhave to make some changes. Can America make a change? We sure can. We \nhave led the world when it comes to change. This President sat down \nwith the automobile manufacturers, after decades of resistance to the \nnotion of more fuel-efficient vehicles, and hammered out an agreement \nthat now we are driving cars and trucks that take us the same distance \nand burn fewer gallons of gasoline.\n  My wife and I drive a Ford Fusion Hybrid, 36 miles a gallon, and we \ncan beat that with other cars, but we are pretty happy with our little \nFord. Nobody put a gun to my head and said buy it. My wife and I \nthought it was the responsible thing to do. Ford made a great product \nand we bought it.\n  There was a time on the floor of the Senate when Ford and other \ncompanies were in denial. It will never happen, they said. It is \nhappening. America can change for the better with leadership.\n  I listened to the arguments from the Senate Republican leader today \nabout the impact of change and the impact of doing something about \ncarbon pollution on poor people and working families. I had to come to \nthe floor. I listened to the plaintive pleas of the Republican leader \nto think about poor people working and the impact it has on them, and I \nkept remembering it is his political party that has opposed the \nincrease in the minimum wage, an increase in the wage these poor people \nare earning. They oppose it, with one exception, maybe two. Their party \nopposes increasing the minimum wage and comes to the floor and says we \ncan't do anything that could hurt poor working families.\n  First, let them join us in a bipartisan effort to raise the minimum \nwage. Secondly, I can report one thing that global warming and carbon \npollution is producing today. It is producing the No. 1 complaint of \nchildren brought to the emergency rooms across America. What is the \nmost common health problem bringing children to emergency rooms? \nTrauma? No. What is it? Asthma. I go to classrooms across my State, and \nI say to the children who are there: Hold up your hand if you know \nanyone who has asthma. Rural schools, urban schools, it is all the \nsame. Hands go up across the classroom. These problems are created by \nthe air we are forced to breathe. Are we going to do something about \nit? We should.\n  Our colleague Max Baucus from Montana recently took on the position \nas Ambassador to China. He and his wife were headed over and we said \nhalf jokingly: I hope the air is clean enough to breathe over there, \nbecause if you have been to China, you know it is a challenge every \nsingle day. Are we going to take a different approach in America? Are \nwe going to set a different example in America when it comes to public \nhealth? This is our opportunity.\n  If we truly care about working families and their children, how can \nwe ignore what is happening? As the air gets worse and carbon pollution \nincreases and asthma increases, health care costs go up. Lives are \ncompromised. I don't want to see that happen. So if we truly care about \nworking families, care about their children and the health of their \nchildren. I might also add, care about providing these families with \nhealth insurance. Time and again the same party that came to the floor \nthis morning, telling us about working people, has opposed our efforts \nto extend the protection of health insurance to working families.\n  Which State is one of the most successful States in the Union in \nsigning up people when it comes to our new health insurance plan, the \nso-called ObamaCare? One of the most successful per capita States in \nthe Nation happens to be the Commonwealth of Kentucky, represented by \nthe Senator who just spoke on the other side of the aisle. Hundreds of \nthousands of people in Kentucky now have health insurance through the \nPresident's plan, including thousands under Medicaid.\n  So when we are talking about who is sensitive to the needs of working \nfamilies, whether it is minimum wage or basic health insurance, I think \nour approach is one that has proven to be right. Over 6 million \nAmericans have now signed up for health insurance. In my State of \nIllinois, over 100,000 in Cook County alone now have health insurance, \nand I have met some of them.\n  Roy Romanowski--a great Chicago name--Roy, a big barrel-chested \nPolish musician, was sitting next to me at a health care clinic and he \nsaid, Senator, never had health insurance in my life but have it now \nand patted his wallet. Now he is signed up for Medicaid. A low-income \nguy, takes jobs as they come along, he has health insurance--he is \nabout 60 years old--and is happy to have it. So when we talk about \nstanding up for working people, this is part of it.\n  Yes, it is a challenge when we face change. We are a coal-producing \nState in Illinois. We are going to have to sit down as a State and make \na plan that is going to deal with reducing the pollution which is \nchanging our planet. We can do it. I am sure we can, and America should \nlead the world.\n  How many times have our colleagues on the other side talked about \nexceptionalism; that America is such a different and great country. I \ndon't quarrel with that. I don't want to be braggadocios about it, but \nI don't quarrel with it.\n  But when it comes to a challenge such as this, of cleaning up the \nenvironment, shouldn't America be a leader? Of course. That is what \nPresident Obama is asking us to do: State by State, figure out a plan \nthat reduces carbon pollution, reduces the public health hazards \nchildren and families are facing because of the pollution, reduces the \ndamage taking place to this environment that is changing the world we \nlive in. That is what a leader does.\n  It is time for us to try to come together and work together to find a \nsolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/03/senate-section/article/S3347-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3347-S3348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CFTC NOMINATIONS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank our leader Senator Durbin for \nspeaking on a number of subjects that actually all add up to the fact \nthat we believe every American ought to have a fair shot to make it, \nwhether it is jobs in a new clean energy economy. When I think about \nthe fact that we will not have a middle class, we will not have an \neconomy unless we make things and grow things--and that is what we do \nin Michigan. I think about our new clean energy opportunities. There \nare 8,000 parts in a big wind turbine, and somebody has to make those \nparts. We can make those in Michigan. So when we talk about doing the \nright things so we can breathe the air and drink the water, it is also \nabout creating new opportunities for good-paying jobs for people, and \nit is about making sure our economy works for everybody and that \neverybody has a fair shot. That is the best of America.\n  We have before us in the Senate three nominations for the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission, and we will be voting on one of them in a \nfew hours. They came out of the Agriculture Committee, which I am \nhonored to chair, so I wish to speak about them for a moment.\n  This independent agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is \nentrusted with the important mission of protecting investors in the \nderivatives market from fraud, manipulation, and other abuses. That \nmeans farmers and ranchers. It means consumers. It means businesses, \nlarge and small. It means a way to create capital so it can be invested \nin new jobs.\n  The oversight of this agency is incredibly important. Given this \nresponsibility, it is imperative that we select Commissioners who have \ndemonstrated not only expertise in global financial markets but the \nintegrity and the judgment necessary to lead the implementation reforms \ncontained in the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. This\n\n[[Page S3348]]\n\nis a five-member Commission. Due to some changes and folks moving on in \ntheir careers, we have two members right now, one Democratic and one \nRepublican. So we have a responsibility of now filling all five. We \nwill have in front of us this week, at some point throughout the week, \nall three of the folks who came out of our committee.\n  We have three nominees before us who I think fit the requirement of \nhaving expertise, integrity, and judgment. The first is Republican \nnominee J. Christopher Giancarlo, and then we have two Democratic \nnominees, Tim Massad, who has been nominated to Chair the CFTC, and \nSharon Bowen. All three are highly qualified nominees who were approved \nby the agriculture committee on a voice vote. Right now I will focus on \nMs. Bowen, whom we will be voting on in just a little bit.\n  Within the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reforms, individual agencies were \ndirected to establish an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion. This \naction was taken to address the lack of diversity of qualified men and \nwomen in Federal agencies involved in financial regulation but also \nsubcontractors and contractors who receive billions of dollars from the \ngovernment.\n  The CFTC itself should lead by example when it comes to diversity as \nwell as expertise. So I am especially pleased President Obama selected \nSharon Bowen as a nominee for the Commission. She will be the first \nAfrican-American woman to serve on the CFTC and will be the only woman \nserving at this point in time on the five-member Commission. She has \nthe expertise and experience to be an excellent Commissioner.\n  During her testimony before the Agriculture Committee, Ms. Bowen told \nof her upbringing as the youngest of five children in the small town of \nSt. Julien's Creek in Virginia. During Ms. Bowen's youth, St. Julien's \nCreek was a segregated town, and her family had modest means, but these \nchallenges forged her character. Ms. Bowen developed a knack for \nunderstanding the perspective of people who have a stake in public \npolicy decisions but no voice in how those decisions are made.\n  This background has served her well throughout her years as an \nattorney. As a partner in the New York firm of Latham & Watkins, Ms. \nBowen represented clients in a range of complex financial transactions. \nSo her knowledge of derivatives and global markets is based on real-\nworld experience.\n  She has been selected by one publication as one of America's top \nBlack lawyers and chosen as the Lawyer of the Year by the Metropolitan \nBlack Bar Association.\n  Recognizing Ms. Bowen's talents, President Obama nominated her to be \nvice chair, then acting chair of the Securities Investor Protection \nCorporation, a very important nonprofit which helps protect investors \nwhose brokers have failed them. Ms. Bowen was confirmed by the Senate, \nat that time, unanimously, and I certainly hope that will happen again.\n  Sharon Bowen has worked tirelessly to fulfill what are called SIPC's \nmandates--the Securities Investor Protection Corporation--helping \nthousands of small investors faced with the failure of their brokerage \nfirms. During Ms. Bowen's tenure on the board, SIPC has returned $24.5 \nbillion to over 9,000 investors.\n  Despite all her accomplishments through the years, it was evident \nfrom Ms. Bowen's testimony in the agriculture committee that she \nremains grounded by a sensibility for how markets have effects far \nbeyond investors. They affect each of us. They affect consumers, \nfarmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and others who create jobs.\n  She recognizes the urgency of protecting these individuals from \nexcessive speculation and manipulation. She told our committee:\n\n       I understand the importance of being the voice of the \n     under-represented and small business owners who have not had \n     a seat at the table, as I do today.\n\n  The CFTC needs a Commissioner of Ms. Bowen's background and skill \nset. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting Ms. Bowen's \nnomination and to quickly move forward with the nominations of Mr. \nGiancarlo and Mr. Massad, whom I will be speaking about more as their \nnominations come before us, so they can get to work protecting \ninvestors and every American who is vulnerable to abuses in the futures \nand swaps markets.\n  We need those markets to work, to create capital, and also to manage \nrisk for those who are using the markets in order to be able to manage \ntheir own risk, and we need a full five-member CFTC of competent, \nqualified people in order to get that done. That is what we are doing \ntoday with the vote, and then, as we move forward this week, hopefully \nby the end of the week we will have the full complement of the CFTC in \nplace.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to \nSharon Bowen's nomination to be a Commissioner of the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission. Frankly, it amazes me that we are here today \ndiscussing basically a possible promotion for Ms. Bowen. Given my \nexperience with her in her current job as Acting Chair of the \nSecurities Investor Protection Corporation--SIPC--and before that as \nVice Chair, I can say quite frankly that she does not deserve any \npromotion because she has not successfully safeguarded consumers, which \nis her job, her mission. Instead, she has fought to safeguard Wall \nStreet money from just compensation to the legitimate victims of the \nAllen Stanford $7.2 billion Ponzi scheme.\n  I have been involved in this Stanford issue for quite a while because \nit affects a lot of folks in Louisiana, but it affects a lot of folks \nin every State of the country as well. These folks first and foremost \nwere victims of Allen Stanford and his completely fraudulent activity, \nhis Ponzi scheme that literally defrauded hard-working Americans of \n$7.2 billion. But they were victimized again, quite frankly, by Federal \nagencies that didn't do their job--first by the SEC, which knew about \nthis activity for 4 years before saying anything publicly, before \nwarning anyone out there, before taking any action, and then by SIPC--\nincluding Sharon Bowen at SIPC--by refusing to take appropriate action \nfor the victims and instead acting as if their job, their duty was to \nsafeguard Wall Street money, not to properly compensate victims under \nthe law.\n  If you read the letters and talk to the Stanford victims, as I have \nmany times, it will just break your heart.\n  Charles Cook of Baton Rouge said:\n\n       My family, along with thousands of others who placed their \n     savings in licensed brokers' hands, now faces absolute \n     financial ruin simply because our government and government-\n     appointed regulators did not perform their jobs of protecting \n     us. These savings include retirement accounts, trusts for \n     chronically ill family members, college funds, and pension \n     plans.\n\n  Byron Ratliff, also of Baton Rouge:\n\n       Congress needs to be aware that the agency created by \n     Congress to protect investors is using their fund to defy the \n     federal government for the sake of denying protection to \n     investors they helped defraud . . . We need your help now \n     more than ever to block this ridiculous effort by SIPC. This \n     is criminal.\n\n  Gilbert Gossen, also of Louisiana:\n\n       Has it changed our lifestyle? Yes, tremendously. Not only \n     my wife and I have been deprived of our lifetime savings, my \n     five children who have worked alongside with us have been \n     unfairly deprived of their inheritance.\n\n  Carolyn Smith in Baton Rouge goes to the core of the matter:\n\n       I cannot believe this. This is killing me and my family.\n\n  Fraudulent schemes unfortunately go on all the time, but, again, what \nmakes this so heartbreaking is the victimization upon victimization. \nFirst came the original fraud; then came the SEC, which saw this going \non and did not act and did not give victims and potential victims any \nnotice for 4 years; and then after the SEC acted, after the SEC ordered \nSIPC to compensate victims, SIPC--Sharon Bowen included--in an \nunprecedented move, refused to follow\n\n[[Page S3349]]\n\nthat mandate by the SEC, requiring the SEC to sue SIPC, which is now \ntied up in court and continues to this day.\n  That gets us back to the issue at hand--Ms. Bowen. The name of her \ncurrent employer is supposed to be about investor protection--the \nSecurities Investor Protection Corporation, SIPC--but she and her \ncolleagues have acted in the direction of Wall Street protection.\n  The fund is funded by companies that pay into it. They pay their dues \nto give potential investors peace of mind, and that confidence helps \nbuild a vibrant and positive marketplace. Make no mistake that those \nWall Street member companies do not want SIPC to compensate these \nvictims because they are worried that their dues will increase. Well, \nit is fine for them to have their concern; it is not fine for Sharon \nBowen to make those concerns win out over the law and over the facts, \nto ignore a mandate from the SEC, and to not properly compensate the \nvictims of the Stanford scandal.\n\n  If, after all of this, Congress gives Ms. Bowen a promotion, condones \nher actions here today, and votes to support her, that will be yet \nanother slap in the face to these victims and an action that will \ncertainly undermine investor confidence and encourage more to follow \nMs. Bowen's career path and the way she ran the Security Investor \nProtection Commission by advancing themselves and member companies \nrather than the real mission of following the law and properly \ncompensating victims.\n  This is not a partisan grudge match. This is not partisan at all. I \nam opposing Ms. Bowen's confirmation for one simple reason: I think she \nhas proved that she is not qualified for the job based on her track \nrecord at SIPC as well as her performance at her confirmation hearing.\n  Let me underscore the way in which this is not partisan at all \nbecause there are many folks who have been following this Stanford case \nwho are directly involved who have written to Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle urging--urging in the strongest terms possible--opposition to \nthis nomination.\n  Let's take a letter written by a self-proclaimed and lifelong \nDemocrat from Ann Arbor, MI, a constituent of Senator Stabenow. Senator \nStabenow is the chairman of the Senate agriculture committee. That \ncertainly has a significant role in this nomination.\n  The letter says:\n\n       I've been writing to you over the past days regarding the \n     growing opposition to the nomination of Sharon Bowen to the \n     CFTC. I am writing once more to stress that this is not \n     merely an effort to block an Obama nominee. As a lifelong \n     Democrat I would not get behind such an initiative if I \n     thought that's what it was. Opposing Ms. Bowen's confirmation \n     is not a partisan issue. Simply put, it makes no sense to \n     appoint a regulator who is being sued by another regulator \n     (SEC vs. SIPC)! In this climate of growing cynicism toward \n     our financial regulators, can we really afford to put one \n     more fox outside the hen house?\n\n  In a similar way, a constituent of Senator Nelson of Florida wrote \nSenator Nelson and said:\n\n       We hope you will vote AGAINST confirming Ms. Bowen as a \n     CFTC Commissioner as she does not support protecting \n     investors. Sharon Bowen's loyalty to Wall Street instead of \n     hard-working people like us has devastated our lives because \n     her actions resulted in us not being able to recover our \n     savings.\n\n  A constituent of Senator Pryor's wrote him in a similar vein:\n\n       Based on the facts set forth below, I certainly hope you \n     will vote against confirming Ms. Bowen as a CFTC Commissioner \n     in order to protect the investors who rely on the CFTC's \n     regulatory supervision.\n\n  In a similar way, Madoff victims have also weighed strongly into this \nmatter. They have written their Senators urging them to oppose the \nBowen nomination.\n  One Madoff victim wrote:\n\n       SIPC Chairwoman Sharon Bowen is neither a qualified nor \n     appropriate nominee for the all-important Commodity Futures \n     Trading Commission. As a SIPC board member, SIPC Chairwoman \n     and an attorney representing members of the financial \n     industry, Ms. Bowen has demonstrated repeatedly that her \n     interest is in protecting Wall Street's interests.\n\n  Again, frauds happen all the time. It is always tragic, but it does \nhappen. What makes this case so ``tripley'' tragic is that the victims \nof the original Allen Stanford fraud were victimized again by failed \nbureaucracies and regulators who failed to do their jobs and continued \nto fail to carry out their true mandate of protecting investors.\n  First, the SEC dragged its feet and took way too long to take any \naction in this matter or to give anyone in the real world notice of \nwhat was clearly happening in the Stanford case--4-plus years--and then \nthe SEC finally acted and agreed that these victims required \ncompensation under the law. They told SIPC to set about giving them \nthis compensation, and in a completely unprecedented way, never before \nand never since, Sharon Bowen of SIPC said: No. We are not doing what \nthe SEC has told us to do. We are refusing to do that.\n  They had to be sued by the SEC, and that legal matter is still \ntangled up in court with the victims of the Stanford mess, and they \nstill have not gotten any compensation.\n  We can't prevent every bad thing from happening in the world, but \nsurely we can ensure that agencies in Washington and regulatory bodies \ndo their jobs, follow their mandates and their missions and work for \ninvestors and citizens and not be captured by narrow interests--in this \ncase, Wall Street interests. Surely we can do that, and that, \nultimately, is what this vote is all about. Are we going to do that or \nare we going to promote someone who has failed at her current job? Are \nwe going to promote someone who has proved in her current job that she \ndoes not have the right mindset, the right understanding of a pro-\ninvestor, pro-consumer mission to handle that job or any other?\n  I urge all of my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats--and there is \nnothing partisan about this--to oppose this Sharon Bowen nomination. \nThe victims of the Stanford scandal need some justice. They need to see \nthat someone cares and that someone is fighting on their behalf. The \nvictims of the Madoff scandal need exactly the same and feel exactly \nthe same way.\n  Please oppose this nomination. Please vote for those consumers, those \nAmericans, and those investors. Please vote to begin to right the ship \nand fix the regulatory system.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, everywhere middle-class Americans look, \nthey are facing higher prices. Over the past 5\\1/2\\ years of the Obama \nPresidency, the price of everything--from milk to the refrigerator to \nput it in--has risen. Tuition costs have soared, gas prices have almost \ndoubled, food prices have shot up, and then, of course, there is health \ncare. The President claimed that health care premiums would fall by \n$2,500 under his health care law. Instead, they have risen by almost \n$3,700 during the President's administration, and they are still going \nup. The President's health care law has driven up the price of almost \nevery aspect of health care, from premiums to pacemakers.\n  Americans are ill-equipped to meet these higher costs. Household \nincome has declined by more than $3,500 on the President's watch. \nNearly 10 million Americans are unemployed, more than one-third of them \nfor 6 months or longer, and 19.4 million Americans have been forced to \njoin the food stamp program since the President took office.\n  Our economy is simply not posting the kind of growth we need to open \nopportunities for middle-class families. Economic growth actually \ndeclined last quarter, and job creation is sluggish at best. \nFurthermore, the jobs we are creating are not the kinds of jobs \nAmericans need to get ahead. Seventy-eight percent of the jobs that \nwere lost during the recession were high- or mid-wage jobs, but just 56 \npercent of the jobs recovered have been the same.\n\n[[Page S3350]]\n\nThat means almost half of the jobs we are creating are low-wage jobs--\nnot the kind that will get Americans to a more secure financial future.\n  Americans have had a tough time over the past 5\\1/2\\ years, and if \nthe President has his way, it is about to get much worse. This week the \nPresident's Environmental Protection Agency announced a national energy \ntax that will drive up Americans' energy bills and destroy jobs while \nessentially doing nothing for the environment.\n  Coal is responsible for approximately 40 percent of our country's \nenergy production and is a significant part of the economies of several \nStates. Currently, there are nearly 560 coal-fired powerplants in the \nUnited States, but if the administration's new greenhouse gas \nregulations go into effect, a majority of them will close and no new \nplants will be built. That means energy companies are going to have to \nscramble for new sources of energy. With utilities faced with fewer and \nmore expensive sources of energy, electricity rates will soar to \nunprecedented levels, and that will leave millions of Americans \nstruggling to afford their energy bills.\n  What the administration has proposed this week is nothing short--make \nno mistake about it--of a national energy tax, and it will hit low-\nincome families and seniors who live on fixed incomes and already \ndevote a large share of their income to the electricity bills the \nhardest. In my home State of South Dakota, low-income families already \nspend almost a quarter of their income on energy bills. There is no way \nthey can afford to spend hundreds more to pay for President Obama's \nnational energy tax--that is, of course, if they can even get \nelectricity.\n  The polar vortex that covered large portions of the United States \nwith extreme cold and snow this past winter pushed the electricity grid \nto its limits. The Chairman of the Federal Regulatory Commission \ndescribed the grid as ``close to the edge,'' with coal-fired \npowerplants running at 90 percent capacity to keep houses warm during a \nhistorically cold winter. These are the very plants that are being \ntargeted by this administration. Closing these powerplants, which \nprovide affordable power throughout the year, will severely jeopardize \nour ability to produce reliable electricity and heat during times of \npeak power demand. This will be particularly dangerous in winter months \nwhen an overstressed grid could leave thousands of Americans without a \nsource of heat for their homes.\n  Driving up energy bills and compromising the energy grid would be \nsufficient reason to reject the President's new carbon dioxide \nregulations, but that is not all these regulations will do. The \nPresident's new regulations will also destroy tens of thousands and \npossibly hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  First, of course, there are the thousands of Americans who will lose \ntheir jobs when the coal-fired plants that they work for close their \ndoors. Then there are the manufacturing jobs that will be lost if these \nregulations go into effect. U.S. manufacturing is currently enjoying a \nrenaissance thanks to the abundant, affordable energy the United States \noffers. Manufacturers are actually moving production from overseas to \nthe United States and investing billions of dollars in our economy in \nthe process. But if we drive up the cost of energy here at home, \nmanufacturers will no longer have the same incentive to locate jobs \nhere in America. Instead, manufacturers will send jobs overseas.\n  Given the terrible costs of these regulations, one would assume that \nthe payoff would be huge--a drastic reduction in global carbon dioxide \nconcentration levels.\n  The truth is the President is proposing to devastate American \nfamilies and destroy our economy for nothing, because the President's \nproposals would have essentially no impact--no impact--on the \nconcentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. Even the President's \nown former EPA Administrator admitted: ``U.S. action alone will not \nimpact world CO2 levels.''\n  The truth is, as long as the United States is acting unilaterally, \nglobal emissions will not be reduced in any meaningful way. In fact, \nthe President's proposals could actually drive up emissions in other \ncountries as manufacturers send jobs from the United States to some of \nthe world's top polluters such as India and China.\n  Manufacturers in the United States are already reducing emissions. \nU.S. manufacturing and other industrial carbon dioxide emissions are \ndown 13 percent since 2005. In the meantime, however, China's \nCO2 emissions have grown by 69 percent, while India's have \ngrown by 53 percent.\n  After 5\\1/2\\ years of the Obama economy, Americans are struggling--\nstruggling to pay for health care, for college tuition, for food, and \nfor gas--and they are wondering where the promised recovery is and how \nlong they are going to have to live paycheck to paycheck, praying they \ncan afford unexpected bills. Too many of them are wondering if they \nwill be able to find a job to replace the one they lost. Others are \nwondering if they ever will find the better paying job they have been \nwaiting for.\n  Now the President is prepared to hike electricity prices for every \none of these Americans. Worse, he is prepared to eliminate thousands of \ntheir jobs. For what? For a significant reduction in global carbon \ndioxide concentration levels? No. He is prepared to damage their \nbudgets and destroy their jobs just so they can appear to be doing \nsomething about global warming. He is willing to overlook the economic \nhavoc these regulations will create as long as his extreme \nenvironmental base is content.\n  News reports have suggested the President has backed these new carbon \nregulations because he believes they will be an impressive addition to \nhis legacy. I wish to suggest that the record of lost jobs and \nstruggling families is not the kind of legacy the President would want \nto leave.\n  I hope in the coming days we will hear from the President's party on \nthis issue. I challenge my Democratic colleagues in the Senate to stand \nand tell the American people where they stand. Do they stand with \nAmerican jobs and American families or do they stand with their party's \nenvironmental fringe?\n  The American people deserve to know. Their jobs, their standard of \nliving, and their future hang in the balance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/03/senate-section/article/S3350-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for approximately 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Markets Transparency\n\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I believe in markets and I believe in \ntransparency, and that is what I wish to speak about today. I think \nmarkets generally are the best allocators of goods and services, but in \norder for markets to work, people who purchase--consumers--need \ninformation. I wish to address one small piece of a very important \nmarket today.\n  I serve on the Budget Committee of this body and as such I have had \nan opportunity to look at not only the current budget but projections \nof future\n\n[[Page S3351]]\n\nbudgets. I think it is important to emphasize that virtually all the \ngrowth--all the growth--in future Federal budgets is attributable to \nhealth care--all the growth. It is not Pell grants, it is not national \nparks, it is not national defense, it is not the National Security \nAgency; it is all in health care.\n  There are several ways we can control those costs. One way which has \nbeen suggested is to simply shift those costs off to other people--to \nthe States, to the elderly, to other citizens--and say it is not the \nFederal Government's problem; it is someone else's problem. I would \nsuggest that is not the answer. We need to be focused on the issue of \nhealth care costs generally, for everyone--for the Federal Government \nas a consumer, as it is in Medicare and Medicaid, but also for all of \nus as health care consumers across the country.\n  The standard response around here to growing health care costs is to \ncut programs, cut recipients, reduce payments to States, or reduce \npayments to providers. That does nothing about the fundamental issue. I \ncan tell my colleagues that none of these steps has anything to do with \nreducing the demand for services or the costs of those services. We \nhave to spend the money we have more responsibly.\n  There have been discussions recently about repealing the medical \ndevice tax which was passed as part of the Affordable Care Act. The \ntheory, by the way, was that the Affordable Care Act would produce, as \nit has, millions of new customers for the private insurance industry as \nwell as for all of those who participate in the health care system, \nincluding those who manufacture medical devices. The Affordable Care \nAct has produced new customers. And the theory, as I understand it, \nbecause I wasn't here when the bill was originally passed, was the \nindustry--the businesses that will profit by the production of new \ncustomers through new people gaining insurance who never had it \nbefore--was that part of that would be paid back to support the overall \nsystem. That was the idea of the tax on medical devices. I realize the \nmedical device tax is a controversial tax and that strong arguments can \nbe made that it should be modified or reduced. But the repeal of the \nmedical device tax would cost the government $29 billion over the next \n10 years. That is money, as we all know, that has to be replaced \nsomewhere else. So I think that is a consideration that has to be taken \ninto account as we discuss this matter which is under consideration as \npart of the tax extenders package.\n  As I looked into this issue and thought about the medical device \nindustry, I was surprised to find it is very difficult to find out the \nprice of an implantable medical device. One of the reasons is that the \nhospitals, which are the purchasers of these devices, are often \nprevented by agreements with the medical device company from revealing \nthe price they pay. In other words, there is no transparency about the \nprices of these devices which find their way into the cost of \neverybody's health care.\n  Imagine for a moment going to buy a new car and there is no \nadvertising about the prices of the cars. We couldn't go on the \nInternet and determine the prices of the cars. We couldn't compare the \nprices of the cars from one dealer to the other. But we go in and \nsomebody behind a closed door says, OK, the price is $20,200, and we \nare not allowed to tell anybody the price we are paying for this car, \nand we have to sign an agreement that we are keeping that price secret. \nImagine that system, and imagine for a moment what would happen to the \nprice of cars. I don't think it is gross speculation to assume that the \nprice would go up, because there is no transparency.\n  I have filed amendment No. 3802 to H.R. 3474, which is the tax \nextenders bill that is pending. It simply says that when a medical \ndevice is being sold, the manufacturer cannot impose a secrecy \nprovision on the hospitals that purchase these devices, and they also \nhave to report median prices to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices on a regular basis.\n  In 2012, the GAO did a report on Medicare and one of the pieces of \nthe report was titled ``Lack of Price Transparency May Hamper \nHospitals' Ability to Be Prudent Purchasers of Implantable Medical \nDevices''--a long title, but the conclusion is contained in the title: \n``may hamper hospitals' ability to be prudent purchasers.'' Well, if \nhospitals can't be prudent purchasers, we who are paying the bills, \nquite often through Medicare and Medicaid, are not able to get the best \nprices. Who pays? All of us pay.\n  This amendment would prohibit medical device manufacturers from \nrequiring hospitals and buyers to sign purchasing agreements that \ncontain confidentiality clauses that would restrict them from revealing \nthe prices paid for medical devices to third parties. In addition, as I \nmentioned, the amendment would require these manufacturers to submit \nthe average and median sales prices of covered devices to the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services on a quarterly basis.\n  In 2007, my good friend Senator Grassley from Iowa sponsored a \nbipartisan bill to create a process of reporting this kind of price \ndata to HHS, and I believe it is time to do just that.\n  To the extent that prices of implantable medical devices, which are \nvery expensive generally, are not disclosed, the ability of hospitals \nto bring price information to bear in negotiations and decisions is \nclearly limited. I believe if we are going to talk about repealing a \nmedical device tax, we should also talk about calling upon the industry \nto provide to consumers and policymakers greater transparency in order \nto better control costs.\n  In a world of limited resources, we have to spend the money we have \nmost wisely. It is very difficult to spend money wisely if prices and \ncomparative prices and prices of the various components of the health \ncare system are essentially kept secret.\n  This is a simple amendment. It is simply based upon the fundamental \nidea that markets work, but they only work when consumers--in this \ncase, hospitals--have the information necessary to make good purchasing \ndecisions. I think markets, as I said at the beginning, are the best \nway to allocate goods and services, but that information is necessary \nfor markets to work, and that is the purpose of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time between now and \n12 noon during quorum calls be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KING. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Speak Up Act\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this morning just before the noon \nhour to talk about our children, a topic which does not get nearly \nenough attention in Washington. I will try to focus on just one issue. \nBoth parties in this body and in the other body indicate, on a pretty \nfrequent basis, that they are in favor of supporting strategies to \nprotect and to help our children, but not enough attention is paid to \nwhat that strategy should be and what the elements of it should be.\n  I believe it should at least have four major components. One is to \nmake sure children have every opportunity for more early learning. In \naddition, we need to make sure more children are covered by health \ninsurance and get quality health care. We made a lot of strides in that \nin the last couple of decades, but we still have a ways to go.\n  We need to make sure children are protected, an issue I will speak \nabout today in particular. Obviously, we want to put in place better \nstrategies to make sure children have enough to eat and are eating food \nthat is nutritious. So today I will focus on the question of \nprotection.\n  We know that as we head into the last couple of days of the school \nyear, children are starting to look forward to summer activities such \nas camp and summer sports and other activities. That is the good news. \nThe bad news is that can create opportunities for people who would do \nthem harm. It is important to reiterate the responsibility adults have \ngenerally but in particular at this time of the year.\n  Adults have an abiding responsibility to protect children from harm \nand to speak up, literally to speak up when\n\n[[Page S3352]]\n\nthey suspect a child is a victim of abuse or neglect. We know many \ncases of abuse and neglect go unreported, sometimes for years, \nsometimes even until a child has died or suffered other terrible \nconsequences as a result of years of neglect or abuse.\n  For example, in 2012, in Pennsylvania there were 3,565 substantiated \nreports of child abuse and neglect. Across the Nation, 678,047 children \nwere victims of abuse and neglect in the country as a whole, although I \nthink it is important to point out the number I read from Pennsylvania: \n3,565 substantiated reports of child abuse and neglect.\n  That means two things: It was reported, and we know the overwhelming \nnumber do not get reported. So even among the category of those that \nwere reported, they had to be substantiated reports of abuse and \nneglect. I believe if we had just a broad category of children in our \nState--and it is true of a lot of other States as well--who are the \nvictims of abuse and neglect, it would far exceed 3,565 cases, but that \nnumber alone is horrific and should cause us to do a lot more than we \nare doing, not just in Pennsylvania but around the country. We saw in \nPennsylvania a horrific example. Many people read the news about Penn \nState over the last couple of years. In that case, children were being \nabused by an individual they were supposed to be able to trust, an \nauthority figure and other authority figures who did little about \nreporting it.\n  We know there is a significant variation across the country in the \ntypes or categories of adults who are required by law to report \nsuspected or known child abuse and neglect. Not all States require, for \nexample, camp counselors to be so-called mandated reporters under the \nlaw, meaning an adult who has a legal duty by statute to report on \nchild abuse or suspected child abuse. Some States have a long list of \ncategories, some States have shorter lists. We know not all States \nrequire camp counselors or even coaches to report instances. So we need \nto do something about that. That is why I have introduced legislation \nto directly address it.\n  The Speak Up to Protect Every Abused Kid Act, which is more simply \nknown as the Speak Up Act, would require all States to pass and enforce \na law requiring adults with a professional responsibility to children \nto report instances of known or suspected child abuse in order for \nStates to receive funding through the Child Abuse Prevention and \nTreatment Act, the so-called CAPTA legislation, the Federal statute \nthat focuses on child abuse and neglect prevention and response.\n  So if they are going to have the benefit of those Federal dollars, \nthey have to do more to protect children. That is what we are saying to \nStates. The legislation will close a loophole that allows abusers to \nget away with heinous crimes and emphasize the responsibility of all \nadults to protect children from abuse and neglect.\n  States have a wide variety of standards, as I mentioned, for whom \nthey designate as so-called mandated reporters. Some States require all \nmedical professionals to be mandated reporters. Others only specify \ncertain types of health care providers. Under the Speak Up Act, States \nwould have to require all of these adults to be mandated reporters or \nforfeit their Federal funding under the so-called CAPTA Act, the Child \nAbuse and Prevention Treatment Act.\n  The Speak Up Act also requires that these mandated reporters give \ntheir reports directly to State authorities responsible for \ninvestigating child abuse and neglect. In some States, and in \nPennsylvania I am pleased to report, there is a unified system of \nreporting, which is called the ChildLine, that accepts all reports. In \nthis case, in Pennsylvania, one could call an 800 number and report \nchild abuse and neglect.\n  I have asked myself--and I am not sure we will ever get the answer to \nthis--what if--not only in a random set of cases but in the case of \nPenn State--one adult or more than one adult had called an 800 number \nearly in the case history, even with a suspicion, reason, or grounded \nin fact, but a suspicion or direct evidence of child abuse? What if \nthey had called that number. Could children have been protected; could \nchild abuse have been prevented?\n  I don't know the answer, but I think if more people use that kind of \nmethod, they might be able to prevent a lot more cases of abuse.\n  Other States may require reporting to law enforcement or so-called \nchild protective agencies.\n  Finally, the act itself, the Speak Up Act, closes a loophole in an \nexisting law that can leave children in danger because their abuser is \nfrom another State or because a child was visiting another State when \nhe or she was abused.\n  In the summer this becomes especially relevant when children may be \nattending camps where they are not just going back and forth to camp--a \ncamp where they stay overnight, night after night, or other programs \nwhere they might have access to or be enrolled in, I should say, \nanother State. Under the Speak Up Act, we make it clear that the State \nwhere the incident occurred has the obligation to investigate the \nincident, and other States must help if necessary. So that gives a \nfurther protection to children that is not in the law today.\n  The legislation in the Speak Up Act will provide as well standard \nreporting requirements across all States while still allowing States to \ngo beyond what is required if they seek to do that.\n  I don't know why we don't have this in law already. Why should we \nhave a variety of measures in place to protect children? We should \nstandardize that. Every State should meet a certain minimum standard \nwhen it comes to protecting children. If States want to add people to \ntheir mandated reporter list, require more adults or more categories of \nadults to be listed, then they could do that, but there should be a \nstandard reporting requirement across the country.\n  So as we begin the summer, I urge adults who work with children to \nremember their responsibility to speak up and to act to protect \nchildren, to make sure they know how to report abuse and neglect, if \nnecessary.\n  If you are in that category of mandated reporters already, you \nobviously not only have a legal duty to report, but I think you have a \nresponsibility to find out today how you report, what method will you \nemploy, what resource will you access to report instances of child \nabuse or suspected child abuse. But even if you are not sure you are in \nthat category of mandated reporter, if you are an adult and you have an \nobligation to or your job entails working with children, I believe you \nhave an obligation to find out not only when you are a mandated \nreporter but how you can report suspected cases of abuse and neglect.\n  Of course, if you are an adult, it may not be legally required. It \ndoesn't, of course, foreclose the possibility that you could and should \nreport instances of abuse and neglect, even if you don't have a legal \nduty.\n  I believe every adult has some kind of duty--maybe not in law but \ncertainly a duty as a citizen and as an adult--to be vigilant, to keep \nyour eyes open, and to focus your attention on protecting children. We \nall have an abiding obligation.\n  This is a time of the year when children have a lot of time away from \nschool, and they have a lot of enjoyment in the summer. We should make \nsure we are being very vigilant, though, at this time of the year to \nspeak up and to protect our children.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Bowen Nomination\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. I will take just a moment. Our colleague from Louisiana \nwas on the floor a while ago referring to one of the nominees we will \nhave coming up for a cloture vote in a moment to the Commodities \nFutures Trading Commission, which is so significant.\n  I want to correct a few things in the record for my colleagues and \nfirst remind everyone that Ms. Bowen, who will be the nominee in front \nof us, was unanimously confirmed by the Senate to be a director of the \nSecurities Investor Protection Corporation, where she has honorably \nserved, after 25 years of representing clients in complex financial \ntransactions as a partner of a major international firm.\n  The issue that has been raised on the floor relates to a decision \nthat was made unanimously by the board she\n\n[[Page S3353]]\n\nchairs that relates to a particular case where there is no question \nthat there were citizens who were ripped off in a Ponzi scheme, the \nStanford Ponzi scheme, in fact.\n  The question that came before this board that covers certain kinds of \nlosses is whether what happened is something that could be covered \nunder this particular entity, the Securities Investor Protection \nCorporation.\n  Based on legal advice, outside counsel, and review, the board \nunanimously looked at this and said, unfortunately, due to law--which \nwas written by Congress--this particular board could not cover the \nfraud victims in this particular case.\n  This subsequently went to the Federal District Court for the District \nof Columbia, which concluded the current law does not authorize SIPC to \ncover these particular fraud victims. This has now gone on to the Court \nof Appeals.\n  SIPC and Ms. Bowen have indicated that if the Court of Appeals rules \nin favor of the victims, they are more than happy to include them and \nto reimburse them for the terrible situation they all found themselves \nin. This is a legal question of whether this particular fund is allowed \nto reimburse these particular victims of fraud. There have been over \n9,000 victims who have been reimbursed through this fund in a lot of \ndifferent situations, but it is a legal question.\n  The way this has been interpreted by our colleague from Louisiana--\nthat somehow this is something personal that Ms. Bowen is involved in \nto try to stop these people, these victims, from being able to be \nreimbursed and made whole--is absolutely false. Again, this is an issue \nin the court. If the court rules in favor of those who were victims of \nthis Ponzi scheme, then the group, the agency, the Securities Investor \nProtection Corporation, has indicated they will move forward and \ninclude them under the scope of their responsibility for reimbursement.\n  Certainly what happened to people in this situation is terrible. I \nunderstand their concerns and wanting to find a way to be able to be \nmade whole. But this is a legal question that was unanimously decided \nby a board of directors, of which Ms. Bowen is now the chair, it was \nrecommended by outside counsel, and it was also something that was \nupheld by the Federal district court. It is now in the Court of \nAppeals. If the Court of Appeals changes and reverses the lower court, \nthen they will act accordingly.\n  We should not have the situation where a very qualified member and \nnominee for this very important oversight agency, the futures industry, \nwould be held responsible or somehow be caught up in the politics. I \nappreciate the legitimate concerns, but to lay those at the feet of \nthis woman, at this point, simply is not fair.\n  Again, she was, on her qualifications, unanimously confirmed by the \nSenate once already, and I would urge colleagues to join together to \nsupport moving forward on this nomination with the cloture vote and \nultimately to support her.\n  She has strong support throughout the country, is known for standing \nup for victims, and will play a very important role and be a very \nimportant voice going forward with the Commodities Futures Trading \nCommission.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp).

The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                                EPA Rule\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, 17 years ago the Senate voted on something \ncalled a sense-of-the-Senate resolution designed to protect American \nworkers and their families from misguided policy with regard to \nCO2 regulations. Of course, CO2, or carbon \ndioxide, is a necessary element of life, and plant life depends on \nCO2 for photosynthesis, which helps make them green. To hear \nsome of the psuedoscientists talk about CO2 here in \nWashington, you would think it was poison. Suffice it to say, 17 years \nlater the Obama administration is trying to enact similar legislation \nthat was rejected 17 years ago by the Senate in that sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution.\n  Back in 1997 Members of the Senate were concerned that the Clinton \nadministration might sign a global climate change treaty that imposed \nhigher costs on the United States while exempting developing countries \nsuch as China or India. These concerns turned out to be well-founded. \nThe Clinton administration did indeed sign such a treaty known as the \nKyoto Protocol in December of that year, but it never got around to \nhaving it ratified here in the Senate largely because of a unanimous \nresolution this Chamber passed several months earlier.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate resolution I alluded to a moment ago was \nvoted on in July 1997, and it received 95 votes in favor and 0 votes \nopposed. Ninety-five Senators expressed their opposition to any climate \nchange agreement that would result in serious harm to the economy of \nthe United States. They also rejected any agreement that failed to \ninclude other countries, and that is for good reasons I will explain in \na moment.\n  The message sent by these 95 Senators--a unanimous vote in the \nSenate--is pretty clear. It makes absolutely no sense for America to \nadopt job-killing carbon regulations while CO2 emissions \nfrom developing countries continue to skyrocket and are not subjected \nto the same restrictions.\n  Don't just take my word for it. Listen to what one of the most \nprominent supporters of the 1997 resolution, Secretary of State John \nKerry--at the time he was the junior Senator of Massachusetts--had to \nsay:\n\n       It's just common sense that if you are really going to do \n     something to effect global climate change, and you are going \n     to do it in a fair-minded way . . . we need to have an \n     agreement that does not leave enormous components of the \n     world's contributors and future contributors of this problem \n     out of the solution.\n\n  In effect, what he was saying was: Why would America do this to \nitself and throw a wet blanket on job creation and economic growth when \nother countries were going to continue to produce CO2 \nunabated?\n  One of the cosponsors of this resolution was the late Democratic \nSenator Robert Byrd. The Presiding Officer knows Senator Byrd and his \nlegacy very well. While explaining his opposition to the Kyoto-style \nclimate deals, Senator Byrd said:\n\n       I don't think the Senate should support a treaty that \n     requires only half of the world . . . to endure the economic \n     costs of reducing emissions while developing countries are \n     free to pollute the atmosphere, and in so doing, siphon off \n     American industries.\n\n  Another cosponsor was Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, who was then \nthe junior Senator from Nebraska. He described the likely consequences \nof Kyoto-style agreements in these terms:\n\n       As industries flee the United States and other \n     industrialized countries, they would re-establish themselves \n     in developing countries that have much weaker environmental \n     standards than our own.\n\n  I have just one more point about the Kyoto Protocol, which was \nunanimously voted down, in essence, 17 years ago.\n  A year after that, in 1998, there was a then-unknown Illinois State \nsenator who voted on legislation that denounced Kyoto and prohibited \nState regulation of greenhouse gases in Illinois. If you guessed it was \nBarack Obama, you would be right.\n\n[[Page S3355]]\n\n  One of the State senators voting in favor of the bill, condemning \nKyoto, and banning State regulations of greenhouse gases in Illinois \nwas Barack Obama. President Obama voted for legislation that explicitly \nrejected the type of CO2 regulations that he is now trying \nto impose on the entire U.S. economy.\n  Yesterday I discussed some of the costs of those regulations, how \nenormous they would be, and how they would disproportionately fall on \nthe poor and middle class in our country. The truth is most of the \nburden of higher energy costs would fall on retired people, seniors, \nand people on a fixed income.\n  In my State our electricity capacity is regularly strained due to the \nhot August summers. People in my State depend on their air conditioners \nfor safety. The threat of limited access to electricity, or higher \ncosts that people can't afford, literally threatens their health and \nsafety, and certainly their welfare. Lost jobs, lost wages, higher \nutility rates, and tighter family budgets are the inevitable \nconsequences of this proposed EPA rule that was announced late last \nweek.\n  For that matter, the EPA has also proposed another rule on new \npowerplants that would impede technological innovation. Several of my \nDemocratic colleagues expressed their deep concern about the additional \nEPA rule in a recent letter to the President. These seven Democrats \nnoted that ``American technology providers would be incentivized to \nstop research and innovation in coal combustion, further delaying \ndomestic development of pioneering new technologies that could be \nexported to improve plants around the world.''\n  Earlier today one of these Democrats who signed the letter, and \nhappens to be the Presiding Officer at this time, said the Obama \nadministration was ``working against us'' on CO2 \nregulations, and he described the EPA proposals as ``unreasonable and \nunacceptable.'' This is obviously not a partisan issue by any means.\n  Any regulation that is this costly is almost impossible to justify \nunless it was to have clear benefits that outweighed those costs. \nPresident Obama's EPA rule can't lay claim to having enormous benefits \nin spite of these huge costs.\n  Even if you agree with my friends about the long-term risks posed by \nrising CO2 emissions, and that this sort of regulation is \njustified, the projected growth of global emissions over the coming \ndecades has almost nothing to do with America and almost everything to \ndo with developing countries such as China and India.\n\n  Indeed, our emissions have gone down over recent history. Some of \nthat has been due to the renaissance of natural gas, which burns \ncleaner. But the fact is that anything we would do would be confined to \nthe United States and our economy and would have no impact whatsoever \non developing countries such as China and India. Indeed, China--by a \nvery wide margin--is already the planet's largest CO2 \nemitter. The U.S. Government estimates that China alone will account \nfor nearly half of all growth in worldwide emissions between 2010 and \n2040.\n  In short, nothing America does by itself or to itself will stop \nglobal emissions from rising. In fact, even if we could magically \nreduce our own emissions to zero over the next quarter century, \nworldwide emissions would still increase significantly without major \nreductions in China, India, and other developing countries.\n  Yet, despite all these costs to American workers and American \nfamilies--literally a threat due to the lack of grid capacity in places \nsuch as Texas because of high-priced energy--President Obama is moving \nahead with this massive new energy tax that is effectively, in the \nwords of our colleague from Louisiana, all pain and no gain, and he is \nright.\n  To put this in context, I think it is important that anyone who \nhappens to be listening understands a few points.\n  No. 1, regardless of what the President calls it, the proposed EPA \nrule is indeed a massive new national energy tax, one that will affect \nall workers, all consumers, and all families in America.\n  No. 2, the reason it is being enacted via the regulatory process is \nbecause Members of the Senate rejected it 4 years ago at a time when \neven our Democratic colleagues had a supermajority. In other words, \nthey could have done it when they wanted to when the Senate controlled \nthe White House and both Chambers of Congress, but they chose not to do \nit then.\n  No. 3, it fits with a broader and deeply disturbing matter. Time and \ntime again, the President has used unelected bureaucrats to skirt the \nnormal legislative progress and override the will of Congress and avoid \nany kind of electoral accountability.\n  The point is this: When the President, who is not going to stand for \nelection again, gets the Environmental Protection Agency to issue \nregulations, those bureaucrats don't run for election. The American \npeople--my constituents in Texas and the Presiding Officer's \nconstituents in West Virginia--can't vote the rascals out of office, so \nthere is no accountability in the system. That is what the President \nwas bragging about when he said: I have a phone, and I have a pen. He \nwas effectively saying he was going to do it alone, and that is what he \nis trying to do here.\n  The result has been a misguided explosion of burdensome and onerous \nregulations, and those have a cost to our economy. The last quarter--\nthe last 3 months of the year--we learned that instead of the economy \ngrowing in a way that will create more jobs and reduce unemployment, \nthe economy actually contracted. It shrank by a full percentage point. \nOne of the reasons why the economy shrank is because of overly \nburdensome regulations where there is no cost-benefit analysis, much \nless any cost-benefit calculus whatsoever.\n  According to one estimate, between 2009 and 2013, Federal regulatory \ncosts increased by nearly $500 billion--a truly astonishing figure. Not \nonly have these regulations proven to be onerous and unwieldy, they \nhave been implemented by agencies that are hopelessly incompetent at \nhandling even basic responsibilities.\n  As my friend the junior Senator from Oklahoma said a few years ago:\n\n       It is absurd to allow an agency as incompetent as the EPA \n     to exercise vast new powers when they can't manage less \n     complex tasks. If the EPA can't train 250,000 contractors to \n     manage lead paint rules . . . why should we expect them to \n     regulate the energy-consuming processes used in every sector \n     of the economy?\n\n  If this competence question of a huge bureaucracy sounds familiar, I \nthink we are now learning that when the hubris overcomes the good \njudgment of leaders here in Washington and decides to take over one-\nsixth of the economy, which is our health care sector, you get \nObamaCare and the disaster that has proven to be in terms of its \nimplementation.\n  None of the essential promises that were made about how it would \nactually work have been kept. In other words, if you like what you \nhave, you can keep it, the price would go down $2,500 for a family of \nfour, and, yes, you can keep your doctor. None of those promises have \nproven to be true. Yet those were the promises upon which ObamaCare was \npassed. Now we see the administration make additional extravagant \npromises that can only be borne out of hubris based on what we have \nseen as the implementation of ObamaCare.\n  Not only have these regulations proved to be onerous, they are not \ngoing to work the way the administration predicts, except we are pretty \nsure it will kill jobs and reduce economic growth and further extend \nthis lengthy recession which has been the slowest economic recovery in \nAmerica since the Great Depression.\n  At a time of mass unemployment and historically low levels of labor \nforce participation, America needs an energy policy that is projobs and \nproworker and profamily. This new EPA rule is the opposite of that. It \nwould destroy jobs, it would hurt workers, and it would hurt consumers \nbecause it would raise the cost of living for middle-class families, \nincluding people on fixed incomes such as seniors. The fact that such a \nregulation is even being considered not in Congress but in the \nexecutive branch agencies such as the EPA, amid the weakest economic \nrecovery since the Great Depression, illustrates once again how \nmisguided this administration's priorities truly are.\n  I wish to clarify once again that the debate over President Obama's \nEPA\n\n[[Page S3356]]\n\nrule is not about the science of climate change; it is a debate about \nwhether massive regulations should be forced to pass a simple cost-\nbenefit analysis. The EPA rule clearly fails that test.\n  For all of those reasons and plenty more, we will be continuing to \nurge President Obama, from this side of the aisle but in a bipartisan \nway, to put jobs and families ahead of politics and ideology.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 9 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Burwell Nomination\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Presiding Officer \nallowing me to speak this afternoon. I am speaking in the context of a \nnomination we are likely to consider on the floor this week. I am told \non Thursday we are going to be asked to confirm the President's \nnomination of Sylvia Burwell to be the next Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services.\n  This is a very important job for a number of reasons. One reason is \nit is the job in charge of implementing the Affordable Care Act, \notherwise known as ObamaCare. Therefore, I think it is an appropriate \ntime to talk about the urgent need for us to address some of the \ncontinuing problems we have had with implementation.\n  This whole subject of ObamaCare of course has divided this Chamber \npretty sharply over the last few years. Part of the reason is it was \nforced through the Congress without a single bipartisan vote; in other \nwords, all Democratic votes and not a single Republican vote. Also, it \nwas pushed through quickly, so it resulted in a lot of problems. We \nhave seen that in terms of the implementation of ObamaCare generally, \nincluding some of the computer problems and some of the concerns people \nhave about having their health care canceled and so on.\n  I wish to speak about a specific issue with regard to implementation, \none on which I hope we could be together, that this issue would unite \nus as Republicans and Democrats--that we would take forceful action to \ndeal with it. It is an issue I think all of us agree on because it has \nto do with the taxpayers. It has to do with money that might be going \nout under ObamaCare that is not appropriate. It is ensuring that the \nsubsidy payments in ObamaCare are going to the people who actually \nqualify for them.\n  As this Chamber knows, the subsidies started to flow on January 1. \nObamaCare provides subsidies to health care premiums for low- and \nmiddle-income Americans who don't qualify for Medicaid. They are not \nunder the poverty line but are above the poverty line; actually, above \n133 percent of the poverty line. In fact, people who earn up to 400 \npercent of the poverty line are eligible for these subsidies. Recently, \nthe Kaiser Foundation estimated the number of people who can legally \nqualify for these funds and receive them is about 6.6 million \nAmericans. These subsidies can be fairly large. They can exceed $10,000 \na year, for instance, for a family of four. So we are talking about \nbillions of dollars of taxpayer money. The question is, Are they going \nto the right people? I think, because there is so much money involved, \nthe American people should be able to rightly expect that the \ngovernment has in place a system to ensure that the people who are \nsupposed to get it are getting it and to ensure that those who are \nclaiming the subsidies and receiving the taxpayer dollars are eligible \nfor them.\n  In January of this year, in response to a requirement actually \nattached to legislation that passed the Senate called the Ryan-Murray \nbudget--in response to that legislation where there was a requirement \nthat there be some sort of process put in place--the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, ensured Congress in a \nletter that HHS had ``implemented numerous systems and processes to \ncarry out'' income verification procedures.\n  So she sent a letter to the Congress saying: Don't worry about it. We \nhave it covered. We have implemented numerous systems and processes to \ncarry out income verification procedures.\n  Unfortunately, what we are finding out now--and here we are, gosh, 6 \nmonths later--is that a lot of those assurances might not be accurate, \nthat it appears as though they have not put in place these processes.\n  The Washington Post wrote a recent article that got my attention. It \ngot my attention because it reported that, in fact, no permanent system \nhas been built that is capable of verifying those eligible to receive \nthe subsidies. In fact, according to internal reports that were \nobtained by the Washington Post, since no computer capability for \nverifying eligibility yet exists, Health and Human Services will begin \nsorting through all these applications by hand at some indefinite date \nin the future.\n  So this is concerning. These internal reports are not reports we have \nhere in Congress. They are not reports my constituents have. The \nAmerican people have not been able to see these reports. But the \nWashington Post got hold of some that showed, in fact, they have not \nput in this permanent system or an automated system of any kind that \nyou would normally expect with this kind of money going out the door.\n  So here we are in 2014 and the U.S. Government is going to comb \nthrough, I guess by hand, literally millions of documents of people who \nare claiming subsidies--by hand--and try to figure out how to deal with \nit. It is like something out of a bad movie, but it is not a laughing \nmatter because the consequences are significant.\n  The Washington Post reports that the government may already be paying \nincorrect subsidies to more than 1 million people, although that is \njust a best guess. These fraudulent payments--if that is accurate--of \ncourse, would then be costing the American taxpayers millions, maybe \nbillions of dollars.\n  When news broke about this problem last month through this story in \nthe Washington Post, I wrote a letter to Secretary Sebelius at the \nHealth and Human Services agency. I also wrote it to the IRS \nCommissioner because the obvious thing to do would be to check the \ninformation that is given with the IRS records to see whether the 1040 \nmatches up with what you are saying your income is.\n  In the letter, I said: Can you give us the answers about these very \nserious questions that have been raised, and can you tell us what the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services is doing about this?\n  I asked for a response by June 1. It is now past June 1 and I have \nreceived nothing but silence in response. That is why I have come to \nthe floor today to say, look, I do not think anybody on either side of \nthe aisle in the Senate thinks this is acceptable. Some on the other \nside might say: Well, we are more concerned about people who are not \ngetting the subsidies they are eligible for because the verification is \nnot in place to help them. That is fine. The point is that the \nsubsidies ought to go to the people who are eligible. Whether they are \noverstating or understating their income and therefore made eligible or \nnot eligible, there ought to be a system in place. That is a minimum \nrequirement, I would think, that we would all want to have in place to \nbe able to, again, save these payments from going out in a fraudulent \nway, to the tune of what could be billions of dollars. I cannot imagine \nanyone thinks the current situation is acceptable.\n  So we are going to see if HHS gets its act together and gets serious \nabout enforcing these rules. I think it is going to require new \nleadership. That is why I am hoping that with the nomination and debate \nthis week of Sylvia Burwell to be the next Secretary of HHS, we can \nhave a discussion about this issue and that she can provide some of \nthat new leadership from the top to ensure that indeed we do have \naccountability through the system and we can figure out whether this \nsituation will be resolved.\n  Unfortunately, I think it is also going to require leadership from \nthe top-top, meaning from the White House as well. This is not an \nisolated incident, unfortunately, of incompetence, I would say, on \nbehalf of our Federal Government in implementing in this case a very \ncomplicated law. We have seen this recently with the scandal\n\n[[Page S3357]]\n\nthat has involved the VA--the VA health system--another big complicated \nsystem that is obviously not working to take care of the needs of our \nveterans, who should be at the front of the line receiving the best \ncare and too often we find out are at the back of the line or maybe are \nnot on the list at all, as we saw with regard to the Phoenix VA center, \nwhere 1,700 people were just taken off the list altogether. We have \nseen it with regard to the IRS scandal, where you have the Internal \nRevenue Service actually going after Americans because of their \npolitical beliefs. Nothing could be more wrong in terms of building \nfaith and trust in our Federal system than to think that the tax \ncollector is going after folks because of their political beliefs.\n  So all these recent issues that have come up of incompetence and of \nthe government not keeping the trust are bad. It is bad even in good \ntimes. Today is not good times because already that faith in the \nFederal Government is at record lows. The faith in this institution is \nat a record low, they say.\n  It should be our responsibility to begin to rebuild that faith by \ndoing what makes sense. What is going on at HHS does not make sense. \nEveryone knows there needs to be a system in place and a permanent \nautomated system to deal with this; the same with the VA, the same with \nthe IRS. I hope we see that kind of leadership. I hope we can do that \nbecause it is the right thing to do for taxpayers, but it also rebuilds \ntrust in the American Government system. To do that is going to require \nsome serious and immediate action.\n  In the case of HHS, I call on the administration today to make good \non the promise they made in January where they said: No problem. We \nhave it covered. We have a system in place to ensure that there are not \nmispayments going out, that only folks who are eligible are going to \nget these payments.\n  In the process of Sylvia Burwell's nomination, let's raise this \nissue. Let's encourage her to show leadership at HHS to be able to deal \nwith this issue. Let's ensure that subsidies are going to the right \npeople and that taxpayers are being protected.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Student Loan Debt\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, during this last break I went back to \nIllinois and visited a lot of college campuses. I went to Augustana \nCollege, which is in the Quad Cities, and then went to Illinois State \nUniversity in Normal, IL, and then down to the University of Illinois.\n  At each one of those campuses I had a press conference about student \ndebt. Student debt today has reached a point where we have to pay close \nattention to it--and we should. The vast majority of Americans ask a \nvery basic question: Senator, is there anything you are doing today \nthat really is going to help my family? For 44 million Americans \ncurrently paying on student loans in America, legislation that is going \nto be introduced tomorrow can make a big difference.\n  I am cosponsoring a bill with Elizabeth Warren, the Senator from the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, a very bright lady who was on the \nfaculty of the Harvard Law School and who understands these issues \nbetter than almost anyone I have ever met. She is leading the way on a \ncollege student loan refinancing bill.\n  Here is what we are trying to do. We are trying to get those students \nwho are trapped in big debts with high interest rates a chance to \nrefinance their loans. How significant could it be? Well, when I met \nthese students at different schools, they told me their stories. As a \nformer college borrower myself, as a father raising three kids who went \nthrough college, it was sad. It was really sad to hear their stories \nbecause the amount of debt that students are running into now is \ndramatically higher than anything those of us who were in the early \nstages of college loans ever experienced.\n  I will not even tell you how much I borrowed because it makes me \nsound ancient. But it scared me to death when I borrowed that money to \ngo through college and law school for fear I would never pay it back. \nIt turns out I did as I was supposed to. But students today many times \nfind themselves so deeply in debt they just cannot get out from under \nit.\n  Now, I am going to set over here on this side a whole category of \nspeeches on institutions known as for-profit colleges and universities. \nThey are in a special place in my thinking. For-profit colleges and \nuniversities, who are they? The biggest one is the University of \nPhoenix. Apollo Group owns a series of universities. You have seen \ntheir advertising, I will bet.\n  They, at one point, had over 450,000 students in this University of \nPhoenix network of schools across the country. The second biggest is \nDeVry, another for-profit university out of my State of Illinois. \nKaplan is the third largest. I am going to set them over here because \nthey are in a special category. They are in a category of colleges and \nuniversities that we ought to be doing something about.\n  Three numbers tell the story about the for-profit colleges and \nuniversities. Ten percent of high school graduates go to for-profit \ncolleges and universities. Ten percent of America's high school \ngraduates go to these schools. These schools receive 20 percent of all \nFederal aid to education--10 percent of the students, 20 percent of the \nFederal aid.\n  These for-profit colleges and universities receive over $32 billion a \nyear in Federal aid. Why is it so much if they only have 10 percent of \nthe students? Because they charge so much when it comes to tuition. But \nhere is the number: 46. Forty-six percent of all student loan defaults \nare students out of for-profit colleges and universities.\n  Why? Worthless diplomas, too much debt, and the students cannot find \nwork to pay off their debts. Now, what if you have a college loan? \nThere is something you ought to know about it. You probably heard it. \nIt bears repeating. There are only a handful of debts in America that \nyou can incur as an American citizen that cannot be discharged in \nbankruptcy: taxes--you have to pay those--child support, alimony, and \ncollege student loans.\n  No matter what happens to you financially, there is virtually no way \nout. The loan you take out to go to college is with you for a lifetime. \nEven in bankruptcy you cannot discharge it. At the end of bankruptcy, \nit is still sitting there. Unfortunately, the interest is growing.\n  That is why we have to take a look at it. Let's move aside from the \nfor-profit college world, which I think is a separate issue, but a very \nimportant one, and look at the big picture. For too many Americans the \npromise of a fair shot at an affordable college education has become a \nlong shot. Average tuition and fees at 4-year public colleges has more \nthan tripled in the last 30 years. I can guarantee you that income for \nAmerican families has not tripled in that same period.\n  Tuition has outpaced inflation for 32 straight years. The cost of \neducation at all colleges and universities has been going up \ndramatically. No other major consumer expenditure, including health \ncare, can make that claim. It is not just low-income students who feel \nthe impact of these rising costs. It is middle-income students and \ntheir families as well. Since 2003 the amount of student loan debt in \nAmerica has quadrupled. Nationally there are now almost 40 million \nborrowers with more than $1 trillion in debt. There is more student \nloan debt in America today than the combined sum total of all credit \ncard debt. That is more than there is in auto loans. Only mortgages \nwould be a higher category of debt in terms of its total cost.\n  The average student loan debt increased by 49 percent between 2005 \nand 2012 to $27,850. On average, Illinois graduates in the class of \n2012 left with a little over $28,000 in debt, but their individual \ndebts, as you might guess, are much higher; and 1.7 million Illinoisans \nhave outstanding student loan debt out of a population of about 12.5 \nmillion.\n\n[[Page S3358]]\n\n  What effect does $1 trillion in student loan debt have on the \nAmerican economy. The Federal Reserve warns us that it is threatening \ncurrent and future economic growth. The student loan debt crisis has \nbeen compared to the mortgage crisis we went through 8 or 9 years ago. \nIt is ingrained in American culture that each successive generation \nwants to do better than the previous one. But student loan debt is \ncrippling middle-class growth for younger generations.\n  Currently the median household wealth of people my age, in the 55-to-\n65 bracket, is 44 times the net worth of the median household of people \nyounger than 35. People under the age of 35 are struggling. This is \nhistorically unprecedented and has a lot to do with the student loan \ndebt.\n  I have heard from so many people in my State about this issue. They \nsay student loan debt is preventing them from buying a car, borrowing \nany more money to finish their education, having their own place to \nlive, getting married and, once married, having children. I have met \ncouples who have said: We made a family decision; no kids until we pay \noff the student loans; I am not sure we will be able to pay them off in \ntime to make that decision.\n  Think about that for a second. They cannot even start a family \nbecause of the student debts and the fear that they are going to \ndefault on them. I heard it firsthand back in Illinois last week. One \nstudent I met, Mabinty Tarawallie, is struggling with student loan debt \neven though she has done everything right. She immigrated to the United \nStates from Africa when she was 11 years old. Her family was very poor \nbut they told her: You have to have an education.\n  She graduated from high school, went to a local community college--a \ngood place to start--and completed her undergraduate degree in \nsociology at the University of Illinois.\n  She told me she wanted to help others pick themselves up out of \npoverty as she did, so she went to graduate school for a master's \ndegree in social work. She recently graduated from a program at the \nUniversity of Illinois. Although she was able to get through her \nundergraduate years without much debt, she spread out her graduate \nstudies over 3 years as she was raising her family of three kids.\n  She had one graduate assistantship, but she had to pay for the rest \nwith loans. To compound this problem, her husband, another University \nof Illinois graduate student in education, also has student loans. \nTogether, Mabinty and her husband, now that they have completed their \ndegrees, have a debt of $150,000. One wants be a social worker and the \nother wants to be a teacher.\n  Now she worries about how her family is going to be able to cope, \nwith debt three times the annual salary she might receive as a social \nworker. The irony is even as a college degree becomes harder to afford \nfor the middle class, it is more important than ever that people get \neducated, trained, and skilled for better jobs. Only college-educated \nworkers have had wage gains in the past 30 years. If you don't go the \ncollege route, your chances of success are diminished dramatically. \nThat is why we want to address these serious issues.\n  This bill I am talking about, the one we are going to introduce \ntomorrow, will give students with college student loan debt who are \ncurrent on their loans an opportunity to refinance.\n  I talked to Mabinty and other students. It meant for her that her \ninterest rate would come down from 6.8 percent to 3.8 percent. If you \nhave ever gone out to get a mortgage or you know somebody who did, they \nwill explain to you that 3 percent of your interest rate is a big deal. \nIf you can get your interest rate reduced by 3 percent, your chances of \npaying off the principal are going to be a lot better.\n  This bill I have cosponsored with Elizabeth Warren, Jack Reed, and \nothers is called the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act. \nIt will help millions of current borrowers refinance their Federal or \nprivate student loans into these lower Federal interest rates. Those \nwith Federal loans can refinance into lower rates, the same rates \navailable to students who took out new loans this year.\n  Under the Warren bill, those with private loans--many of whom have \nsky-high interest rates and are facing collection agencies beating up \non them--can refinance with Federal loans with lower rates and strong \nconsumer protection. Refinancing, incidentally, is fully paid for. This \nis a point I want to make, because this is where we lose the other side \nof the aisle. This is where we can't find bipartisan cosponsorship for \nrefinancing college loans.\n  Here is how we pay for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Most of us have heard the name Warren Buffett, one of the \nwealthiest men in America. He raised the question a few years ago: Why, \nin America, is my income tax rate as a multimillionaire lower than my \nsecretary's income tax rate? There is an explanation in the Tax Code, \nbut it isn't a very good one. Warren Buffett said I should be paying \nmore than she is paying. So we have come up with something called the \nBuffet rule, which says if you are in the multimillionaire category, \nyou are going to pay a higher income tax rate than your secretary.\n  What a radical idea that is. I am just kidding. I think it is \nreasonable, and that is how we pay for refinancing college loans.\n  The problem is that we go to the other side of the aisle and say: We \nwant to refinance college loans. It is going to take some money to do \nit. We will put in the Buffett rule so millionaires pay more in their \nincome taxes. They say: We don't want any part of it. We will not \nincrease taxes on anybody.\n  Well, by taking that position, they are sticking 44 million Americans \nwith college loan debt at higher interest rates and all the problems \nthey generate.\n  Which is better, that millionaires pay a little more so working \nfamilies across America have a fair shot of paying off their college \nloans or saying we are not going to touch the Tax Code for any reason \nwhatsoever--and isn't it a darn shame for these students and their \nfamilies.\n  Well, it is pretty obvious to me what we should be doing.\n  I met Shiann Poshard last week at Illinois State University. She \ngraduated with a teaching degree and about $30,000 in student debt. She \nhas a job, and she is going to be teaching in public schools in Eureka, \nIL. Even so, on a first-year teaching salary--with an upcoming wedding, \nincidentally--her student loan debt will undoubtedly be a burden. If \nshe is allowed to refinance her loan, which she took out at 6.8 \npercent, she could cut her interest rate almost in half. That will make \na big difference.\n  Tomorrow, when this legislation is introduced, I hope anyone who has \na family, where they have borrowed money for college, who has a son or \ndaughter deep in debt and wondering how they are going to get out from \nunder it, contact your Senator or your Congressman and ask them: Are \nyou going to be part of this college student loan refinancing effort?\n  I hope they will say yes. We need bipartisan support to help these \nstudents out of the debt they are facing today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to the vote on the confirmation of the \nnomination.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to yield back all time on the \npending nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Sharon Y. Bowen, of New York, to be a Commissioner of the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission for a term expiring April 13, 2018?\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. On this vote I have a pair with the Senator from New \nJersey [Mr. Booker]. If he were present and voting, he would vote \n``yea.'' If I were permitted to vote, I would vote ``nay;'' therefore, \nI withhold my vote.\n\n[[Page S3359]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, the Senate has now approved three \nnominations to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The CFTC is an \nimportant independent agency with a mission to provide oversight of the \nfutures, swaps, and options markets, protecting market participants \nfrom fraud and manipulation. The agency ensures safety and soundness of \nthe market and makes sure that hedgers, such as farmers and ranchers or \nmanufacturing companies, can manage risks appropriately, and there \nneeds to be confidence in those markets and in the oversight of those \nmarkets. The Commissioners confirmed today will not only help protect \nthose markets but finish the implementation of reforms contained in the \nWall Street Reform Act.\n  Earlier today I spoke about Sharon Bowen's qualifications, and I was \nvery pleased to see the Senate approve her nomination. Now I wish to \ntalk about the other two CFTC Commissioners appointed by the President \nwho were also confirmed by the Senate just a few minutes ago.\n  For the role of CFTC Chairman, President Obama has selected Timothy \nMassad. Mr. Massad has a sterling record of public service. Three years \nago he was confirmed unanimously by the Senate to serve as the \nDepartment of Treasury's Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability. \nIn that position Mr. Massad oversaw the winddown of the Troubled Asset \nRelief Program. He devoted himself to helping homeowners who were \nstruggling to stay in their homes while helping communities where \nvacant houses were a blight to neighborhoods. It is a tribute to Mr. \nMassad's leadership that the banks that benefited from TARP have repaid \nnearly every dollar.\n  At the Treasury Department Mr. Massad not only made good on his \nresponsibility to ensure a positive return to American taxpayers, he \ndid so with complete transparency.\n  During Mr. Massad's testimony before the Agriculture Committee, he \nemphasized that need for strong enforcement to ensure public confidence \nin our markets, which is so very important. He demonstrated an \nunderstanding of how markets must provide hedging and price discovery \nfor end users.\n  Mr. Massad demonstrated that he will be an advocate for strong \ninternational regulatory standards in a global derivatives market. \nThroughout the course of his career in the private sector and then in \nthe public sector, Mr. Massad has earned a reputation as a consensus \nbuilder, a tireless worker, and a protector of the public interest. I \nhave no doubt Mr. Massad will continue his excellence in his role as \nCFTC Chair.\n  The second nominee chosen by President Obama is Christopher \nGiancarlo. Since 2000, Mr. Giancarlo has worked in companies that \nfocused on swaps markets regulated by the CFTC. For most of that time \nMr. Giancarlo has been a senior executive at the interdealer broker, \nGFI Group.\n  At his confirmation hearing, Mr. Giancarlo talked about how the \nfutures and swaps markets must serve the needs of farmers and other end \nusers. He recognizes the central role that commodities play in our \nNation's economy.\n  Like Mr. Massad Mr. Giancarlo understands the important lessons of \nthe financial crisis. For example, in his remarks Mr. Giancarlo \nemphasized the value of transparency in the swaps markets. He agrees \nwith the provisions in the Wall Street Reform Act that allow robust \noversight of U.S. swaps intermediaries, while at the same time Mr. \nGiancarlo talked about the importance of balanced regulatory oversight \nin open and competitive markets. In short, Mr. Giancarlo is a \npragmatist. This is a quality that will serve him well as a CFTC \nCommissioner.\n  I congratulate not only Mr. Giancarlo but Mr. Massad and Ms. Bowen on \ntheir confirmations today. I have every expectation that they will work \nwell with all of the stakeholders involved in the vitally important \nwork of the CFTC. This will ensure that CFTC is fulfilling its mission \nof protecting the public, which is the bottom line.\n  In Congress we must also do our part to protect these markets and \nmake sure the CFTC has the resources it needs to do its job, and that \nmeans having both the staff and technology in place so the CFTC can \nperform its work. We have given them so much more work with the new \nlegislation, so we need to make sure they have the resources to do what \nwe have asked them to do.\n  The agency must be able to keep up with the markets they are \noverseeing. They can't do that if they don't have the funding they \nneed, and this will be a priority for me as we seek to update the CFTC \nand its abilities to protect consumers and market participants. We have \n21st century markets and we need a 21st century CFTC to oversee them.\n  The Senate Agriculture Committee is beginning its work on a CFTC \nreauthorization bill. The approval of today's nominees and our upcoming \nwork on this legislation will help make sure the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission is fully empowered to do everything that we and the \npublic are relying on them to do.\n  Again, I congratulate all of those confirmed today. I thank my \ncolleagues for their support, and I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/03/senate-section/article/S3361-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Madam President, it is no secret that communities across \nthe country are struggling to break the cycle of addiction to powerful \nopioids, including heroin. We are now seeing addiction creep into \nneighborhoods and communities of all sizes, both rural and urban. My \nhome State of Vermont has not been spared, and it in fact has attracted \nmuch attention for its struggles with addiction. However in many ways, \nVermont is ahead of much of the Nation when it comes to responding to \nthe opioid epidemic. We long ago recognized the problem, and \ncommunities in Vermont have spent the better part of a decade coming \ntogether to address opioid addiction.\n  In March I had the privilege of chairing a field hearing of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee in Rutland, VT. It was the fourth time in \nthe past 6 years that I brought the committee to Vermont to explore \nissues related to drug abuse. I heard powerful testimony discussing how \ncommunities are responding to addiction, rethinking decades-old \napproaches to prevention, treatment, and law enforcement efforts. Dr. \nHarry Chen, the Vermont Department of Health commissioner and a career \nemergency room physician, described what it means to recognize\n\n[[Page S3362]]\n\naddiction as a public health issue, expanding evidence-based prevention \nand treatment services to all corners of the State.\n  Vermont hospitals are also rethinking best practices in light of this \nepidemic. Recently, the Office of National Drug Control Policy \npublished an article entitled ``How a Vermont Hospital Fights the \nAmerican Opioid Epidemic.'' The article was authored by Dr. Stephen \nLeffler, the chief medical officer at Fletcher Allen Health Care in \nBurlington, VT. In the article, Dr. Leffler describes how Fletcher \nAllen is on the leading edge of modernizing health care practices to \nminimize abuse and addiction, while still providing necessary pain \nmanagement. The hospital provides clear, standardized protocols for \ntreating pain, defines a maximum daily dosage as guided by the latest \nresearch, and measures patients' risk for addiction. This approach \nensures consistency in treatment and may help to stem the flow of \nprescription opioid users from sliding into addiction.\n  The approach described in Dr. Leffler's article could potentially \nserve as a model for the rest of country, and I would encourage other \nStates grappling with addiction to look at what Fletcher Allen is doing \nin Burlington. If we are to find legislative solutions that may finally \nbreak the cycle of opioid addiction, then surely we must carefully \nconsider promising, novel approaches such as this. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Dr. Leffler's article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     [From The Office of National Drug Control Policy, May 9, 2014]\n\n       How a Vermont Hospital Fights the American Opioid Epidemic\n\n                      (By Dr. Stephen M. Leffler)\n\n       Over the course of my more than 20 years as an emergency \n     physician, I have seen thousands of patients with painful \n     conditions. During that same time, I have witnessed the \n     remarkable evolution of modern pain medication--its potential \n     and its pitfalls. We can now help patients manage both short-\n     term and long-term pain. Yet, while medications--particularly \n     opioids--have helped us heal patients, we have also seen \n     their detrimental effects, chief among them addiction.\n       Opioids can be very helpful for patients with conditions \n     such as broken bones and kidney stones, and they are also \n     useful after many types of surgery. They may also be used to \n     treat those with chronic pain--people who experience pain \n     carrying out normal, daily functions of life that others take \n     for granted. Used for short periods of time at the proper \n     dosage, opioids are safe medications and excellent choices \n     for a wide variety of acute painful conditions.\n       While opioids work well for pain control, they have a \n     number of potentially serious side effects: They can hinder \n     or stop breathing, cause constipation, result in drowsiness, \n     and act as central nervous system depressants. That's why \n     your doctor tells you it is not safe to drive after taking \n     opioids.\n       Another devastating side effect is addiction. The body \n     develops a tolerance to opioids and, after only a couple of \n     weeks, may require higher doses to control pain. Over time, \n     increasing doses of opioids may be needed to manage the same \n     level of pain. Patients may develop dependence--their bodies \n     will crave it. They will exhibit a strong desire or \n     compulsion to take the drug for reasons beyond simple pain \n     control. At this stage, if they stop taking opioids, they \n     will experience withdrawal. This is how opioid use can lead \n     to addiction and all its inherent problems for the individual \n     and society.\n       As providers, our responsibility is to carefully manage the \n     side effects of opioid therapy. Dependence, tolerance, and \n     addiction must be discussed with patients, and a careful \n     well-planned strategy is crucial for their extended use of \n     opioids.\n       That is exactly what we are doing at Fletcher Allen Health \n     Care in Burlington, Vermont. Recently, providers and pain \n     management experts from multiple specialties (Anesthesia, \n     Emergency Medicine, Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, and \n     Surgery) converged to standardize how we care for patients \n     with painful conditions and to develop best practices for our \n     patients.\n       What did we do? Here is an overview:\n       Systems Approach. We built standardized protocols so that \n     patients will get similar treatment in various settings. We \n     believe this standardization will help our patients and \n     providers. There will be clear, defined expectations and \n     goals for treating our patients' pain.\n       New Rules & Tools. We use processes and tools such as pain \n     agreements with patients and surveys to assess how patients \n     are functioning with their pain and to measure their risk for \n     addiction.\n       Defining Maximum Daily Dosage. We are one of the first \n     hospitals in the country to define the maximum daily dose of \n     opioids. Research shows that beyond certain doses, patients \n     experience no additional benefit. We know that very high \n     doses of opioids increase the risk of dangerous side effects \n     but offer no additional pain control.\n       This approach helps ensure that we are more reliable and \n     consistent in our approach to pain in our patients and that \n     our patients will know what to expect from their providers.\n       Gil Kerlikowske, then-Director of ONDCP, recently visited \n     Fletcher Allen Health Care to discuss our new approach and \n     tools. He lauded our systems-level strategy and our \n     standardized protocols. I believe that the current dialogue \n     in Vermont and elsewhere on how to better manage opioid abuse \n     will be productive and lead to changes across the country in \n     how these drugs are prescribed and how acute and chronic pain \n     is managed. Fletcher Allen Health Care is on the leading edge \n     of this transition and could be a model for other health \n     systems managing this complex issue. I hope that sharing our \n     practices here is the first step toward being that model.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/03/senate-section/article/S3362-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3362-S3363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO LOIS R. HATFIELD\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, last month, Lois R. Hatfield received \nthe 2014 Business Woman of the Year award from the Somerset Business \nand Professional Women's Club. I wish to honor this exemplary citizen \nand to recognize her tremendous career as an educator.\n  Lois took her first job in 1951, teaching grades one through eight at \na one-room school house called Union Ridge School in the Jabez portion \nof Wayne County. She continued to devote herself to education in \nKentucky for the remainder of her career, which lasted over 60 years.\n  Her accomplishments over the years are many. In 1978, she became the \nprincipal of her alma mater, Nancy Elementary, making her the first \nfemale principal in the history of the Pulaski County School System. \nShe has also served as president of the Alpha Delta Kappa Educational \nSorority, precinct chair for the Pulaski County Republican Party, and \npresident of the Pulaski County Republican Women's Club.\n  Officially in retirement since 1997, Lois has a hard time staying \naway from the classroom and still serves when needed as a substitute \nprincipal or teacher. The fire that burns within her, propelling her to \neducate the children of our Commonwealth, has not waned in the \nslightest degree since she began her career in education.\n  Lois's dedicated commitment to her community and its children \ndeserves the praise of this body. Therefore, I ask that my U.S. Senate \ncolleagues join me in recognizing Lois R. Hatfield and her many \naccomplishments in the field of education.\n  The Commonwealth Journal recently published an article detailing Lois \nHatfield's career and her receipt of the 2014 Business Woman of the \nYear award. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Commonwealth Journal, May 11, 2014]\n\n 2014 Business Woman of the Year: Lois R. Hatfield is the Recipient of \n                               the Award\n\n       A Pulaski County woman with a passion for education is the \n     recipient of the 2014 Business Woman of the Year award from \n     the Somerset Business and Professional Women's Club.\n       Lois R. Hatfield was presented the award Tuesday at the May \n     membership meeting of the Somerset-Pulaski Chamber of \n     Commerce.\n       Hatfield was born in Faubush and graduated from Nancy High \n     School in 1947.\n       Her teaching career spans more than 60 years and with all \n     her educational achievements she has never grasped the \n     meaning of retirement.\n       Working her way through college, Hatfield received her \n     Bachelor of Arts degree in education from Eastern Kentucky \n     University in 1961 and later received her master's degree in \n     elementary education with an emphasis in early childhood \n     education from EKU in 1972.\n       She began her distinguished professional career in \n     education in 1951 when she taught grades one-eight at Union \n     Ridge School, a one-room school house in the Jabez portion of \n     Wayne County.\n       In 1958 she began working with the Pulaski County School \n     System teaching first-eighth grades at Anderson School, which \n     was eventually consolidated into Nancy Elementary.\n       In 1978, she was promoted to principal of Nancy Elementary, \n     making her the first female principal in the history of the \n     Pulaski County School System.\n       Hatfield officially ``retired'' in 1997 while serving as K-\n     6 supervisor in the Pulaski County School District, a \n     position she had held since 1988.\n       She didn't stop. Since retiring, Hatfield has served as a \n     reading consultant and homebound instructor for the Pulaski \n     County\n\n[[Page S3363]]\n\n     school system; a long-term substitute principal at numerous \n     elementary schools in Pulaski County; substitute teacher in \n     Pulaski County and Science Hill school systems; and for the \n     past 14 years she has served and continues to serve as a \n     teacher-educator for Pulaski County, Somerset, Science Hill \n     and Somerset Christian school.\n       Very active in community affairs, Hatfield is a board \n     member of Somerset-Pulaski Convention and Visitors Bureau, \n     member of Somerset Business and Professional Women's Club, \n     member and past president of Alpha Delta Kappa Educational \n     Sorority, director of Lake Cumberland Foundation, precinct \n     chair for the Pulaski County Republican Party, member of \n     Fidelis Chapter of Eastern Star, member and past president of \n     Pulaski County Republican Women's Club, member of Pulaski \n     County Lincoln Club and Mt. Pisgah Baptist Church.\n       The third of 10 children in a family of limited means, \n     Hatfield had to work while she attended Nancy High School.\n       For a time she worked and lived in Somerset, riding a bus \n     to attend high school at Nancy.

HUC was founded \nin Cincinnati in 1875 by Rabbi Isaac Wise.\n  As president, Panken will serve as the chief executive officer of \nHebrew Union College's four campuses--in Cincinnati, Jerusalem, Los \nAngeles and New York. The 12th president in HUC's 138-year history, \nPanken succeeds Rabbi David Ellenson, who served from 2001 to 2013, and \nhas been named chancellor upon his retirement.\n  Rabbi Panken, 49, of Mamaroneck, N.Y., brings an impressive record to \nHUC.

He \nhas also served as vice president for strategic initiatives, dean of \nthe New York campus and dean of students.\n  Rabbi Panken grew up on Manhattan's Upper West Side, went straight \nfrom college to a job as regional director of the North American \nFederation of Temple Youth, was ordained by Hebrew Union College, \nworked as an associate rabbi at Manhattan's Congregation Rodeph Shalom \nand earned a doctorate in Hebrew and Judaic Studies at New York \nUniversity.\n  I congratulate Aaron Panken as he begins this new chapter in his \ndistinguished career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/03/senate-section/article/S3363-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3363-S3364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          DUBUQUE COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Dubuque County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Dubuque County worth over $40 \nmillion and successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $97 million \nto the local economy.\n  My close partnership with the community and economic development \nleaders in Dubuque has resulted in community transformation. From \ncleaning up the riverfront and building the National Mississippi River \nMuseum to improving road and air access to the community to investments \nin Dubuque schools and downtown storefronts and housing, massive \nFederal investments combined with local vision and hard work has \nresulted in the revitalization of Dubuque. I am pleased that my staff \nwill be touring the community health center. I have been a long-time \nsupporter of community health centers, having worked for over two \ndecades to expand centers in Iowa.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Dubuque \nCounty has recognized this important issue by securing more than \n$550,000 for construction, renovations, and to hire additional workers \nat the Crescent Community Health Center.\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Northeast Iowa, we have worked together to grow the \neconomy by making targeted investments in important economic \ndevelopment projects including improved roads and bridges, modernized \nsewer and water systems, and better housing options for residents of \nDubuque County. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has \nleveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple \neffect of positive, creative changes. For example, working with mayors, \ncity council members, and local economic development officials in \nDubuque County, I have fought for $37 million to make highway 61 a \nfour-lane highway to expand transportation into Dubuque, $23 million to \nimprove the Mississippi River Bridge, $30 million for the southwest \narterial, $4 million for the river museum, and a $5.6 million TIGER \nGrant, helping to create jobs and expand economic opportunities.\n  Main Street Iowa: One of the greatest challenges we face--in Iowa and \nall across America--is preserving the character and vitality of our \nsmall towns and rural communities. This isn't just about economics. It \nis also about maintaining our identity as Iowans. Main Street Iowa \nhelps preserve Iowa's heart and soul by providing funds to revitalize \ndowntown business districts. This program has allowed towns like \nDubuque to use that money to leverage other investments to jumpstart \nchange and renewal. I am so pleased that the community has earned \n$438,000 through this program. These grants build much more than \nbuildings. They build up the spirit and morale of people in our small \ntowns and local communities.\n\n[[Page S3364]]\n\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Dubuque County has received more than $2.7 million in Harkin \ngrants.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency-\nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nDubuque County has received over $4.3 million to remediate and prevent \nwidespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Dubuque \nCounty's fire departments have received over $3 million for firefighter \nsafety and operations equipment and over $570,000 in Byrne Justice \nAssistance Grants.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television, but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nDubuque County, both those with and without disabilities.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Dubuque County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Dubuque \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/03/senate-section/article/S3364-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3364-S3365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          KEOKUK COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

Similarly, \nschools in Keokuk County have received funds that I designated for Iowa \nStar Schools for technology totaling $136,722.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Keokuk County has received more than $2 million \nfrom a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as \nthe methamphetamine epidemic.

Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to a \ndevoted public servant as he retires from a career at the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy and U.S. Navy. Matthew S. McCormick has dedicated \n32 years in service to our Nation, including 11 years--the last 4 as \nmanager--at the Richland Operations Office at the Hanford Nuclear \nReservation in my home State of Washington.\n  A graduate of Montana State University, Mr. McCormick began his civil \ncareer as a nuclear engineer for the U.S. Navy. After he worked on the \nNaval Reactor's Program, Mr. McCormick moved to the Department of \nEnergy serving in multiple different capacities in the Office of \nEnvironmental Management and with the Savanah River Site and Rocky \nFlats Environmental Technology Site. His time there taught him the \nvalue of environmental cleanup, and was critical to his next job as \nassistant manager for the Central Plateau in the Richland Operations \nOffice. He proved himself in this role, and was named manager of the \nRichland Operations Office in 2010.\n  It is clear to me that Washington State has benefitted from Mr. \nMcCormick's leadership. As a part of the Manhattan Project, the Hanford \nNuclear Reservation produced plutonium from 1944 until 1987. The people \nof the Tri-Cities sacrificed for the strength and safety of our Nation, \nand cleanup of the Hanford site is an ongoing challenge. Mr. McCormick \nhas shown tremendous dedication to this task, and has helped ensure \nthat the cleanup efforts at Hanford continue to move forward in a \nmeaningful and timely fashion.\n  Mr. McCormick was part of the team that set forward a path to protect \nthe Columbia River and reduce the active footprint of the Hanford site \nby focusing on cleanup projects along the shoreline under the 2015 \nVision. During his tenure, the remaining plutonium left in the \nPlutonium Finishing Plant after the Cold War was stabilized, packaged, \nand shipped offsite and out of the State of Washington. Cleanup was \ncompleted at the first reactor area--F Reactor, and a total of seven of \nnine nuclear reactors were placed in interim safe storage. Significant \nprogress has been made in protecting the Columbia River from \ncontaminated groundwater through the construction of the 200 West Pump \nand Treat Facility in the Central Plateau and three new pump and treat \nfacilities along the Columbia River. Most importantly, Mr. McCormick \nhas strived to ensure that local communities, tribal nations, and \nstakeholders know their voices are being heard.\n  Mr. McCormick's success in carrying out the cleanup mission at \nHanford was aided by his ability to build relationships, including with \nme and members of my staff. When he was made manager almost 4 years \nago, I knew that the Tri-Cities community and Washington State as a \nwhole could count on his leadership. Today I join with others \nthroughout the Pacific Northwest in thanking him for his years of \nservice. I congratulate Mr. McCormick on his retirement, and wish him \nthe best of luck in moving forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/03/senate-section/article/S3365-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING RAYMOND J.W.

In May of 1943, he \nenlisted with the Army Air Corps. He was assigned to the 8th Air Force, \n351st Bombardment Group.\n  Raymond served as a wing gunner on a B-17 bomber crew. The unit was \nstationed in England and carried out daytime bombing operations across \nWestern Europe.\n  The 351st was responsible for crippling attacks to German \ninfrastructure and even supported the Allied landing at Normandy in \nJune of 1944. After the Allies won the war, Raymond left the Army Air \nCorps as a staff sergeant in September of 1945.\n  He returned home to Pennsylvania where he and his wife Treva raised \ntheir son Raymond II and their daughter Karen. Raymond spent the next \nseveral years serving as a guard for First Sterling steel mill.

Madam President, I wish to honor Jerry Eugene \nCooney, a veteran of the U.S. Navy.\n  It is my honor to share the story of Jerry's service, because no \nveteran's story should ever go unrecognized.\n  Jerry was born in Billings, MT in 1946. After graduating from Joliet \nHigh School in 1965, Jerry joined the U.S. Navy. He underwent basic \ntraining in San Diego before being assigned to the Seabees' 21st Naval \nConstruction Regiment in Davisville, RI. In October of 1966, the \nTwenty-first went to Da Nang, Vietnam where it constructed a Marine \nbase.\n  During his tour in Vietnam, Jerry's unit was under constant enemy \nfire for which he earned a Combat Action Ribbon. Jerry returned to the \nUnited States in July of 1967. After a short leave, Jerry joined an \nadvance team to Antarctica in September of 1967 where he spent the \nsummer expanding McMurdo Station.\n  Following his stop in Antarctica, Jerry spent the remainder of his \nservice as part of a five-man exhibition team tasked with representing \nthe Seabees across the country. Jerry mustered out of Active Duty in \nSeptember of 1968 and joined the Retired Reserves.\n  In 1969, Jerry married Lori and together they had two children and \nsix grandchildren. Jerry worked for Montana-Dakota utilities for 35 \nyears before he retired in 2006.\n  Last month, in the presence of his wife Lori, it was my honor to \npresent Jerry with the National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service \nMedal with Two Bronze Stars, and Navy Unit Commendation Ribbon.\n  It was my honor to also present a Combat Action Ribbon, Antarctica \nService Medal, and a Discharge Button.\n  These decorations are small tokens, but they are powerful symbols of \ntrue\n\n[[Page S3366]]\n\nheroism, sacrifice, and dedication to service.\n  These medals are presented on behalf of a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/03/senate-section/article/S3366-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore (Mr. Leahy) reported that he had signed the \nfollowing enrolled bill, which was previously signed by the Speaker pro \ntempore of the House (Mr. Thornberry):\n\n       S. 611.

A bill to improve the access of veterans to medical services \nfrom the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes; read \nthe first time.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I rise today to introduce the Ensuring Veterans \nAccess to Care Act of 2014.\n  I thank the 16 cosponsors of this legislation, and they are Senators \nRockefeller, Begich, Shaheen, Kaine, Reed, Merkley, Casey, Whitehouse, \nBlumenthal, Heinrich, Udall of New Mexico, Schatz, Baldwin, Wyden, \nHirono, and Leahy.\n  It is safe to say there is broad bipartisan agreement among all of us \nthat every veteran in this country who enters the VA health care system \ndeserves high-quality care and deserves that care in a timely manner.\n  Overall, talking to veterans in Vermont and, in fact, throughout this \ncountry, talking to the veterans service organizations who represent \ntheir interests and reading independent studies, they all confirm that \nby and large, once veterans get into the VA health care system, the \nsystem is, in fact, quite good.\n  However, it has become clear--and I think all of us are aware of what \nhas happened in the last month--that while quality is generally good, \nthere are too many veterans throughout this country waiting too long to \naccess this care.\n  In recent years, the VA has seen a huge increase in its patient load.\n  In fact, in the last 4 years, 2 million new veterans have come into \nthe system, many of them with very complicated health care cases, \nincluding TBI, post-traumatic stress disorder, and many of the needs \nthat older veterans and older people generally have.\n  Despite this fact, it is still absolutely unacceptable that some \nveterans are forced onto long waiting lists for care, and it is totally \nintolerable--it is reprehensible--that any VA employee could be \nmanipulating data in Phoenix or anyplace else to hide how long veterans \nhave been on waiting lists to see doctors. This is an issue that must \nbe dealt with and must be dealt with rapidly and strongly.\n  These problems are real, and they have to be addressed. But they \nshould not be an excuse to walk away from a system that serves 6.5 \nmillion veterans every single year and 230,000 veterans every single \nday. This is a system we must fix, not a system that we should ditch.\n  We must focus on the underlying problems and work to transform the \nVA.\n  In general, what our legislation does is it works in three basic \nareas. No. 1, we give greater authority to the Secretary to fire \nincompetent senior officials. No. 2, we take very significant steps to \nshorten the wait times that many veterans are now experiencing. And No. \n3, we address the long-term health care needs of the VA in terms of a \nshortage of staff, doctors, and nurses that currently exists in various \nlocations around the country.\n  Let me go through some of those issues right now.\n  Several weeks ago my Republican colleague from Florida requested a \nvote on legislation that would allow VA Secretaries to immediately \nremove senior executives due to poor performance.\n  So let us be clear. I strongly support the effort to make sure that \nwe get rid of incompetent or worse senior executives at the VA. There \nis no debate about that. But here is what the debate is about. I do not \nthink it is a good idea to give the Secretary of an institution, of an \nagency that has some 300,000 employees, the ability to simply fire \nwithout any due process.\n  What I worry about is that you can move toward a situation where the \nVA health care system is politicized in a way that it should not be.\n  Let me give an example. A new President comes in with a new \nSecretary. The new Secretary says--whether it is a Democratic President \nor a Republican President--I want to get rid of 300 senior-level \nappointees and bring in 300 new people. Four years later, another \nPresident comes in--different party--and says: We are going to get rid \nof those 300 people and bring in 300 more people.\n  I do not think that provides the kind of stability that the largest \nintegrated\n\n[[Page S3370]]\n\nhealth care system in America needs or deserves. I worry about the \npoliticization.\n  Second, I worry about an instance where a whistleblower stands up who \nis critical of this or that aspect of the VA. That person could be \nfired without due process.\n  I worry there may be a situation where somebody is fired--not because \nof bad performance; maybe they are a woman and somebody doesn't like a \nwoman in that position; maybe they are gay, maybe they are black, maybe \nthey are whatever--and that person does not have any ability to appeal \nthat decision.\n  I think that is wrong. I think that is bad policy. On the other hand, \nwhat I do believe is that person should be taken out of his or her job \nimmediately, but that person must have the right to have an expedited \nappeal.\n  What our legislation does is give the person a week to bring forth \nthe appeal and gives the appropriate appeal body 3 weeks to make a \ndecision.\n  Now, we are dealing with people who are M.D.s, Ph.D.s, high-level \npeople whose professionalism is on the line. I don't think you can fire \npeople willy-nilly without giving them a chance in an expedited manner \nto express their point of view.\n  That is one difference I have with my colleague from Florida on his \nproposal.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the major concern I have; that is, how \ndo we shorten wait times? How do we make certain in those areas of the \ncountry where there are long waiting periods or where veterans may be \ngeographically a long distance away from a facility that they get \ntimely care?\n  The legislation that I have authored takes immediate action to \nprovide timely access for care for our veterans. First, this \nlegislation would standardize VA's process for providing non-VA care \nwhen the Department is unable to provide care to the veterans within \nits stated goal. As the DVA--Disabled American Veterans--pointed out in \na release today, VA must continue to be responsible for coordinating \ntheir care amongst various VA and non-VA providers. This legislation \naccomplishes that goal by providing a framework for consistent \ndecisionmaking regarding non-VA care. Under this legislation VA would \ncoordinate non-VA care by taking into account wait times for care, the \nhealth of the veteran, the distance the veteran would be required to \ntravel, as well as the veteran's choice.\n\n  This bill also addresses VA systemwide health care provider \nshortages. But in terms of the wait lists, what we say in English is: \nIf there is an unacceptable wait time or if a veteran is a long \ndistance away from a provider, we are going to allow--and we must \nallow--that veteran to get health care through a private provider, \nthrough a federally qualified community health center, through a \nDepartment of Defense military base, if that is available, through an \nIndian health service, if that is available--and that exists now in \nAlaska--and that might be expanded. So the bottom line is if there are \nwaiting lists beyond what is reasonable, the veterans in this country \nshould be able to get into non-VA health care in a timely manner, and \nthis bill does that.\n  But importantly, this bill also addresses a very significant issue \nthat I think we cannot ignore, and that is it appears to me that in \nmany parts of this country we simply don't have the doctors and nurses \nwe need when an influx of veterans is coming into the system.\n  I was talking to some very knowledgeable people today who were \ntelling me about burnout. Primary care physicians and psychiatrists are \nseeing many more patients and turnover rates are much too high. The \nlast thing we want to do is to see rapid turnover because people are \nburnt out and don't have the time to do the quality work they want to \ndo.\n  Let me quote an article that appears in the New York Times on May 29 \nwhich addresses this issue. This is what it says:\n\n       Dr. Phyllis Hollenbeck, a primary care physician, took a \n     job at the Veterans Affairs medical center in Jackson, Miss., \n     in 2008 expecting fulfilling work and a lighter patient load \n     than she had in private practice. What she found was quite \n     different: 13-hour workdays fueled by large patient loads \n     that kept growing as colleagues quit and were not replaced.\n       Appalled by what she saw, Dr. Hollenbeck filed a whistle-\n     blower complaint and changed jobs. A subsequent investigation \n     by the Department of Veterans Affairs concluded last fall \n     that indeed the Jackson hospital did not have enough primary \n     care doctors, resulting in nurse practitioners' handling far \n     too many complex cases and in numerous complaints from \n     veterans about the delayed care. ``It was unethical to put us \n     in that position,'' Dr. Hollenbeck said of the overstressed \n     primary care unit in Jackson. ``Your heart gets broken.''\n\n  In this case we had a physician who wanted to do the right thing, \nwanted to spend the appropriate amounts of time that were needed with \nthe patients, and she was unable to do that. What we are hearing is in \nmany parts of this country primary care physicians are saying: We \ncannot do it; too many people are coming in. This is an issue that has \nto be addressed, and our legislation does that.\n  Our legislation gives the VA the ability to rapidly hire new doctors, \nnurses, and other health care providers in areas with identified \nshortages. It also enables VA's ability to recruit qualified health \nproviders by enhancing scholarship and loan repayment opportunities.\n  As the Presiding Officer well knows as a member of the committee that \ndeals with this issue, we have a crisis in this country in terms of the \nlack of primary care practitioners. This is a very serious problem. \nThere are experts who tell us, in fact, that we need 50,000 new primary \ncare physicians in the next 10 to 15 years. This is a national problem, \nit is a problem within the VA, and what this legislation proposes is \nthat the VA work with the National Health Service Corps in order to \nprovide debt forgiveness, scholarships to medical school students, so \nwhen they graduate they can get into the VA and practice the quality \nmedicine we need there.\n  This bill addresses another issue that has been discussed a lot--and \nthere is widespread bipartisan support for this and support in the \nHouse as well--and that is the authorization of 27 major medical \nfacility leases. In many instances these leases would improve access to \ncare closer to home and would increase the availability of specialty \ncare services in those locations that would allow the VA to decompress \noverutilized VA facilities. This is an important issue in this \nlegislation and I believe there is bipartisan support for it.\n  Furthermore, this bill would require the President to create a \ncommission to look at VA health care access issues and recommend action \nto bolster capacity. In the last couple of days I have heard a lot of \ngood ideas about how we can deal with the issue, but we need a high-\nlevel commission of some of the most knowledgeable people in this \ncountry appointed by the President to report within 90 days some ideas \nof how the VA can proceed.\n  I want to thank the 16 or so cosponsors we have. I look forward to \nworking with my Republican colleagues. We have got a problem we have to \naddress, and I hope we can do it in a bipartisan way.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2422\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

BUDGETARY TREATMENT OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS \n                   AFFAIRS MAJOR MEDICAL FACILITIES LEASES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Title 31, United States Code, requires the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs to record the full cost of its \n     contractual obligation against funds available at the time a \n     contract is executed.\n       (2) Office of Management and Budget Circular A-11 provides \n     guidance to agencies in meeting the statutory requirements \n     under title 31, United States Code, with respect to leases.\n       (3) For operating leases, Office of Management and Budget \n     Circular A-11 requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to \n     record up-front budget authority in an ``amount equal to \n     total payments under the full term of the lease or [an] \n     amount sufficient to cover first year lease payments plus \n     cancellation costs''.\n       (b) Requirement for Obligation of Full Cost.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the availability of \n     appropriations provided in advance, in exercising the \n     authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to enter into \n     leases provided in this Act, the Secretary shall record, \n     pursuant to section 1501 of title 31, United States Code, as \n     the full cost of the contractual obligation at the time a \n     contract is executed either--\n       (A) an amount equal to total payments under the full term \n     of the lease; or\n       (B) if the lease specifies payments to be made in the event \n     the lease is terminated before its full term, an amount \n     sufficient to cover the first year lease payments plus the \n     specified cancellation costs.\n       (2) Self-insuring authority.--The requirements of paragraph \n     (1) may be satisfied through the use of a self-insuring \n     authority consistent with Office of Management and Budget \n     Circular A-11.\n       (c) Transparency.--\n       (1) Compliance.--Subsection (b) of section 8104 of title \n     38, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new paragraph:\n       ``(7) In the case of a prospectus proposing funding for a \n     major medical facility lease, a detailed analysis of how the \n     lease is expected to comply with Office of Management and \n     Budget Circular A-11 and section 1341 of title 31 (commonly \n     referred to as the `Anti-Deficiency Act'). Any such analysis \n     shall include--\n       ``(A) an analysis of the classification of the lease as a \n     `lease-purchase', `capital lease', or `operating lease' as \n     those terms are defined in Office of Management and Budget \n     Circular A-11;\n       ``(B) an analysis of the obligation of budgetary resources \n     associated with the lease; and\n       ``(C) an analysis of the methodology used in determining \n     the asset cost, fair market value, and cancellation costs of \n     the lease.''.\n       (2) Submittal to congress.--Such section 8104 is further \n     amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(h)(1) Not less than 30 days before entering into a major \n     medical facility lease, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives--\n       ``(A) notice of the Secretary's intention to enter into the \n     lease;\n       ``(B) a detailed summary of the proposed lease;\n       ``(C) a description and analysis of any differences between \n     the prospectus submitted pursuant to subsection (b) and the \n     proposed lease; and\n       ``(D) a scoring analysis demonstrating that the proposed \n     lease fully complies with Office of Management and Budget \n     Circular A-11.\n       ``(2) Each committee described in paragraph (1) shall \n     ensure that any information submitted to the committee under \n     such paragraph is treated by the committee with the same \n     level of confidentiality as is required by law of the \n     Secretary and subject to the same statutory penalties for \n     unauthorized disclosure or use as the Secretary.\n       ``(3) Not more than 30 days after entering into a major \n     medical facility lease, the Secretary shall submit to each \n     committee described in paragraph (1) a report on any material \n     differences between the lease that was entered into and the \n     proposed lease described under such paragraph, including how \n     the lease that was entered into changes the previously \n     submitted scoring analysis described in subparagraph (D) of \n     such paragraph.''.\n       (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section, or the \n     amendments made by this section, shall be construed to in any \n     way relieve the Department of Veterans Affairs from any \n     statutory or regulatory obligations or requirements existing \n     prior to the enactment of this section and such amendments.\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am pleased to follow my friend and \ncolleague from Vermont, Senator Sanders, and I want to begin by \nthanking him for his leadership, his persistence, and his perseverance \nin the face of resistance that should not exist. This cause ought to be \none that galvanizes the Nation, and perhaps it will, since the Nation \nhas been appalled and astonished by reports of not only cooking the \nbooks but covering up that potential criminality--destruction of \ndocuments, falsification of records, secret waiting lists, delays that \nare unacceptable and intolerable for basic, necessary health care our \nveterans need.\n  But these issues are longstanding, decades old in this system, and \nthey need to be addressed with system-wide reform.\n  I am strongly in support, and proudly so, in advocating the Ensuring \nVeterans Access to Health Care Act that Senator Sanders has just \nintroduced. It is a version of the omnibus bill and\n\n[[Page S3380]]\n\nother measures that have been introduced. It has essential features \nthat will provide better health care sooner and more accessibly to our \nveterans. It is necessary to pass, but these provisions should have \npassed literally years ago. In fact, the very first piece of \nlegislation I introduced in the Senate, S. 1060, called the Honoring \nAll Veterans Act, included a provision to deal with this shortage of \ndoctors in this system. It included other health care-related measures \nto expand the availability and accessibility of health care. These \nproblems, far from new, have been existent for some time. And the \ncoverup, the lying, and falsification of records is potentially now \ncriminal and beyond a failure of public policy; it is a failure in \nintegrity.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Sanders to make sure the 9.3 million of \nthe Nation's 22 million who are enrolled in the VA health care system--\nwhich is up from about 2.5 million at the end of the first gulf war--\nhave the kind of service they need. This bill will address some basic \nneeds. It provides authority to remove senior executives based on poor \njob performance and preventing wholesale political firings. The \nlegislation would provide veterans who cannot get timely appointments \naccess to private clinics and the option of going to community health \ncare centers, military hospitals, or private doctors. It would \nauthorize the Veterans' Administration to lease 27 new health \nfacilities in 18 States, including funds for the enhanced lease of the \nErrera Community Care Center in West Haven, CT, which does profoundly \nimportant and excellent work.\n  The legislation authorizes emergency funding to hire new doctors and \nnurses and other providers in order to address systemwide health care \nprovider shortages and to take other necessary steps to ensure timely \naccess to care. It addresses the health care primary care shortage for \nthe long term as well by authorizing the National Health Service Corps \nto award scholarships to medical school students and to forgive college \nloans for doctors and nurses who work at the VA. These kinds of \nmeasures and others in the bill will act to fulfill our basic \nobligation to our veterans, just as I attempted to do in the Honoring \nAll Veterans Act some years ago, and others have joined since in \nseeking to do.\n  My hope is we can reach across the aisle. In fact, I am working with \nSenator McCain on a bipartisan letter to the Attorney General urging \nall possible involvement and leadership in a criminal investigation. I \nhope a similar spirit of bipartisanship will enable us to work with \nSenators McCain, Burr, and Coburn on their Veterans Choice Act and \ncombine these measures, enlist them in supporting a bipartisan solution \nand join Senator Sanders in hoping for that bipartisan effort in this \nmeasure because there is no question that the VA budget has grown, but \nsimply has failed to keep pace with surging demand, especially in \nmental health services and primary care. Too many of our veterans are \ncoming home with serious mental health issues, including post-traumatic \nstress, traumatic brain injury, and need the care we owe them. We need \naccountability. Part of it will be firing the officials who should be \nheld responsible, but part of it may also be prosecuting them, and that \nis the reason I have asked the Attorney General to take the lead to \nassume much more immediate, significant involvement in any criminal \ninvestigation that may be necessary.\n  In fact, there is credible and significant evidence of criminal \nwrongdoing here. The Department of Justice must be involved and in my \nview must take a leadership role, and that is the reason Senator McCain \nand I have joined in a letter that we are seeking support for our \ncolleagues to send that would request the Attorney General to take such \nsteps. Only the Attorney General has the resources, expertise, and \nauthority, along with the FBI, to do a prompt and effective criminal \ninvestigation. Only the Department of Justice can convene a grand jury \nand take other necessary steps. Only the FBI can bring to bear the \nexpertise as well as the resources.\n  The inspector general of the Veterans' Administration has only 165 \ninvestigators for the entire Nation. This investigation now spans more \nthan 40 centers where criminality has been alleged. Of the 216 sites \nvisited by the auditors recently, many were found to have issues of \nscheduling practice defects and potential integrity problems. So there \nis a reason for the VA inspector general to not only consult with the \nDepartment of Justice but also involve the Department of Justice in an \nactive leadership role here, and for the Acting Secretary of the VA to \nrequest that involvement, which I hope he will do. I commend what he \nhas done so far, but now is the time for the Department of Justice to \nbe involved in leading.\n  The audit of the facilities around the country is to be made public--\nnot just the overall results which have been delivered to the President \nin a report last Friday, but all of the results--site-specific results \nfor locations, for example, the two hospitals in Connecticut in West \nHaven and in Newington as well as the six medical centers in \nConnecticut. All of those site-specific audits should be made public.\n\n  I have written to the Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson, urging that he \nmake those face-to-face audits of the VA medical facilities public, not \nonly for Connecticut but for the whole country. Restoring trust and \ncredibility will be achieved only if there is more transparency. \nNondisclosure would be a bad way to begin a new era of leadership at \nthe VA. Full transparency is absolutely vital to help restore trust and \nconfidence, which has been so gravely threatened and, indeed, \nundermined.\n  Finally, I have a few words to say about Secretary Shinseki. The \nimmediate challenge is not about replacing one person, it is about \nfixing a system that is desperately wrong. I deeply respect Secretary \nShinseki's decision to resign last week after concluding that his \ncontinued service would be a distraction from the urgent and necessary \noverhaul of the Veterans' Administration. I respect even more his \ndedicated service to our Nation. He is a decorated combat veteran who \nled into battle many of the men and women who now use the Veterans' \nAdministration. His mentors and models, as he so eloquently told our \ncommittee, now use the Veterans' Administration. In his heart, I \nbelieve he is passionately committed to the cause of serving our \nveterans, and he deserves gratitude and respect from the American \npeople for his service in the U.S. military and his telling truth to \npower as the President so powerfully observed.\n  The Nation must recognize it owes our veterans world-class, first-\nclass medical care that is second to none. Putting them at risk in \nmedical facilities after they have put their lives on the line on the \nbattlefield is a disservice to them and our Nation.\n  It is abhorrent and atrocious that there have been these potentially \ncriminal acts--destruction of documents and falsification of records--\nat many of the VA facilities around the country. There is no excuse for \nit. Whether it is arbitrary deadlines or timelines, there is simply no \nexcuse for that kind of lying. The lying that happened within the VA \nwas not only to General Shinseki, but to the American people. The ones \nwho committed that kind of wrongdoing should be held accountable \nadministratively and criminally.\n  The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the ongoing global military \noperations since 9/11, have cast a long shadow on this Nation's \nhistory. It involved less than 1 percent of the population, including \nthe families of the brave warriors who have been sent to battle. All of \nus will live with the consequences, and all of us have an obligation to \nkeep faith with them, leave no veteran behind, and give them prompt and \nworld-class, first-class medical care when they need it right away.\n  The ``greatest generation'' set a model for them, and they are, \nindeed, the next greatest generation. We have to do right by them as \nthey have done right by us. No matter what the era, conflict, or war, \nlet us keep faith with all of the veterans and leave no veteran behind.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Burr, Mr. Flake, Mr. \n        Isakson, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. \n        Coats, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. \n        Alexander, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Wicker, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Portman, Mr.\n\n[[Page S3381]]\n\n        Toomey, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Moran, Mr. Thune, Mr. Scott, Mr. Enzi, \n        and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 2424. A bill to provide veterans with the choice of medical \nproviders and to increase transparency and accountability of operations \nof the Veterans Health Administration of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it has been almost 2 months since \nallegations that some 40 veterans died while waiting for care at the \nPhoenix VA were first made public. Since that report, we have learned \nof similar allegations of gross mismanagement and data manipulation at \n42 VA medical facilities across the U.S. More troubling, according to \nthe Office of the Inspector General's preliminary report, 1,700 \nveterans in the Phoenix VA Health Care System who thought they were \nabout to receive care were never even placed on the VA's Electronic \nWaiting List and are ``at risk of being forgotten or lost in Phoenix \nHCS's convoluted scheduling process''. Today, it is clear that delaying \nmedical care and manipulating records to hide those delays in care is \nsystemic through the Department of Veterans' Affairs health system. \nThis has created in our veterans' community a crisis of confidence \ntoward the VA--the very agency that was established to care for them.\n  Today, I joined Senators Coburn, Burr, and Flake to introduce the \nVeterans Choice Act of 2014. This bill would, principally, empower \nveterans with greater flexibility when choosing their medical care and \nincrease transparency and accountability within the VA to ensure that \nit delivers quality care to our veterans in a timely manner. \nSpecifically, it would give veterans the option to go to a different \ndoctor if the VA can't schedule an appointment within a reasonable time \nor if the veteran lives too far away from a VA medical facility. \nAdditionally, this bill would prohibit scheduling or wait-time metrics/\ngoals from being used as factors to determining performance awards or \nbonuses. It would also require the Secretary of the VA to punish \nemployees who falsify data, including civil penalties, suspension or \ntermination. And, empower the Secretary of the VA to remove any top \nexecutive at the VA if the Secretary determines that his performance \nwarrants removal.\n  Put simply, unlike some other proposals that have been made to reform \nhow the VA delivers care, this bill would squarely address the root \ncauses of the tragic circumstances that have brought us to this point.\n  For almost all this century, Americans have been fighting in faraway \nplaces to make this dangerous world safer for the rest of us. They have \nbeen brave. They have sacrificed and suffered. They bear wounds and \nmourn losses they will never completely recover from--and we can never \nfully compensate them for. But, we can care for the injuries they \nincurred on our behalf and provide for their physical and emotional \nrecovery from the battles they fought to protect us. Quality care for \nour veterans is among the most solemn obligations a nation must pay, \nand we will be judged by God and history by how well we discharge ours.\n  Indeed, we must be worthy of the sacrifices made on our behalf How we \ncare for those who risked everything for us is the most important test \nof a Nation's character. Today, we are failing that test. We must do \nbetter tomorrow. Much better.\n  For the 9 million American veterans who depend on the VA for their \nhealth care, and for the families whose tragic stories we have heard \nover the last two months, who I know are still grieving their losses, \nit is time to provide our veterans with the care, choice, and \naccountability that they so rightly deserve.

Res. 464\n\n       Whereas aphasia is a communication impairment caused by \n     brain damage that typically results from a stroke;\n       Whereas aphasia can also occur with other neurological \n     disorders, such as a brain tumor;\n       Whereas many people with aphasia also have weakness or \n     paralysis in the right leg and right arm, usually due to \n     damage to the left hemisphere of the brain, which controls \n     language and movement on the right side of the body;\n       Whereas the effects of aphasia may include a loss of, or \n     reduction in, the ability to speak, comprehend, read, and \n     write, but the intelligence of a person with aphasia remains \n     intact;\n       Whereas, according to the National Institute of \n     Neurological Disorders and Stroke (referred to in this \n     preamble as the ``NINDS''), strokes are the fourth-leading \n     cause of death in the United States;\n       Whereas strokes are a leading cause of serious, long-term \n     disability in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that there are approximately \n     5,000,000 stroke survivors in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that people in the United \n     States suffer approximately 795,000 strokes per year, with \n     about \\1/3\\ of the strokes resulting in aphasia;\n       Whereas, according to the NINDS, aphasia affects at least \n     1,000,000 people in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that more than 200,000 people \n     in the United States are afflicted with aphasia each year;\n       Whereas the people of the United States should strive to \n     learn more about aphasia and to promote research, \n     rehabilitation, and support services for people with aphasia \n     and aphasia caregivers throughout the United States; and\n       Whereas people with aphasia and their caregivers envision a \n     world that recognizes the ``silent'' disability of aphasia \n     and provides opportunity and fulfillment for people affected \n     by aphasia: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 2014 as ``National Aphasia Awareness \n     Month'';\n       (2) supports efforts to increase awareness of aphasia;\n       (3) recognizes that strokes, a primary cause of aphasia, \n     are the fourth-largest cause of death and disability in the \n     United States;\n       (4) acknowledges that aphasia deserves more attention and \n     study to find new solutions for people experiencing aphasia \n     and their caregivers;\n       (5) supports efforts to make the voices of people with \n     aphasia heard, because people with aphasia are often unable \n     to communicate with others; and\n       (6) encourages all people in the United States to observe \n     National Aphasia Awareness Month with appropriate events and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/03/senate-section/article/S3381-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3381-S3382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 465--COMMEMORATING THE CENTENNIAL OF WEBSTER \n                               UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. BLUNT (for himself and Mrs. McCaskill) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
