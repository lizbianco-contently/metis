Mr. President, life can change in a moment. In Carson City, \nNV, a little over a year ago--actually, time goes quickly; it was in \nSeptember of 2011, September 6--shortly before 9 o'clock in the \nmorning, a deeply disturbed man with an automatic weapon stepped out of \nhis car outside of a Carson City, NV, restaurant. In the few brief \nseconds that followed, he fired nearly 80 rounds from an automatic \nweapon, spraying bullets over the parking lot and into an IHOP \nrestaurant that was packed with customers for breakfast. He killed four \npeople instantly, wounded seven others, and then he took his own life \nafter that. That took 85 seconds. In those 85 seconds, 5 lives ended, \nand countless more were altered forever.\n  Three Nevada Army National Guardsmen were on their way to work that \nmorning: 31-year-old SFC Miranda McElhiney, 38-year-old SFC Christian \nRiege, and 35-year-old MAJ Heath Kelly. Florence Donovan-Gunderson, who \nwas eating breakfast with her husband, was also killed--murdered.\n  In 85 seconds, Carson City joined the likes of Tucson, AZ, Fort Hood, \nTX, Blacksburg, VA, Columbine, CO, and scores of other cities and towns \nin America rocked by mass shootings in recent decades. And as were \nthose other cities and towns, Carson City was left asking, Why? Maybe \nwe will never know.\n  The gunman had been diagnosed earlier with schizophrenia. He had been \ninvoluntarily committed by law enforcement officials to a mental \ninstitution. He recently confided to a priest that voices he heard in \nhis head told him to continue to do bad things. A lot is not clear.\n  What is clear is how the shooter obtained two assault rifles, two \nhandguns, and almost 600 rounds of ammunition he took to the IHOP that \nday. I don't know--no one really knows--what happened. It is not clear \nwhat happened. Where did he get those weapons--two assault rifles, two \nhandguns, and about 600 rounds of ammunition that he took with him to \nthe parking lot to start shooting people?\n  Even though all of that is not clear in terms of how he obtained \nthose assault weapons, this much is clear: We have a responsibility to \ndo everything in our power to keep guns out of the hands of those who \nsuffer from mental\n\n[[Page S2572]]\n\nillness. I think it is clear we mean severe mental illness. Within our \nfamilies we all have individuals who have periods of time when they are \ndepressed. We must keep weapons out of the hands of those with \nillnesses that make them a danger to themselves and others. We have a \nresponsibility also to keep the guns out of the hands of criminals--\nconvicted felons.\n  The measure before the Senate today would institute universal \nbackground checks that would prevent people with severe mental illness \nfrom buying firearms--those with severe mental illness; I want to make \nsure we stress that--and criminals. This legislation would also crack \ndown on anyone who buys a gun to funnel it to criminals and it would \ngive schools the resources to improve security to keep children safe.\n  This bill won't stop every madman determined to take innocent lives. \nI know that. We all know that. Nor is this bill the only suggestion to \nprevent gun violence. In the coming days we will debate other proposals \nto make Americans safer.\n  An assault weapons ban will be debated and voted on. Improvements to \nour mental health system will be debated and voted on. A ban on high-\ncapacity clips such as those used to kill four people in Carson City at \nthe IHOP, and how the man in Columbine, CO, was able to get a magazine \nwith 100 bullets in it--that is the only reason the people in Colorado \nweren't massacred even more. The gun jammed.\n  There are powerful feelings about each of the proposals I have \nmentioned, both strong support and strong opposition. But whichever \nside one is on, we ought to be able to agree to exchange thoughtful \ndebate about these measures. Let's engage in it. We ought to be able to \nagree to a careful examination of the culture of violence that is \ngrowing in this Nation.\n  I am pleased a number of reasonable Republicans have joined Democrats \nin welcoming this debate saying they are not going to debate cloture. I \nhope we have enough to have cloture invoked. I feel fairly confident \nthat, in fact, is the case.\n  As I have indicated for the last many weeks, we are going to have an \nopen amendment process, as much as possible, on this bill. As always, \nthe process will depend on the goodwill of all Senators. Somebody could \ncome and do all kinds of things to stop us from doing anything on the \nbill. I hope that is not the case.\n  Once we are on the underlying bill, the first amendment, as I have \nindicated, will be on a substitute compromise background check proposal \noffered by Senators Manchin, Toomey, Kirk, and Schumer. I thank the \nSenators for their diligent work on this issue. They have been working \na long time.\n  I am hopeful we will be able to debate and vote on a reasonable \nnumber of amendments offered by Senators who feel passionately about \nreducing gun violence or respecting Americans' second amendment rights. \nI also respect those who want to weaken the laws that now exist. They \nhave a right to try to do that. But three soldiers--Miranda, Christian, \nand Heath--and Florence, who was not a soldier but was one of those \nkilled--deserve some attention. There were seven people who were hurt \nas a result of these bullets as well as those killed. That was a \nterrible day in Carson City. Each one of them deserves a thoughtful \ndebate, and they deserve votes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/11/senate-section/article/S2572-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on whether \nto invoke cloture on proceeding to S. 649. I will vote against invoking \ncloture and I wish to explain why.\n  I believe the government should focus on keeping firearms out of the \nhands of criminals and those with mental issues that could cause them \nto be a threat to our society. The government should not punish or \nharass law-abiding citizens in the exercise of their second amendment \nrights. Unfortunately, S. 649 has the focus entirely backwards.\n  For example, the background check portion of S. 649 is Senator \nSchumer's bill that the Judiciary Committee reported out on a party-\nline basis. The aim of that bill, from its plain terms, could not be \nmore clear. Section 121, the purpose section, provides that the aim of \nthe bill is to require Americans to undergo background checks for ``all \nsales and transfers of firearms.'' If they don't, it is a Federal \ncrime. Again, the requirement applies to all sales, and even transfers, \nof all firearms. And with very few exceptions, that is exactly what S. \n649 does. The next section of the bill makes plain why that overly \nbroad language is so problematic.\n  That section, section 122, provides that it is ``unlawful'' for any \nprivate party to ``transfer a firearm to any other person'' without \nfirst turning over that firearm to a commercial firearms dealer and \nhaving that dealer perform a background check. There are a few limited \nexceptions such as for gifts between immediate family members and \ninheriting a firearm. But that is it. In fact, the bill makes clear \nthat transfer means not just sale but a ``gift, loan'' or any ``other \ndisposition'' of that firearm.\n  So under the Schumer legislation, the following offenses would now be \nFederal crimes absent surrendering the firearms and conducting a \nbackground check. Federal offenses: An uncle giving his nephew a \nhunting rifle for Christmas; a niece giving her aunt a handgun for \nprotection; a cousin loaning another cousin his hunting rifle if the \nloan occurs just 1 day before the beginning of hunting season; or one \nneighbor loaning another a firearm so his wife can protect herself \nwhile her husband is away.\n  The people I am describing are not criminals--they are neighbors, \nfriends, and family--and the scenarios I am describing are not \nfanciful. They happen countless times in our country. But the Schumer \nbill would outlaw these transfers and it would make people such as \nthese criminals.\n  But there are other problems with the legislation from the Senator \nfrom New York. Under his legislation, it is a crime for someone who \nlawfully possesses a firearm not to report a lost or stolen firearm to \nboth the ``appropriate local authorities,'' whoever they are, and the \nAttorney General within 24 hours. People should report firearms that \nare lost or stolen, but are we really going to make their failure to do \nso within 24 hours a Federal crime that is punishable by up to 5 years \nin prison? What if the person thinks the firearm is misplaced, not lost \nor stolen, but the person is actually wrong about that? And what if the \nperson comes to the realization after 2 days instead of 1, and if they \nreport the lost or stolen firearm to their sheriff--assuming he is one \nof the undefined ``appropriate local authorities''--why is it a crime \nif they don't report it to the Attorney General?\n  Why would the provision target only those who ``lawfully possess'' \nfirearms, rather than criminals who do not lawfully possess them?\n  I could go on and on and list other problems with S. 649, but I think \nI have made my point. This bill is a clear overreach that will \npredominantly punish and harass our neighbors, our friends, and our \nfamilies. To protect the rights of the law-abiding citizens of the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky and other States, I will oppose invoking \ncloture on S. 649.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/11/senate-section/article/S2572-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 11 a.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, with Senators permitted to speak for up to \n10 minutes each.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, we are on the verge of a historic vote \nthat will determine whether we make America safer and assure that we do \neverything possible as Senators and citizens to ensure there are no \nmore Newtowns.\n  On the evening of December 14, when we left the firehouse at Sandy \nHook, there was a vigil at a church in Newtown, St. Rose of Lima, \npresided over by Father Bob, who is Monsignor Robert Weiss. It was a \nvery moving and powerful experience. The church was filled. People \nstood at the windows to hear what was going on.\n  The Governor spoke and so did I. I said that evening: The world is \nwatching Newtown. And, in fact, the world was watching Newtown, as we \nknew from the horror of that afternoon, when many of us arrived at the \nchurch, and first at the firehouse, to see families emerging and \nlearning for the first time that their children, their babies, would \nnot be coming home that evening. It was an experience that will stay \nwith me forever. The sights and sounds of that afternoon, filled with \ngrief and pain, will never leave me.\n  The world was watching Newtown that day and that evening and has \nwatched Newtown and Connecticut in the days and months since, and I \nhave been privileged to spend many hours and days and weeks and these \npast months with the families.\n  The world has watched the families, and it has seen in them and in \nNewtown--a great community, a quintessential New England town--strength \nand courage that was as unimaginable as the horror of that day, \nstrength and courage that represents what is good about America and \nwhat is strong and courageous about our Nation.\n  The world has watched Newtown and the families of Newtown and it has \nwatched Connecticut. Now the world is watching the Senate. It is \nwatching the Senate to see whether democracy works. It sounds simple, \nbut it is true. Will democracy work to reflect the majority of the \nUnited States of America, the majority of our people who say we need to \ndo something about the guns. That is what the families said to me that \nday and in days since and what people in Connecticut and across the \ncountry have said to their Senators: We must do something about gun \nviolence.\n  I remember talking to one of the families that evening and saying: \nWhen you are ready, we ought to talk about what we can do in Congress \nto stop gun violence. She said to me: I am ready now.\n  The Senate must be ready now to act. It must keep faith with those \nfamilies and victims--as the world watches--with Benjamin Andrew \nWheeler, age 6. His father David is here today, and Benjamin is here in \nspirit as we decide in the Senate whether we will move forward toward \nprogress.\n  Ana Grace Marquez-Greene, also age 6. Her mother Nelba is here today. \nAna is with us in spirit.\n  Dylan Hockley, age 6, whose mother Nicole is here, is also here in \nspirit.\n  Daniel Barden, age 7. His mother Jackie and his father Mark are here.\n  Jesse Lewis, age 6. His father Neil Heslin is here.\n  Mary Sherlach, one of the six educators killed at Sandy Hook \nElementary, whose husband Bill is here--Jesse and Mary are here with us \ntoo.\n  We know compromise and action are possible because two of our \ncolleagues have forged a bipartisan compromise that will enable us to \ncome closer. It is imperfect. It is less than what I would have \npreferred in achieving universal background checks. It is a starting \npoint. It is a step in the right direction, and it will help us achieve \na larger bipartisan compromise because background checks are only one \npart of a comprehensive strategy that must include a ban on illegal \ntrafficking, strengthening school safety, as well as mental health \ninitiatives and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. I \nwill be privileged to spearhead that effort on high-capacity \nmagazines--hopefully next week--after today's vote, along with \ncolleagues such as Dianne Feinstein, Frank Lautenberg, and my \ncolleague, Chris Murphy.\n  Today, let us decide, as the world watches, there will be no more \nNewtowns. That is what the families want. That is what America wants. \nLet us resolve that we will make democracy work as we go beyond this \nfirst step and decide to proceed on a bill that also is imperfect but \nprovides a starting point, provides a way forward, so we can make our \ncommunities safer.\n  The families of Newtown have performed an extraordinary service for \nour Nation. Not only has the world watched and been inspired by their \nstrength and courage, but they have turned the tide. They have visited \nwith our colleagues and they have impacted this process more profoundly \nand more directly than any other single group. They have shown we can \nbreak the stranglehold of special interests and the NRA, that speaking \ntruth to power still works. To them we owe a special thanks. To them, \nas a nation, we owe a debt of gratitude for the lives that will be \nsaved, for the futures that will be given. Even if their children and \ntheir loved ones will not enjoy that future, they have given futures to \ncountless Americans who will be saved from the scourge of gun violence.\n  To them I say thank you. They are in this building, and their \nchildren, their loved ones, are with us in spirit as we take this \nhistoric step.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am honored to be on the floor this \nmorning to begin today's debate on this historic gun violence measure \nwith my colleague Senator Blumenthal. I join with him in my awe of the \nNewtown families who are here this week. People have watched them on \nthe news as they have gone from office to office and told the story of \ntheir loved ones. Nobody can paint a picture better as to why we need \nto act next week than the families of those people who lost their lives \nin Newtown.\n  There are so many stories they can tell better than anyone else. They \ncan tell the story of their lost first graders, but they can also tell \nthe story of the five little boys and girls who escaped that morning, \nwho escaped when the shooter went to reload and there was a brief \nperiod of time where some kids could run out of one of those first-\ngrade classrooms.\n  Better than anyone else, these families can posit as to whether their \nlittle boys and girls would still be alive if the shooter walked in \nwith 10-round clips rather than 30-rounds clips, if he had to exchange \nmagazines 15 times rather than 5 or 6 times. Nobody can tell that story \nbetter than these families.\n  What I have tried to do over the course of the last couple days is to \nhelp these families tell the story of their loved ones but to also \npaint a broader picture to talk about the 30 lives every day that are \nended by gun violence. I think we need to talk about the victims and \nallow for the voices of those victims to be part of the debate, because \nwhile the tragedy in Newtown has gotten the headlines and the \nhighlights and is certainly the reason we are standing here today, more \npeople than were killed in Newtown die every day in this country from \ngun violence--on the streets of Washington and Hartford and Bridgeport \nand Baltimore--all across the country.\n  These victims need to be our imperative, whether they be the 6- and \n7-year-old kids and the teachers in Newtown or the 25-year-olds and 17-\nyear-olds who are dying every single day across our country. It has to \nend. The answer cannot be, as it has been for 20 years, that we are \ngoing to do nothing. So I wish to take a few minutes to continue \ntelling these stories this morning.\n  I wish to begin with Dylan Hockley. Dylan's mother has probably been \none of the most articulate spokesmen for this cause. His parents Nicole \nand Ian have been amazing in their ability to grieve and also to come \ndown to Washington and argue their cause.\n  Dylan loved video games. He loved jumping on trampolines. He loved \nwatching movies. He was autistic, but he was doing so much better. He \nwas so proud of the fact that he had learned how to read, and he was \ntaking out books every day from the library to bring home. His parents \nchose Sandy Hook Elementary School because of its great autism program.\n\n[[Page S2574]]\n\n  I spoke yesterday about his paraprofessional, his special education \naid, who was so wonderful to assist him in doing better every single \nday. Because of his autism, he was a child who loved routine and \nrepetition, and there were a few movies he would watch over and over \nand over again--``Up,'' ``WALL-E,'' ``The Gruffalo''--and he would find \nthose portions of the movies he loved so much. He would sit in front of \nthe TV with his headphones on rewinding those portions over and over \nand over again, and every single time he watched those movies, he would \nlaugh over and over and over again.\n  His parents have created an organization called Dylan's Wings of \nChange. It is a memorial fund to benefit children with autism. It is \njust one of a multitude of efforts that have flowed forth from this \ntragedy. Dylan's life was ended, but this fund is going to help make \nsure other kids like him have the chance to lead great, normal lives, \neven though they deal with complex problems such as autism.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator from Connecticut yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to commend the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Murphy, as well as Senator Blumenthal. In the last 2 \ndays they have come to the floor many times leading the floor debate \nand discussion on the pending legislation we will vote on soon relative \nto guns and gun safety. It is appropriate that they are here because, \nbeing the Senators representing Newtown, CT, they have personal \nattachment to the families who have weathered this tragedy.\n  This morning I met with those families in my office. Tears were shed, \nas you might expect. These families have lost little children like \nDylan and so many others. It is a loss they will feel for a lifetime, \nbut in their grief, they have come forward and shown extraordinary \ncourage to walk through the corridors of power in Washington to bring a \nsimple message: that they do not want this to happen to any other \nparent.\n  I thank Senator Murphy and Senator Blumenthal for reminding us that \nwe have the power, we have been given the power by the people we \nrepresent to make this a safer nation for families, for children, for \nschools, and for communities across the board. Soon we will have a \nvote. We are hoping--I think that is a positive hope--that enough on \nthe other side of the aisle will step forward to defy the filibuster \nthat has been threatened and bring this matter to the floor for a vote.\n  I know Senator Murphy and Senator Blumenthal have come to the floor \nfor the last day and a half and more to dramatize that issue. What I \nfound interesting, and I would like to ask the Senator from Connecticut \nto comment on it, is the promise of this community. They gave me a list \nof things and said: This goes beyond guns and gun safety. I would ask \nthe Senator if he could address this promise that came out of Newtown, \nCT, after the terrible tragedy on December 14.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for his career fighting on behalf of \nlegislation that will address gun violence. The summation of all of \nthat work hopefully will be with us this week and next week.\n  I thank the Senator for his question about the Sandy Hook promise. \nThe Sandy Hook promise, which has been signed by tens of thousands of \npeople all across the country, came out of this tragedy because there \nwas a recognition, as you said, that this was not a sprint, that this \nwas a marathon, that the promise we needed to make to each other in the \nwake of this horrific tragedy was not just that we were going to do \neverything within our power, our individual powers to try to reduce the \nincidence of gun violence--and as Senator Durbin points out, we have \nmore power, the 100 of us, than almost anyone else, and shame on us if \nwe do not use it. But the Sandy Hook promise is that there are so many \nother things that you can do: that you can make smaller commitments in \nyour communities to build bigger and better systems of mental health; \nthat you can try to forge atmospheres in schools that are more \ninviting, that are more positive; that you can, frankly, just be nicer \nto your neighbors, you can be more thoughtful in your everyday \ninteractions, knowing there could be some tragedy around the corner \nthat takes your neighbor away from you; make sure you say everything \nyou want to say to that person.\n  So this promise--a promise to do everything within our power to try \nto make sure this never happens again, but to bring a new level of \npositivity to our world in the wake of this awful violence, is one of \nthe most important things that come from it.\n  We are so grateful that these families are here not just challenging \nus to pass specific pieces of legislation but also to make our lives \nchange in the wake of this situation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask if the Senator would yield for a \nfurther question through the Chair.\n  One of the issues the Senator just raised is one I would like to have \nhim expound on; that is, the issue of mental illness and mental health. \nI think this is something in my lifetime on which we have seen dramatic \nprogress made, not just in the treatment of mental illness but in our \nattitude toward mental illness.\n  There was a time in the history of this country and this world when \nmental illness was viewed not as an illness but a curse. The people who \nwere afflicted by it were often shunned and institutionalized and \ntreated very badly because it was considered to be something incurable \nand they had somehow been cursed. That was their plight on Earth. Thank \ngoodness that has changed and we now have a more positive attitude \ntoward dealing with mental illness.\n  I might say I have read--I believe it is accurate--more than half the \npeople in America suffer from some form of depression. It is very \ncommon in most families. It is treatable. Most mental illnesses are \ntreatable. Most victims of mental health illness are people who are \npeaceful, God-fearing, loving people who need understanding and help. \nThey are no threat to anyone. More often, they are the victims of \nviolence rather than the perpetrators of violence.\n  One person in the community of Newtown who stepped up and clearly was \nunstable and used those firearms on December 14 to kill innocent people \nhas caused us to step back and take a look at the issue of mental \nillness as it relates to guns and firearms. I think what we are trying \nto do in this legislation is to say: If your mental illness has reached \nsuch an extreme, if you are so unstable or threatening that you need to \nbe watched in terms of purchasing firearms, let's make sure the records \nare there.\n  But I hope--I know the Senator agrees with this--I hope we will not \nallow this discussion to take us away from the beginning part: that \ntreating mental illness and helping people is the right thing to do, \nnot shunning them, not pushing them aside from the rest of the \nmainstream, but understanding that treatment of mental illness makes us \na better people, gives them a better chance at life. It is that small, \nsmall minority of those suffering from these afflictions who need to be \nmonitored in terms of the use and purchase of firearms.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for that comment. As he knows, there \nis absolutely nothing inherent in mental illness that creates a \nconnection to violence. As the Senator said very correctly, people with \nmental illness are much more likely to be the victims of violence than \nto perpetrate a crime. The great irony coming out of this debate could \nbe that if we make the awful mistake of equating violence with mental \nillness, than we will frankly make it harder for people to go out and \nseek treatment, not easier.\n  Adam Lanza was a deeply disturbed individual. His mother made awful \nmistakes, but she was certainly trying to figure out a way to get him \nhelp. The fact is that there are far too many families out there who do \nnot have places to turn for treatment. That is the right thing to do \nindependent of this debate today. We should absolutely be talking about \nthe comprehensive commitment to ending gun violence, but the reality is \nthat today there are way too many families who hit brick walls in \ntrying to find mental health treatment for children.\n  If we were to go through this debate and somehow stereotype people \nwith mental illness as prone to violence, then it would, frankly, \ncreate more barriers. There is a proposal out there from one of the gun \nlobby groups to\n\n[[Page S2575]]\n\ncreate a registry of everyone with mental illness across this country. \nIt is an absolutely ludicrous idea, especially when this very same \ngroup opposes keeping a registry of everyone with guns in this country.\n  I take the Senator's concerns to heart.\n  This was a very serious incident in Newtown, but it should not cause \nus to take steps backward in terms of the support we give families who \nare looking for help for their loved ones.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the last point I would like to make is \nthat included in the bill that came before us is not only an \nopportunity to change some of the circumstances that might have saved \nlives in Newtown but also to address some underlying issues of gun \nviolence that is not resulting in a mass killing but the killing on a \nday-to-day basis of innocent people.\n  A measure I have joined Senator Leahy, Senator Kirk, and Senator \nCollins in introducing relates to straw purchases. These are purchases \nby some individual who does not have a problem in their background that \nwould disqualify them from buying a gun. They buy a gun and then turn \nit over to someone who has a problem. This straw purchase or third-\nparty purchase happens way too often.\n  In the city of Chicago, where we are making progress toward reducing \ngun violence and murder, in a recent survey of the crime guns \nconfiscated in the last 10 years, 9 percent of them in the city of \nChicago came from the State of Mississippi. The State of Mississippi is \nnot contiguous to Illinois. It is a long way away. But clearly someone \nhad started an industry of buying guns easily in Mississippi and moving \nthem up the interstate system all the way to Chicago and selling them \nto the gang bangers and the thugs and criminal elements in this city.\n  Another 20 percent of the guns came from one gun shop outside the \ncity of Chicago, in the suburbs. We know exactly where it is--it is in \nRiverdale, IL. That has become the venue of choice for girlfriends to \ngo buy a gun for their boyfriends, who are going to use them to kill \nsomebody. Well, the provision in the law we are going to try to bring \nto the floor in the base bill says that this will now be a stiff \nFederal crime--a hard-time Federal crime--to buy a gun that you knew or \nshould have known was going to be used in the commission of a crime. So \nalthough it does not directly affect the circumstances of the tragedy \nin Newtown, it really does hold out promise to reduce some of the other \ndeaths.\n  Yesterday the Senator gave us a chart that showed how many have died \nfrom gun violence since December 14. It was a big chart with a lot of \nfaces on it of people who had died. I thank the Senator for what he has \ndone in terms of what has affected Newtown, but I also thank him for \nsupporting this underlying legislation.\n  I think this chart is now being shown here. I hope we keep in mind \nthat gun safety and reducing gun violence means start with the \nmassacres, the tragedies that have stricken us, but also go beyond that \nand find a way to make the streets safer for Hadiya Pendleton, a high \nschool girl who came up from Chicago for the inauguration, could not \nhave had a happier day, and then 10 days later was gunned down in a \npark next to her school in the city.\n  So we want to make this a comprehensive and a balanced, commonsense \napproach to gun safety. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for that.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the majority whip. Just to add to his last \ncomment, my constituents are amazed that we do not have a Federal law \nbanning gun trafficking today. They are amazed that if you go into a \nstore and buy guns legally and then walk outside that store and sell \nthem to people who are prohibited, that you have not committed a \nFederal crime. There is an assumption that the Federal Government would \ndisallow that. We have not. But hopefully at the end of this debate we \nwill. I thank Senator Durbin for all of his fantastic work on that \nissue.\n  Let me tell a few more stories. I want to get to Senator Durbin's \npoint and tell some stories about the victims of urban gun violence as \nwell, but let me tell one more story from Newtown.\n  This is the story of our heroic principal. Dawn Hochsprung was the \nprincipal at Sandy Hook Elementary School. People have heard a lot \nabout her because she was perhaps the first to die that day. When the \nbullets started flying, when she heard the gunman enter through the \nfront door, she ran straight to him. Some of the investigators have \nposited, given the way the crime scene shook out, that she may have \neven lunged for the gunman to try to stop him before he turned the \ncorner to the first grade classrooms. She was unsuccessful. She was \nkilled--perhaps the first that day.\n  The irony surrounding this day is multifold, but part of it involves \nthe fact that one of her most recent proudest accomplishments as \nprincipal of that school was the establishment and integration of a \nbrandnew security system, one that made sure every visitor who entered \nthat school after 9:30 had to buzz in, had to talk to the security \npeople, the front desk people, before they entered the school. That \ndoes not work too well when the person trying to gain entry does not \nneed to press the buzzer but instead can take an AR-15, which sprays \nsix bullets a second, and just knock out all of the windows.\n  She was a passionate educator. She dove into her work at Sandy Hook. \nShe was one of those folks who did not sit in their office. She was out \namongst the hallways at all times trying to make that place a much more \npositive environment.\n  She grew up in Connecticut. She lived in Woodbury, CT, with her \nhusband and her two daughters and three stepdaughters. She grew up \nloving the outdoors. Her friends recalled that Dawn Lafferty at the \ntime was a tomboy who loved sports in high school. She wasn't a top-\nlevel athlete, but that didn't stop her.\n  One of the most amazing stories I have heard about Dawn was that when \nshe was in school at Naugatuck High School, she wanted to run with the \nboys track team. She wanted to run sprints. She wasn't allowed to do \nthat. She protested to the coach, the administration, and they still \nsaid she couldn't run sprints with the boys track team. She took her \ncase to the school board--as a high school student--and won her case. \nWhen she came back to her high school, she didn't just run sprints with \nthe boys, but she recruited other girls to run sprints with her. She \nwas a born leader.\n  Perhaps we may take some solace in the fact that so many of these \nother kids here--Dylan, Chase, Benjamin, Jesse, and Ana--were leaders \ntoo. They were going to do amazing things with their lives. At least we \nwere able to know with Dawn what her true potential was. We saw that \npotential in the wonderful school she built.\n  I just spoke about Dylan. Dylan's parents came from England all the \nway to Sandy Hook, CT, for this school because of the programs Dawn \nbuilt there. If they ever had any doubt as to whether they had chosen \nthe right leader, they were confident of this when she ran to the \ngunman to try to stop the carnage from becoming worse.\n  Let me speak about one more little girl, age 6, Madeleine Hsu. \nMadeleine was, again, one of the youngest victims that day. She was a \nshy and relatively quiet 6-year-old, but there were certain things that \nwould make her light up. A lot of these kids loved animals. Madeleine \nloved dogs. She lit up around dogs. They were her passion. She was an \navid reader, and she loved running and dancing. More than anything \nelse, she loved to wear bright, flowery dresses which matched her \npersonality. She shared a bed with two of her sisters. They had their \nown rooms, but they loved each other so much, they chose to sleep \ntogether at night. They miss her dearly.\n  As Senator Durbin pointed out, 20 kids and 6 adults were killed in \nNewtown that day; 2 others, Adam and Nancy Lanza--28 total. This is \nless than the average number of people who are killed by gun violence \nacross this country every day. We deserve to talk about them as well.\n  Before I leave the floor today, I would like to talk about a couple \nof the most recent victims of gun violence. One can't even really read \nthis poster Senator Durbin referred to because each one of these little \ndots is an individual figure representing people who have been killed \nin this country since December 14. The 28 people from Newtown aren't \neven on this chart. We are speaking about 3,800 people who have died as \na result of gun violence.\n  Some of these people died because they were possibly doing something\n\n[[Page S2576]]\n\nwrong or in the midst of an activity they shouldn't have been a part \nof. However, Chuck Walker was 15 years old and walking on his way to \nvisit his girlfriend to deliver some new shoes he purchased for her. He \nwas bringing a gift to his girlfriend. His family said this was a kid \nwho never, ever was in trouble. He was walking to visit his girlfriend, \nand he was gunned down on the streets of Hillcrest Heights, MD, in an \napparent robbery.\n  Marckel Worman Ross, who was 18 years old, on September 11, 2012, was \nwalking to school. He was a member of the track team, ROTC, and was \nthinking about a career in the military. He was found in his school \nuniform still holding his backpack. It was a random act of violence on \nthe way to school.\n  Moses Walker was older--40 years old. He was a police officer. He had \njust finished his shift in August of 2012. He was four blocks from his \npolice station, and he was gunned down--1 year away from retirement. He \nwas very active in his community, not only a great police officer but \nserved as deacon of his church. He was remembered as a courteous, \npolite, and humble police officer--gunned down four blocks from his \npolice station.\n  These are the tragedies bringing us here to the floor today. As we \nhave this debate, we should remember that every day 30 people across \nthis country are dying from guns. We have the power to do something \nabout it.\n  I am as pleased as Senator Blumenthal about the compromise brought to \nthis floor by Senators Manchin and Toomey. It is not perfect, but it is \nimportant. It is important because it will make our streets safer and \nensure fewer criminals across this country have access to guns. It is a \nplatform for more next week, but it is a very important start.\n  I will be back to the floor later today and next week to speak about \nmore of these victims.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, earlier I met with families from \nNewtown, CT, to discuss the legislation we are currently debating. It \nwas emotional and difficult for all of us. I thank them for sharing \ntheir stories of their loved ones and their concerns with me. I hope my \ncolleagues will also consider meeting with these families.\n  At the meeting, they called for a debate on the legislation, a debate \nwe are having. Nonetheless, we are in the unusual position of being \nasked to take a leap into the unknown. We are being asked to vote to \nproceed to an uncertain bill. That bill is not even the bill that we \nwould likely consider if the motion to proceed were successful. The \nlanguage on background checks would change. We have not seen the actual \nnew background check language. But we are being asked to proceed to the \nbill anyway. What we do have is a summary of the proposed background \ncheck language. That summary raises questions. For instance, the \nsummary states that the background check language applies to sales at \ngun shows and online. Is a background check required if someone sees a \ngun at a gun show, then proceeds to purchase the gun outside the gun \nshow, maybe even in a parking lot? What if someone at a gun show trades \nbut does not sell a gun? And it applies beyond gun shows. If a private \nperson advertises a gun, then the transfer would have to go through a \nlicensed dealer, at a price. So if someone takes out an ad to sell \ntheir gun in the local Farm Bureau newsletter or in their church \nbulletin, they would have to find a licensed gun dealer to conduct a \nbackground check before sale could go through.\n  That is quite a limitation on private sales and ownership of guns. \nAnd it takes time in many places in this country to find that gun \ndealer to conduct that background check. The summary is not specific: \nwhich private sales would be exempt from the bill's background check \nrequirements? The summary states that background checks are ``required \nfor sales at gun shows and online while securing certain aspects of 2nd \nAmendment rights for law abiding citizens.''\n  That should cause everyone concern. If the background check language \nsecures ``certain aspects of 2nd Amendment rights,'' then what aspects \nof second amendment rights of law abiding citizens does it not secure?\n  The summary says that the new language exempts ``temporary \ntransfers.'' What is the difference between a ``temporary'' and a \npermanent transfer? How would a law-abiding citizen know whether the \ntransfer would be considered to be ``temporary''? What if the person \nmaking the transfer thought at the time it was made that the transfer \nwould be temporary but later decides that it should be for a longer \ntime?\n  And the summary claims that it will close the ``gun show and other \nlooopholes.'' What ``other loopholes''? We should be skeptical about \nwhat rights could be infringed based on that claim. It is important to \nunderstand that there is no such thing as a ``gun show loophole.'' \nUnder existing law, background checks are required for gun purchases \nfrom a federally licensed firearms dealer. This is true whether the \npurchase is made at a gun show or any other location. Also, under \nexisting law, gun purchases made through someone who is not a federally \nlicensed firearms dealer do not require a background check.\n  This is true whether the sale is made at a gun show or not. Whether a \nsale is made at a gun show is therefore irrelevant to whether a \nbackground check is required. There is one rule for sales from licensed \ndealers and another for private sales. But under the new language, not \nall private sales will be treated the same. Some private sales will \nrequire background checks and others will not. That distinction will \ncreate, not close, a loophole. No longer would all private sales be \ntreated the same. Some private sales will require background checks and \nothers will not. There will be political pressure then to say that all \nprivate sales should be covered--universal background checks, in other \nwords. And we heard testimony in the Judiciary Committee, and the \nDeputy Director of the National Institute of Justice has written, that \nuniversal background checks can be enforced only if gun registration is \nmandated.\n  Now it has been said on the floor recently that background check \nlegislation cannot lead to gun registries because Federal law prohibits \nthat. But current Federal law can be changed. And the language \ncurrently before us requires recordkeeping, a step toward registration. \nAlthough the sponsor of that language said that the bill expressly \nprovided that no registry could be created, the bill contains no such \nlanguage at present. The sponsor was misinformed about his own bill. He \nadmitted that the current background check language was not yet ready \nfor consideration and needed clarifications that so far have not been \nforthcoming.\n  We should have answers to these and other questions before we should \nproceed to the bill.\n  And we should be wary of going to a bill when various senators have \nannounced their intention to offer amendments to that bill that in my \njudgment raise serious constitutional questions under the second \namendment.\n  Mr. President, how can we responsibly proceed to a bill that contains \nlanguage that even its sponsor admits is not ready for consideration?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEE. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the \nconclusion of the comments by the distinguished Senator from Utah, I be \nrecognized.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEE. I appreciate the cooperation and friendship of the senior \nSenator from Vermont.\n  Mr. President, yesterday on the floor I discussed an initiative I \nlaunched this week called Protect2A to give voice to the millions of \nsecond amendment supporters around the United States who are very \nconcerned about Congress enacting any new gun control measures.\n  I am pleased to announce that we now have over 3,000 responses from \ncitizens all across this country who are sharing their stories, their \nexperiences, and their opinions about why they feel we should do \neverything in our power to protect their second amendment rights. I had \nonly a brief time to share some of those stories yesterday and wish to \nuse a few minutes today to share a few more.\n  Kathy from the State of Virginia writes:\n\n\n[[Page S2577]]\n\n\n       My husband and I are senior citizens. He is a veteran of \n     the U.S. Army. Over the past several years, we have seen our \n     constitutional rights trampled and twisted, until we no \n     longer trust that our government has our well-being as its \n     primary concern. Last year, for the first time in our lives, \n     we bought a gun, not only to ensure our safety against \n     criminals, but to protect and defend our God-given rights as \n     citizens. The most basic right of all mankind, the right to \n     life itself, no longer exists in this country. Protecting our \n     rights, the few the government has left us, is of the utmost \n     importance to us and we will do everything necessary to hold \n     onto those rights, regardless of the source of the threats \n     against them. God bless America.\n\n  Emily from Pennsylvania writes:\n\n       I am 19 years old and I want to protect myself as soon as I \n     am legal to. As a young female living in Allentown, PA, I \n     don't like walking in the city because I'm afraid of \n     something happening to me. I believe in the power of the \n     Constitution and especially my second amendment rights. I am \n     a strong conservative who believes that the Constitution is \n     our guiding power and not the cronyism that seems to blanket \n     DC. The founding fathers knew what they were doing. As soon \n     as I am legal, I want to take gun safety classes and purchase \n     a handgun of my very own. I like to think that I can protect \n     my own life as well as another person whose life may be in \n     danger. Gun control doesn't solve anything. Criminals will \n     get guns no matter what. I want to be able to protect myself \n     as well as someone else. Please don't take away my second \n     amendment rights.\n\n  Well said, Emily.\n  William from Connecticut submitted the following statement:\n\n       On Tuesday, February 11, 2003, my brother was confronted by \n     three armed thugs in a parking lot. Out of their stolen car, \n     with a stolen shotgun, they tried to rob him. Much to their \n     surprise, my brother had his legally owned pistol (with a \n     legal carry permit). He thwarted this and saved his own life \n     and held them at bay until the police arrived. Without this \n     second amendment he would've been another victim to the \n     growing street crime that these bills do not address.\n\n  These are the rights we are trying to protect by requiring a 60-vote \nthreshold on any new gun control legislation. In so doing, we are \ntrying to prevent the ability of Members to push through legislation \nbefore anyone has had time to read and evaluate the language and then \ntell the American people what that language means for them, what the \nlanguage would mean for their rights. Unfortunately, this is exactly \nwhat we are faced with today.\n  Yesterday Senators Toomey and Manchin announced a new proposal that \nis widely expected to replace the current language on the background \nchecks in this bill. Yet, as of this morning, this very moment, not a \nsingle Senator has been provided the legislative text of this \nprovision. Because the background check measure is the centerpiece of \nthis legislation, it is critical that we all know what is in the bill \nbefore we vote on it.\n  As I have argued on this floor, in the national media, and back home \nin my home State of Utah, we should not be legislating by negotiating \nclosed-door, backroom deals away from the eyes of the American people. \nWe should not be voting before we read and understand exactly how these \nproposals will affect the rights of law-abiding citizens and whether we \ncan say with any level of certainty they will reduce crime. This is \nexactly why we need more debate and why I ask my colleagues to vote no \non cloture--so Senators and the American people may fully understand \nthe consequences of this legislation.\n  To be clear, the vote we will have this morning will be to end debate \non whether the Senate should take up a bill, the very heart of which is \nbeing concealed from the Senate and concealed from the American people \nas of this very moment. Proponents say the people deserve a vote. Don't \nthey deserve to know what they are voting on? I think they do.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am about to suggest the absence of a \nquorum for about 1 minute and ask unanimous consent that upon coming \nout of the quorum, I be recognized.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this week I spoke about the need \nfor the Senate to consider legislation to help increase Americans' \nsafety by reducing gun violence. I came to the floor of the Senate and \nI urged my fellow Senators to abandon efforts to filibuster proceeding \nto this bill. The Senate should not have to overcome a filibuster to \nrespond to the call for action in response to the violence they are \nexperiencing.\n  I have the privilege of being the longest serving Member of this \nbody. I have watched debate on so many issues. If there were ever an \nissue where all 100 of us should vote yes or no it is here.\n\n  I was encouraged by the comments of a number of Senate Republicans \nthat they are prepared to debate this matter and will not support this \nwrongheaded filibuster. Even the Wall Street Journal editorialized \nagainst this filibuster yesterday in a lead editorial entitled ``The \nGOP's Gun Control Misfire.'' I do not agree with much of that \neditorial, but I would quote this:\n\n       If conservatives want to prove their gun-control bona \n     fides, the way to do it is to debate the merits and vote on \n     the floor.\n\n  Senators should understand what is in this bill that a small minority \nof Republicans are seeking to prevent the Senate from even considering. \nThe bill has three parts. None of them threaten the second amendment \nrights, none of them call for gun confiscation or a government \nregistry. In fact, two of the three parts have always had bipartisan \nsupport. With regard to the third component--the provisions closing \nloopholes in our current background check system--Senators Manchin and \nToomey yesterday announced they are going to have a bipartisan \namendment for this component as well.\n  Since the beginning of the 113th Congress, in the months since the \ntragedy in Newtown, the Judiciary Committee held three hearings and \nfour mark ups focused on the issue of gun violence. The Committee voted \nin favor of the Leahy-Collins gun trafficking proposal that is now part \nof the legislative package the Majority Leader created to allow for \nSenate consideration. I described our legislation in some detail on \nMonday. I thanked our Ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Grassley, for working with us and supporting our gun \ntrafficking bill. I commended Senator Collins, who has been my partner \nas we have moved forward with legislation to combat illegal gun \ntrafficking and straw purchasers who obtain firearms to provide them to \ncriminals and gangs. We have been joined in that bipartisan effort by \nSenators Durbin, Gillibrand, Kirk, Klobuchar, Franken, Blumenthal, \nShaheen and King. A bipartisan majority of the Judiciary Committee \nvoted for the Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act.\n  Our bill is intended to give law enforcement better and more \neffective tools. It was an ATF whistleblower who testified last \nCongress that the existing firearms laws are ``toothless.'' We can \ncreate better law enforcement tools and that is what we are doing with \nthe Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act. We need to close this \ndangerous loophole in the law that Mexican drug cartels, gangs and \nother criminals have exploited for too long.\n  Straw purchasers circumvent the purposes of the background check \nsystem. Straw purchasing firearms is undertaken for one reason to get a \ngun into the hands of someone who is legally prohibited from having \none. We know that many guns used in criminal activities are acquired \nthrough straw purchases.\n  It was a straw purchaser who enabled the brutal murders of two brave \nfirefighters in Webster, New York this past Christmas Eve, and it was a \nstraw purchaser who provided firearms to an individual who murdered a \npolice officer in Plymouth Township, Pennsylvania, last September.\n  We need a meaningful solution to this serious problem. We also \ninclude suggestions from Senator Gillibrand to go after those who \ntraffic in firearms by wrongfully obtaining two or more firearms. We \nworked hard to develop effective, targeted legislation that will help \ncombat a serious problem and that will do no harm to the\n\n[[Page S2578]]\n\nSecond Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans.\n  Yesterday, Senator Collins, the senior Senator from Maine, and I were \nable to announce another step toward consensus. We had previously been \nengaged in discussions with law enforcement and victims groups. More \nrecently we have been engaged in discussions with the National Rifle \nAssociation. We have agreed on modifications to the Stop Illegal \nTrafficking in Firearms Act. They address all of its substantive \nconcerns while doing as we have always wanted to do--providing law \nenforcement officials with the tools they need to investigate and \nprosecute illegal gun trafficking and straw purchasing.\n  Senator Collins and I are both strong supporters and advocates of \nsecond amendment rights for law-abiding Americans. We also agree that \nour law enforcement officials deserve our support in their efforts to \nkeep guns out of the wrong hands. We worked with the NRA and are \nconfident that nothing in our bill infringes on the Second Amendment \nrights of lawful gun owners and purchasers, while still providing a \nstrong new set of tools for law enforcement officials.\n  We protect legitimate sales and do not place unnecessary burdens on \nlawful transactions. We are pleased that the NRA agrees with us that \nthis legislation is a focused approach to combat the destructive \npractices of straw purchasing and firearms trafficking while protecting \nthe Second Amendment rights of Americans. Having now worked out \ndifferences with the NRA on our bipartisan legislation that would help \nkeep guns out of the hands of dangerous criminals and individuals with \nsevere mental illnesses, and give law enforcement the tools they need \nto investigate and prosecute these crimes more effectively, it seems \nabsurd that some Senators nonetheless persist in filibustering \nconsideration of our bill.\n  The American people expect us to stand and face our responsibilities. \nWhether we like having to vote or not, we have taken an oath of office \nto uphold the Constitution, to uphold our laws. Congress has to \nconfront the serious role that straw purchasing and gun trafficking \nplay in supplying criminals with firearms for illegal purposes. It is \nnot enough to stand on the floor of the Senate and say you are pro law \nenforcement. Let's take as a given everybody is pro law enforcement, \nbut then give law enforcement the tools they need. The bipartisan Stop \nIllegal Trafficking in Firearms Act will create specific Federal \ncriminal statutes prohibiting the trafficking and straw purchasing of \nfirearms, and also strengthens other law enforcement tools to assist \nthose investigating these crimes. This is a common sense response to \nhelp in the fight against gun violence.\n  This is a commonsense response to help in the fight against gun \nviolence, and it will help law enforcement. That is why law enforcement \nstrongly supports our bill. Yet some are seeking to filibuster it. Let \nthem go to law enforcement groups and say they are trying to block them \nand take away the tools they need to keep every one of us safe.\n\n  Our bill protects Second Amendment rights of lawful gun owners, while \ncracking down on criminals and those who would assist them. The bill \ndoes not create a national firearms registry, nor does it place any \nadditional burdens on law-abiding gun owners or purchasers. It sends a \nclear message that those who would buy a gun on behalf of a criminal, a \nmember of a drug cartel, or a domestic abuser will be held accountable. \nThat is why our bill is strongly supported by law enforcement. Yet that \nis what some are seeking to filibuster. Congress should be confronting \nthe serious role that straw purchasing and gun trafficking play in \nsupplying criminals with firearms for illegal purposes, not ducking the \nissue.\n  Senators are filibustering a bipartisan proposal that received \nbipartisan backing of the Senate Judiciary Committee to provide some \nFederal assistance to schools to create safer environments for children \nand young people. There is nothing unconstitutional about that. We \nshould proceed to consider it and I would hope pass it so that more \nschool resource officers can be hired and more can be done to help and \nprotect our young people who are in schools around the country, where \nthere are supposed to be.\n  Finally, it is hard to understand how improving our background check \nsystem and plugging some of the loopholes in it that allow those who \nare by law prohibited from purchasing guns because they are dangerous \ncriminals or dangerous to themselves and others because of mental \nillness justifies a filibuster. We have had background requirements for \ngun purchases for decades. We have had a background check system for \ndecades. We have improved it repeatedly over time.\n  I know gun store owners in Vermont. They follow the law and conduct \nbackground checks to block the conveyance of guns to those who should \nnot have them. They wonder why others who sell guns do not have to \nfollow these same protective rules. I agree with these responsible \nbusiness owners.\n  As I said, Congress should be confronting the serious role straw \npurchasing and gun trafficking play in supplying criminals with \nfirearms for illegal purposes, not ducking the issue. Stand up and be \ncounted. Stand up and be counted. Don't give speeches saying you are in \nfavor of law enforcement but we are going to take away tools law \nenforcement needs. Stand up and be counted. Stand up and be counted. If \nwe can all agree that criminals and those adjudicated as mentally ill \nshould not buy firearms, why should we not try to plug the loopholes in \nthe law that allow them to buy guns without background checks?\n  If we agree the background check system is worthwhile, should we not \ntry to reform its content so it can be more effective? What responsible \ngun owner objects to improving the background check system? Stand up \nand be counted.\n  At our January hearing I pointed out that Wayne LaPierre of the NRA \ntestified in 1999 in favor of mandatory criminal background checks for, \nas he put it, ``every sale at every gun show.'' He went on to emphasize \nthe NRA's support for closing the loophole in the background check \nsystem by saying--in what has become an oft-quoted remark--``no \nloopholes anywhere for anyone.''\n  Well, of course, it is common sense to close the gun show loophole. \nThe Senate voted to do so in 1999. We should vote to do so again. This \ntime we should get it enacted. One of the ways to do so is with the \nbipartisan proposal from Senators Manchin and Toomey to improve the \nlaw, if we are able to stop this ill-conceived filibuster and get to \nthe bill.\n  Americans across this great country are looking to us for solutions \nand for action, not filibustering or sloganeering. Americans are \nsaying: Stand up and be counted. I opened our first hearing on these \nissues in January, asking Senators on both sides of the aisle to join \nin the discussion as part of a collective effort to find solutions to \nhelp assure that no family, no school, no community ever has to endure \nthe kind of tragedy the families at Newtown and Aurora and Oak Creek, \nTucson, Blacksburg or Columbine had to suffer.\n  As I emphasized throughout the committee process, the second \namendment is secure. It is going to remain secure and protected as part \nof my oath of office as a Senator. In two recent cases, the Supreme \nCourt has confirmed that the second amendment, as the other aspects of \nour Bill of Rights, secures that fundamental individual right. \nAmericans have the right to self-defense. They have the right to have \nguns in their homes to protect their families. No one is going to take \naway these rights or these guns. That second amendment right is the \nfoundation on which our discussion rests. They are not at risk. But we \ncannot close our eyes to what is at risk: lives are at risk when \nresponsible people fail to set up the laws to keep the guns out of the \nhands of those who will use them to commit mass murder.\n  So I ask my fellow Senators to focus our discussion and debate on \nthese proposed statutory measures intended to better protect our \nchildren and all Americans. Ours is a free society, an open society, a \nwonderful society. We should be coming together as elected \nrepresentatives of all of the American people to consider how to become \na safer and more secure society. I would have hoped all Senators from \nboth parties would join together in good faith to strengthen our law \nenforcement efforts against gun violence and to protect public safety. \nLet's focus on our\n\n[[Page S2579]]\n\nresponsibilities to the American people.\n  We are the 100 Senators elected to represent more than 314 million \nAmericans. That is an awesome responsibility. Let's stand up to that \nresponsibility. We are accountable to those people. We are not \naccountable to special interest groups on either the right or the left. \nWe are accountable to the more than 300 million Americans. Special \ninterest lobbies on either the left or right should not dictate what we \ndo. We do not need a lobby's permission to pass laws to improve public \nsafety. That is our responsibility.\n  I urge Senators to be less concerned with special interest scorecards \nand more focused on fulfilling our oath to faithfully discharge the \nduties of our office as Senators.\n  I consider myself a responsible gun owner, but I am also someone who \ncherishes all of our constitutional rights. As a Senator who has sworn \nan oath to uphold those rights, as a father and a grandfather, and as a \nformer prosecutor who has seen the results of gun violence firsthand, I \nhave been working to build consensus around commonsense solutions. I am \nprepared to debate and vote on the measures before us. I challenge \nother Senators to do the same. Do the same. Stand up and be counted. \nStand up and be counted.\n  A filibuster says you are not willing to take a stand; that you vote \nmaybe. Stand up and be counted. Have the courage. Stand up and be \ncounted. Then let us work together to make all Americans safer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday I had the solemn privilege of \nmeeting with some of the families who lost loved ones in the Sandy Hook \nshooting. As a father, I can hardly begin to comprehend the enormous \ngrief these individuals have suffered, losing such a young child or a \nspouse or a mother in an act of what would appear to be just senseless \nviolence. Burying your child is something no parent should have to do.\n  The families and friends of the victims at Sandy Hook are owed the \ndignity and respect of a transparent, good-faith effort to address gun \nviolence. I do believe there is common ground upon which Republicans \nand Democrats can come together. The issue of mental health of the gun \nowner is that common ground for me, along with enforcing current laws \nthat are on the books.\n  If there is one thread that connects the horrific series of gun \nviolence episodes in our country, particularly in recent times, it is \nthe mental illness of the shooter. In every case, the perpetrator's \nmental illness should have been detected. In some instances it was \ndetected but not reported. These individuals should never be allowed \naccess to a gun. This is actually something we can and should do \nsomething about. We need to make sure the mentally ill are getting the \nhelp they need, not guns. As I said, this is something I believe all of \nus can agree on.\n  In response to the tragedy at Virginia Tech in 2007, the Senate and \nthe Congress unanimously passed a measure to bolster mental health \nreporting requirements on background checks.\n  Some States, such as mine, Texas, have received high marks for their \ncompliance. But many States have essentially been noncompliant, and the \nDepartment of Justice has failed to adequately back implementation of \nthe law. So essentially the law that we passed in the wake of the \nVirginia Tech shooting to require reporting of people who are actually \nadjudicated mentally ill in their respective States is not working the \nway it should. Rather than string along an ineffective program, I think \nthis is a wonderful opportunity for us to fix it. And we should fix it.\n  I want to say a word, though, about symbolism versus solutions. I am \nnot interested in Congress voting on a measure that would have no \nimpact on the horrific violence we have seen in recent months. I am not \ninterested in a symbolic gesture which would offer the families of the \nSandy Hook shooting no real solutions. They told me they are not \npolitical. They don't come with an agenda. They are not asking us to \npass a specific piece of legislation. They just want to know that their \nloved one did not die in vain, and that something good can come out of \nthis terrible tragedy.\n  So I think dealing with this mental health reporting issue is a \ncommon ground we could come together on. But we also need to make sure \nwe are not just going to pass additional laws that will not be \nenforced. What possible solace could that be to these families, for \nCongress to pass additional laws that will never be enforced?\n  Take, for example, the National Instant Criminal Background Check \nSystem--the NIC system, as it is called--which flags people who lie on \ntheir background check. The annual number of cases referred for \nprosecution fell sharply during the first 2 years of the current \nPresident's term of office. Indeed, there was a 58-percent drop in \nreferrals and a 70-percent drop in prosecutions for people who lie on \nthe background check. We can fix this.\n  Let's make sure that guns aren't getting into the hands of people who \nwe all agree should not have them. We could be doing this right now \nwith broad bipartisan support.\n  Let me conclude with a couple of observations about where we find \nourselves with an 11 o'clock vote on an underlying bill which remains \ncontroversial and which I think the majority leader and all of us know \nhas very little chance, if any, of going anywhere.\n  We heard yesterday that our colleagues from West Virginia and Ohio \nhave come together on a bipartisan background check bill. I asked my \nstaff as recently as on my way over here whether the language had been \nreleased so we could actually read it and find out what is in it, and \nit has not. We have no commitment in front of the Senate by the \nmajority leader that there will be a robust debate and amendment \nprocess, because there are a lot of amendments that need to be offered \nto whatever that so-far-unwritten bill says, I am sure. And we need to \nhave a full, robust, transparent discussion of this issue in front of \nthe American people.\n  So I am not going to vote to proceed to a bill that has not yet been \nwritten, no matter how well intentioned it may be. We need to make sure \nthat what we do is address the cause of this violence, and to come up \nnot with symbolic gestures that will have no impact or to pass other \nlaws that will not be enforced but to come together with real \nsolutions. Rather than put on a show and pat ourselves on the back and \ncall it a day, let's do something good to make sure we have done \neverything in our human capacity to prevent another Sandy Hook. This is \nwhat these families want. This is what they deserve. And this is what \nthe American people deserve.\n  This calls on the Senate to exercise its historic and its central \nrole in bringing all sides together to try to come up with solutions. \nBut if we can't do that here, if we can't do that now, when will we \never address this tragedy?\n  The President has told some of these victims' families that this side \nof the aisle doesn't care about their loss. That is not true. That is \nfalse. The President is wrong. All of us care about these families. All \nof us should care about violence in our communities, and we should try \nto work together to find ways to address this--not in a symbolic sort \nof way but in a real way that offers a solution and maybe a little bit \nof progress on this issue that would allow these families to say, no, \nmy loved one did not die in vain; something good came out of this. We \nwant to work together to find real solutions to this type of senseless, \nincomprehensible violence that has taken too many lives. I hope we \nwill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S2580]]\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Three-fifths of the \nSenators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the \nmotion is agreed to.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate everyone's cooperation. I am \nglad we were able to get cloture on this legislation. This legislation \nand this vote that just took place are, of course, important for our \ncountry, especially for the people from Connecticut who have lived \nthrough their tragedy. But it is also important for this body, this \nSenate. There have been many things written in the last several months \nabout how the Senate cannot operate. And I so appreciate the Members on \nthe other side of the aisle--especially John McCain on a Sunday show \nwho said: I don't think there should be a filibuster on this. John \nMcCain is a leader and has been a leader in this country for 31 years \nand people respect his opinion. I am grateful to all Republicans who \njoined with us to allow this debate to go forward.\n  The hard work starts now. As everyone knows, because we have all \nheard this on a number of occasions, the first amendment is going to be \none that has been worked on for weeks by Senator Manchin, Senator \nToomey, and Senator Kirk. That will be the first amendment. We expect \nto lay that down later today. I hope there will be no efforts to \ncontinue this filibuster with the 30 hours. There is no reason we \nshouldn't get to legislating.\n  We have an important lunch, as everyone knows. We are going to finish \nthat lunch, and I hope we can come back and lay down this amendment and \nstart some debate on it. I have indicated to Senators Toomey and \nManchin--they want to spend a lot of time because they have to get \nprepared for what they are going to do beginning Tuesday morning--and I \nsaid that is fine. In the meantime, there are other things we can do on \nthis legislation.\n  We know there are other amendments, and I hope no one is going to \nsay, Well, I am going to filibuster every amendment that is offered. \nThat defeats the whole purpose of why we are here. We can't allow that \nto happen. It would be such a shame if that, in fact, did happen.\n  We are going to have an open amendment process, meaning Senators are \ngoing to be able to offer amendments. One thing we can't do is have \npending scores of amendments and we are not going to do that. We need \nto make this debate so people understand what is going on.\n  There are certain things we are going to have to vote on here. We are \ngoing to have to vote on the Manchin-Toomey amendment. We are going to \nhave to have a vote on assault weapons. Some people love it, some \npeople hate it, but we are going to have to have a vote on it. We are \nalso going to have to have a vote on the size of clips or magazines. \nThose are the only votes I am going to make sure we have. Other than \nthat, we should have amendments. If people think the present law is too \nweak, they can change that or if people think it is too strong, have \nsome amendments to change that. We cannot have just a few Senators \nspoiling everything for everyone here. This is the time we should lay \ndown amendments and see if we can pass them. We can set up procedures \nhere, as we have done, to make sure everyone is heard.\n  I can remember when I had to meet with the families from Newtown. To \nbe very honest, I didn't want to, but I did. I met them over here in \nroom 219. That was a hard meeting, because everyone knows how I have \napproached things in the past with regard to these matters now before \nus. I am like virtually everyone in America: The events of the last few \nmonths have been very tragic--people going to a movie theater to watch \na movie and they are gunned down, and more would have been gunned down \nbut for the fact that the man's 100-clip magazine jammed. Newtown, we \nhave all seen the pictures that are not here today of those babies who \nwere shot, more than once. So America has a different view of this \nviolence than they did just a little while ago.\n  We all believe in the Constitution. We all know what all of these \namendments are about and what they are supposed to do and we are going \nto make sure that during this debate we keep the Constitution in mind.\n  The families of the most recent tragedy in Newtown deserve a debate, \nbecause these people from Newtown who are the survivors of this tragedy \nare representing everybody in America. That is why we need this debate. \nThe Senate is going to give these family members, friends, and people \nwho live in Newtown, no matter how long it takes, the ability to see \nhow people stand on these issues. So the Senate is going to give them \nvotes. We hope it will be sooner rather than later, but we are going to \nwork through this.\n  Senators on both sides have amendments they want to offer. We have \nour most experienced Senator, who has been here longer than anyone \nelse, managing this bill, Senator Leahy of Vermont. He has always been \na fair man and he will continue to be. He knows there are a few \namendments that have to go forward, but after that we are going to be \nas deliberative as we can to make sure people have the opportunity to \noffer amendments.\n  I repeat, after we get through the Manchin-Toomey amendment, the \nassault weapons, and the high-capacity\n\n[[Page S2581]]\n\nmagazines, we are going to make sure everyone has the opportunity, and \nthe Republicans can catch up. We can have the first amendment, the \nToomey-Manchin amendment--I don't know if it is a Democratic amendment \nor a Republican amendment, but that is the first one we are going to \ndo. After we get through these two things, we will have the \nRepublicans. If they are two or three behind, they can catch up with us \nand then we can alternate back and forth. Even though there is no rule \nrequiring it, that is the best way to move forward.\n  I am grateful to everyone we are here and able to start legislating \non this issue that has caught the attention of the American people and, \nfrankly, the world.\n\n\n                            Order For Recess\n\n  Mr. President, we are having a joint meeting. I ask unanimous consent \nthe Senate recess from 12:30 until 2:30 today to allow for a joint \ncaucus meeting, and that all time during recess and morning business \ncount postcloture on the motion to proceed to S. 649.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before I make a statement relative to an \nunrelated issue, I just want to say a very quick word about the \nhistoric vote that took place a few minutes ago on the floor of the \nSenate. I believe we had 16 Republicans who joined us in an effort to \nproceed to a bill that will initiate a debate--one of the first in \nyears--on the floor of the Senate about gun safety in America.\n  I salute those Members of the Senate from both sides of the aisle who \nsupported that motion to proceed, but especially from the other side. I \nknow it took a great deal of courage, political courage, for them to \nstep up and to at least initiate this debate. I will tell you, there \nwere those among them--some 13--who signed a letter saying: We are \ngoing to filibuster this matter to stop it. They did not succeed today \nin that effort because 16 on the Republican side joined us. I do not \npresume they are going to vote for all or any of the amendments to be \noffered. But at least they allowed the Senate to be the Senate instead \nof having us bogged down--as we have over 400 times in the last 6 \nyears--in a filibuster.\n  I hope during the course of this debate on the floor we are able to \nhave amendments debated and voted on. The majority leader made that \nrequest earlier, and I believe, for the good of this Senate--and \ncertainly for the debt we owe to America to address the issues of the \nday--we should address them in a bipartisan fashion in courteous but \nthorough debate.

I come down to the floor for the second time today and \nmaybe the fifth time over the last 2 days to talk again about the real \nreason we are here on the floor of the Senate this week and next week--\nto talk about the scourge of gun violence across the country and its \nvictims.\n  We have had a good week this week on the floor of the Senate--a \nbreakthrough on the matter of background checks, an agreement that we \nhope can forge the basis of a bill next week, an agreement that maybe \ndoesn't move us as far as some of us would like in terms of making sure \ncriminals in this country don't have guns but that moves us very far \ndown the line toward a day when no criminals can go onto the streets of \nthis country with guns, and then a very positive vote today in which \nDemocrats and Republicans joined to break a threatened filibuster.\n  But these are the kids we are really here to talk about, and I wanted \nto come down before the week was over to talk about a few more victims \njust to make sure we are really clear about whom and what we are \ntalking about.\n  Let me tell you about Chase Kowalski, one of the 7-year-olds killed \nby the gunman's bullets in Sandy Hook Elementary School. He was an \namazing little kid. He was an athlete. Much like Jack Pinto, whom I \ntalked about yesterday, Chase was a young jock. He was 6 years old when \nhe actually completed and won a kids triathlon in Mansfield, CT. He was \nso inspired from watching the Olympics last summer, seeing his heroes \nMichael Phelps and Ryan Lochte do so well, that he went out and decided \nto learn how to swim and do it competitively. So with a little bit of \nhelp, he became a swimmer as well. His parents and surviving two older \nsisters, with a lot of his friends and family, ran together in honor of \nChase's love for sports in a Sandy Hook 5K run that attracted thousands \nof people to the streets of Hartford.\n  Chase Kowalski could have done a lot of things. He clearly had this \ndrive and initiative you don't find in a lot of kids who are only 7 \nyears old. We will never really know who Chase was going to grow up to \nbe, but he was a pretty remarkable young boy.\n  Jesse Lewis is here on this poster. His father, Neil Heslin, is here \nthis week arguing and pleading for us to do something.\n  Jesse was a pretty amazing kid in his own right. He was 6 years old. \nThe evening before the tragedy, he and his father had been out shopping \nfor Christmas presents for his friends and family. One of the gifts \nthey were going out to get was for his teacher Vicki Soto, who was \nkilled the next morning along with him. Jesse was spending his own \nmoney on all these presents. He had $37 to spend, which he had earned \nby helping his father with a variety of odd jobs.\n  That was Jesse. He wanted to do nice things for people, but he wanted \nto earn the right to do it, so it wasn't the first time he had gone out \nand basically earned the money at 6 years old in order to buy things. \nBut he was still a kid. He grew up on a farm, so he loved horses and \ndogs and chicks, and he liked to go out and fish and play soccer. His \ndad was always outside working on projects, and he always wanted to be \nwith his dad Neil.\n  He was a pretty amazing kid with a lot of initiative and drive for a \n6-year-old. We will never really know who he was going to grow up to be \neither.\n  As I have talked about on this floor over the last 2 days, although \nso much of the attention is on those 20 kids, the reality is that 3,300 \npeople have died since Newtown. That is where our focus should be as \nwell, on people such as Brian Herrera, 16 years old, a straight-A \nstudent at Miami Jackson Senior High School. Three days before \nChristmas of last year, only about a week after the Newtown shootings, \nBrian was riding his bike to his best friend's house. He was doing \nexactly what he should have done--going to a friend's house to work on \na school project--and he was gunned down in broad daylight in the \nmiddle of the pavement. He was still carrying his red backpack--a story \nwe heard earlier today about someone else. This was a totally random \nshooting. I am not sure if this has\n\n[[Page S2582]]\n\nbeen solved at this point, but at the time the police had absolutely no \nidea why this happened. But there are so many guns out on the streets \ntoday--many of them illegal guns because we don't have a gun \ntrafficking law and we don't have a good background checks law--that \nthese things happen.\n  Jeremy Lee Khaoone, 25 years old, was shot in California about 1 \nmonth ago. He was one of five brothers. His father had just lost his \nwife. He was a native of Stockton, CA, an ironworker. He was always \ncheerful and smiling. Jeremy was killed by gun violence, and he left \nbehind a 3-year-old son in February of this year.\n  Every single day 30 people in this country die from gun violence. You \ncan't even see the differentiation between the little figurines on this \nchart because it happens so often. So I have been coming down to the \nfloor not to hold time but just to remind my colleagues of whom we are \nreally talking and the fact that what we are proposing to do next week \nreally will make a difference.\n  If we want to get all these illegal guns off the street, then we \ncan't just accept the status quo. We have to do something about it. It \nis ridiculous that we don't have a Federal law that bans gun \ntrafficking. It is not OK that perhaps 4 out of every 10 guns in this \ncountry are sold without background checks. A person shouldn't be able \nto walk into a school or a movie theater or a church with a 100-round \ndrum of ammunition. There is no reason for it.\n  We are not going to wipe gun violence off the face of this Earth, but \nwe have to remember these victims. We have to remember the Jeremies, we \nhave to remember the Jesses, we have to remember the Brians and the \nCharlottes and the Madeleines and all of these people who have lost \ntheir lives. We can't bring them back, but we can certainly make sure \nthat 3 or 4 months from now this chart is a little bit smaller. We have \nthe ability to do that.\n  I will be back next week with other stories of victims--from \nConnecticut, to Colorado, to Tucson, to New York City, to Chicago, to \nMiami--so that as we move into maybe the most critical week on the \nfloor of this body with respect to the debate on gun violence in \ndecades, we are really sure about whom we are talking about and the \ndifference we can make.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise today to speak on the budget \nproposal released at long last yesterday by President Obama. Tardy \nthough this budget may be, and despite our differences in opinion, I \nwelcome the President's ideas to begin addressing our Nation's fiscal \ncrisis and runaway spending. Unfortunately, though, I am disappointed \nthat this budget amounts to more taxes, more spending, and more debt. \nThe President's budget calls for $1.1 trillion more in taxes, on top of \nthe $660 billion in tax hikes the President already demanded and won as \npart of the fiscal cliff deal enacted at the beginning of the year, \nbefore I arrived in Washington. That is a grand total of $1.8 trillion \nin tax hikes--before we add in another trillion dollar tax from \nObamaCare. Yet, despite all of this new so-called ``revenue,'' the \nPresident's budget would never balance. No amount of taxes will ever \nbegin to address our Nation's $17 trillion debt.\n  But taxes aren't the only problem with the President's budget. There \nis also a trillion dollars in new spending. We tried that in 2009. It \ndidn't work then and it won't work now. To spend more, we have to \nborrow more. The President's budget would add $8.2 trillion in new debt \nover the next 10 years.\n  Of particular concern to farmers, ranchers, and small businesses in \nNebraska is a proposed hike in the death tax. Under the fiscal cliff \ndeal reached at the beginning of this year, the death tax was set at 40 \npercent, with an exemption per estate of $5 million, indexed for \ninflation. This is already an increase from 2011 and 2012, when the \ndeath tax rate was 35 percent. The President's budget, however, would \nhike the rate further, to 45 percent, while also diminishing the \nexemption per estate to $3.5 million.\n  This disregards the bipartisan will of Congress. The Senate has \nrepeatedly supported a lower death tax rate and higher exemption. Just \n3 weeks ago, 80 senators--myself included--supported an amendment \nseeking to repeal, or at least reduce, the death tax. Instead, the \nPresident's death tax proposal would result in a $72 billion tax hike. \nThis would be particularly harmful to family farmers and ranchers in my \nState of Nebraska and across our Nation. On average, more than 80 \npercent of the value of a family-owned farm or ranch is derived from \nland, buildings, and equipment. Following the death of a loved one, \nfamilies often must sell part or even all of their land and property to \npay the death tax bill. Yet these are illiquid assets which rarely \nreceive their assessed value on the open market, leaving families to \ntake cents on the dollar in order for them to keep that farm or ranch.\n  Each day, farmers and ranchers across Nebraska and the United States \nrise well before dawn only to retire well after dark. After building a \nsuccessful enterprise, family farmers and ranchers should be able to \npass along the fruits of their labor to their children. Instead, the \nPresident's budget proposal would reward this lifetime of hard work \nwith a higher tax bill.\n  I will proudly cosponsor legislation to be introduced soon by Senator \nJohn Thune to permanently repeal the death tax. Absent a full repeal, I \nwill continue fighting to ensure that family farmers, ranchers, and \nother small businesses escape as much of the brunt of the death tax as \npossible. This is not to say that I disagree with every aspect of the \nPresident's budget. Medicare and Social Security are both on the path \nto insolvency. I appreciate that the President sees this unsustainable \npath and has offered concrete proposals to reform these programs.\n  Without action, seniors and other beneficiaries will see steep cuts \nin benefits from Medicare by 2024 and Social Security by 2033. While \nthese cuts will not come overnight, neither will the solutions we need \nto keep the promises we have made to our seniors and those nearing \nretirement.\n  This is the first step in what will be--and quite frankly needs to \nbe--a prolonged, well-reasoned debate. I look forward to working with \nthe President in good faith to reform and save these critical programs. \nI also appreciate the President's desire for revenue-neutral corporate \ntax reform. The devil, of course, is in the details. I have great \nreservations that the President's proposal would basically redistribute \ntax preferences instead of doing more to bring down what is the highest \ncorporate income tax rate in the world. And I believe that we should \nnot merely do this on the corporate side but reform our entire tax code \non a revenue-neutral basis in order to unleash the economic growth of \nour Nation.\n  There are areas where we can work together--and I am eager to do so. \nBut higher taxes, higher spending, and higher debt are not the answer \nto the fiscal challenges our Nation faces.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I join my other colleagues in \nthanking the Senators who joined us in the vote earlier today. My \nprofound thanks go to all who voted among the 68 to enable this debate \nto go forward, to provide and permit debate and votes in coming days, \nand to enable the families of Newtown to have a vote; to enable the \nvictims of Tucson and Virginia Tech and Aurora and Oak Ridge to have a \nvote.\n  Voting is what we are sent here to do. The American people hold us \naccountable when we have votes. Votes enable us to be held accountable \nand those votes will take place. The vote today is exciting and \nencouraging and energizing, but it is only a first step. The critical \ntest and profoundly significant steps will be next week when we vote on \nthe bipartisan compromise that our colleagues have fashioned, that \nSenators Manchin and Toomey have together forged on national criminal \nbackground checks.\n  That is not necessarily as strong as many of us might have preferred. \nThat is not a final or ultimate result on this issue for all time. But \nit is a solid foundation and a path forward to enable more bipartisan \ncompromise, more momentum and impetus.\n  The brave families from Newtown who were part of this discussion this \nweek deserve our thanks as well. They turned the tide. They faced our \ncolleagues in meetings, visit after visit,\n\n[[Page S2583]]\n\nconversation after conversation--painful, demanding, grief-stricken in \nrecalling those hours after that horrific, unspeakable tragedy. As one \nwho arrived there within hours of the shooting, I saw, firsthand, their \nunimaginable pain and grief as they came out of the Sandy Hook \nfirehouse after learning for the first time that their babies would not \nreturn; loved ones, teachers, educators perishing while trying to save \ntheir children in their care.\n  Those families came to Washington to tell their stories and advocate \nfor change so that others would be spared that same experience, so that \nothers would be spared the same fate as the 3,300 who have died since \nNewtown and the horror they and their families experienced.\n  Just 4 months ago the conventional wisdom was that gun violence \nlegislation would never go anywhere in the Congress. In fact, gun \nviolence was politically untouchable. Just days ago, 60 votes was \nthought to be unreachable as a goal. The fact is the political \nlandscape is changing seismically as we speak. As we deliberate, minds \nare changing. Voices are piercing that conventional wisdom. The courage \nand compassion of the Newtown families have disproved and completely \ndefeated the pundits, the conventional wisdom, the prognosticators who \nsaid it could not be done.\n  The world watched that tragedy on December 14 at Newtown. I said on \nthat evening at the vigil at St. Rose of Lima Church: The world is \nwatching Newtown.\n  Indeed, the world watched Newtown, and today the world watched the \nSenate as it took this historic, and for many of our colleagues a \ncourageous, brave step.\n  Today we kept faith with those families and the victims of that \ntragedy in a first step to finally do something about gun violence. Now \nwe must continue working, taking nothing for granted, avoiding \ncomplacency and overconfidence because every step is uphill when it \ncomes to gun violence.\n  I thank particularly two of my colleagues, Joe Manchin and Pat \nToomey, because they stepped forward from States that may not be as \nreceptive to what they have done as others, but they deserve the thanks \nand gratitude of their States in their statesmanship in supporting and \nforging this compromise.\n  I will continue to support and work for a truly universal background \ncheck system, but this bipartisan compromise represents significant \nprogress. It is a vast improvement over current law. It will make sure \nthat a lot fewer criminals get their hands on guns. It will make our \nstreets and schools safer.\n\n  On the morning of December 14, I--along with Senator Murphy--pledged \nto do everything I could to make sure more parents will not have to \nbury their children because of preventable gun violence. Expanded \nbackground checks are part of that pledge, and we are helping to \nfulfill it by supporting it. This is only part of a bigger and more \ncomprehensive solution to this problem, but this compromise is a good \nstarting point for next week's debate on gun violence.\n  We have talked a lot about Newtown and the victims who have evoked \nour most powerful grief, breaking our hearts, and evoking memories of \nour own children at that age. As I said, I went to Newtown as a public \nofficial, but what I saw was through the eyes of a parent. Other \nvictims of loved ones evoke the same memories.\n  Today, I wish to evoke the memory of another tragedy that many of us \nin Connecticut remember well. It happened at Hartford Distributors, \nwhich is just outside Hartford.\n  On a beautiful morning, August 2, 2010--and a lot of what I am going \nto summarize comes from this great newspaper account which appeared in \nthe Hartford Courant shortly thereafter.\n  As the Courant reported:\n\n       In three minutes on that bright summer morning, Thornton \n     executed eight men, shooting them all from behind and \n     laughing at one point as he chased down a wounded victim.\n       Thornton went into a kitchenette near the office, saying \n     that he wanted a drink of water. He pulled a pistol from his \n     lunch pail and shot operations director Louis Felder. \n     Hollander said he heard Felder yell: ``Omar, you can't!'' \n     followed by loud bangs.\n       Hollander was hit by one of the bullets that passed through \n     Felder. As he crawled into his father's office--\n\n  Hartford Distributors is owned by the Hollander family.\n\n       Hollander heard Cirigliano yell--``Omar, no! Omar, no!'' \n     Thornton shot Cirigliano twice, once in the back of the head \n     and once in the forehead.\n\n  He systematically executed another six people after those two, and \nthen he killed himself.\n  The victims that day were men who came to work every day and had \nfamilies. They came to work expecting to come home at the end of the \nday. Their families expected them to come home. They were men who had \nworked in that place for many years by dint of their sweat and \nbackbreaking labor. They had come to a place in their lives where they \ncould enjoy it. They had enough financial security that they expected \nto enjoy it for some time. That day the killer deprived them of their \nfuture and their families' future as well.\n  Gun violence affects all of us in different ways. I have visited the \nmemorial that was established for the brave men who died that day at \nHartford Distributors. It is a quiet, peaceful place that is \nexquisitely and beautifully done. It evokes the memories of men who \ndied while they were on the job because of a deranged individual who \nwas, in fact, about to be fired.\n  Connecticut's experience with this kind of death extends to its own \nfacility. The State lottery experienced a similar horrific and brutal \nslaying. The scene played out in seconds, which seemed to take an \neternity, on a Friday morning.\n  It was a routine morning for dozens of State lottery office workers, \nand it turned into a nightmare of blood, fear, and betrayal. The \nshooter was named Matthew Beck, and he summarily executed men and women \nthere that day. Connecticut remembers those State employees who \nprovided public service day in and day out and were killed while they \nwere at work. Again, they were working men and women who wanted nothing \nmore than to go home safely that night.\n  My colleague, Chris Murphy, has recounted many stories. Many of the \nstories were about children. All of them had their future ahead of \nthem. Their future ended brutally and horrifically because of gun \nviolence.\n  We have taken a step today--a first step--hopefully followed by more \nsteps next week.\n  I wish to end by thanking Members of this Chamber for giving us the \nopportunity to debate and vote and say to the American people we are \nwilling to be held accountable.\n  The majority of American people want commonsense and sensible \nmeasures to end the violence on the streets, in our neighborhoods, and \nin our place of work, such as Hartford Distributors and the State \nlottery. We want to make sure the hard-working men and women who go to \ntheir jobs, play by the rules, and expect fairness have the opportunity \nto go home that night.\n  I thank this Chamber and the Members who voted today, and I hope \nthose Members will join us in the future so we can make sure fewer \nvictims perish as a result of this horrific epidemic in our country, \ngun violence.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp).

Mr. President, I rise to honor the Rotary Club of Carson \nCity. Celebrating 75 years of service to the community, the Rotary Club \nhas shown great dedication to America's ideals of prosperity, \neducation, and opportunity. It is my great honor to acknowledge the \nRotary Club of Carson City's rich history of service, particularly in \nlight of its recent anniversary.\n  Hans Jepson, president of the Minden Rotary Club, and the civic-\nminded Rev. John L. Harvey, began plans to create the Carson City \nRotary Club in the summer of 1937. The first meeting saw five attendees \nwho sketched plans for the organization's future. Their first plan of \naction was to add the Carson City Rotary Club to the Nevada roster.\n  After carefully selecting additional members, the Rotary Club of \nCarson City had its first official meeting on January 25, 1938. A month \nlater, it was accepted as a member of Rotary International--an \nachievement that reflected several months of earnest effort on the part \nof the pioneers of the local movement.\n  Initially comprised of only 25 men, the Rotary Club of Carson City \nhas since expanded to encompass almost 90 members. Ever mindful of the \norganization's previous motto ``He Profits Most Who Serves The Best'', \nthe members provide ``Service Above Self'' to the Carson City \ncommunity.\n  Since its founding, the Rotary Club of Carson City has realized many \naccomplishments, including its participation in the global campaign \nthat reduced transmission of the Polio Virus\n\n[[Page S2585]]\n\nby 99 percent since 1985 and its successful efforts to place a town \nhall clock in front of the Legislative Building of Carson City.\n  The Rotary Club has a special focus on education. It awards a 4-year \nscholarship to a non-traditional student and recognizes exceptional \neducators through Teacher of the Year and Teacher of the Month awards. \nIt also sponsors high school students' involvement both in the Rotary \nYouth Leadership Academy and the Rotary Youth Exchange Program, where \nstudents spend a year abroad and, host international students in Carson \nCity.\n  Moreover, the club supports various programs offered by FISH, Friends \nin Service Helping, Capital City Circles Initiative, Western Nevada \nBoys and Girls Club, and Food for Thought, in addition to its various \ncommunity service projects, such as Rotarians at Work Day.\n  I laud the Rotary Club of Carson City's dedication to the community \nand am pleased to congratulate its members on seventy-five much \nappreciated years of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/11/senate-section/article/S2585-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CRAIG WARNER\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to honor a man who has dedicated his \nlife to serving others, Craig Warner. Although this chapter of his \ncareer is coming to a close, his legacy in volunteerism will live on.\n  Craig began his career in public service by joining the Peace Corps \nafter graduating from Iowa State University. He spent two years in \nLesotho, Africa, after which he became a recruiter for the Peace Corps. \nHe then served for 16 years as a state program specialist with the \nACTION Agency in the Tennessee State Office supporting VISTA and Senior \nCorps programs. In 1991, he brought his expertise to Nevada. When \nACTION was replaced by the Corporation for National and Community \nService, CNCS, Governor Bob Miller made Craig one of the original \nappointees to CNCS, where he served as the state director for more than \n20 years.\n  Bringing his great sense of humor to every project he works on, Craig \nhas been a mentor in addition to director. Craig is a warm and \ncompassionate man with a kind heart, intent on doing everything \npossible to make life better for those seeking help. He has high \nexpectations for projects and pushes to make sure they are done right. \nEven so, he is always ready to lend a hand and give advice to make sure \nprojects are successful. Craig is an honest man who treats colleagues \nwith respect, genuine kindness, and interest.\n  Volunteerism is a vital component of every community, and I am proud \nto honor Craig for the tradition of service he has built in Nevada. \nWorking with the Nevada Commission for National and Community Service \nsince its inception, Craig has shaped the organization, now called \nNevada Volunteers, as well as the way Nevada has served its community \nfor the last 20 years.\n  Craig is to be commended for his more than 40 years of service to the \ncitizens of our State and to our Nation. He is an exemplary model for \nall Nevadans. I join in recognizing Craig and look forward to his \nfuture contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/11/senate-section/article/S2585-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MAYOR ARLENE MULDER\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Arlington Heights, IL, is known as the \nCity of Good Neighbors--and if you ask people there who best embodies \nthat spirit, there's a pretty good chance they'll answer: Mayor Arlene \nMulder.\n  After 20 years as mayor and more than three decades serving her \ncommunity, Mayor Mulder is retiring from public life in just a few \nweeks. I would like to personally acknowledge Arlene's significant \ncontributions to the people of Arlington Heights, thank her for her \ngood work, and wish her every success in the coming years.\n  Both in public service and private life, Mayor Mulder was always a \ngood neighbor. She worked to reduce aircraft noise, improve air quality \nand quality of life for residents, and to redevelop Arlington Heights' \ndowntown district.\n  Even outside her role as mayor, she always advocated for the people \nand businesses of Arlington Heights. As a member of the board of \ndirectors of Metra, Northeast Illinois' commuter rail system, Arlene \nworked to improve the region's transportation network because she \nunderstood that when cities and suburbs work together, everyone \nbenefits.\n  Those who know her well have nothing but good things to say about \nher. She practices an inclusive brand of leadership to bring people \ntogether and get results, genuinely cares about her community, and she \nreally listens to their needs.\n  I always knew that Arlene would aspire to the highest levels of \nprofessionalism in her work. She managed to conduct her work with a \nsmile--which you could see often at any of the daily public appearances \naround town for which she is well known.\n  While Mayor Mulder is ending her career in public life to spend more \ntime with her husband, children, and grandchildren, I know she'll \ncontinue to be a good neighbor to the Arlington Heights community. This \nis what she has always done. That is just who she is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/11/senate-section/article/S2585-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2585-S2586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for months, Members on both sides of the \naisle have been working to find common ground on ways to fix our broken \nimmigration system. This group has been meeting behind closed doors to \nforge a consensus on a very difficult topic. The group released a \nframework, or a document of principles, that would guide their \nnegotiations. I cannot stress the importance of the first sentence in \ntheir preamble that states: ``We will ensure that this is a successful \npermanent reform to our immigration system that will not need to be \nrevisited.'' In other words, the group claimed to understand that we \nneed a long-term solution to our immigration problems. That sentence is \nthe most important part of their document, and as we work together on \nthis issue, we must not lose sight of that goal.\n  In order to achieve that goal, we need to learn from our previous \nmistakes so that we truly don't have to revisit the problem. There is \nclear evidence that the 1986 amnesty program didn't solve our \nimmigration problem, despite the intent of the law. Even though, for \nthe first time ever, we made it illegal to knowingly hire or employ \nsomeone here illegally, illegal immigration soared because we rewarded \nthe undocumented population. We set penalties to deter the hiring of \npeople here illegally. Yet, an industry of counterfeiting and identity \ntheft flourished and made a mockery of the law.\n  Unfortunately, the 1986 law didn't adequately provide for securing \nour borders or provide the tools to enforce the laws, nor did it \nproperly address the need to create or enhance the legal avenues for \npeople to enter the country. The bill focused on legalizing millions of \npeople here rather than creating a system that would work for \ngenerations to come.\n  So, I have made a point of trying to remind my colleagues that we \nmust learn from the mistakes we made. As a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I have been adamant about making sure all members have an \nopportunity to review, analyze, and debate the bill. Along with other \nmembers, we have asked for hearings. We have pressed the bipartisan \ngroup to work with us and ensure that we have a deliberative and \nhealthy debate.\n  Unfortunately, this bipartisan group has failed to consult with many \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over \nimmigration matters. They are working with the Chamber of Commerce and \nthe AFL-CIO. They are sharing language with K Street and interest \ngroups. They are leaking details of their plans to certain media \noutlets. Yet, Members of the Senate are forced to learn through these \navenues about their negotiations. And, all along, the American people \nhave been in the dark.\n  When the bill is unveiled, possibly next week, every Member of the \nSenate will have questions. We will comb through the details and \ndetermine if the proposal will truly fix the problems once and for all. \nSo allow me to share some of the questions I have. In an effort to \nensure that the bill does what their framework insisted that the \nproblem be fixed once and for all I will ask these questions when the \nbill is finally revealed to the public.\n  Is this bill enforcement first or legalization first?\n  What is the expected cost? How will it be paid for?\n\n[[Page S2586]]\n\n  Will the bill ensure that undocumented immigrants don't get public \nbenefits?\n  Will the bill move us closer to a merit-based system?\n  Will the bill be an avenue for labor unions to push Davis Bacon?\n  What are the concrete metrics used to measure border security?\n  Who will determine that these metrics are met? Will it be Congress, a \ncommission or a Secretary who doesn't think that the border matters?\n  Will the entry/exit system Congress mandated in 1996 finally be \nimplemented? Will it be a part of the trigger?\n  Will the language be tight enough to prevent criminals--those with \nDUIs and other aggravated felonies from being eligible for \nlegalization?\n  Will individuals already apprehended, or people in removal \nproceedings be eligible or even allowed to apply for the legalization \nprogram?\n  Will the bill ensure that the legalization program is covered by \nbeneficiaries, and not taxpayers?\n  What will happen to individuals who do not come forward and register \nor get provisional status?\n  What will happen if the border is never secured? What will be the \nconsequences, including for those who have already received registered \nprovisional status?\n  Will the agency in charge of immigration benefits be able to handle \nthe additional workload while also preventing fraud and abuse?\n  Will the bill encourage cooperation between the Federal Government \nand State and locals to enforce the laws?\n  How will the bill ensure that ICE agents are allowed to do their job?\n  Will E-Verify be mandatory for all businesses? Will there be \nexceptions to the rule?\n  Will the bill require all businesses to use E-Verify now or will it \ndrag out the requirement even though it is ready to go nationwide?\n  Will the bill exempt or preserve State laws that require E-Verify?\n  What are the concessions to the unions and to the business community?\n  Will the new temporary worker program, which is a new model \nencompassing instant portability, truly work? How will employers be \nheld responsible for the visa holders, if at all?\n  Is the new temporary worker program truly temporary? Will they get a \nspecial green card process?\n  Will the bill exempt certain industries, such as construction, from \nthis new visa program?\n  Will the 11 million people here illegally get priority in this new \ntemporary worker program? Will they be able to use it?\n  Will the bill require employers to first recruit and hire Americans?\n  We have a long road ahead of us to pass legislation to reform our \nimmigration system. We will have many more questions and, hopefully, a \ntransparent and deliberative process to improve the bill. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on this issue and solving the \nproblem once and for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/11/senate-section/article/S2586-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2586-S2587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today I wish to share a startling fact with \nthe American public. For the first time since the President has been \nrequired to submit a budget--since 1922, 91 years ago--the President \nfailed to provide a budget proposal before the Senate passed one. This \nyear the President's budget proposal was submitted to Congress 65 days \nlate. And even with that extra time to find solutions that would \njumpstart the economy, the budget proposed by the President continues \nthe policies that have led to anemic economic growth and stagnant job \ncreation--more taxes, more spending, more government.\n  The last time we voted on the President's budget, it received zero \nvotes. Let me repeat that--zero votes. Not even the members of his own \nparty supported his budget. Since the President's budget is arriving \nafter we have already taken up a budget here in the Senate, I doubt \nthat we will vote on this proposal. But I don't think it's a stretch to \nsay that a vote on this budget might obtain the same result.\n  We have already heard cries from members of his own party that he is \nincluded proposals they don't like for example, a provision called \n``chained CPI'' that changes the inflation measurement for many Federal \nprograms, such as Social Security, and for certain provisions of the \ntax code. The President's budget estimates that this provision will \nreduce the deficit by nearly $230 billion over 10 years. And a budget \nsuch as the President's that raises taxes by nearly $1 trillion over \nthe next 10 years--and that is in addition to the $600 billion in tax \nincreases that went into effect earlier this year certainly will not \nwin over any members on my side of the aisle. While there are some \nprovisions in this budget I might support, the budget taken as a whole \nis a far cry from what we need to get the country on the right fiscal \npath.\n  The President and his party like to talk about a so-called ``balanced \napproach.'' But there is nothing balanced about a budget proposal that \nraises taxes by nearly $1 trillion and can't even balance. That is \nright the President's budget does not balance in any of the next 10 \nyears. What we really need is a budget that gets us to balance and puts \nus on a path to start paying down our country's $16 trillion debt. We \nhave to start paying down the debt.\n  The President's budget proposal would increase taxes as a percent of \nthe Nation's total output, or GDP, each year over the next 10 years, \nresulting in revenues as a percent of GDP at 20 percent in fiscal year \n2023. The average rate over the past 40 years has been approximately 18 \npercent of GDP. The U.S. has balanced the budget 12 times since World \nWar II. The average revenue for those 12 years was 18 percent of GDP. \nThese numbers tell the story--our problem is not that we tax too little \nbut that we spend too much. I have introduced a bill called the Penny \nPlan that cuts spending by one percent for each of the next three \nyears, and balances the budget in 2016. Our Nation owes over $16 \ntrillion and no one is talking about reducing it. We have to get to \nbalance--the sooner the better--and start paying down the debt.\n  I am very disappointed, but not surprised, that the President yet \nagain has not taken the opportunity to fully address the drivers of our \ngrowing deficits and debt spending programs such as Medicare and Social \nSecurity. The President won his re-election last year. The time for \ncampaigning is over; it is time to start governing and make the tough \nchoices to save these programs for current and future beneficiaries.\n  I said this during the debate on the majority's budget resolution a \nfew weeks ago, and it is worth repeating now we need to grow the \neconomy, not the government. One of the ways we can grow the economy is \nby reforming our outdated tax code. We have to lower tax rates and \nbroaden the tax base and make the tax code simpler and fairer for all \ntaxpayers. I was happy to see the President's budget call for revenue-\nneutral business tax reform. But then I read the fine print and \nrealized the President was calling for lowering the corporate tax rate \nonly and by paying for it by increasing taxes on U.S. multinational \ncompanies and oil and gas companies. I agree we need to lower the \ncorporate tax rate. We also need to fix our outdated international tax \nsystem so we don't hamper our U.S. multinational companies from \ncompeting globally. And I have an international tax reform bill that \naddresses those issues. But in addition to lowering the corporate tax \nrate, we have to ensure we address the taxes paid by so-called ``flow-\nthrough'' businesses these are the partnerships, S-corporations, and \nlimited liability companies. Just fixing the corporate side doesn't \nhelp the millions of businesses structured as flow-through entities. I \nappreciate the President wanting to do revenue-neutral corporate tax \nreform. But that only addresses part of the problem.\n  I generally don't like to do things ``comprehensively.'' We should do \nlegislation in smaller parts so people can understand what is in them \nand can vote for and against the things they support and don't support. \nBut given the interaction between the individual and corporate side of \nthe tax code, we really need to look at them together and make sure \nchanges we make in one area don't make things worse in another area.\n  So now we have finally seen the President's budget proposal. And \nwhile there are a few good things in it, I am sorry to tell my \nconstituents back in Wyoming and the American public that the President \nhas yet again failed to\n\n[[Page S2587]]\n\nseize the opportunity to move the country's economy forward. It is more \ntaxes, more spending, more government. That is not the recipe for \ngrowing the economy. I hope that over the coming months the President \nand his party will work with me and the Members on my side of the aisle \nto fix our tax code, both individual and corporate, and reform our \nspending on programs such as Medicare and Social Security. The American \npeople deserve nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/11/senate-section/article/S2587-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Pennsylvania \nState University as the school celebrates 150 years of history. April \n1, 2013, marked this monumental anniversary when Pennsylvania \ndesignated the then-Agricultural College of Pennsylvania to be the sole \nland grant college in the Commonwealth. Of course the Agricultural \nCollege would eventually become Pennsylvania State College in 1874 and \nPennsylvania State University in 1953.\n  While maintaining its agriculture base, Penn State expanded its focus \nshortly after opening its doors to students and began offering degrees \nin liberal arts and other fields. Notably, Penn State quickly became \none of the Nation's largest engineering schools in the late 19th \ncentury.\n  Today, the Pennsylvania State University is the largest university in \nthe Commonwealth and grants more baccalaureate degrees than any other \nschool in Pennsylvania, and it has one of the largest graduate schools \nin the country. In all, Penn State offers students the opportunity to \npursue studies in more than 150 different disciplines. Penn State \ngraduates have gone on to great success in agriculture, engineering, \nbusiness, law, medicine, academia, government, and sports. Enrollment \nat Penn State's 20 undergraduate campuses, the World Campus, the \nGraduate School, the Dickinson School of Law, the College of Medicine, \nand the College of Technology is approaching 100,000. Penn State can \nboast that 1 in every 117 Americans with a college degree is an alumni \nof Pennsylvania State University. That is quite an achievement. It has \nbeen a great success, and has served Pennsylvania, and the Nation, \nwell.\n  Penn State has also created an environment that promotes the \nimportance of public service and volunteer work. Most notably, Penn \nState students participate in an annual fundraiser known as THON, which \nbenefits pediatric cancer care and research. THON culminates each year \nwith a multiday dance marathon at the Bryce Jordan Center. Since its \ninception in 1977, THON has raised more than $100 million. In 2013 \nalone, THON raised nearly $12.5 million for pediatric cancer. These \nfundraising efforts are truly remarkable and Penn State students should \nbe proud of all they have done to help children and families who are \nfighting pediatric cancer.\n  In addition to THON, Penn State University also hosts annual events \nsuch as Ag Progress Days, the Engineering Design Showcase, and the Arts \nFestival Weekend. All of these events bring together Penn State \nstudents, alumni, and other interested parties by providing a forum \nwhere relevant technological advances in the related fields, best \nbusiness practices between interacting disciplines and creative \ninnovation can be shared and displayed for the betterment of all \ninvolved.\n  Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, I should recognize the \noutstanding faculty who make Penn State what it is. The faculty at Penn \nState are leaders in their respective fields and conduct cutting edge \nresearch in numerous disciplines. The success of the university is \ndependent on the high quality faculty who dedicated their lives to \nacademia, and all of the Penn State faculty should be proud of their \naccomplishments. They are educating the next generation of leaders, \nand, through their research, are bettering the lives of people \nthroughout the Commonwealth, Nation, and the world.\n  Again, I want to congratulate Pennsylvania State University on \nreaching this milestone. You make the Commonwealth a better place, and \nI am confident the next 150 years of accomplishments will be even \ngreater than the last.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/11/senate-section/article/S2587-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S FUNERAL TRAIN\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \nlife and legacy of an outstanding leader and friend, Shoshone-Paiute \nTribal Chairman Terry Gibson. He left a lasting mark in his far too few \nyears of life.\n  Terry carried an absolute commitment to better the lives of the \npeople he led and those of future generations. He had a deep \nunderstanding of the strengths and challenges of the Shoshone-Paiute \nTribes, and he focused on making progress. Prior to serving as \nchairman, he served on the tribal council and worked as health \ndirector, compliance officer and natural resource director for the \ntribes. His experience and knowledge contributed to his exemplary \nleadership.\n  He was dedicated to encouraging tribal youth to achieve educational \nand career success, and he worked to address unemployment, domestic \nviolence and poverty. Terry furthered the mission of protecting and \npreserving the Shoshone-Paiute tribal culture and natural resources \nwhile also assisting and encouraging the economic development of the \ntribes. He was mindful of ensuring future generations would also have \nthe opportunity to benefit from our resources.\n  We worked together on projects to benefit tribal members, and he was \nalways a trusted partner and strong leader with the courage and \nforesight to tackle the many issues facing the tribes. He is recognized \nas a dedicated leader who thoughtfully carried out his duties in \nadvancing the objectives of the tribal membership. Terry was a \nsensible, strong and reliable voice.\n  The unexpected passing of Chairman Gibson brings great sadness to the \ntribes, the Owyhee area, Idaho and me. My prayers are with his wife, \nDebbie, his children, his family, the people he led, and the many lives \nhe reached. I join his family members and many friends in mourning his \nloss. I am thankful I had the opportunity to know Terry and work with \nhim. While Terry will be sorely missed, his legacy will endure. His \nsteady and dedicated leadership will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/11/senate-section/article/S2587-4", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2587-S2588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JESSE DAUNIS\n\n Mr. HELLER.

Our Nation's \nservicemembers have made great sacrifices\n\n[[Page S2588]]\n\nfor our country, and they deserve our gratitude and support. We must \nwelcome them home and help them transition to civilian life. Assisting \nour Nation's veterans and families is of the utmost importance.\n  I am grateful Mr. Daunis is raising awareness for an issue about \nwhich I care deeply. Having a family member who has served in the Armed \nForces, I have always been an advocate for our troops. As a member of \nthe United States Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, I will continue \nto vocalize my support for our servicemembers. I applaud Mr. Daunis for \nundertaking this 448-mile journey over 18 days from Reno to Las Vegas, \nand I stand with him.\n  Mr. Daunis' selfless efforts to honor and acknowledge our Nation's \nveterans embodies the value of service over self. I commend Mr. Daunis \nfor his steadfast determination in raising awareness for those who keep \nus safe. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. \nDaunis for his service to our country and commitment to helping \nveterans in need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/11/senate-section/article/S2588-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LAURA HODSON\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. HIRONO (for herself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 703. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nprovide for the eligibility of the Hong Kong Special Administration \nRegion for designation for participation in the visa waiver program for \ncertain visitors to the United States; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 703 with \nSenator Hatch to fix a technical problem that prevents Hong Kong from \njoining the Visa Waiver Program. Under current law, only ``countries'' \nare eligible for the program, and Hong Kong is not a sovereign country, \nso a special provision needs to be added to the law to make Hong Kong \neligible.\n  On July 1, 1997, after over 150 years of British rule, Hong Kong \nbecame a Special Administrative Region of China, retaining its own \ncurrency, free market economy, political system, civil liberties, and \nimmigration policies. This autonomy was recognized by the United States \nand affirmed by Congress in passing the United States-Hong Kong Policy \nAct.\n  Today we have a robust bilateral relationship with Hong Kong, a \nglobal financial and trading hub, which was our 10th largest export \nmarket last year and whose trade ties are significant for many States. \nThe State Department considers Hong Kong an important law enforcement \npartner in combating money laundering and eliminating funding for \nterrorist networks.\n  Despite our visa policies treating it separate from Mainland China, \nbecause it is not a ``country,'' Hong Kong is unable to be considered \nfor the Visa Waiver Program. The Visa Waiver Program is an essential \ntool for promoting travel and tourism to America while protecting \nnational security by allowing precleared business and leisure travelers \nfrom 37 countries to visit the U.S. for up to 90 days without obtaining \na nonimmigrant visitor visa.\n  Hong Kong has secured visa waivers for its passport holders from over \n140 countries and territories, including allies such as Canada, \nAustralia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and all member states of \nthe European Union. Hong Kong has already extended visa waivers to \nAmerican citizens. Our laws shouldn't be a barrier to do the same in \nthe future.\n  As our largest industry, tourism is important to Hawaii, especially \nfrom Asia. Our largest source of foreign tourists comes from Japan, a \nvisa waiver country since 1988. In 2011, domestic and international \nvisitors to Hawaii spent $16.9 billion which supported 160,800 jobs in \nthe islands according to the U.S. Travel Association.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bipartisan, commonsense \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. \n        Heitkamp, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, and Mr. \n        Wyden):\n  S. 706. A bill to provide the Department of Justice with additional \ntools\n\n[[Page S2591]]\n\nto target extraterritorial drug trafficking activity, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Transnational \nDrug Trafficking Act of 2013 with my colleagues and friends, Senator \nCharles Grassley, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Senator Heidi Heitkamp, \nSenator Amy Klobuchar, Senator Tom Udall and Senator Ron Wyden.\n  This bill, which passed the Senate unanimously in the last Congress, \nwill support the Obama administration's Strategy to Combat \nTransnational Organized Crime by providing the Department of Justice \nwith crucial tools to help combat the international drug trade. As drug \ntraffickers find new and innovative ways to avoid prosecution, we must \nkeep up with them rather than allowing them to exploit loopholes as our \nlaws lag behind.\n  This legislation has three main components. First, it puts in place \npenalties for extraterritorial drug trafficking activity when \nindividuals have reasonable cause to believe that illegal drugs will be \ntrafficked into the United States. Current law says that drug \ntraffickers must know that illegal drugs will be trafficked into the \nUnited States and this legislation would lower the knowledge threshold \nto reasonable cause to believe.\n  The Department of Justice has informed my office that with increasing \nfrequency, it sees drug traffickers from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru who \nproduce cocaine in their countries but leave transit of cocaine to the \nUnited States in the hands of Mexican drug trafficking organizations \nsuch as the Zetas. Under current law, our ability to prosecute source-\nnation traffickers from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru is limited since \nthere is often no direct evidence of their knowledge that illegal drugs \nwere intended for the United States. But make no mistake, drugs \nproduced in these countries fuel violent crime throughout the Western \nHemisphere as well as addiction and death in the United States.\n  Second, this bill puts in place penalties for precursor chemical \nproducers from other countries, such as those producing pseudoephedrine \nused for methamphetamine, who illegally ship precursor chemicals into \nthe United States knowing that these chemicals will be used to make \nillegal drugs.\n  Third, this bill will make a technical fix to the Counterfeit Drug \nPenalty Enhancement Act which was signed into law last year and \nincreases penalties for the trafficking of counterfeit drugs. The fix, \nrequested by the Department of Justice, puts in place a ``knowing'' \nrequirement which was unintentionally left out of the original bill. \nThe original bill makes the mere sale of a drug that happens to be \ncounterfeit a federal felony offense regardless of whether the seller \nknew the drug was counterfeit. Under the original bill, a pharmacist \ncould be held criminally liable if he or she unwittingly sold \ncounterfeit drugs to a customer. Adding a ``knowing'' requirement \ncorrects this problem.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control \nand as a public servant who has focused on law enforcement issues for \nmany years, I know that we cannot sit idly by as drug traffickers find \nnew ways to circumvent our laws. We must provide the Department of \nJustice with all of the tools it needs to prosecute drug kingpins both \nhere at home and abroad.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 706\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Transnational Drug \n     Trafficking Act of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. POSSESSION, MANUFACTURE OR DISTRIBUTION FOR PURPOSES \n                   OF UNLAWFUL IMPORTATIONS.\n\n       Section 1009 of the Controlled Substances Import and Export \n     Act (21 U.S.C. 959) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (b) and (c) as subsections \n     (c) and (d), respectively; and\n       (2) in subsection (a), by striking ``It shall'' and all \n     that follows and inserting the following: ``It shall be \n     unlawful for any person to manufacture or distribute a \n     controlled substance in schedule I or II or flunitrazepam or \n     a listed chemical intending, knowing, or having reasonable \n     cause to believe that such substance or chemical will be \n     unlawfully imported into the United States or into waters \n     within a distance of 12 miles of the coast of the United \n     States.\n       ``(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture or \n     distribute a listed chemical--\n       ``(1) intending or knowing that the listed chemical will be \n     used to manufacture a controlled substance; and\n       ``(2) intending, knowing, or having reasonable cause to \n     believe that the controlled substance will be unlawfully \n     imported into the United States.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. TRAFFICKING IN COUNTERFEIT GOODS OR SERVICES.\n\n       Chapter 113 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in section 2318(b)(2), by striking ``section 2320(e)'' \n     and insertion ``section 2320(f)''; and\n       (2) in section 2320--\n       (A) in subsection (a), by striking paragraph (4) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(4) traffics in a drug and knowingly uses a counterfeit \n     mark on or in connection with such drug,'';\n       (B) in subsection (b)(3), in the matter preceding \n     subparagraph (A), by striking ``counterfeit drug'' and \n     inserting ``drug that uses a counterfeit mark on or in \n     connection with the drug''; and\n       (C) in subsection (f), by striking paragraph (6) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(6) the term `drug' means a drug, as defined in section \n     201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n     321).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Franken, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \n        Whitehouse, Mr. Sanders, and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 707. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to extend \nthe reduced interest rate for Federal Direct Stafford Loans; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, once again, on July 1, millions of college \nstudents will see the interest rate double on their student loans from \n3.4 percent to 6.8 percent unless Congress takes action. Borrowers will \npay an estimated $1,000 more in interest on their loans each year of \nrepayment if Congress fails to act.\n  Student loan debt is second only to mortgage debt for American \nfamilies. Now is not the time to add to student loan debt by allowing \nthe interest rate on need-based student loans to double. I am pleased \nto introduce the Student Loan Affordability Act with my colleagues \nSenator Al Franken, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Senator Debbie \nStabenow, Senator Sherrod Brown, and Senator Bernie Sanders to maintain \nthe current 3.4 percent interest rate for the next 2 years, as we work \ntowards a long-term solution in the reauthorization of the Higher \nEducation Act.\n  Last Congress, we narrowly averted a doubling of the interest rate on \nneed-based student loans. It took thousands of calls, letters, and \nrallies from students and parents across the country and our concerted \neffort to negotiate a bipartisan solution. However, we were only able \nto get a temporary, 1-year fix.\n  The budget passed by the House Republicans assumes a doubling of the \ninterest rate. In stark contrast, the budget resolution we passed last \nmonth accommodates legislation to keep rates low.\n  We need to come together to develop long-term solutions to the \ngrowing burden of student loan debt, the rising cost of college, and \nthe need to improve higher education outcomes so that students complete \ntheir degrees and get the full benefit of their investment in \neducation. Everyone agrees that college costs are too high and climbing \nhigher. Families will be priced out of a college education, even with \ngrants and loans, if we do not take real action on curbing cost \nincreases.\n  What we can do right now is reassure students and families that we \nwill not allow the interest rate to double this July at a time when \ninterest rates are at historic lows.\n  Student loan debt affects millions of Americans. Two-thirds of the \nclass of 2011 graduated owing student loans, with an average debt of \n$26,000. Student loan debt has passed the $1 trillion mark--exceeding \ncredit card debt. Moreover, the students and families we are trying to \nhelp with the Student Loan Affordability Act have demonstrated economic \nneed. Indeed, approximately 60 percent of the dependent students who \nqualify for subsidized loans come from families with incomes of less \nthan $60,000.\n\n[[Page S2592]]\n\n  The question before us is will we make the student loan debt burden \nworse by allowing interest rates to double or will we take action to \nprotect low and moderate income students.\n  We need to act fast. July 1 is only 81 days away. I urge all our \ncolleagues to join us in supporting the Student Loan Affordability Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Coons):\n  S. 712. A bill to allow acceleration certificates awarded under the \nPatents for Humanity Program to be transferrable; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the American intellectual property system \nis rightly held as the global standard for promoting innovation and \ndriving economic growth. This is particularly true of our patent \nsystem, which was recently updated and strengthened for the 21st \ncentury by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. The fundamental truth \nthat our Founders recognized more than 200 years ago--that limited \nexclusive rights for inventors incentivize research and development--\ncontinues to benefit consumers and the American economy at large.\n  These limited rights can also be applied to incentivize research and \ndiscoveries that advance humanitarian needs. In my time in the Senate, \nI have worked to promote policies that encourage intellectual property \nholders to apply their work to address global humanitarian challenges. \nToday, I am pleased to join with Senator Coons in reintroducing the \nPatents for Humanity Program Improvement Act to again advance such \npolicies.\n  This legislation improves on a program created by the United States \nPatent and Trademark Office, PTO, last year. The PTO's Patents for \nHumanity Program provides rewards to selected patent holders who apply \ntheir technology to a humanitarian issue that significantly affects the \npublic health or quality of life of an impoverished population. Those \nwho receive the award are given a certificate to accelerate certain PTO \nprocesses.\n  This year, the innovations that received awards touched on critical \nareas that will help improve the quality of life for people throughout \nthe world. Award winners worked to improve the treatment and diagnosis \nof devastating diseases, improve nutrition and the environment, and \ncombat the spread of dangerous counterfeit drugs. These are innovations \nthat will make a real difference in the lives of people in the \ndeveloping world and elsewhere.\n  Following a Judiciary Committee hearing last year, I asked PTO \nDirector Kappos whether the Patents for Humanity program would be more \neffective, and more attractive to innovators, if the acceleration \ncertificates awarded were transferable to a third party. He responded \nthat it would, and that it would be particularly beneficial to small \nbusinesses. The Patents for Humanity Program Improvement Act makes \nthese acceleration certificates transferrable. It is a straightforward, \ncost-neutral bill that will strengthen this useful program.\n  When Congress can establish policies that provide business incentives \nfor humanitarian endeavors, it should not hesitate to act. I urge the \nSenate to work swiftly to pass this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 712\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

TRANSFERABILITY OF ACCELERATION CERTIFICATES.\n\n       (a) In General.--A holder of an acceleration certificate \n     issued pursuant to the Patents for Humanity Program \n     (established in the notice entitled ``Humanitarian Awards \n     Pilot Program'', published at 77 Fed. Reg. 6544 (February 8, \n     2012)), or any successor thereto, of the United States Patent \n     and Trademark Office, may transfer (including by sale) the \n     entitlement to such acceleration certificate to another \n     person.\n       (b) Requirement.--An acceleration certificate transferred \n     under subsection (a) shall be subject to any other applicable \n     limitations under the notice entitled ``Humanitarian Awards \n     Pilot Program'', published at 77 Fed. Reg. 6544 (February 8, \n     2012), or any successor thereto.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 713. A bill to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act to add Rhode Island to the Mid-Atlantic Fishery \nManagement Council; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague Senator \nWhitehouse, I am introducing the Rhode Island Fishermen's Fairness Act \nof 2013.\n  For nearly a decade, I have worked to give the fishermen of my state \nfull participation in the management of the fish stocks that they rely \non for their livelihoods.\n  The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act \nestablished eight regional fishery management councils to give \nfishermen and other stakeholders the leading role in developing the \nfishery management plans for federally-regulated species. As such, the \ncouncils have enormous significance on the lives and livelihoods of \nfishermen. To ensure equitable representation, the statute sets out the \nstates from which appointees are to be drawn for each council.\n  Under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the State of Rhode Island was granted \nvoting membership on the New England Fishery Management Council, NEFMC, \nas NEFMC-managed stocks represent a significant percentage of landings \nand revenue for the state. However, while Rhode Island's participation \nin the New England fishery remains important, its stake in the Mid-\nAtlantic fishery has become more critical. Yet, it does not have voting \nrepresentation on the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, MAFMC, \nwhich currently consists of representatives from New York, New Jersey, \nDelaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina.\n  Rhode Island's stake in the Mid-Atlantic fishery is hardly \nincidental. According to National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA, data, Rhode Island accounted for approximately 20 \npercent of the commercial catch from this fishery in 2012, and its \nlandings are greater than the combined total of landings for the States \nof New York, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and North \nCarolina. In fact, New Jersey is the only state currently represented \non the MAFMC that lands more MAFMC-regulated species than Rhode Island.\n  While Rhode Island is represented on some policy-setting committees \non the MAFMC, its position on those committees is not guaranteed nor \ndoes the state have a vote on matters as they come before the full \ncouncil. Having that representation can be critically important to \nRhode Island as decisions are made on critical stocks like squid, which \ncomprised 40 percent of the state's annual landings in 2012 according \nto NOAA data, and is a major part of our commercial fishing sector.\n  This legislation offers Rhode Island that voice. Following current \npractice, the Rhode Island Fishermen's Fairness Act would create two \nseats on the MAFMC for Rhode Island: one seat appointed by the \nSecretary of Commerce based on recommendations from the Governor of \nRhode Island, and a second seat filled by Rhode Island's principal \nState official with marine fishery management responsibility. To \naccommodate these new members, the MAFMC would increase in size from 21 \nvoting members to 23.\n  There is precedent for this type of change. North Carolina was added \nto the MAFMC through an amendment to the Sustainable Fisheries Act in \n1996. Like Rhode Island, a significant proportion of North Carolina's \nlanded fish species were managed by the MAFMC, yet the state had no \nvote on the council.\n  With mounting economic, ecological, and regulatory challenges, it is \nmore important than ever that Rhode Island's fishermen have a voice in \nthe management of the fisheries on which they depend. I look forward to \nworking with Senator Whitehouse and my other colleagues to restore a \nmeasure of equity to the fisheries management process by passing the \nRhode Island Fishermen's Fairness Act.\n\n[[Page S2593]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 716.

A bill to create jobs in the United States by increasing \nUnited States exports to Africa by at least 200 percent in real dollar \nvalue within 10 years, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Increasing American \nJobs through Greater Exports to Africa Act of 2013.\n  I am introducing this bill along with my partners from the last \nCongress. Senator Chris Coons from the State of Delaware is in the \nChamber, the chair of the African Affairs Subcommittee of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. Senators John Boozman, Ben Cardin, and \nMary Landrieu have joined us in this bipartisan effort. We expect \nRepresentatives Chris Smith and Karen Bass will soon introduce \ncompanion legislation in the House.\n  This is a very straightforward, commonsense piece of legislation.\n  It is about creating jobs, American jobs. Every $1 billion in exports \nfrom America supports over 5,000 jobs. This bill seeks to expand U.S. \nexports specifically to Africa by 200 percent in real dollar value over \nthe next 10 years. The African market is ripe for greater American \ncommercial engagement. In the past 10 years, people do not believe \nthis, but they should take a look at the facts. In the past 10 years, \nsix of the worlds fastest growing economies were located in Sub-Saharan \nAfrica.\n  In the next decade, 7 of the top 10 will be in Sub-Saharan Africa. \nThe mental image which most Americans have of Africa is completely out \nof date. Africa is growing, not only in population but in economic \nactivity. The middle class of Africa is growing as well. Their appetite \nfor goods and service puts an opportunity before us to export from \nAmerica and to create good jobs in our country with exports to Africa.\n  In the last decade, the number of Africans with access to the \nInternet has doubled. From 1998 to today, the number of mobile phones \non the continent has grown from 4 million to 500 million. Seventy-eight \npercent of Africa's rural population now has access to clean water. \nOver the last 10 years, real income per person in Africa has increased \nby more than 30 percent. Positive health outcomes are increasing. \nEnrollment in school is growing.\n  These are signs of a growing middle class and what the World Bank has \ncalled the brink of an economic takeoff in Africa. As my colleague and \nfriend Senator Coons has noted, in a report he recently released on the \ntopic, economic growth in Africa has risen dramatically in recent \nyears. But the continent's vast economic potential has not yet been \nfully realized by the U.S. Government or the American people.\n  That report from Senator Coons could not have been more timely and \naccurate as far as I am concerned. I can tell you, American companies \nare eager to get into the African market. They should be. But they \noften face a private finance system that is stuck, thinking about \nAfrica through the prism of the past: wars, famine, strongmen \ndictators.\n  I have met with these company leaders, large and small companies \nalike. They tell me the same thing: The U.S. does not have a \ncoordinated strategy for Africa. Others do. China and others are \ngaining a foothold in Africa at the expense of our workers. Yesterday, \nthe Ambassador from Algeria came to see me. It is a country that has a \nfascinating background, colonized like most of the countries in Africa. \nIt went through a storied period of independence in the 1960s and has \nFrench roots. The Ambassador said: We pride ourselves, we believe we \nspeak better French than the people living in France. That is their \npast.\n  I asked them about their future. I said: What is the presence of \nChina in Algeria today? He said: It is a growing presence. When it \ncomes to the infrastructure of Algeria, it is China that is playing a \nmajor role. It is China that is loaning the money to Algeria to build \nthe roads and the bridges and the airports. But there is a catch. You \nwant\n\n[[Page S2594]]\n\nto borrow the money from China? There will be Chinese architects, \nChinese engineers, Chinese contractors, and half the workforce will be \nChinese.\n  Pretty soon they will have become part of Algeria. The next time \nthere is a decision, whether it is for a telecommunications system, \nwhatever it might be, you can bet the Chinese, with a history of \nworking with the Algerian Government, will be first in line.\n  They know what is happening there. Africa is developing its economy \nand they are part of it. They see Africa from two or three different \nperspectives. First, obviously, it is an opportunity to sell things. It \nis a market. Second, it can provide basic resources and energy needed \nby the Chinese. Third, as the middle class grows in each of these \ncountries, the appetite for more and more economic activity will grow.\n  There was a time when America knew that too. There was a time when we \nvisited the four corners of the world looking for those same \nopportunities. We are sitting back now and watching. As we watch, China \nis moving. As I have said many times, the U.S. system of export, \npromotion, and finance is so poorly coordinated that it is a shame we \nare losing so many opportunities.\n  We have dozens of government agencies that are supposed to be working \non this problem. I called many of them in my office. It was the first \ntime some of them had met one another. They are supposed to be working \ntogether. This bill we are introducing will fix it. It would require a \ncoordinated government strategy to help increase U.S. exports to \nAfrica.\n  Responsibility for overseeing the implementation of this strategy \nwould be vested in a single position, one coordinator. No more agencies \ntripping over one another. No more competing priorities. Every day we \ndelay, China and, I might add, India and others will fill the void if \nAmerica does not step forward.\n  Since 2009, China has been Africa's largest trading partner. It has \nflooded the continent with billions of dollars building high-profile \nconstruction projects. Often the assistance comes in the form of \nconcessional loans, loans that, frankly, suggest you can borrow $100 \nmillion, you only have to pay back $70 million. That practice distorts \nmarkets, puts our companies in America at a disadvantage.\n  Between 2008 and 2010, China provided more to the developing world \nthan the World Bank, to the tune of $110 billion. Currently, China's \nexports to Africa outnumber America's three to one. The Chinese get it. \nShould America not get it? Through this engagement, the Chinese are \nbecoming major players all over Africa. I defy you to find a country in \nAfrica where the Chinese are not already a part of the economy and part \nof the economic conversation.\n  Recently, Senegal's President Macky Sall told President Obama exactly \nthat in a meeting at the White House, arguing the West should pay as \nmuch attention to Africa as China does. I have heard the same thing \nfirsthand, not just from the Algerian Ambassador but from the former \nPresident of Ethiopia. Across the continent, it is the same question: \nWhere is the United States?\n  This bill answers the question. No longer would Africans wonder why \nAmerican companies were not doing business there. The bill bolsters \nU.S. Government ability to support these companies, maintains a solid \npresence of U.S. commercial Foreign Service officers. It is going to \nhelp small and medium businesses in the United States compete in \nAfrica. It will increase the focus of the Export-Import Bank, giving it \ngreater incentive to aggressively counter those concessional loans. It \nwill help the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation more quickly process applications so we can be competitive.\n\n  Last Congress we almost passed this bill. One would almost think that \nit is a no-brainer. But, unfortunately, we did not. One Senator \nobjected. He had the courage to come to the floor and voice his \nobjections. I appreciate that very much. But at the same time, on the \nother side of the aisle, Senators Johnson, Coburn, and Corker were \nworking with me to pass the bill. So we have not given up on making \nthis a successful bipartisan effort.\n  I think the United States cannot stand by the sidelines just to say \nwe believe in a market economy, get the government out of the picture \nis to overlook the obvious. The Chinese Government is in the picture, \nand they are running circles around American companies because of it. \nIn thinking about the issue, we must also not ignore the interests of \nthe Africans themselves--something sometimes our competitors do not \nfocus on.\n  Chinese engagement comes with a price. China gobbles up natural \nresources that are needed many times for that growing domestic economy. \nThe infrastructure projects, as I mentioned, often come with Chinese \nprofessionals: architects and engineers and workers. When local labor \nis used, African workers often suffer poor labor standards, if the \nChinese are in charge. Environmental standards are ignored. They should \nbe a priority all over the world. We also have to factor in the cost of \nhaving to replace products and goods much sooner because, sadly, the \nChinese workmanship as well as the quality of their goods does not \nmatch what the United States can bring.\n  I also wish to mention a growing problem that stems from China's \npresence in Africa; that is, the resurgence of elephant poaching and \nivory trafficking. Several recent New York Times articles have \nhighlighted tens of thousands of elephants have been slaughtered.\n  One may say: I thought we solved this a few years ago with a \nworldwide ivory ban. It turns out ivory is so popular in the Chinese \nculture in part of its burgeoning population, one item is sought as an \nultimate status symbol in China: Ivory. Reports are that as much as 70 \npercent of the ivory harvested from slaughtered elephants is smuggled \nto China. In fact, there is growing evidence that ivory poaching \nactually increases in elephant-rich areas where the Chinese \nconstruction workers are building roads.\n  Even more troubling, the Chinese demand for ivory funds some of the \nmost despicable actors in Africa. Much of the proceeds from the illegal \nivory trade ended up in the hands of Joseph Kony and his murderous \ngroup the Lord's Resistance Army. I recently went to Uganda and met two \nof the victims of Joseph Kony. He is a madman. He has used his beatific \nvisions to generate an Army of slaves, literally soldier slaves. I met \none of them, a young man who was dragged out of his African village in \nUganda.\n  Everybody was lined up at the village as Kony and his soldiers stood \naround with their automatic weapons. They said to this young man: You \nare going to join our army here or we are going to kill you. Before you \njoin the army, though, there is one thing we have to ask you: Who would \nyou spare among the members of your family here? We are going to kill \nthe rest of them. Which one would you spare?\n  The young man said, after some hesitation: My father. They walked \nover and killed his father first. That is the kind of ruthless madman \nwe are dealing with in Joseph Kony. Believe me, President Obama has \nrecently put a target on his back. We are going after this man. We have \ndriven him out of Uganda. We believe he is in the Central African \nRepublic. I saw firsthand while visiting there what we are doing to \nmake sure his reign of terror comes to an end very quickly.\n  It turns out Kony's reign of terror has been fed and financed by the \nChinese demand for ivory. He is poaching ivory from the elephants, \nslaughtering them in the area and using this ivory to keep his men in \narms and for their reign of terror to continue.\n  The Increasing American Jobs Through Greater Exports to Africa Act \nhas something for everyone to support. It is good for the American \neconomy, helps U.S. businesses create jobs, it is good for U.S. foreign \npolicy, keeps America in a position of global leadership. It is good \nfor the people of Africa by making superior American products and \nservices the standard in their future.\n  I urge my colleagues to sign on to support this important effort. \nWhile we wait and do nothing, the Chinese are acting every single day \nand America is falling further and further behind.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2595]]\n\n                                 S. 718\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Increasing American Jobs \n     Through Greater Exports to Africa Act of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Export growth helps United States businesses grow and \n     create American jobs. In 2011, United States exports \n     supported 9,700,000 jobs and 97.8 percent of United States \n     exports came from small- and medium-sized businesses in 2010.\n       (2) The more than 20 Federal agencies that are involved in \n     export promotion and financing are not sufficiently \n     coordinated to adequately expand United States commercial \n     exports to Africa.\n       (3) The President has taken steps to improve how the United \n     States Government supports American businesses by mandating \n     an executive review across agencies and a new Doing Business \n     in Africa initiative, but a substantially greater high-level \n     focus on Africa is needed.\n       (4) Many other countries have trade promotion programs that \n     aggressively compete against United States exports in Africa \n     and around the world. For example, in 2010, medium- and long-\n     term official export credit general volumes from the Group of \n     7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the \n     United Kingdom, and the United States) totaled \n     $65,400,000,000. Germany provided the largest level of \n     support at $22,500,000,000, followed by France at \n     $17,400,000,000 and the United States at $13,000,000,000. \n     Official export credit support by emerging market economies \n     such as Brazil, China, and India are significant as well.\n       (5) Between 2008 and 2010, China alone provided more than \n     $110,000,000,000 in loans to the developing world, and, in \n     2009, China surpassed the United States as the leading trade \n     partner of African countries. In the last 10 years, African \n     trade with China has increased from $11,000,000,000 to \n     $166,000,000,000.\n       (6) The Export-Import Bank of the United States \n     substantially increased lending to United States businesses \n     focused on Africa from $400,000,000 in 2009 to $1,400,000,000 \n     in 2011, but the Export-Import Bank of China dwarfed this \n     effort with an estimated $12,000,000,000 worth of financing. \n     Overall, China is outpacing the United States in selling \n     goods to Africa at a rate of 3 to 1.\n       (7) Other countries such as India, Turkey, Russia, and \n     Brazil are also aggressively seeking markets in Africa using \n     their national export banks to provide concessional \n     assistance.\n       (8) The Chinese practice of concessional financing runs \n     contrary to the principles of the Organization of Economic \n     Co-operation and Development related to open market rates, \n     undermines naturally competitive rates, and can allow \n     governments in Africa to overlook the troubling record on \n     labor practices, human rights, and environmental impact.\n       (9) As stated in a recent report entitled ``Embracing \n     Africa's Economic Potential'' by Senator Chris Coons, \n     ``Economic growth in Africa has risen dramatically, but the \n     continent's vast economic potential has not yet been fully \n     realized by the U.S. Government or the American private \n     sector.''\n       (10) The African continent is undergoing a period of rapid \n     growth and middle class development, as seen from major \n     indicators such as Internet use, clean water access, and real \n     income growth. In the last decade alone, the percentage of \n     the population with access to the Internet has doubled. \n     Seventy-eight percent of Africa's rural population now has \n     access to clean water. Over the past 10 years, real income \n     per person in Africa has grown by more than 30 percent.\n       (11) Economists have designated Africa as the ``next \n     frontier market'', with profitability of many African firms \n     and growth rates of African countries exceeding global \n     averages in recent years. Countries in Africa have a \n     collective spending power of almost $9,000,000,000 and a \n     gross domestic product of $1,600,000,000,000, which are \n     projected to double in the next 10 years.\n       (12) In the past 10 years, Africa has been home to 6 of the \n     10 fastest growing economies in the world. Sub-Saharan Africa \n     is projected to have the fastest growing economies in the \n     world over the next 10 years, with 7 of the 10 fastest \n     growing economies located in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (13) When countries such as China assist with large-scale \n     government projects, they also gain an upper hand in \n     relations with African leaders and access to valuable \n     commodities such as oil and copper, typically without regard \n     to environmental, human rights, labor, or governance \n     standards.\n       (14) Unless the United States can offer competitive \n     financing for its firms in Africa, it will be deprived of \n     opportunities to participate in African efforts to close the \n     continent's significant infrastructure gap that amounts to an \n     estimated $100,000,000,000.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to create jobs in \n     the United States by expanding programs that will result in \n     increasing United States exports to Africa by 200 percent in \n     real dollar value within 10 years.\n\n     SEC. 3.

EXPORT-IMPORT BANK FINANCING.\n\n       (a) Financing for Projects in Africa.--\n       (1) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     foreign export credit agencies are providing non-OECD \n     arrangement compliant financing in Africa, which is trade \n     distorting and threatens United States jobs.\n       (2) In general.--Section 6(a) of the Export-Import Bank Act \n     of 1945 (12 U.S.C. 635e(a)) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(4) Percent of financing to be used for projects in \n     africa.--The Bank shall, to the extent that there are \n     acceptable final applications, increase the amount it \n     finances to Africa over the prior year's financing for each \n     of the first five fiscal years beginning after the date of \n     the enactment of the Increasing American Jobs Through Greater \n     Exports to Africa Act of 2013.''.\n       (3) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for 5 years, \n     the Export-Import Bank shall report to the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations, and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate \n     and the Committee on Financial Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Affairs, and the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     House of Representatives if the Bank has not used at least 10 \n     percent of its lending capabilities for projects in Africa as \n     described in paragraph (4) of section 6(a) of the Export-\n     Import Bank of 1945, as added by paragraph (2). The report \n     shall include the reasons why the Bank failed to reach this \n     goal and a description of all final applications for projects \n     in Africa that were deemed unworthy of Bank support.\n       (b) Availability of Portion of Capitalization To Compete \n     Against Foreign Concessional Loans.--\n       (1) In general.--The Bank shall make available annually \n     such amounts as are necessary for loans that counter trade \n     distorting non-OECD arrangement compliant financing or \n     preferential, tied aid, or other related non-market loans \n     offered by other nations for which United States companies \n     are also competing or interested in competing.\n       (2) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for 5 years, \n     the Export-Import Bank shall submit to the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the\n\n[[Page S2597]]\n\n     Committee on Foreign Relations, and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on Financial \n     Services, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Committee \n     on Appropriations of the House of Representatives a report on \n     all loans made or rejected that were considered to counter \n     non-OECD arrangement compliant financing offered by other \n     nations to its firms. The report shall not disclose any \n     information that is confidential or business proprietary, or \n     that would violate section 1905 of title 18, United States \n     Code (commonly referred to as the ``Trade Secrets Act''). The \n     report shall include a description of trade distorting non-\n     OECD arrangement compliant financing loans made by other \n     countries during that fiscal year to firms that competed \n     against the United States firms.\n\n     SEC. 10. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       Section 22(b) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 649(b)) \n     is amended--\n       (1) in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by inserting \n     ``the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee,'' after \n     ``Director of the United States Trade and Development \n     Agency,''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``regional offices of \n     the Export-Import Bank,'' after ``Retired Executives,''.\n\n     SEC. 11. BILATERAL, SUBREGIONAL AND REGIONAL, AND \n                   MULTILATERAL AGREEMENTS.\n\n       Where applicable, the President shall explore opportunities \n     to negotiate bilateral, subregional, and regional agreements \n     that encourage trade and eliminate nontariff barriers to \n     trade between countries, such as negotiating investor \n     friendly double-taxation treaties and investment promotion \n     agreements. United States negotiators in multilateral forum \n     should take into account the objectives of this Act. To the \n     extent any such agreements exist between the United States \n     and an African country, the President shall ensure that the \n     agreement is being implemented in a manner that maximizes the \n     positive effects for United States trade, export, and labor \n     interests as well as the economic development of the \n     countries in Africa.\n\n  Mr. COONS. I rise to thank Senator Durbin of Illinois for his \nleadership on these vital issues. You just heard in the comments he \nmade the reach and scope of his vision. I am so impressed with the \nbreadth and depth of his engagement first on behalf of American \nworkers.\n  The Senator recognizes so clearly that 95 percent of the world's \nconsumers live outside our country, and we have to have a coordinated, \ncapable, competent export strategy in order to continue to access the \nmost promising, most rapidly growing markets in Africa. The 54 \ncountries of the continent of Africa provide enormous opportunity as \ntheir growing middle class, increasing access to their human and \nmineral and natural resources create opportunities for us to grow jobs \nin the United States.\n  Nearly 10 million new jobs are supported in the United States by \nexports to the rest the world. But as Senator Durbin has wisely seen \nand pointed out, our competitors are beating us in the race to access \nthese great opportunities. The Chinese, the Brazilians, the Russians, \nthe Indians, in every country on the continent they are present, they \nare investing, and they are growing.\n  Senator Durbin rightly recognized that China has eclipsed the United \nStates as the leading trading partner for Africa. There are real \nconsequences for Africans and for African countries because, sadly, \noften Chinese investments bring with them Chinese contractors, workers, \nand a different approach to values: priority in terms of development, a \nlack of focus on transparency, on human rights, on the environment. As \nSenator Durbin detailed in his comments, the consequences can even be \nso far-reaching as conservation and the impact on wildlife and the \nultimate consequences of supporting the worst actors on the continent, \nfolks such as Joseph Kony.\n  But let me turn, if I might briefly, to the bill which I am proud to \ncosponsor with Senator Durbin, which focuses on trying to ensure that \nmore than 10 U.S. Government agencies responsible for export promotion \nhave a coordinated strategy. One of the principal points of Senator \nDurbin's bill, which I am proud to cosponsor, challenges the executive \nbranch to sustain and increase our investment in the Foreign Commercial \nService, to sustain and increase our resources through entities such as \nOPIC and Ex-Im and ask the executive branch to create a coordinator to \nensure that all of this is done responsibly and in a cost-effective \nway.\n  Other things I mentioned in the trade report, which Senator Durbin \nwas kind enough to quote and to reference, are that in the United \nStates we have an enormous African community which can be strategically \nvital as American businesses seek to access these growing opportunities \nacross the continent of Africa.\n  We also look to bolster support for agencies that finance U.S. \ncommercial engagement overseas. Our competitors--in particular, the \nChinese--have a very different approach to financing exports. The \nUnited States needs to better coordinate and align to act as one \nNation.\n  The goal that is set in this legislation--a 200-percent increase--is \nan ambitious goal. The goal is to increase U.S. exports to Africa in \nthe next 10 years. If we were to accomplish this goal in a cost-\neffective way--through more responsibly coordinating the investments we \nare already making in these Federal agencies to better coordinate the \nprivate sector efforts of the United States--think of how many jobs we \nmight create, how many countries we might better connect to the United \nStates. Think of how many towns and workplaces across this country \nwould benefit.\n  I thank Senator Durbin today for his leadership, the clarity of his \nvision, and the breadth of his engagement and investment of time. \nSomeone in his position has so many other issues on which he could be \ninvesting his time. Over his entire service here in the Senate of the \nUnited States, he has been passionate about clean water for the \ncontinent of Africa and passionate about high-quality jobs for the \nworkers of the United States. In this bill he finds a way to make good \non both of those passions, improving the lives of Africans across a \ngrowing continent and improving the lives of workers across our Nation.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership, and I am proud to join him \ntoday in cosponsoring this reintroduced bipartisan, soon-to-be \nbicameral, commonsense bill. Let's hope all of our colleagues will help \nto take it up and pass it in this Congress.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nIllinois not only for the chance to help with this effort, but more \nimportantly for his steadfast work to strengthen our bond with the \ncountries of Africa.\n  We were on the floor last year talking about the importance of this \nbill--the importance of creating a comprehensive trade strategy with \nAfrica. I know the Senator from Illinois made a valiant effort to get \nour bill through at the end of the last Congress, but he ran into some \nresistance. It is my hope that as we re-introduce this bill, we can \nassuage any outstanding concerns and get this bill passed early in this \nsession.\n  As the Senator from Illinois stated, Africa is home to many of the \nfew emerging bright spots in a tough global economy. In fact, an \narticle from The Economist this week called it the ``hottest \nfrontier.'' They are right. Within the next decade, Africa will be home \nto 7 of the 10 fastest growing economies in the world--Nigeria, \nEthiopia, Chad, Rwanda, Mozambique and Angola. The Economist article \npointed out that by 2020, more than half of African households will \nhave enough income to spend some on non-essentials and that within \nthree decades, the continent will have a larger working age population \nthan China.\n  When I served in the House, I was on the Africa Subcommittee and \ntraveled often to the continent. I still make trips there to visit with \ntheir leaders and the top issue on every meeting agenda continues to be \ntrade. Many African leaders are very concerned about China's increasing \nfootprint in Africa and want the U.S. to be more engaged and involved \nin their economies.\n  So, the eagerness and willingness to be good trade partners on the \npart of African nations is there. They want our goods and services \nbecause Africans know they are high quality. The desire for American \nproducts, along with our ideals, is strong. The only thing missing is a \ncohesive strategy on our end. That is what we are aiming to create with \nthis legislation.\n  This bill will develop a comprehensive strategy to create American \njobs by increasing exports of U.S. goods and services to Africa by at \nleast 200 percent in real dollar value over the next 10 years. It \nincreases our ability to help U.S. companies expand into African \nmarkets without adding to our debt. So it is a win-win for our economy. \nIt will create jobs here at home\n\n[[Page S2598]]\n\nand bring in additional income instead of increasing our debt.\n  When we talk about job creation, free and fair trade is a vital \ncomponent to a successful plan. Sixty percent of American exports came \nfrom small and medium size businesses. That is huge. Small business is \nthe backbone of our economy. The bottom line is that trade equals jobs.\n  As I already mentioned, China is bullish on Africa. We need to be \ntoo. China is outpacing us in exports to Africa by an alarming 3 to 1 \npace. By 2009, China had surpassed us as the African continent's \nlargest trading partner. This bill lets us establish a plan that will \nallow us to compete with nations like China that are already extremely \nactive in the African market. And that will help our small companies \ncreate jobs.\n  My home State, Arkansas, stands to benefit greatly through the \ncreation of a comprehensive trade plan with Africa. Free and fair trade \nis an important component to our State's economy. Arkansas exported \n$5.6 billion in merchandise overseas in 2011, up 7 percent from the \nprevious year. In 2008, over 1,500 companies exported goods from \nArkansas. Over \\1/3\\ of exports were from small and medium-sized \nbusinesses with fewer than 500 employees. An effective trade strategy \nwith African nations will help us build on that significantly.\n  So again, increased trade equals increased jobs at home. America \nneeds jobs. That is what this bill is about. That is why we need to \nmove it quickly in this session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/11/senate-section/article/S2598-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 96--RECOGNIZING THE CELEBRATION OF NATIONAL STUDENT \n         EMPLOYMENT WEEK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA DULUTH\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                               S.
