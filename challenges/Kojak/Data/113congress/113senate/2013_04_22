Mr. President, I commend the law enforcement officials at \nthe city, State, and local level for their incredible response to last \nweek's traumatic and horrifying events at the Boston Marathon, and for \nhours following that all over the Boston metropolitan area.\n  A week that began with this unspeakable tragedy, the death of three \ninnocents, ended with the death of one suspect in the Boston bombing \nmarathon and the capture of the other. Capturing those suspects would \nhave been impossible without the hard work and bravery of countless law \nenforcement personnel as well as the cooperation and fortitude of the \npeople of Boston. They are Boston strong.\n  Our hearts extend to the family of 26-year-old Sean Collier, the \nyoung MIT officer who was simply sitting in his car and was so \ncallously killed by these bombing murderers. Our thoughts this week are \nwith Richard Donohue, the transit police officer who was wounded during \nthe manhunt by these terrorists.\n  We once again extend hope for recovery of those injured in last \nweek's senseless bombings and our condolences to lost loved ones. The \nU.S. Government and Americans across the Nation pledge our continued \nsupport for the people of Massachusetts as they recuperate from a truly \ntrying week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/22/senate-section/article/S2819-8", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2819-S2820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SEQUESTRATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Americans arriving at the airport--almost \nany airport in America--to take off on their summer vacations already \nface long lines at security checkpoints. Soon they will be facing long \nwaits at the terminal as well. Last week the Federal Aviation \nAdministration announced that starting this week thousands of flights \nevery day will be delayed for up to 3 hours.\n  Because of the devastating, arbitrary cuts of sequestration, the FAA \nis forced to furlough tens of thousands of workers. These furloughs \ncould lead to\n\n[[Page S2820]]\n\n6,700 flight delays every day this summer. I repeat, every day, 6,700 \ndelayed flights. By comparison, the worst travel day of last year, \n2012, was about 3,000 flights being delayed. That was after severe \nthunderstorms accompanied by 2-inch hail and a 90-mile-an-hour wind \nthat ripped across the Midwest and Northeast and a tornado touched down \nin New York. That caused 3,000 flight delays. On any day this \nsequestration kicks in, it will be double that. Travelers were stranded \nat airports across the country during that very bad day we had last \nyear. Some were stranded for days. It is going to be worse than that. \nAs I said, this summer more than twice that number of flights will be \ndelayed every single day.\n  While major airports such as LaGuardia in New York and O'Hare in \nChicago will see the worst delays, furloughs will impact every airport \nin the Nation. So whether Americans are traveling to Orlando, Las \nVegas, San Diego or Seattle, Maine or Montana, they should expect a \nlong wait for a flight.\n  This will make air travel frustrating, to say the least. It is bad \nenough now. It will be worse. It will be time-consuming for millions of \nAmericans, whether taking the family to see the Grand Canyon or heading \nto New York for business. It will cover everything. At airports across \nthe country, millions of Americans who fly will get their first taste \nof the pain of sequestration.\n  Many Americans have been feeling that pain for weeks. For example, in \nRockland, ME, Meals on Wheels, a wonderful program, been in existence \nfor a long time, decades--it is for people who are old and homebound. \nThey bring them a meal, one meal a day, a hot meal. In Rockland, ME, \nMeals on Wheels has a waiting list for the first time in 16 years.\n  It is going to affect Meals on Wheels Programs all over the country. \nThey have literally cut the size of meals they serve to the elderly in \norder to save money. Not only are they going to be able to do less \nmeals, but those they serve are going to be smaller. This is the only \nmeal most of these seniors get every day. They may have a bowl of \ncereal, eat a piece of toast. But as far as a hot meal, this is it.\n  In Fayetteville, AR, a Head Start Program will close 13 days early \nthis spring, leaving hundreds of needy children without anywhere to go \nand without nutritious meals to eat. Nationwide, more than 70,000 \nlittle boys and girls will be kicked off Head Start, a program for low-\nincome children who could not afford preschool.\n  As the name Head Start says, the purpose of it is for these tiny \nlittle boys and girls to have preschool programs so they can learn to \nstart to understand what it means to read, to understand what education \nis all about. Economically burdened little kids, because of this \nprogram, who want to get a head start will not be able to; these \nprograms will be savaged.\n  At Duke University, just one program out of hundreds at the School of \nMedicine program will have 50 people laid off. These are people doing \nsome of the most important research there is in the world to cure \ndiseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes. All over the \ncountry, thousands of these researchers will be furloughed or they will \nbe laid off.\n  The U.S. military has cut tuition assistance for soldiers and \neliminated a program helping more than 100,000 homeless veterans get \noff the street and back on their feet. The U.S. Air Force has grounded \none-third of its fighter jets and bombers because of the across-the-\nboard cuts. These programs are to train our military so in a time of \ncrisis they can be prepared. They cannot be prepared if they cannot \npractice. More than 1 million Federal workers, including hundreds of \nthousands of Defense Department employees, are preparing to take forced \nfurlough days. This is not only a hardship for individual families, it \nis also a threat to our national economy and our national security.\n  In national parks across the Nation--Great Basin in Nevada, Bryce \nCanyon, UT, Mount Desert Island, thousands of miles away from those two \nplaces in Maine--employees face reduced hours, and closure will affect \nthousands of travelers.\n  Long delays at the airport will not be the only damper on summer \nvacation travel. For every person who loses work because of this \nsequestration, that is less they can buy to help people who are selling \ngoods and services. We cannot and we should not only address the FAA \ncuts. As important as they are, we should look at the whole spectrum. \nWe cannot ignore the sequester's overall effect on Americans and on \nprograms that help small businesses grow, fund crucial medical \nresearch, and keep our children and seniors safe.\n  While airport delays are costly and frustrating, some would say they \nare not as severe as the pain of a senior citizen missing a meal, the \nonly hot meal they would get that day, or veterans going without a roof \nover their head at night.\n  Families and businesses in every State in the Nation, in red States \nand blue States, are at risk because of these haphazard cuts. That is \nwhat they are. But Congress has the power to reverse these self-\ninflicted wounds without adding 1 penny to the deficit. We are winding \ndown the war in Afghanistan, and Iraq has been wound down \nsignificantly. We have provided the money. The money is there. We have \nnot spent it. We do not need to. We can use those savings from wrapping \nup two wars to avoid the full brunt of the sequester's arbitrary cuts. \nThe Congressional Budget Office said that would score, that money is \navailable, money we could use. Funding for the operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan is kept in the so-called Overseas Contingency Operations \nAccount. That is what it is called. Since the worst of the sequester \ncuts is creating an emergency situation, we should consider using these \nfunds to offset their impact. These really are emergencies. We should \ndo it. I am not proposing to use these funds to offset the entire \nsequester, but Congress has the power to avert the most painful and \nsenseless of the sequester's cuts using these monies.\n  Twenty-eight Republicans in the Senate and 174 Republicans in the \nHouse voted to oppose these sequester haphazard cuts. If those same \nRepublicans will work with Democrats, we could act now to protect \nfamilies, businesses, ensure our national defense, and save Americans \nmillions of hours spent waiting at the airport.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/22/senate-section/article/S2820-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I note Senator Enzi is on the floor. At 5:30 p.m. we are \nvoting on a measure which will affect literally millions of Americans. \nI will provide some illustration about this bill.\n  A close friend of mine is the mayor of Normal, IL. His name is Chris \nKoos, and he is a local businessman. His business sells bicycles, \nrunning shoes, running paraphernalia, and equipment. Chris has a good \nbusiness and has done well.\n  He told me that in the last 10 or 20 years things have changed. He \nsaid, It is not unusual for someone to come into my store, ask to see a \npair of running shoes, try them on, look at the different colors, and \nthen leave without buying anything. Sometimes they will come back \nseveral weeks later with shoes and they will say: Chris, we bought \nthese over the Internet, and they are not what we thought they would \nbe; what can we do about it?\n  This is called ``showrooming'' and is happening more and more. Why \nwould somebody try on the shoes, not purchase them, and then go to the \nInternet? In many instances, it is because many Internet retailers do \nnot collect sales tax. In my State, this means 9 or 10 percent less \ncost to purchase an item over the Internet.\n  This is the reality for most companies. Some companies, Internet \nretailers, collect a sales tax. I recently purchased a book on Amazon, \nand they\n\n[[Page S2821]]\n\ncharged the sales tax, which is appropriate in Illinois. Most companies \ndo not collect the sales tax.\n  I wish to tell another side of this story. When we are dealing with \nthe collection of this sales tax, we are dealing with existing \nlaw. Forty-six States in America have sales tax. The States that do not \nare Montana, Oregon, New Hampshire, and Delaware. Every other State has \neither a sales tax or what they call a use tax, and the State law \nrequires all of us living in those States to pay a sales tax on \nInternet purchases even if the seller didn't charge it.\n\n  In my State, people are supposed to pay it when they file their \nannual State income tax return. There is a line: How much do you owe \nfor Illinois sales tax that should have been paid on remote purchases \nor online purchases? It is really an honor system is what it comes down \nto. Though there is a legal obligation, there is no direct enforcement. \nIt turns out that only 1 out of 20 people in Illinois even know this \nexists. So only 5 percent of the population know.\n  As I mentioned several times, a few years ago my bookkeeper said--\nwhen she was doing our taxes--Senator, do you want to pay the sales tax \nyou owe? I said: I think I do. I did, and we have ever since. But most \npeople aren't aware of it.\n  So here we have businesses all around America, on Main Streets and in \nshopping malls, collecting sales tax on the things they sell and \ncompeting with Internet retailers who do not collect the sales tax. \nSecondly, we have individuals with an obligation to pay the sales tax, \nbut most of them do not. So the bill we will consider at 5:30 this \nafternoon is going to try to resolve this problem.\n  Over 20 years ago the U.S. Supreme Court said: Congress, you have to \nfix this. We are not going to fix it by court decision. The States \ncan't fix it because it affects retailers from all around the United \nStates. In the Quill decision before the Supreme Court, they said: \nCongress, you have to fix it.\n  It was about that time my colleague, Senator Enzi of Wyoming, teamed \nup with Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota to fix it. Many years have \npassed and here we are today on the floor of the Senate trying to \nfinally resolve this issue. We have reached a good place. I think we \nhave a reasonable approach to it, and this is what it says: States have \nto decide to opt in to our system. In other words, no mandate from the \nFederal Government.\n  If States opt in to what we propose in this legislation, here is what \nit means. It means States will be willing to provide the Internet \nretailers with the software program so that when they sell into the \nState of Illinois and the purchaser gives the home address, the program \nwill automatically calculate how much sales tax should be collected on \nthe sale. This is free to the retailers, and it allows them to collect \nthe sales tax and then remit the sales tax to the State of Illinois or \nthe other States in which they are selling.\n  We have worked with businesses--Internet businesses, obviously--and \nhave the support of amazon.com, the largest Internet retailer. For \nyears they have been fighting this battle State by State. As I said, \nthey are now in Illinois collecting sales tax on things they sell over \nthe Internet. But they have decided, and many others as well, it is \ntime to put an end to these statewide court battles, statewide \nlegislative battles, and finally have a national program to collect the \nsales tax.\n  What it means is a lot of money for the States and localities. My \nState is struggling with terrible budget problems. We are in the red \nwith deficits, our pension system is in trouble, and money that should \nbe collected for sales tax is not being collected. So what we are doing \nwith this bill is allowing States to have Internet retailers selling in \nthose States to collect the sales tax.\n  Several of my colleagues will come to the floor to oppose this, and \nthey have one thing in common. Most of them--I think virtually all of \nthem--live in States that don't have a sales tax. So what about those \nStates? If we say Internet retailers can collect a sales tax, what does \nthat mean in the State of Montana, for example? It means nothing \nchanges for the people living in Montana. If there is no State sales \ntax they have to pay in their stores, this bill is not going to impose \nany new sales tax on the people of Montana.\n  So, then, why are the Senators from Montana opposing it? They are \narguing their Internet retailers should not have to collect a sales tax \nfor sales made in States that do have a sales tax. My answer to that \nis, if you wanted to do business in Illinois--if you wanted to move \nyour shoe store to Illinois--you would have to follow Illinois law; you \nwould have to play by Illinois rules--you would have to pay your \nproperty tax and collect the sales tax. That is accepted. If you want \nto do business in our State or any other State, those are the rules. We \nthink the same thing should apply when it comes to Internet sales.\n  If a Montana Internet retailer, a State with no sales tax--Montana \nhas no sales tax--wants to sell in Illinois, we are saying they need to \ncollect money from the Illinois purchaser--not from the Montana \npurchaser but from the Illinois purchaser--for the sales tax and remit \nthat back to the State of Illinois. If they do not want to do that or \nsell in Illinois or any State with a sales tax, that is their right. \nBut if they do, for the privilege of selling in our State, we are \nsaying they will pay this sales tax.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na column from last week, April 21, from the Wall Street Journal, \nentitled ``Tax Internet Sales, Stimulate Growth.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 17, 2013]\n\n                  Tax Internet Sales, Stimulate Growth\n\n                         (By Arthur B. Laffer)\n\n       States can cut their income-tax rates if Web vendors \n     collect the sales taxes that are legally due.\n       Reinvigorating the economy should be priority No. 1 for \n     federal and state leaders. After enjoying an average growth \n     rate above 3.5% per year between 1960 and 1999, Americans \n     have had to make do with less than one-half that pace since \n     2000.\n       The consequences are already dramatic and will become even \n     more so over time. Overall we are 20% poorer today than we \n     would be had the pre-2000 growth rate persisted. All other \n     things being equal, less national income also means federal \n     and state fiscal problems are more intractable.\n       At the state level, there are reforms that can alleviate \n     the problems associated with declining sales-tax bases and, \n     at the same time, allow the states to move closer to a pro-\n     growth tax system. One such reform would be to have Internet \n     sellers collect the sales taxes that are owed by in-state \n     consumers when they purchase goods over the Web.\n       So-called e-fairness legislation addresses the inequitable \n     treatment of retailers based on whether they are located in-\n     state (either a traditional brick-and-mortar store or an \n     Internet retailer with a physical presence in the state) or \n     out of state (again as a brick-and-mortar establishment or on \n     the Internet).\n       In-state retailers collect sales taxes at the time of \n     purchase. When residents purchase from retailers out of state \n     (including over the Internet) they are supposed to report \n     these purchases and pay the sales taxes owed--which are \n     typically referred to as a ``use tax.'' As you can imagine, \n     few people do.\n       The result is to narrow a state's sales-tax base. It also \n     leads to several inefficiencies that, on net, diminish \n     potential job and economic growth.\n       Exempting Internet purchases from the sales tax naturally \n     encourages consumers to buy goods over the Web; worse, the \n     exemption incentivizes consumers to use in-state retailers as \n     a showroom before they do so. This increases in-state \n     retailers' overall costs and reduces their overall \n     productivity.\n       The exemption of Internet and out-of-state retailers from \n     collecting state sales taxes reduced state revenues by $23.3 \n     billion in 2012 alone, according to an estimate by the \n     National Conference of State Legislatures. The absence of \n     these revenues has not served to put a lid on state-\n     government spending. Instead, it has led to higher marginal \n     rates in the 43 states that levy income taxes.\n       Therefore--as with any pro-growth tax reform--the sales tax \n     base in the states should be broadened by treating Internet \n     retailers similarly to in-state retailers, and the marginal \n     income-tax rate should be reduced such that the total static \n     revenue collected by the state government is held constant.\n       One difficulty in imposing an Internet sales tax is the \n     existence of dozens, if not hundreds, of sales-tax \n     jurisdictions in many states, often with the tax rates and \n     tax classification of the same goods varying by jurisdiction. \n     It is overly burdensome to task companies with remitting \n     sales taxes to more than 9,500 such tax jurisdictions. \n     Instead, each state should set up a single sales-tax system, \n     making compliance as easy as possible for today's modern \n     sellers.\n       Addressing e-fairness from a pro-growth perspective creates \n     several benefits for the\n\n[[Page S2822]]\n\n     economy. A gross inequity is addressed--all retailers would \n     be treated equally under state law. It also provides states \n     with the opportunity to make their tax systems more efficient \n     and better aligned toward economic growth, as well as improve \n     the productivity of local retailers.\n       The principle of levying the lowest possible tax rate on \n     the broadest possible tax base is the way to improve the \n     incentives to work, save and produce--which are necessary to \n     reinvigorate the American economy and cope with the nation's \n     fiscal problems. Properly addressing the problem of e-\n     fairness on the state level is a small, but important, step \n     toward achieving this goal.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. There are differences of opinion about this, but here are \nseveral things we should make clear. This is not a new tax. The bill we \nhave before us will not create any new tax. It creates a method for \ncompliance or collection of an existing tax.\n  Secondly, it is only fair to the businesses across America--the \nentrepreneurs who open their stores every morning and do business. If \nthey are required to collect a sales tax on their sales, it is only \nfair those who are competing with them do the same.\n  Also, I might add, it is naive to believe the Internet retailers are \nselling into States and not using the benefits of the State. When I buy \na book on Amazon or wherever it happens to be, ultimately it may be \ndelivered by UPS, for example. That UPS truck is going to use the \nstreets of Chicago and the streets of Springfield. It will use all the \nbasic infrastructure of the cities and the State of Illinois to deliver \nits product. I don't think it is unreasonable they collect taxes to \nsupport the State and the city where they are making their sales, and \nthat is what this is about.\n  I also note, Mr. President, that today the White House announced the \nPresident supports this bill to give States the authority to collect \nsales tax from Internet retailers. The White House spokesman said: The \nSenate bill will level the playing field for small businesses and \nbrick-and-mortar retailers undercut by online retailers. Governors and \nmayors are overwhelmingly in support of this bill. They told the White \nHouse the bill is needed. The States are losing out on revenues that \ncan go to education, law enforcement, infrastructure investments, and \nhealth care.\n  We have a wide array of businesses supporting this. You can imagine. \nRetailers large and small are supporting it. Labor unions are \nsupporting it as well. Business and labor have come together. They \nbelieve this is only a matter of fairness.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Senator Enzi of Wyoming--and then I \nwill yield the floor for him--for his leadership, persistence, and \npatience on this issue. It has been a long time. Senator Enzi was in \nthe retail business before he came to the Senate, and he was one of the \nearliest supporters of this measure. When Senator Dorgan retired, I \nasked Mike if I could join him in this effort, and he has been a \nterrific ally.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I yield the floor for my colleague and \nfriend from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, for his \ninterest and participation in this issue, his ability to explain it, \nand for the way he has brought a lot of people along in helping out \nwith this bill. He has been a great replacement, and we have made more \nprogress than we ever have in the other 14 years of working on the \nbill. So I thank him for that and for his ability to explain things so \nclearly.\n  I also want to thank Senator Lamar Alexander who helped us change \nthis bill in the last year from about an 80-page bill to an 11-page \nbill and made it States rights. As Senator Durbin so eloquently \nexplained, this takes action by the States. This is just to clear up \nthe Quill case that made it a little confusing about whether they could \ncharge a tax and then challenged Congress to fix the problem.\n  The solution Senator Alexander came up with condensed the bill \nconsiderably and made it a lot easier. But it made it a States rights \nissue so that the States have to take some action.\n  I thank Senator Heitkamp as well. She is brandnew to the bill but has \nmore years of experience than anybody because she was a part of the \nQuill case when it came up. She was representing North Dakota in that \ncase, and that is the other side of the case. She can explain the \nintricacies of that and the challenge we were given, and the number of \nreasons why it didn't happen earlier.\n  One of the reasons is that 20 years ago the Internet was in its \ninfancy and nobody knew what its capabilities were going to be. Most \npeople didn't even know it was out there. That has changed over quite a \nperiod of time to where it is now one of the handy tools everybody \nuses. We have come to recognize there are apps that are available that \nwill answer any question and sources of information that will provide \nus with what we need to know on virtually any subject. I think that has \nprobably put some encyclopedias out of business, but it has made \ninformation more readily available, and it has made products available \nthat people didn't have the availability of before. But it is creating \na bit of a dilemma that marketplace fairness straightens out.\n  Today we are scheduled to vote on the motion to proceed to the bill \nat 5:30, and I do strongly encourage my colleagues to vote yes. Let me \nexplain why.\n  As Senator Durbin said, I have been working on this sales tax \nfairness issue since joining the Senate in 1997, and I may have a \nunique perspective on the dozens of proposals that have been \nintroduced. For instance, I have worked sales tax from a number of \ndifferent aspects. I worked the sales tax issue when I was in the \nWyoming Legislature. I know when our legislators were considering sales \ntax they didn't intend to discriminate against the people in the \ncommunities, those who hire the people in the communities and pay the \nproperty tax to the communities and participate in all of the community \nevents. They definitely didn't anticipate they were going to be the \nsource where people could come in and feel and touch and try on the \nproduct and then check the bar code with their cell phone--one of the \nadvances made possible now through Internet use--and then find out if \nthere is a lower price, which is usually based on no sales tax.\n  I am pleased some businesses across the Nation have said that isn't \nfair and have decided to voluntarily do the sales tax. And there is no \nproblem with them doing that.\n  I have also been a retailer, so I know that feeling. My wife and I \nhad a shoe store, so I know the feeling, again, the Senator from \nIllinois described, of people coming in, trying it on, feeling it, \nmaking sure it is the right size and then checking to see where else it \nis available. It is discouraging when the sales tax is the difference. \nSo as a former small business owner, I believe it is important to level \nthat playing field for all retailers--the in-store, the catalogue, and \nthe online--so an outdated rule for sales tax collection doesn't \nadversely impact particularly small businesses and Main Street \nretailers.\n  I know a lot of year books would never be published if it wasn't for \nthe support of some of the local businesses. Thousands of these local \nbusinesses are forced to do business at a competitive disadvantage \nbecause they have to collect a sales tax or a use tax and remote \nsellers don't. In some States that can mean a 5- to 10-percent price \ndisadvantage. We should not be subsidizing some taxpayers at the \nexpense of others. All businesses and their retail sales should be \ntreated equally.\n  As a former mayor, I know sales taxes go to State and local \ngovernments to bring in needed revenue for maintaining schools, fixing \nour roads, supporting law enforcement, fire protection, those first \nresponders we are always so conscious of, particularly today and \nthrough this last week. If Congress fails to authorize States to \ncollect tax on remote sales, and electronic commerce continues to grow, \nwe are implicitly blessing a situation where States will be forced to \nraise other taxes, such as income and property taxes, to offset the \ngrowing loss of sales tax revenue. Do we want that to happen? I don't \nthink so. We need to promote economic growth, not stifle it.\n\n  As the Supreme Court identified in the Quill v. North Dakota decision \nin 1992, the Quill decision challenged Congress to come up with a \nbetter system, a way of making it fair. The local brick-and-mortar \nretailers collect sales taxes, while many online and catalog retailers \nare exempt from collecting the same tax as a result of that case, and \nthat was based on whether they\n\n[[Page S2823]]\n\nhad a nexus. The nexus has changed dramatically since that time. That \nused to be where you would go and actually pick up something, but now \nit is where you can order something and that can be even moved around \nthe country virtually at will. So we designated some States as not \nhaving to do it. Web sites could be set up in that State for people to \nsell through from anywhere.\n  So the taxes need to be collected. It needs to be fair, and right now \nit is not only fundamentally unfair to Main Street retailers, but it is \ncosting States and localities billions in lost revenue. The Supreme \nCourt invited Congress to address this issue, and we stalled. We know \nthat early on the Internet was new, but now everything is done on the \nInternet. So now is the time for Congress to act.\n  Many Americans don't realize that when they buy something online or \norder something from the catalog of a business outside their own State, \nthey still owe the sales tax. I know from being a legislator that was \npart of what we put in place. There is a form in Wyoming that you can \nfill out and pay your tax. It is pretty hard to keep track of, \nparticularly on smaller items, but it ought to be easier on big items. \nAnd I do know there are about three people who comply with that.\n  For over a decade Congress has been debating how to best allow States \nto collect sales tax from the online retailers in a way that puts Main \nStreet businesses on a level playing field with the online retailers. \nSo on February 14, 2013, the bicameral--House and Senate--and \nbipartisan--Republicans and Democrats--put together the Marketplace \nFairness Act that was introduced to close that 20-year loophole that \ndistorts the American marketplace by picking winners and losers, by \nsubsidizing some businesses at the expense of other businesses and \nsubsidizing some taxpayers at the expense of other taxpayers. All \nbusinesses in retail sales and all consumers and their purchases should \nbe treated equally.\n  The bill also empowers States to make the decision themselves. This \nis not Congress saying what has to be done or whether they collect \nthem. If they choose to collect already existing sales taxes on all \nonline purchases regardless of whether the sale was online or in-store, \nStates will be able to if this bill passes. If they want to keep things \nthe way they are, that is the State's choice. That is why this bill is \nthe States rights bill.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act does not tax Internet use, it does not \ntax Internet services, and it does not raise taxes. It gives States the \nright to collect what is owed by the purchasing individuals. Some argue \nthat the bill is a disguise to create taxes. It is not. Consumers are \nalready supposed to pay taxes and use taxes in most States for \npurchases made over the phone, by mail, or by way of the Internet.\n  Mr. President, in a couple of minutes we are going to have a moment \nof silence for the tragic events that happened. I yield the floor for \nthe time to be able to do that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for a moment of \nsilence and that the Senator from Wyoming then be again recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

To return to the discussion on marketplace fairness, I \nmentioned that most consumers are aware they are supposed to pay the \ntax on purchases that the retailer does not choose to collect at the \ntime of the purchase, so I would like to provide some highlights of \nwhat the Marketplace Fairness Act actually accomplishes.\n  The bill gives the States the right to decide to collect or not \ncollect taxes that are already owed. The legislation would simplify and \nstreamline the country's more than 9,000 diverse State tax \njurisdictions and provide 2 options by which States could begin \ncollecting sales taxes from online and catalog purchases.\n  The bill also carves out small businesses so that they won't be \nadversely affected by the new law by exempting businesses with less \nthan $1 million in online or out-of-State sales from the collection \nrequirements until they have had a year in which they have had more \nthan $1 million worth of sales. This small business exemption will \nprotect small merchants and give new businesses time to get started. As \nhas been mentioned, when they meet that level, then they have to be \nprovided with a program that will do the calculations for them, provide \nfor submitting the revenues, and also hold them harmless for any errors \nthere might be in the program.\n\n  So don't let the critics get away with saying this type of \nsimplification can't be done. The different tax rates and jurisdictions \nare no problem for today's software programs. When you order something \nonline, you have to put in your ZIP Code. The ZIP Code will tell what \nthe tax is from whatever jurisdiction.\n  As a former mayor and State legislator, I strongly favor allowing \nStates the authority to require sales and use tax collection from \nretailers on all sales for each State that chooses to do so. We need to \nimplement a plan that will allow States to collect revenue using \nmechanisms already approved by their local leaders. We need to allow \nStates the ability to collect the sales taxes they already require.\n  If enacted, it would provide approximately $23 billion in fiscal \nrelief for States for which Congress does not have to find an offset. \nThis will give States less of an excuse to come knocking at the Federal \ndoor for handouts and will reduce the problem of federally attached \nstrings.\n  A lot of people don't realize that the Federal Government is out of \nmoney, and that is shown by what was done through the sequester because \nthe Federal Government usually pays property tax to States and \nlocalities that have Federal property. That amount has never been equal \nto what other people would be paying in their property taxes, but it \nhas been a show of good faith that they recognize that with the \ngovernment there, there is a loss of revenue and that the Federal \nGovernment should do something. So there is a tax level they have been \npaying. It hasn't gone up much and it hasn't gone down much until this \nyear. Then, as part of the sequester, they decided they would hold 5.3 \npercent from all the States and all the local governments. That is \ncalled payment in lieu of taxes, and that is one way the States and the \ncounties have lost money and a way they are going to have to make up \nfor it if that continues. But there is also the possibility that the \nrevenue they take in from this can reduce something like property \ntaxes.\n  For many years I have worked with all the interested parties to find \na mutually agreeable legislative package to introduce and ultimately \nenact into public law. This year Senators Durbin, Alexander, Heitkamp, \nand I worked together with 25 of our bipartisan Senate colleagues to \nproduce a bill that assists sellers and State and local governments to \nsimplify taxes and use collection and administration. We are working \nwith our House supporters--Representatives Steve Womack, Jackie Speier, \nPeter Welch, and John Conyers--and have found common ground on this \nimportant issue to move forward with a bipartisan, bicameral bill in \nthis Congress. I wish to publicly commend all of my Senate and House \ncolleagues in taking a leadership role and working on this important \nissue.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act is about States rights, and it is about \nfairness on the budget bill. We had a vote on this, and I was very \npleased that 75 of the 100 Senators voted in favor of making the \nmarketplace fair. So I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote for the \nmotion to proceed on S. 743, the Marketplace Fairness Act, tonight at \n5:30 when we have that vote. I\n\n[[Page S2824]]\n\nam hoping we will be able to duplicate what we did before and support \nthe goals of States rights and a level playing field for all \nbusinesses.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, we have an important opportunity this \nweek, or before, to help small and local businesses all across our \ncountry. We have an opportunity to help the kinds of local businesses \nthat make our small towns and rural States so warm and inviting. These \nbusinesses attract tourists because of the nature of their smallness.\n  Everything is not big. Everything that is big is not necessarily \nfriendly. Small businesses are almost always friendly. Today these same \nsmall and local businesses are competing on a very unfair playing \nfield. This is an issue I have cared about ever since the Internet was \ncreated. I felt strongly about it then and I feel strongly about it \nnow--except even more so.\n  For over 20 years States have been unable to enforce their own sales \ntax laws on sales by out-of-State catalog and online sellers due to \nsomething I am familiar with only because of the specificity of the \nissue to the 1992 Supreme Court decision Quill Corp. v. North Dakota.\n  Sales tax is not collected for most Internet transactions, so \nconsumers know they can benefit from a 5- to 10-percent discount \nonline, and they know that before they go into a store. In fact, \nsomething that is even more discouraging--because I have made a point \nof watching it--also takes place, and that is what cell phones can do \nfor shoppers. I have seen shoppers in various small shops, such as \ncraft shops, tool shops, and other various kinds of Main Street shops, \ncome in and look at the merchandise. They pick over the merchandise, \ncompare it, decide what they like, and take a picture of it. While \nstill in that small store, they go online and buy it, thus avoiding \nhaving to pay a sales tax. They never have to leave the store--or they \ncan. They can just look at their cell phone when they get home and then \nbuy it if they want to.\n\n  This strikes me as profoundly unfair, so profoundly unfair that it is \none of the easiest issues I think I have ever dealt with since I came \nto the Senate some time ago. It is profoundly unfair to traditional \nshops and small businesses to end up serving as the display case for \nconsumers who see the product in person but buy it online to avoid \npaying sales tax--or maybe they aren't doing it deliberately to avoid \npaying sales tax. If they are well versed in the ways of life, they can \ndo that because they know they will get a nice little discount. On the \nother hand, it is just a habit because States don't have the money--\nparticularly small States such as mine--they don't have the money to \npossibly collect that or go after that.\n  I feel very strongly about sales taxes. For the most part sales taxes \nare used, about 70 percent of them are used in my State for boards of \neducation, public education. I think that is probably true in most \nStates. But, frankly, I just don't know. It is true in my State, so I \ncare about it. My State, because of what I have just described--simply \nbuying online and not having to pay a sales tax or anything--my State \nlost about $103 million last year alone. That is a pretty big chunk of \nour budget. That sounds silly to California. On the other hand, \nCalifornia loses about $4 trillion-plus because of this, and this \nsimple bill would correct that situation and allow them to be able to \nhave the software to do all this.\n  In West Virginia we are fighting to keep our small towns vibrant, and \nI think the good Presiding Officer understands what I mean by that. His \nState has a couple of big cities, but it has a lot of small towns. My \ndaughter lives in one. Those small towns are the heart and soul--towns \nsuch as Newtown are the heart and soul of America, with good people, \nhonest people, doing honest commerce.\n  We need local retailers to keep our small towns vibrant. I believe we \ncan have both a vibrant Main Street economy and e-commerce businesses \ntogether, but we have to have them both. Let's be honest. Allowing \nStates to collect sales tax for online purchases is not going to stop \nthe growth of e-commerce.\n  My Commerce Committee held a hearing on this issue a couple of years \nago, and we had a bunch of folks who made all kinds of claims, but then \na lot more folks who said this isn't fair. It is not a fair way to do \nbusiness.\n  Today's technology, with the tremendous advances made in recent \nyears, makes tax collection simple, makes it cheap, makes it reliable. \nIn many ways, the Internet is the perfect environment to collect sales \ntaxes because it can be automated.\n  If Congress does nothing, we will end up with States forced to raise \nincome or property taxes to offset the growing loss of sales tax \nrevenue. That doesn't seem right or fair to me, and I feel strongly \nabout it.\n  I know the Congress has worked on this issue for a long time. I \nrecall Senator Enzi's original bill on this issue was referred to the \nCommerce Committee. Senators Enzi, Durbin, and Alexander are, from my \npoint of view, to be enormously commended for their commitment on this \nissue, keeping up the good fight. I have always thought it was the \nright idea, and I cosponsored the very first bill just as I am \ncosponsoring this current bill.\n  When Senator Enzi first introduced this bill, it was not a popular \nidea. Over time more people have come to understand that this is an \nissue of basic fairness--really just that word, ``fairness''--to make \nit possible to allow people to compete on a correct basis, and it is \nterribly critical to our States' fiscal health. So that is why I stand \nhere excited to see a growing bipartisan consensus in this Chamber to \npass the Marketplace Fairness Act. I commend its authors. By a vote of \n75 to 24, the Senate recently supported the inclusion of this bill in \nthe budget resolution. I hope we can finish the bill soon and level the \nplaying field once and for all.\n  I wish to close by saying this bill is ultimately about fairness. It \nwould allow small and local businesses--the kind that dot every town \nall across the United States--a chance to play on a level playing field \nand, in fact, in some cases a chance to operate, to be in business. By \npassing this bill in the next several days, we can restore fairness to \nsmall and local businesses.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor and note the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I am here on the floor today just to say a few words \nto follow the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee in \nsupport of the Marketplace Fairness Act.\n  I represent Rhode Island and I have to say my Governor, a former \nmember of this body, Lincoln Chafee; the president of our State senate, \nSenator Teresa Paiva; our speaker of the house, Gordon Fox, and \nnumerous other Rhode Island organizations have ardently urged us to \npass this legislation. The reason for that is twofold. No. 1, they are \nlosing immense amounts of tax revenue that is swirling down this \nloophole of noncollection. Actually, the number I think is $23 billion \nfor 2012. Rhode Island is not the biggest State, so we don't have a \nhuge chunk of it, but it is about $70 million for Rhode Island, which \nis pretty significant. So it is important to all of us, while the \nStates are struggling, to make sure tax revenue that is due and just \nnot being collected is put into the revenue equation.\n\n  The second thing is that it really just plain is not fair to the \nlocal businesses that have shops on Main Street, that have shops in the \nlocal shopping malls, to have competition with electronic delivery \ncompanies, with companies that exist on the Internet and with Internet \nshopping, that are subsidized, in effect, by the government.\n  Very often my colleagues come to the floor to say government should \nnot\n\n[[Page S2825]]\n\npick winners and losers. Government should not pick winners and \nlosers--how many times have we heard that? If I had a nickel for every \ntime somebody on the other side of the house said government should not \npick winners and losers, I would probably be a wealthy man. But \n``government should not pick winners and losers'' is a principle that \nreally applies in this area because those companies that are operating \na brick-and-mortar storefront are paying their taxes--they are paying \ntheir taxes--and the noncollection on the Internet sales puts them at \nan unfair disadvantage.\n  There are conveniences to Internet sales. Nobody wants to get rid of \nthat. It is an important, growing part of our economy. I am all for \nthat. In fact, I think I have family members who shop that way, \nincluding a daughter who is one of the more ardent eBay shoppers in the \ncountry, I suspect. But in any event, it is very important that we not \nadd to the natural advantages Internet shopping has by creating this \nadditional, manufactured tax advantage.\n  It comes down to a point that I think you could appreciate if you can \nput yourself in the shoes of a small business owner. Imagine that you \nown an electronic goods store and you sell televisions--imagine that \nyou are a shoestore owner and you sell shoes for kids and adults--and \nsomebody comes into your electronics store and they look at all the \nTVs, they call over your salesperson and they get the whole briefing on \nwhat is best and how you hook it up and all of the technical details \nabout it, and they see exactly what they want. Then, when they have \ndecided what they want, that is the moment when they should reach into \ntheir wallet and pull out their credit card and say: I will take that \none. I will buy it. Instead, they reach into their pocket and they pull \nout a notepad and they write down the details of the television they \nwere looking at, and they say thank you very much to the store owner, \nand they walk out and they buy it off the Internet.\n  The brick-and-mortar store has put all the expense into having the \noverhead, into having the television there, and into having the expert \nsalespeople there, and a consumer takes advantage of that but then does \nnot buy it, goes outside. That may still happen, but it will happen \nless if we can take out the unfair disadvantage that brick-and-mortar \nstore owner has and put that back into balance.\n  I have had a shoestore owner say the same thing. A parent comes in, \nsits the kids down, and has the sales clerk bring out boxes of shoes. \nThey try them all on, see which ones the kids like, see which ones fit \nbest. Then, when they are all done and they are ready to make their \npurchase, again, out with the notepad. They write down the brand of the \nshoe, the size of the shoe, and then walk out of the store, and there \nis the sales clerk left to box up the shoes, wrap them back up in the \npaper, take them back in the back again, and they took all that effort \nand all that expense and they never made the sale.\n  Again, there are advantages to shopping on the Internet, and there \nare probably times when that kind of behavior by consumers will \ncontinue. But why add the subsidy of uncollected taxes to the \nadvantages the Internet shopper has? Our local stores, our local small \nbusinesses need to have this set right and set into balance.\n  There has been a concern raised that the Marketplace Fairness Act \nwould create all this immense bureaucracy and it would be so difficult \nto do this. That is really not true. The computer and billing systems \nthat exist right now make this a virtually seamless transaction, and \nStates are obliged before they can do it to come into compliance with \nthe Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, which is a compact among \nStates, developed by them, that has coordinated the different State tax \nlaws so that this process can be easy and streamlined.\n  So I think this is a good moment coming for us after a very lousy \nweek last week. We have the chance to get together on a bill that in \nthe budget process I think gathered 70 votes--maybe more than 70 votes. \nI do not remember the exact count, but it was a very strong majority in \nthis body. It was a completely bipartisan vote, with proponents and \nopponents on either side.\n  But I think that in the interest of fairness, in the interest of \neconomic efficiency, in the interest of not picking winners and losers, \nand in the interest of helping to move our economy forward and \nprotecting our stores that are on our Main Streets and in our shopping \ncenters and shopping malls, this is a good thing to do. So I hope we \nwill come together and pass this bill and show that we can act \nproductively and in a bipartisan fashion and that we will do so this \nweek.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and again thank the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee for his leadership and enthusiasm.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS.

Mr. President, today is Earth Day, so I wanted to come to \nthe floor and reflect on some of the changes our Earth is experiencing \nand to talk at some length about how those changes are affecting my \nhome State of Delaware and how the Delaware community is studying, \nplanning, and preparing to deal with these important changes.\n  The recent National Climate Assessment has said that the last decade \nin the United States was the hottest on record, and that the last year \nwas the hottest year ever recorded through the U.S. Government. We are \nwaking up to fewer mornings with frost on our windshields, to less snow \ncover, to warmer oceans and freshwater sources, to more frequent and \nintense storms, to heat waves, to floods and droughts.\n  These many changes are affecting human health, agriculture, \ntransportation, our water supply, our ecosystem, wildlife, and many \nother aspects of our daily lives and our American heritage. On top of \nall of this, we are seeing higher water levels in our oceans and \nestuaries, including in and around my home State of Delaware.\n  Sea level rises essentially for two different reasons. First, as the \nplanet's ice sheets are melting, they are adding to the amount of water \nin the ocean. But second, saltwater actually expands as it warms. So as \nthe planet's average temperature rises, so does the level of its \nsaltwater seas.\n  The fact that Earth's oceans are rising each year is not new \ninformation. It has been rising for as long as we have been keeping \ntrack. What is jarring, though, is that the rate of rise is increasing \nsteadily and significantly.\n  When the data was tracked between 1870 and 1930, sea level was rising \nat a rate of just under 4 inches per hundred years. Over the next 60 \nyears, the sea level rose at a doubled rate of 8 inches per hundred \nyears. And then just over the last 20 years, sea level has been rising \nat a rate of more than 12 inches per hundred years.\n  The water is rising. For those of us from coastal States, in \nparticular for those in Delaware, it is rising fast. At just 60 feet, \nDelaware actually has the lowest mean elevation of any State in the \nUnited States, already making it more susceptible to sea level rise. \nBut here is the thing. We also have another challenge in that the land \nitself is also sinking. There is a documented vertical movement of the \nEarth's crust underneath the MidAtlantic coast referred to as \nsubsidence. It has been happening in Delaware since the last ice age, \nat a pace of roughly 2 millimeters every year. I know 2 millimeters \ndoes not sound like much, but it adds up to another 4 inches per \ncentury.\n  In total, that means you have got, between the water rising and the \nland sinking, making climate change and sea level rise specifically a \nvery real issue for my State and for many other coastal States. An \narray of scientists of many different disciplines and backgrounds has \nstudied this in and outside\n\n[[Page S2826]]\n\nof the U.S. Government. They have developed three models for future \nscenarios.\n  In the most conservative model, by the year 2100, the sea level in \nDelaware will rise above half a meter or about a foot and a half. In \nanother middle range model, the water in Delaware will rise by a full \nmeter. In the most troubling model, it will rise 1.5 meters or about 5 \nfeet between now and the end of this century. Unfortunately, at \npresent, the scientific consensus, their shared estimate, is this is \nthe most likely model.\n  Well, let's try to make that real, as we have in Delaware through a \nwhole series of planning exercises to engage our coastal communities. \nHere is what these different projections look like in Bowers Beach, DE. \nIt only takes half a meter of sea level rise, shown here, before much \nof this community close to Dover Air Force Base in Kent County, DE, is \nunderwater a half a meter, the most conservative scenario. By the end \nof the century, the majority of this community is underwater. At a \nmeter and a half--the most likely scenario in current estimates--the \ntown is virtually gone.\n  Here is another chart which we shared with our communities in \nDelaware of sea level rise. It is a look at South Wilmington. The city \nof Wilmington, where I live, is very close to the Delaware River. It \nhas a whole lot of low-lying areas, this part of the largest city in \nour State.\n  As water rises in the Atlantic, it also rises up the Delaware Bay and \nthe Delaware River and the Christina River which runs through most of \nNew Castle County and through this part of Wilmington. The water rises \nthrough the Peterson Wildlife Refuge as well. The impacts are \ndevastating.\n  We are talking about water every day more than half a foot higher \nthan Delaware experienced during Superstorm Sandy. You can see from the \nconservative to the moderate to the most likely scenario, it floods, it \nimpacts, and it eliminates, wipes out, puts underwater most of South \nWilmington.\n  The calculation of whether we are going to be hit with half a meter, \na full meter or a meter and a half of sea level rise comes down to a \nquestion of the rate of acceleration of climate change globally. It is \nalso implicated in the question of whether we should be trying to slow \nthe rate at which climate change is affecting our planet and maybe even \nhave some hope of turning the tide. This is the part of climate change \npolicy known as mitigation. Priority one in this strategy is reducing, \ncutting the emissions we are pumping into our atmosphere that are \ndriving this change. To do it, we need to diversify our energy sources, \nreduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Clean energy technology, energy \nefficiency programs, public transportation, recycling, and many others \ncould help cut down on these emissions. But it will require a global \nand coordinated effort to avoid or minimize these projected devastating \nlocal impacts.\n  The second part of climate change policy is adaptation. It is based \non accepting the reality our climate is changing and that it will have \nreal effects on our planet and our communities. The truth is, even if \nwe stopped all greenhouse gas emissions today, if we shut down our \ncurrent powerplants, stopped driving our current automobiles, stopped \ndrilling, using gas-powered equipment on our farms or trains or ships, \nthe amount of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere would still \ntake decades to dissipate.\n\n  Changes in the world's climate are at this point inevitable. It is \nalready happening and affecting our communities. We can expect these \nimpacts to intensify and accelerate as the climate continues to change. \nIn my view, we need to accept these facts and modify our behavior to \nprevent these effects from becoming cumulatively catastrophic. We can \nmake better choices now to prevent a disaster later.\n  In Delaware, for example, we have had two laws on the books for \ndecades that helped us to adapt. The first law, championed in 1971 by \nthen-Republican Governor Russ Peterson, was called the Coastal Zone Act \nand prohibited future industrial development on a vital swath of \ncoastal land, allowing the State and Federal Government to preserve it \nand to reduce the impacts of flooding and coastal erosion on these \nvital wetland areas.\n  The second law empowered our State to protect and replenish the \nState's beaches, including beaches on the Delaware Bay which are so \noften overlooked. This has allowed the State to build a series of berm-\nand-dune systems that protect infrastructure and prevent private \nproperty from being washed away. Instead of running away from the \nscience, Delaware's leaders have embraced it. The State agency that \nmanages environmental issues for Delaware is known as DNREC. Under \nSecretary Collin O'Mara's able leadership, it has taken the lead on a \ngovernmentwide project to assess our State's vulnerability to sea level \nrise and to recommend actions for adaptation.\n  In fact, Delaware's Sea Level Rise Advisory Committee, whose report I \nhave here, spent 18 months looking at 79 different Statewide resources, \nvital entities: roads and bridges, fire stations, schools, tourist \nhotspots, wetlands, and, of course, our people, their homes, their \nbusinesses, and layered them on various maps as I have shown, which \ndemonstrated how far the water would reach at different projected sea \nlevels.\n  If sea level gets to 1.5 meters, we lose more than 10 percent of our \nState, the water claims 20,000 residential properties, and significant \npercentages of the State parks and wetlands, farms, highways, \nindustrial sites, rail lines. In Delaware we could lose 21 miles of \nrail lines to flooding, effectively shutting down Amtrak's Northeast \ncorridor. The vital Port of Wilmington would be rendered useless in its \ncurrent footprint. Nearly all the State's acreage of protected wetlands \nwould be inundated, destroyed. Nearly three-quarters of the State's \ndams, dikes, and levies that we use to hold back the bay would be \nflooded. It would be simply devastating to our State.\n  So to those who say: Oh, a few feet of water rising over a century is \na modest amount, something we can plan for, something we do not need to \nbe alarmed about, I think this detailed and thorough study demonstrates \nthe devastating consequences to my home State, a State that would lose \n11 percent of its territory in the worst-case scenario.\n  Our own Secretary of Natural Resources Collin O'Mara said:\n\n       We are looking at big risks for human health and safety, \n     and not just at the Delaware Bay beaches. We have big \n     concerns about south Wilmington, Delaware City and New \n     Castle. It's more complex than just the bay beaches or a \n     community here or there.\n\n  I believe he is right. So once again, if we remember, we have two \nbasic approaches--adaptation and mitigation. Once Delaware compiled its \n200-page vulnerability assessment on sea level rise, the committee got \nto work on an adaptation strategy to protect our State. They came up \nwith more than 60 options and released them publicly, hosting a whole \nseries of townhall meetings to solicit public opinion before the State \ndecides which strategy to implement.\n  The committee is also now working on a broader vulnerability \nassessment to examine the full range of impacts from climate change--\neven beyond sea level rise--changing temperatures, extreme weather, and \nchanges in precipitation. These are impacts which will affect even more \nof our neighbors.\n  Climate change will affect the distribution, abundance and behavior \nof wildlife, as well as the diversity, structure, and function of our \ncomplex ecosystems. We are already seeing changes in natural patterns. \nMany commercial and recreational fish stocks along the east coast have \nmoved northward 25 to 200 miles over the last 40 years as ocean \ntemperatures have steadily but modestly increased, deeply impacting our \nfishing industries and our fishing-reliant communities.\n  Scientists expect migratory species to be strongly affected by \nclimate change since animal migration is closely connected to climatic \nfactors, and migratory species use multiple habitats and resources \nduring their migrations. These changes are impacting the multibillion-\ndollar waterfowl hunting industry vital to my State. It is an important \neconomic driver to Delaware and a vital part of our heritage.\n  According to the draft National Climate Assessment released in \nFebruary, our farmers are expected to adapt relatively well to the \nchanging climate over the next 25 years. However, later, as \ntemperatures increase and precipitation extremes become more intense,\n\n[[Page S2827]]\n\ncrop yields and production of livestock and poultry are expected to \ndecline. More extreme weather events, including droughts and heavy \ndownpours, will further reduce yields, damage soil, stress irrigation \nwater supplies, and increase production costs.\n  I am proud of my State. I am proud Delaware was the first State to \nassess its vulnerability and the vulnerability of specific resources in \nas comprehensive a way as it has. We are determined to confront these \nchanges to our planet head on, protect our own communities, and to \nprotect the way of life we have built. It is an approach which many \nother States should replicate.\n  The private sector has a vital role to play, and they are not waiting \naround for action in this Chamber by the Federal Government. We are \nalready seeing a lot of our companies taking steps on their own to be \nmore sustainable. I see this all the time at home when I visit \ncompanies in Delaware, such as Phillips, Kraft, DuPont, Perdue, and \nMountaire. This Chamber may still be debating climate change, whether \nit is real, and what if anything we should do. These companies in \ncommunities in our State are reducing their water use, reducing power \nconsumption, slimming their footprint, and finding ways to be energy \nefficient. They are doing this not only because it is good for the \nplanet, but because it is good for the bottom line. They have learned \nin measurable ways that reducing their operating costs is good for \nbusiness and good for the planet.\n  Frankly, there is only so much the Federal Government can do as far \nas adapting to climate change. It still plays a very important role, \nwhich States and the private sector alone cannot. The Federal \nGovernment can ensure States have accurate data on climate trends over \nthe long term on which to base its assessments and calculations; invest \nin tidal gauges that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, or NOAA, maintains off all of our coasts, which are \ncritical to monitoring sea level rise; and support the satellites \noverhead which track changing weather patterns.\n  The Federal Government facilitates technology transfer and \ninformation sharing provides technical assistance and guidance to \nStates and regions such as ours and initiates collaboration and \ncoordination among partners, which is essential. From the U.S. Global \nChange Research Program, the Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task \nForce, to the CDC's grant program to help State and local health \ndepartments assess risks the Federal Government is doing a lot. Given \nthe scope and the dire consequences, we need to do more.\n  This President and this administration understand, but what role can \nand should Congress play? In my view we need to also lead in the area \nof mitigation, to support the executive branch as they continue to help \nStates with adaptation. We need to invest wisely in our efforts to \ncombat and prepare for climate change.\n  I have been a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee for more than 2 years. We have seen some ambitious plans to \ndo our part in mitigation, many of which I have supported. One proposal \nwas from Senator Bingaman, former chair of the Energy Committee in the \nlast Congress, to adopt a clean energy standard.\n  It would have set a national goal for clean energy usage and \nestablish a transparent framework that lets resources compete based on \nhow clean they are, and then move out of the way and let the market and \nAmerican ingenuity determine the best path forward. Sadly, this plan \nfailed to attract any bipartisan support and did not make it out of \ncommittee.\n  Although I am an idealist, I am also a pragmatist. I can read the \npolitics of this Chamber. They are deeply divided on this issue at a \ntime when we need to be coming together. Fortunately, there is \nbipartisan support for some steps to improve our Nation's energy \nefficiency. We could take up and pass the bipartisan bill recently \nintroduced by Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman to increase the use \nof energy-efficient technologies in residential, commercial, and \nindustrial sectors.\n  We could level the playing field for financing to help new clean \nenergy technologies get off the ground by giving them access to the \nsame tax advantages currently utilized only by fossil fuel projects. \nThe bipartisan Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act--which I will \nreintroduce later this week with a bipartisan group of my colleagues, \nSenators Moran, Stabenow, and Murkowski--would level the playing field \nfor renewables and give these new technologies a fighting chance in the \nemerging energy market.\n  As we take these sorts of steps and others, we must also be mindful \nof the need to reduce our Nation's dangerous deficits. We also need to \nensure we are not taking away the tools we desperately need to prepare \nfor these changes to our planet. This means sustained support for \nscientific research and protecting the programs which are channeling \nthis vital data to our States.\n  The bottom line in my view is the climate has already changed. We \nknow this. With this knowledge comes the responsibility to reduce our \nemissions in order to mitigate the impacts and to prepare for and take \naction with regard to these coming changes.\n  Climate change is happening. It is happening right now. While it may \nhave local impacts, it has global causes. We ignore these at our peril. \nI believe we have a responsibility: a responsibility to God's creation, \na responsibility to each other, a responsibility to our home States, \nand to future generations. We need to do our very best to slow this \nprocess, to help this planet, our only home, to survive.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate is on course to consider \nprofoundly misguided legislation. This proposal is known as the \nMarketplace Fairness Act, but it is anything but fair. The Marketplace \nFairness Act is unprecedented in its reach to discriminate against the \nInternet, employers, and States with modest or no sales taxes.\n  As the Internet economy has evolved through innovation, and as it \nexpanded because of the value the innovation enabled, traditional \nbrick-and-mortar businesses are seeking to compete through legislation. \nBig retailers, effectively seeking a legislative bailout, have allied \nthemselves with State governments that see the Marketplace Fairness Act \nas an opportunity to obtain new tax revenue without enduring the \npolitical consequence of enforcing their own tax laws in their own \njurisdictions. It is always easier to put the burden of collecting \ntaxes on the people who can't vote for you; isn't that right, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act is going to hobble the Internet economy \nand constrain online commerce. It is, in my view, a recipe for economic \nstagnation. It would rein in the Internet economy which has helped lead \nour economy out of the recession that began in 2008. What this proposal \ndoes is give each State the ability to require online businesses \noutside their States to enforce their tax laws. It enables the State of \nIndiana or the State of South Dakota to require online businesses \nlocated in New Hampshire to collect sales taxes on their behalf. Let me \nrepeat that. The Marketplace Fairness Act could require the businesses \nof New Hampshire, a State that has determined not to have a sales tax, \nto collect sales taxes for goods or services provided to consumers in \nIndiana or South Dakota and then send money to those States.\n  This proposal, in effect, unleashes all the Nation's tax collectors \non small Internet businesses--Internet entrepreneurs who have neither \nthe ability to enforce the terms of the Marketplace Fairness Act nor \nthe political influence in this city to be able to shape\n\n[[Page S2828]]\n\nthe legislation. The Marketplace Fairness Act takes the Internet down a \ndangerous path because its passage would endorse the notion that \nInternet entities should be required to enforce laws outside their home \njurisdiction.\n  Foreign countries have long pressed the notion the Internet should be \nceded to their control. Let me repeat that. This has been an objective \nof a whole number of our global competitors over the years--trying to, \nin effect, get control over the Internet. There is no difference in New \nYork telling Oregon Internet firms to enforce New York laws than China \ntelling American firms to enforce China's censorship practice. As it is \nalready, many countries are seeking to actually put the United Nations \nin charge as the Internet's regulator-in-chief, and this bill, to a \ngreat extent, endorses that world view.\n  Today the Senate is being asked to consider schemes to allow States \nand localities to essentially nationalize their taxes, but tomorrow the \nSenate may be asked to consider similar schemes to enforce laws and \nregulations about content, for example, and other issues that are so \nimportant to the powerful and the well connected.\n  The precedent the Marketplace Fairness Act establishes takes the \nInternet, the American economy, and our society down a dark path. It is \na path toward a future where governments can impose their values and \ntheir regulatory regimes on Internet businesses anywhere. It is a \nfuture in which the sovereignty of the country and the sovereignty of \nour States is significantly eroded.\n  Beyond these issues, the proponents of the legislation are spawning \nmyths about the bill that aren't true. One myth is the Marketplace \nFairness Act levels the playing field. They are going to argue the \nMarketplace Fairness Act levels the playing field between brick-and-\nmortar firms and Internet companies for purposes of collecting and \nremitting sales taxes. But the facts are the facts, and they indicate \notherwise.\n  Furthermore, even if Best Buy knows the consumer resides in \nWashington, DC, because Best Buy provides the consumer with a credit \ncard or a rewards card that is associated with a Washington, DC, \naddress, Best Buy is still allowed to assume the television \npurchased will be consumed in Virginia. The Marketplace Fairness Act, \nin my view, is a targeted strike against the Internet and a targeted \nstrike against the digital economy.\n\n  Another myth being put forward is the myth the MFA isn't about new \ntaxes; that the proposal is about enforcing taxes already owed. The \nfact is the taxes that would be collected as a result of the \nMarketplace Fairness Act's passage have generally not been collected. \nSo these are going to be regarded as new taxes. This is money that is \ngoing to come out of the pockets of American families that has not come \nout of their pockets before.\n  Collecting sales and use taxes for goods or services acquired in \nanother State has long been a low priority for State and local \ngovernments. Because these taxes go uncollected and unenforced, the \nestablishment of an unprecedented regime to collect them for the first \ntime is going to require American consumers to pay more sales taxes and \npay more use taxes.\n  Furthermore, the creation of this new trans-State enforcement scheme \ncreates significant new incentives for States to establish new sales \ntaxes and new use taxes and also to increase the tax rates that exist \nnow for these particular items.\n  Ultimately, the Marketplace Fairness Act is going to require \nconsumers to pay an additional $22 billion in sales taxes they have \nnever had to pay before. In fact, unless the United States pursues the \ntypes of international arrangements that govern the Internet economy--\nthe types of arrangements sought by China and a host of other States--\nforeign Internet retailers will only continue to have the competitive \nadvantage the Marketplace Fairness Act would artificially provide them. \nThat is not what the American economy needs. That is not what is going \nto promote online innovation and value.\n  I hope my colleagues will oppose this Marketplace Fairness Act. It is \npremature. It is, more than anything else, coercive. It is coercive.\n  We are going to hear about how simple this is. Back when we started \nwriting the first bills about technology and the Internet, we said the \nkey principle is do no harm. This is going to do harm. Just this past \nweekend, I was in southern Oregon, where we have many small retailers. \nWe have one in Grants Pass, OR--Fire Mountain Gems. It is an exciting \nnew business online, but it is up against very tough international \ncompetition. What I fear is that unless there is a thoughtful effort \nalong the lines of what Chairman Baucus has tried to do in the Finance \nCommittee to think this through, this bill, in a global economy, will \ngive foreign retailers a significant leg up.\n  We will have people on the northern border of the United States or \nthe southern border of the United States who will say: I want to do \nbusiness in the United States. I am a patriotic American, but there are \nmore than 8,000 taxing jurisdictions in America. If we force our \nbusinesses, our online retailers, such as the one I represent in \nsouthern Oregon, to spend their time and their money trying to comply \nwith scores and scores of tax regimes that are thousands of miles away, \nit is going to be very tough for them to compete with foreign \nretailers.\n  This violates the basic principle we began decades ago with respect \nto technology; that is, do no harm. Do no harm to the cause of \ninnovation, ensure we have fairness--bricks and clicks together--which \nis the future of the American economy.\n  This bill violates that basic principle of technology policy. It will \ndo harm.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose it and its premature consideration by \nthe full Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge the Senate not to \nmove forward on the Marketplace Fairness Act.\n  This bill forces small businesses across the country to spend time \nand resources they should be using to create jobs, jumping through new \nbureaucratic hoops. In Montana it forces our small businesses to play \ntax collector for other States, with absolutely no benefit to them. \nInstead of slapping more redtape on our small businesses, we need to be \nsupporting their work to create jobs and get our economy going.\n  Let me be very clear. This bill is bad for business and bad for jobs. \nThis bill is not ready for debate on the Senate floor. It has not been \ncompletely thought through and is full of unintended consequences that \ncould seriously harm America's small businesses.\n  Supporters of the Marketplace Fairness Act claim this bill would \nlevel the playing field between Main Street businesses and out-of-State \nbusinesses by forcing both to collect sales taxes from customers. The \nbill's sponsors claim this is fair. The reality, however, is this \nlegislation is anything but fair to America's small businesses. This \nlegislation doesn't help businesses expand and grow and hire more \nemployees. Instead, it forces small businesses to hire expensive \nlawyers and accountants to deal with the burdensome paperwork and added \ncomplexity of tax rules and filings across multiple States.\n  This is a big-box bill. This is not a downtown bill. Our vanishing \ndowntowns are in crisis. We must find ways to revitalize Main Streets \nacross America by supporting our small retailers. In doing so, we \nfoster economic growth and job creation in our communities.\n  Let me read just one of the hundreds of letters I have received from \nsmall business owners in Montana and across America who are opposed to \nthis legislation:\n\n       Dear Senator Baucus, at a time when the economy is just \n     recovering, the pending Internet sales tax legislation will \n     cost small business jobs, reduce consumer demand, [and] \n     reduce e-commerce innovation.\n       As you know, TicketPrinting.com is the largest private \n     employer in Wheatland County. . . . We expect this \n     legislation to cost 13-20 jobs in one of the poorest counties \n     in the United States, where a job means everything. Rather \n     than rewarding the thousands of small businesses for their \n     innovation and our hard work, Congress will be taxing the job \n     engine of the economy and reducing jobs across the nation.\n       Sincerely, Lance Trebesch.\n\n  There are mom-and-pop businesses such as Mr. Trebesch's across the \ncountry asking for our help. Unfortunately, this bill does not provide \nthat help. It will not solve the challenges facing Main Street. \nInstead, the Marketplace Fairness Act only creates new challenges that \nwill put many of America's small businesses at a disadvantage.\n\n[[Page S2829]]\n\n  This bill imposes additional burdens and compliance demands on \nbusinesses already weighed down by Federal and State tax systems that \nare too complex, too time consuming, and too costly to comply with.\n  I encourage my colleagues to look at this bill very closely. It \nrequires America's businesses to track thousands of different tax codes \nin 7,500 different jurisdictions if they do online business out of \nState. It will force small businesses to hire expensive accountants and \nimplement costly systems to deal with the complexity of collecting \nsales tax on purchases made in other States.\n  And who is policing all of this? The bill, as written, has no audit \nor enforcement protection. As a result, it opens small businesses to \naggressive out-of-State tax collectors. States will be taxing \nbusinesses beyond their borders. This bill helps States target those \nbusinesses that are truly operating out of State and subjects them to \nthe same broken, confusing State sales tax systems that are currently \nin place. Tell me, how does this grow our economy and how does this \ncreate jobs? The promise of simplification in the Marketplace Fairness \nAct is a ruse.\n  First of all, they provide no simplification to the businesses that \nalready collect sales taxes in multiple jurisdictions. Those businesses \nare not even considered in this bill. They are left out.\n  Second, the bill offers no real simplification for the businesses \nthat will now be required to collect sales taxes. It only adds \ncomplexity, with no resources for guidance.\n  This bill does not streamline the 7,500 different tax rates. It does \nnot require the States to agree on definitions of taxable and exempted \nproducts. Think about that for a moment. Each State and many cities and \nmunicipalities have different definitions of what is taxable and what \nproducts are exempt. They are all different.\n  It does not establish standard requirements for electronic filing. \nThink of that for a moment, no standard requirements for electronic \nfiling. It does not establish a central location for registration or \nfiling. It does not offer uniform forms or paperwork. The list goes on \nand on. These are just a few of the problems this bill is going to \ncreate.\n  Even more concerning, this bill does not establish one audit system \nfor all States. Rather, businesses will be exposed to audit by all 50 \nStates. So any State can decide at any time it wants to audit a \nbusiness beyond its borders.\n  This bill does not even establish any rules or procedures for dispute \nresolution. Got a problem with the tax collector in a State across the \ncountry? Good luck. You will have to work it out with that State's \ncourt system.\n  The bill's sponsors tell us not to worry. They say that computer \nsoftware can calculate the sales taxes owed, collect the money due, and \nfile the reports with the States by linking to the seller's Web site. \nIs offering a business the chance to pay someone else to calculate \ntheir taxes for them what passes for simplification? And those software \nproviders cannot protect the business from exposure to audit, \ncollection, and enforcement by 50 different States.\n  Still worried? Well, the bill's sponsors tell us they will exempt \nbusinesses that have $1 million or less in sales to other States where \nsales taxes are not being currently collected. Why this threshold?\n  Studies show that the burden of sales taxes on the very smallest is \nthe highest. It costs approximately 13 percent of the tax collected for \nthese small sellers to comply. As a result, they are not profitable tax \ncollectors for the States. And what about the businesses with \n$1,000,001 in sales? Are they somehow a more efficient tax collector?\n  These are not just empty fears. Businesses call me, exasperated with \ncurrent State law collection requirements. Last Friday I received a \ncall from the director of a farmers cooperative. He explained that many \nStates exempt farmers from sales tax on certain goods. But the laws \nvary greatly by State on what items qualify for exemptions. Businesses \nselling to farmers already spend a lot of time determining what \nqualifies for exemption and what does not. They spend even more time \ntracking exemption certificates.\n  The director then went on to explain:\n\n       If the Marketplace Fairness Act becomes law, it appears \n     that a regional agribusiness, which might occasionally make \n     Internet sales to farmers in states outside of its territory, \n     would have to invest just as much time and effort into \n     studying and complying with the sales tax laws of far-flung \n     states, as it does in the half dozen states where it has \n     facilities.\n       The burden of such compliance would clearly outweigh the \n     benefits of occasional sales.\n\n  This legislation is ripe with unintended consequences. Let me give \nanother example. A key loophole in this bill is that States get to \ndecide what is and what is not taxable. A State could decide that stock \ntrades are taxable goods or services. Then when that State's resident \npurchases shares through his broker, that Wall Street firm will be \nresponsible for registering as a business for sales tax purposes, \ncollecting the sales tax, and remitting the tax to the State. True, \nStates have the authority to decide what is and isn't taxable--to \ndate--even without this bill. But right now the only way to collect \ntaxes on transactions with out-of-State businesses is through use \ntaxes.\n  If States could now require out-of-State businesses to collect on \ntheir behalf, there is an incentive to expand the items that are \ntaxable. This bill is going to make it very desirable for States to \nstart taxing and collecting on all sorts of services--not just the \nfinancial world but also on services provided by attorneys, architects, \nengineers, and accountants. One can only imagine. By not asking the \nStates to do anything to simplify their system in return for the \nbenefit of having out-of-State business collect taxes for them, we are \ngiving a carte blanche to States to impose even more taxes on \nbusinesses.\n  The act is also an abdication of the responsibility given to Congress \nunder the Commerce Clause. We have the duty to recognize that the State \nsales tax systems are still too complicated and would burden interstate \ncommerce if imposed on more businesses.\n  The Finance Committee is committed to tackling these issues to \nprovide real relief to America's families and small businesses. We have \nheld more than 30 hearings on tax reform--including one specifically \ndedicated to State tax issues, such as the Marketplace Fairness Act. I \nhave affirmed repeatedly to Senators Enzi and Durbin that the Finance \nCommittee would work with them to mark up the bill in the next work \nperiod, and I stated that commitment a few moments ago personally to \nthem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes of his time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 \nmore minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Circumventing the committee process allowed this bill to \ncome to the floor full of so many unanswered questions. Avoiding the \ncommittee process quashes any chance to improve this bill. Evading the \ncommittee process denies the chance to provide a fair playing field \namong businesses and reduce the heavy burden imposed by State \ncompliance.\n  I know some may dismiss my concerns as coming from a non-sales-tax \nState. Granted, I am always proud to protect Montana businesses. But \nthis is not a Montana-only issue, nor is it an issue just for States \nwithout sales taxes. Lance Trebesch of TicketPrinting.com and Main \nStreet business owners across America show us that our interests are \ntied together. We need to stop burdening America's small businesses \nwith more compliance costs and figure out ways to help them grow.\n  I urge Members to vote against cloture. Do not give small businesses \nin our States more regulations and more risks with more unintended \nconsequences that have not been addressed. Do not set our Main Street \nbusinesses up to be audited by other States' tax collectors. Give the \nmembers of the Finance Committee the opportunity to make this bill work \nand make it fair. I urge a vote against this motion so we can do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after I \nfinish speaking, my colleague from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, be \npermitted to speak.\n\n[[Page S2830]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, if the vote is at 5:30, \ncould we allocate time so that each of us could have some time before \n5:30? If the Senator would be willing to do that at this point, I would \nnot object.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Absolutely. In fact, as I understand it, Senator Hatch is \ngoing to be coming to the floor also to speak in opposition to it. I \nonly have some brief comments, and I know Senator Alexander will also. \nIf we want to divide this up, I am fine with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for her \ncourtesy. I am perfectly agreeable, following her speech, to dividing \nit, if Senator Durbin wishes to suggest an allocation of time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. As I understand what Ms. Ayotte has said, there are four \nmembers who wish to speak. I don't want to be presumptuous, but if we \neach speak for 5 minutes, then that leaves 10 minutes for those who \nmight arrive whom we are not aware of. So two Senators on the \nRepublican side speak for 5 minutes, I will speak 5 minutes, and then \nSenator Hatch can speak for 5 minutes. Is that fair?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. That is fair. I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for her \ncourtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise to support the comments of my \ncolleague from Montana on the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act, which \nis being brought up today on the floor. I previously said it should be \nrenamed the Internet Tax Collection Act because it is going to make \nonline businesses the tax collectors for the Nation. And as the Wall \nStreet Journal pointed out in an editorial today called ``The Internet \nSales Tax Rush,'' it actually puts the Internet businesses in a \ndisadvantage to brick-and-mortar businesses in terms of making \nrequirements on online businesses to collect taxes for transactions \nthat the online businesses would not have to. And for a State such as \nmine, New Hampshire, where we do not have a sales tax, this is also \nparticularly onerous and tramples on the decision that New Hampshire \nhas made to not have a sales tax.\n  Most important, where we stand right now with the bill pending on the \nfloor, so many times there is so much around here that happens that \ndoes not go through regular order. Yet we have been saying on both \nsides of the aisle how important it is that when we have a major piece \nof legislation--which certainly this is--that we must go through \nregular order.\n  We just heard the chairman of the Finance Committee saying that this \nis circumventing the committee process, that there has not been a \nmarkup of this legislation, and that there are many concerns being \nraised by online businesses across this country based on onerous \nrequirements this legislation will put on them to become the tax \ncollectors for States around the Nation.\n  Many business groups are raising important issues and urging this \nbody to go through the regular process, including the Financial \nServices Roundtable and the Security Industry and Financial Markets \nAssociation.\n  Technet said:\n\n       Imposing a new Internet sales tax regime is a tremendously \n     complex issue that should be addressed through regular order \n     starting in the Senate Finance Committee and done in a \n     thorough and deliberative manner.\n\n  It seems to me that when you have an issue that will impact a growing \nand robust area of our economy; that is, online businesses that are \nselling to the Nation, where we have seen tremendous growth, we owe it \nto the American people to have this go through regular order.\n  I have heard the Senate leader talk about regular order. I have heard \nthe minority leader, Senator McConnell, talk about regular order. Here \nwe are again not going through regular order. This should go to the \nFinance Committee. It should be thoroughly marked up in that committee.\n  I see Senator Hatch. Senator Baucus and Senator Hatch both believe \nthis should go through the proper committee of jurisdiction so that we \ncan address the concerns raised by so many about the bill and the way \nit is drafted.\n  With that, I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture. This is not \nthe right way to do business. This bill, which has very important and \nnegative implications for many businesses in this country and on a very \nimportant area of our economy, should go through regular order to \naddress concerns that have already been raised by many business groups.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to vote against cloture today.\n  I will yield the floor. I know the Senator from Tennessee is coming \nup now, and I know that he too believes in regular order. I hope that \nhe would, at least for this bill, despite his support for it, ask it go \nthrough regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator \nfrom Illinois for allowing me to have 5 minutes.\n  I do believe in having regular order. I have been looking for it for \nquite a while on this bill. But let me start with exactly what the \npoint of this bill is. This bill is about two words. It is about States \nrights. I say that as a former Governor who cares a lot about States \nrights.\n  I see another former Governor sitting in the chair up there. What \nthis bill does is it allows the Governor of Tennessee and the \nLegislature of Tennessee to decide whether to require out-of-State \nsellers in Tennessee to do the same thing we require of instate sellers \nin Tennessee. In other words, if the National Boot Company has to \ncollect the State sales tax and send it to the State government when it \nsells a pair of boots, then an out-of-State catalog seller or an out-\nof-State online seller who sells boots in Tennessee has to do the same \nthing. It is that simple.\n  It is an 11-page bill. That is a rarity around here, an 11-page bill. \nIt doesn't make any of these decisions for the States; it just says the \nStates can make that decision for themselves. With all respect to \nourselves, I trust the Governor of Tennessee and the legislators of \nTennessee to make tax decisions a lot more than I trust Washington \npoliticians to make them.\n  This has nothing to do with the Federal Tax Code. It has zero to do \nwith it. It has about as much to do with the Federal Tax Code as the \nmilk production bill. Actually, milk production has more to do with the \nFederal Tax Code. This is about what a State can decide for itself.\n  If somebody from Ohio or Illinois wants to sell in Tennessee, they \nneed to play by the same rules everybody in Tennessee has to play by--\nwhich is all we are deciding, or at least the Governor and Legislature \nof Tennessee ought to be able to decide that.\n  It is going to be done fairly. We have an equal protection clause in \nthe Constitution that says you cannot treat an out-of-State seller in a \ndifferent way than you do an instate seller, but that is the first \npoint. This is about States rights. It is about the 10th amendment. It \nis about our saying: Yes, Governor, yes, legislature, you don't have to \nplay ``Mother, may I?'' to the Congress. Make your own decisions about \ntaxes. If you decide you want to treat one set of businesses \ndifferently than others and one set of taxpayers differently than \nothers, you have the right to be wrong. That is your business. But if \nyou decide you want to collect taxes that are already owed--that are \nalready owed; this is not a new tax, taxes that are already owed--from \neverybody who owes the tax so you can lower your tax rate for \neverybody, you are free to decide that.\n  That was the argument Art Laffer made in the Wall Street Journal last \nweek. Art Laffer was President Reagan's favorite economist. That is the \npoint he made. States have the right to be right. He said this: States \nhave the right to be wrong. But if Tennessee or Idaho or any State can \ncollect taxes from everybody who owes them, it can lower the tax rate \nfor everybody.\n  That is why so many conservative leaders support this, Art Laffer, Al \nCardenas, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, Gov. Mike \nPence, Gov. Mitch Daniels--almost all the Republican Governors support \nthis. But all we are deciding here in this 11-page bill is two words: \nDo we respect States' rights to decide their own tax policy? Do we \nrespect States rights as the 10th amendment suggests we do?\n\n[[Page S2831]]\n\n  As far as regular order, I wish the Finance Committee had reported a \nbill. This legislation was first introduced in some form in 2001. As \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee said, he had a hearing on part of \nit last year. That was good. The Commerce Committee had a hearing on \nalmost this identical 11-page bill last August. There have been \nrepeated requests of the chairman of the Finance Committee to report \nthe bill. He has not. That is what rule XIV is about.\n  The majority leader said: If the committee is not going to hold a \nhearing and report the bill after that amount of time, then let's put \nit on the floor, let's debate it, let's amendment it.\n  It has been thoroughly considered. It has been before this body and \nthe American people for a good bit of time. The bill we were to move to \ntoday is exactly the bill that was introduced on February 14 of this \nyear, this 11 pages--exactly the bill. It has been out there for \neverybody to see all that time.\n  I urge the 75 Senators who voted for this during the budget \nresolution to reaffirm their vote for States rights--at least vote \ntonight to move ahead, and let's debate it. Let's put it on the floor. \nIf people have amendments or objections, let's bring them down here and \nlet's debate them and vote on it. If we do not, as Senator Heitkamp has \nsaid, who knows----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I may use 30 more seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Senator Heitkamp has pointed out that if we do not \nact, it will be one big mess. Instead of having a handful of \njurisdictions where a seller can simply--when you buy your ice cream \nover at Williams-Sonoma and put in your credit card and ZIP Code, \nautomatically the tax is collected by the seller out of State and sent \nto the State. Instead of that, you will have thousands of jurisdictions \nto contend with. This simplifies the process.\n  This is States rights. This is an opportunity to debate a bill that \nhas been around for more than a decade and that the country has been \nable to see for a couple of months.\n  I urge our colleagues on both sides to take the conservative point of \nview and vote yes and move forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Tennessee. If \nthis is truly a bipartisan effort on both sides of the issue, Democrats \nand Republicans see it differently. The distinguishing feature of those \nwho oppose this is that so far the leading opponents are from States \nwith no sales tax--New Hampshire, Oregon, Montana. One other State in \nAmerica does not have a sales tax--Delaware. They see it differently. \nThey are supporting the bill.\n  Here is what it boils down to. If this bill passes as written, at the \nend of the day a resident of Montana still will not pay sales tax on \nany purchases they make in a store or on the Internet. Residents of \nOregon will not pay a sales tax on any purchase they make in an Oregon \nstore or over the Internet. The same holds true for New Hampshire. They \nare held harmless from the impact of this measure.\n  However, if an Internet retailer in any of those no-sales-tax States \nwants to sell in Maine or Illinois, the terms of doing business under \nhere are that they will collect the sales tax that is owed in that \nState. It is that simple.\n  People have tried to make this more complicated. It is not. They have \nalso suggested it is just going to be beyond anyone to calculate what \nthe sales tax might be. That is just plain wrong. We are way beyond the \nquill pen and ledger days. We are now dealing with software easily \navailable for a very small amount of money that can be given to any \nretailer to know exactly when Durbin of Bates Avenue in Springfield, \nIL, 62704, buys a product and what sales tax should be collected. And \nthe bill provides that each State has to provide the retailer, free of \ncharge, with the basic software so that they can use it to collect the \nappropriate sales tax.\n  They are trying to make this more complicated than it is. Thanks to \ncomputers and thanks to software, it is not that complex, and neither \nis the issue that is underlying this debate. The issue is this: How in \nthe world can you expect the bricks-and-mortar businesses of America to \ncompete with Internet competition when the bricks-and-mortar businesses \nhave to collect sales tax and the Internet competitor does not? In my \nState, that is an 8-, \n9-, or 10-percent advantage, and it is shifting more sales to the \nInternet and away from the local stores. I don't think that is fair.\n  We are asking for a level playing field. A level playing field says \nthat if you want to sell to a consumer in Illinois directly over the \ncounter or over the Internet, you collect the same sales tax. It is \njust that simple. If you don't want to, if your business in Montana or \nOregon does not want to collect sales tax for sales in Illinois, it is \nsimple: You don't sell in Illinois. It is their choice, their call. I \nthink that is basic fairness.\n  Look at the groups that are supporting this. I could sit here for the \nrest of my time and read all the organizations supporting this--the \nobvious ones, the retailers across America, the men and women with the \nstores. The small businesses we venerate in speeches all the time on \nthe floor of the Senate are begging us to do this so they have a \nfighting chance against Internet retailers. We are also getting a lot \nof support from Governors, from mayors, from labor unions. It is a \ndiverse group--business and labor. They believe it not only is fair but \nit will raise revenue that is badly needed in a lot of these local \nunits of government.\n  I might also say that when you take a look at the impact of the \ncurrent situation, you can understand why this is long overdue. Mike \nEnzi was on the floor earlier. He has been for 12 years trying to \nchange this. People say: Regular order; we ought to take a little more \ntime. You can understand that our patience is wearing thin--Mike's more \nthan mine. I have only been at this for a few years. But we reached \nthis point. We had a vote on the budget resolution. We asked the \nMembers of the Senate: What do you think about this issue?\n  Forty-nine from the Democratic side and 26 from the Republican side \nsaid: We favor going forward on this issue.\n  That is the vote we will have in a few minutes. We should go forward \non this too. Those who have constructive, relevant, germane amendments, \nbring them to the floor. Let's have a conversation. Let's get this \nissue done this week. Let's make sure we meet the challenge we have \nbeen given.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for making this as clear as I \nthink any former Governor can make it. If you want to do business in \nTennessee, play by Tennessee rules and obey Tennessee law. If you \ndon't, it is just that simple and fair. In terms of imposing a new tax, \nthis bill does not create one new tax.\n\n  First, there are no Federal taxes in here--none. Second, we don't \neven have the power to impose a new State sales tax, nor would we try. \nThere are no new taxes. It is simply a question of compliance and \ncollecting the taxes already owed in the 46 States that currently have \nsales-and-use taxes.\n  I urge my colleagues to come forward tonight at 5:30 and vote for \ncloture on the motion to proceed. Let us engage in this important \ndebate. Let us not put this off another day, another week, or another \nmonth. Let's bring this to a conclusion in the Senate with a good, \nwholesome debate on a bipartisan basis. Germane, relevant, and \nconstructive amendments that address these issues are welcome. Bring \nthose amendments forward. Let's not burn up the hours of the day and \nthe hours of the week in quorum calls. Let's get down to the business \nin the Senate we were meant to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the last few months I have come to the \nfloor several times to discuss the need for the Senate to return to \nregular order. If the last several years taught us anything, it is that \nefforts to force legislation through the Senate without full and fair \nconsideration tend to yield unsatisfying results.\n  Complaints about the lack of bipartisanship have more or less become \nthe norm around here, and we hear all the time about the desire for the \nso-called grand bargains. Bipartisan agreements don't just happen. I \nthink we would all agree grand bargains cannot be made out of thin air.\n  Luckily the Senate already has a system in place for fostering these \ntypes of agreements. It is called regular order. Yet today the Senate \nwill vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to the so-called \nMarketplace Fairness Act, and in doing so, the Senate will once again \nabandon regular order in favor of the whims of the Senate Democratic \nleadership. This is a bill that falls under the jurisdiction of the \nSenate Finance Committee, but the committee has not had a markup on the \nbill. Instead the Marketplace Fairness Act is just the latest in a long \nline of bills brought before the full Senate without due consideration \nin the committee of jurisdiction.\n  This has become far too common. I understand there are those who feel \nstrongly about this legislation, and I admire them and respect the \nsponsors of the bill who worked hard to address what they see as a \nmajor problem with our Nation's tax policy.\n  However, that simply is not enough to justify yet another abdication \nof the committee process here in the Senate.\n  The Senate is organized into various committees of jurisdiction so \nMembers are able to develop and utilize their own expertise on specific \nissues. When a piece of legislation goes through the committee process, \nit is thoroughly vetted and examined. This provides an opportunity to \nresolve technical issues and address various concerns before the bill \nis brought to the floor for a vote.\n  Regular order is not a process designed to protect the power of \ncommittee chairmen and ranking members. We have regular order and our \ncommittee structure so we have an organized way of ensuring our \nconstituents are fully represented and to make sure the legislation we \npass is technically sound. The legislation we will be voting on today \nis a perfect example of the importance of regular order.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act is a bill that will have a significant \nimpact on millions of consumers and businesses throughout the country, \nand clearly, this is no trifling matter.\n  Most reasonable people would agree that a bill of this magnitude \nwould benefit from full and fair committee consideration, including a \nmarkup with an open debate and an opportunity to vote on amendments \nbefore it is brought to the floor. However, being reasonable doesn't \nappear to be part of the equation on the floor today.\n  I want to stress I am not fundamentally opposed to this legislation. \nMy goal is not to stop it at all costs. Instead, I simply want to \nensure it is fully vetted and examined. I know if all sides are able to \nlook at this in a dispassionate way, we might find ways of bringing all \nsides together, and that is not going to happen the way it is being \ndone now. Therefore, today's vote is, in my view at least, as much a \nvote on regular order as it is a vote on the underlying bill.\n  That said, I do have specific concerns about the legislation as it is \ncurrently drafted. To begin with, the Marketplace Fairness Act in its \ncurrent form is a fairly short 11 pages long. This bill essentially \nprovides two avenues for States to compel remote sellers or out-of-\nState businesses to collect and remit sales and use taxes. Under the \nbill, the State may either meet specified minimum requirements or be a \nmember State under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, as long \nas the minimum requirements are met under the agreement.\n  The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement is a good deal more \ncomplicated than the Marketplace Fairness Act. For starters, at 203 \npages, the agreement is about 18 times longer. Since its adoption on \nNovember 12, 2002, the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement has been \namended 28 times, most recently last year. It is not a simple little \nproblem here.\n\n  The streamlined sales tax governing board has done excellent work in \nbringing States together to cooperatively and voluntarily address the \nissues of sales and use tax complexity and administration, just to \nmention a few issues.\n  According to the streamlined sales tax governing board, 24 States \nhave adopted the simplification measures in the agreement, representing \n31 percent of the population.\n  The authors of the Marketplace Fairness Act hope to apply its \nmeasures to all 50 States and 100 percent of the population.\n  However, the bill is comparatively short on details. For example, the \nStreamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement contains provisions on rules \nfor the sourcing of sales, along with exclusions to those rules. In \norder to levy the appropriate sales tax, the location and subject \nmatter of the transaction must be determined. This level of detail is \nnot present in the Marketplace Fairness Act.\n  It is unclear if the floor established on sourcing requirements under \nthis bill is sufficient to protect consumers from unintended \nconsequences. For example, I have received a letter from the American \nSociety of Pension Professionals and Actuaries which is worried that \nthis legislation ``would allow states to impose a financial transaction \ntax that would apply to American workers' 401(k) contributions and \nother transactions within workers' accounts.''\n  Another concern I have with the current version of the Marketplace \nFairness Act is that it contains a preemption clause which could make \nit possible for States to expand the reach of their sales taxes through \ncreative legislating. The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement at \nleast provides an avenue for the input of multiple States. The States \nthat are not subject to the agreement would, under this bill, be able \nto legislate knowing that the Federal Government will compel \nenforcement of their tax law on nonresidents.\n  I am concerned with the transition costs that will come with this \nlegislation for retailers who have been operating in an environment \nwhere they have not been required to collect and remit sales taxes for \nStates where they do not have a physical presence. This legislation \nwould change that almost in an instant.\n  Before we enact a new sales tax system, we need to take into account \nthe costs that system will impose on businesses of all sizes and the \ndifficulties these companies will face as they adapt to the new regime.\n  For example, there is the issue of vendor compensation. The \nStreamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement currently includes a provision \ngiving States the opportunity to voluntarily compensate remote sellers \n``as a measure of good faith'' for registering to voluntarily collect \nand remit sales taxes into States where the seller has no physical \npresence. This is included in the agreement because under the current \nlaw remote sellers are generally not required to collect and remit the \nsales tax, and they incur a cost when they do so.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act does not include any provision for \ncompensation of remote sellers. I believe this is something we must \ntake into account and examine even more thoroughly. I am also concerned \nabout the small-seller exemption in the bill which would exempt sellers \nwith national remote sales of less than $1 million from the new \nrequirements to collect and withhold sales taxes. This seems like an \nimportant concession, but it is not without its problems.\n  First of all, the cap on the exemption is not indexed to inflation. I \nthink anyone who has observed any part of the roughly 50-year process \nwhere the alternative minimum tax has grown from a fairness measure \ntargeting the rich to an ever-increasing burden on the middle class \nshould understand how inflation can radically distort policy outcomes \nover a period of time. In addition, there are many who argue that the \n$1 million exemption may be too low. In my view, these are concerns we \nneed to fully consider before bringing the bill to the floor.\n  Finally, I want to point out that the bill does not include a \nprovision for a\n\n[[Page S2833]]\n\ndispute resolution venue. Ideally the bill would give Federal district \ncourts exclusive jurisdiction in matters concerning the implementation \nof this legislation. Policy changes with such far-reaching effects \ninevitably lead to unexpected issues and consequences. Giving Federal \ncourts this jurisdiction would ensure greater uniformity and \napplication of this legislation across the country.\n  These are only a few of the concerns I have regarding the Marketplace \nFairness Act. I don't believe these are necessarily fundamental \nconcerns, but they are issues that need to be addressed.\n  I am quite certain that, if given an opportunity, the Finance \nCommittee could address these issues without inexorably changing the \nunderlying purpose of the bill. However, if we proceed with floor \ndebate on the Marketplace Fairness Act as is, we will not have that \nopportunity.\n  The Senate simply cannot continue to operate this way. Once again, we \nneed to restore the deliberative traditions of the Senate, and that \nmeans a return to regular order.\n  I know a number of my colleagues have expressed similar concerns \nabout the need to restore the committee process in the Senate. I hope \nthey will join with me in voting no on cloture on the motion to proceed \nto the Marketplace Fairness Act. This doesn't necessarily determine how \nI am going to vote on the final analysis of this, but I sure as heck \nwould like to approach this in a much more intelligent and \nlegislatively profound way than we are doing here tonight.\n  By the way, we can talk about the fairness of this thing, but there \nare a lot of stakeholders that are not quite convinced this is as fair \nas those who are supporting the bill actually claim.\n  I hope we can have a more deliberative process to examine these \nmatters. The distinguished chairman of the committee has offered to \nhave a hearing on the bill, mark up the bill, and consider it in a \nregular-order approach in the immediate future as soon as we get back \nfrom this next recess. Frankly, I think that is a pretty good offer, \nand it is one we ought to honor if we honor our committee structure in \nthe Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I understand that unanimous consent was \ngiven earlier to have printed in the Record an op-ed from the Wall \nStreet Journal by Arthur B. Laffer entitled ``Tax Internet Sales \nStimulate Growth.''\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. Laffer, as most Americans know, is a distinguished \neconomist. People sometimes said he was President Reagan's favorite \neconomist. He makes the argument that many conservatives and many \nGovernors across the country make, which is: Give us the authority to \nmake these decisions for ourselves. We will collect taxes from \neverybody who already owes the taxes by requiring sellers to collect \nthe taxes whether they are in State or out of State, and then we will \nlower the tax rate.\n  Mr. Laffer says fairness legislation that collects taxes from \neveryone who owes it and then lowers the tax rate is better for \neconomic growth, which is something our country desperately needs.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the comments supporting specifically the legislation from Al \nCardenas, chairman of the American Conservative Union, Governor Mike \nPence of Indiana, and former Governor Mitch Daniels of Indiana.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Conservatives Support Marketplace Fairness\n\n\n        AL CARDENAS, Chairman of the American Conservative Union\n\n       ``When it comes to state sales taxes, it is time to address \n     the area where federally mandated prejudice is most \n     egregious--the policy toward Internet sales, the decades old \n     inequity between online and in-person sales as outdated and \n     unfair.''\n\n\n                          GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE\n\n       ``I don't think Congress should be in the business of \n     picking winners and losers. Inaction by Congress today \n     results in a system today, that does pick winners and \n     losers.''\n\n\n                         GOVERNOR MITCH DANIELS\n\n       ``Sales taxes that states impose ought to be paid, and paid \n     by everybody equally and collected by everybody in the retail \n     business . . . We're not talking about an additional or new \n     tax here--we're talking about the collection of a tax that's \n     existed a long time.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business for 1 more minute \nand then morning business will be closed and we will proceed to the \nmotion under the agreement.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will take that 1 minute, please.\n  This is pretty simple. This legislation is new and only recently \nintroduced. It has never been vetted. Others have but not this \nlegislation. This bill is fraught with all kinds of problems, some of \nwhich have already been enumerated on the floor. There are many \nunintended circumstances.\n  The only right thing to do is to permit this to go back to the \ncommittee so the committee can take it up. As chairman of the \ncommittee, I have made that promise many times. We have already had \nhearings. We will have a markup on this bill in the next work period. A \nmarkup means there will be a vote. I stand here ready to abide by the \nvote. I submit right now that the majority of the Members of the \ncommittee maybe will let us work this thing. I don't know. But that is \nthe process. That is what we should be doing, not just ramming this \nthing through, which is so complex. There are so many unintended \nconsequences. Many of the consequences have been enumerated and not \naddressed but could be addressed and would be addressed in a proper \ncommittee forum.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/22/senate-section/article/S2833-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time during \nadjournment, recess, and morning business count postcloture on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 743.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I designate the Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin, as the floor manager for the consideration of S. 743.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I heard the Senator from Colorado. My \nremarks are about 25 minutes. Are the remarks of the Senator from \nColorado significantly shorter?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I have 3 or 4 minutes of \nremarks.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I am very grateful to my \ncolleague from Minnesota for yielding for those 3 or 4 minutes. I thank \nhim for his forbearance.\n  I rise in support of our local small businesses and retailers across \nColorado and I would like to think across our great country. Senator \nDurbin and Senator Enzi have introduced a bipartisan bill, the \nMarketplace Fairness Act, of which I am a cosponsor. It would level the \nplaying field for businesses located in Colorado by requiring out-of-\nState online sellers to collect and remit the same local and State \nsales taxes they have to pay.\n  It just makes common sense, which is why a similar amendment during \nthe budget debate a few weeks ago, which I also cosponsored, passed by \na bipartisan vote of 75 to 24.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act is about achieving equitable treatment \nfor all sales so businesses with a physical presence in Colorado, \nemploying Colorado workers living in our communities, are not at a \ncompetitive disadvantage with out-of-State businesses that sell \nproducts online.\n  Online marketplaces have created great companies and innovative ways \nof doing business, but Federal law has failed to keep up with the pace \nof online sales. Again, we have had a lot of innovation in the online \nspace, but Federal law has failed to keep up with the pace of online \nsales.\n  Back when trading posts and local markets were the most prevalent \nplaces for consumer goods, they did not have to worry about out-of-\nState sellers. Today, though, nearly 1 in 10 sales occurs online. \nBecause of these online sales, we now have two inequitable forms of \ntreatment in the marketplace: one where local brick-and-mortar \nretailers have to pay sales taxes and one where out-of-State online \nretailers get to take advantage of a loophole and avoid collecting any \nsales taxes at all. This has, unfortunately, created a disincentive to \nshop at and support our small local businesses.\n  It has been said, for at least a decade, that fixing this inequity is \ntoo difficult or it will burden certain online retailers and consumers. \nHowever, it should be noted this legislation requires States to \nsimplify sales tax laws that apply to these out-of-State sales, in \naddition to providing software free of charge to sellers in order to \nmake the task of collecting and remitting this revenue as painless as \npossible.\n  Many States have already taken this step. My State of Colorado is \nconsidering legislation this year to conform to the rules set out in \nthis bill.\n  The version of the Marketplace Fairness Act we are going to consider \nhas been negotiated by Members of both political parties, and it is a \ntestament to what we can do when we work together to benefit our \ncountry and our economy. Not only will this legislation help level the \nplaying field for mom-and-pop shops across our State and our country, \nit will help restore a lost revenue base for local governments that has \nslowly been eroded with the expansion of online out-of-State sales.\n  Most Americans know those commonsense, fair taxes support our \nschools, police and fire departments, and other critical local \nservices. At the very least I think we can all agree that we do not \nwant to penalize Main Street retailers for creating jobs in Colorado \ncommunities, which is why this bipartisan bill is so important.\n  I look forward to voting for the Marketplace Fairness Act, and I \nencourage all of my colleagues to do the same. I want to acknowledge my \ncolleague from Minnesota for yielding me the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly.) The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator from Minnesota yield for a moment? I \nbelieve the Senator from Oregon would like to make a very brief \nstatement for the Record.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I will yield.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank my colleague from Minnesota. The vote was closed \nas I came in the door. Had I been here, I would have voted against \ncloture. I want that to be a clear part of the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about climate \nchange. But I first do want to say how pleased I am that we just got \ncloture to move to debate on the Marketplace Fairness Act. I am a \nstrong supporter of the legislation. As I said, I am a cosponsor. I \nlook forward to the upcoming debate. I plan to speak on this \nlegislation further tomorrow.\n  Now I would like to talk about climate change. More specifically, I \nrise to suggest that we in this body talk more about climate change so \nthat we can agree on taking action to address it. We need to address \nthe environmental impacts that we are currently facing and the future \nimpacts that will only become exponentially worse if we fail to act. \n2012 was the hottest year on record in the continental United States. \nIn fact, it beat the previous record by a full degree.\n  To give you some idea about how remarkable a full degree of warming \nin 1 year is, scientists tell us since the last ice age 20,000 years \nago the Earth has warmed only 16 degrees at the most. Since we began \nactually measuring\n\n[[Page S2835]]\n\ntemperatures in the continental United States and recording them 117 \nyears ago, the variance between the coldest year and the warmest year \nhas only been 4.2 degrees.\n  So for the temperature to jump a full degree in 1 year is not just \nremarkable, it is alarming. Often when people consider the harmful \nconsequences of climate change and its cost, they are talking about the \nfuture. But make no mistake, climate change is already costing the \nUnited States serious money.\n  2012 was a year when a historic drought caused more than 70 percent \nof U.S. counties to be declared disaster areas. Agriculture Secretary \nTom Vilsack has estimated the drought's impact on the agricultural \nsector to be around $50 to $60 billion. That cost gets passed on to \nevery American. The drought destroyed or damaged major crops all over \nthis country, making corn and soybeans more expensive, increasing \nanimal feed costs. So Americans are paying more for meats and other \nanimal-based products.\n  The 2012 drought dramatically lowered water levels on the Mississippi \nRiver, seriously interfering with our ability to transport our \nagricultural goods to market to compete with those from other \ncountries. So that barges did not run aground, shippers sent them down \nthe Mississippi River the last few months half full, say, with \nsoybeans, making our beans less competitive with Brazilian beans.\n  More and more of my conversation with Minnesota soybean growers who \nexport over one-third of their crop focused on this very issue. Climate \nchange is exacerbating our Nation's wildfires, and that is costing us \nserious money. When Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell testified before \nthe Senate Energy Committee, I asked him about the link between forest \nfires and climate change. He told us that throughout the country we are \nseeing longer fire seasons on average by more than 30 days. Wildfires \nare also larger and more intense.\n  I asked Chief Tidwell whether scientists at the Forest Service \nthought that climate change was increasing the size and intensity of \nwildfires and extending their season. Without hesitation he said yes. \nThe Forest Service is spending more and more of its budget fighting \nwildfires, now about half of its budget. Longer fire seasons and larger \nmore intense fires are just going to eat up more of that budget.\n  Not only is climate change worsening our forest fires, it is also \nexacerbating other problems plaguing our forests. That includes a very \nserious bark beetle crop. The bark beetle is normally kept in check \nbecause cold winters at high altitudes kill its larva.\n  Let's talk about the bark beetle at high altitudes. Their larva used \nto freeze. But now, because of climate change, that is not happening. \nThe winters have gotten warmer and at higher altitudes, and the bark \nbeetles are surviving. That means they are destroying more forests.\n  Similarly, in some Colorado forests scientists have shown that \nbecause of warmer weather, mountain pine beetles have gone from \nreproducing once a year to twice a year. In a little over a decade, \nthis mountain pine beetle has killed more than 70,000 square miles' \nworth of trees. That is an area equivalent to the entire State of \nWashington.\n  Of course, we cannot talk about climate change without talking about \nsea level rise. I serve on the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources. Several months ago we had a hearing on sea level rise. We \nheard testimony about how rising sea level is increasing the size of \nflood zones and increasing damage that occurs from storm surges.\n  One of the witnesses told us that just a few extra inches of sea \nlevel could result in a storm surge that could flood the New York City \nsubway system. It sounded like something out of science fiction. Yet a \nlittle over 6 months later that is exactly what happened. That is \nexactly what happened when Hurricane Sandy hit New York City and \nflooded the subways.\n  My colleagues do not need to be reminded of the cost of Hurricane \nSandy. It is costing taxpayers a staggering $60 billion. Unfortunately, \nonly one of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle, the ranking \nmember, Senator Murkowski, attended this hearing. This has been pretty \nmuch the case whenever we have a hearing that even tangentially relates \nto climate change.\n  A number of my colleagues in Congress do not believe that human \nactivities contribute to climate change. Many others, I suspect, do not \ntalk about climate change because addressing it requires making some \ndifficult choices. But let's be clear about this. Climate change is \nalready costing us. If we do not act now, it will worsen dramatically \nand be far more costly.\n  The Defense Department has studied potential threats to national \nsecurity imposed by climate change. DOD's 2010 Quadrennial Defense \nReview states that climate change may act as an accelerant of \ninstability or conflict. That, in turn, would place burdens on civilian \ninstitutions and militaries around the world. The top commander in the \nPacific, ADM Samuel Locklear, has said the biggest long-term security \nchallenge in the Pacific is climate change. As the Pacific commander he \nunderstands the impact sea level rise and extreme weather events can \nhave on our military resources and on civilian populations in the \nPacific.\n  My constituents in Minnesota also understand the threat of climate \nchange. That is why recently nearly 400 people gathered at a local \nLutheran church in Willmar, MN, to talk about climate change. Willmar \nis not a big city. So when this many people gather in one place, you \nknow it is a big deal. They are concerned about climate change and the \nmarked increase in severe weather occurrences.\n  But when they look to Washington they see a disconnect. They see a \ndisconnect between what the country is experiencing and what Washington \nis doing about it--or, rather, what Washington is not doing. Outside of \nWashington, and not just in Minnesota, things are different. In fact, \nmany respected Republican leaders outside of Washington understand the \nimportance of addressing climate change.\n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, for example, Republican Governor \nChris Christie of New Jersey acknowledged that climate change is a \nproblem and that human activities are playing a role.\n  Former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, also a \nRepublican, has launched an organization to fight climate change. \nFormer Utah Governor and Republican Presidential candidate John \nHuntsman has noted that whenever a party takes a position that runs \ncounter to the position of 98 out of every 100 scientists, that party \nhas a problem.\n  Governor Huntsman is right. Let me illustrate with an analogy. Say \nyou went to a doctor who told you: You know, you better start eating \nmore sensibly and start exercising because you are tremendously \noverweight. I see in your file that your father died of a heart attack \nat an early age. So you really have to go on a diet and start working \nout.\n  You say: You know what, I would like a second opinion.\n  So you go to a second doctor and he examines you, or she examines \nyou, and says: OK, look, you have a family history of heart disease. \nYour father died of a heart attack at 40. You weigh over 300 pounds. \nYour cholesterol is out of control. Your blood pressure is through the \nroof. It would just be irresponsible of me not to immediately send you \nto the Mayo Clinic to this place I know. You have to go there.\n  Then you say: Thanks, doctor, but I would really like a third \nopinion.\n  The third doctor says: Wow. This is a problem. You know, looking at \nyour family history and looking at you and your tests, I am amazed you \nare still alive. You have to do something about this.\n  You say: You know, I would really like a fourth opinion--and this \nkeeps going. It takes months. Finally, you get to the 50th doctor. The \n50th doctor examines you and says: Boy, it is a good thing you came to \nme because all this diet and exercise would have been a waste. You are \ndoing just fine. Those other doctors, well, they are in the pockets of \nthe fresh food and vegetable people. Enjoy life as much as you want and \nwatch a lot of TV.\n\n  Then you learn this doctor was paid his salary by the makers of \nCheetos. Don't get me wrong--Cheetos are a delicious snack. They can \nand should be eaten in moderation.\n  If 98 out of 100 doctors tell me I have a problem, I should take \ntheir advice. If those two other doctors are paid by\n\n[[Page S2836]]\n\n``Big Snack Food'' the way certain climate deniers are paid by ``Big \nCoal,'' I shouldn't take their advice. However, 98 out of 100 climate \nscientists are telling us we have a problem.\n  Governor Huntsman is right. Outside of Washington, many people get \nthis. Even some of the very companies that previously funded anti-\nclimate change efforts have turned the page on this issue. ExxonMobil \nused to fund the Heartland Institute, which is one of the leading \nclimate change denial organizations. If you go to ExxonMobil's Web site \ntoday, it states, ``Rising greenhouse gas emissions pose significant \nrisks to society and ecosystems.'' Shell Oil states on its Web site, \n``CO2 emissions must be reduced to avoid serious climate \nchange.'' Even the major oil and gas companies have begun to \nacknowledge that climate change is real.\n  I respectfully suggest that my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle here in Congress also need to engage in a serious conversation on \nclimate change. At a time when Americans are dealing with record \ndroughts and devastating hurricanes, the Senate cannot afford to simply \nignore climate change. We need to talk about this, as Democratic and \nRepublican leaders outside of Washington are talking about it. \nUltimately, we need to come together to address climate change before \nits damaging costs to society are out of control.\n  I do not pretend this will be easy. Some people will point out that \nclimate change is a global problem. It is. We can't solve it alone. We \ncan't, and they are right. Emissions in the developing world are now on \nthe rise. China surpasses the United States in total greenhouse gas \nemissions--not per capita; we are still ahead on that. But China is \nalso making major investment in renewable energy. According to the \nUnited Nations Environmental Program, in 2011 China led the world in \nrenewable energy investments, with nearly one-fifth of the global \ntotal. This is in spite of the fact that China's GDP in 2011 was half \nof our GDP. If we are going to lead the clean energy race and create \ngood-paying jobs for Americans, we must invest in our renewable energy \ninfrastructure.\n  Last year the Senate Energy Committee heard testimony regarding a \nreport from the American Energy Innovation Council's report entitled \n``Catalyzing Ingenuity.'' The report, authored by former Lockheed \nMartin CEO Norman Augustine, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, and other \nbusiness leaders, states:\n\n       The country has yet to embark on a clean energy innovation \n     program commensurate with the scale of the national \n     priorities that are at stake. In fact, rather than improve \n     the country's energy innovation program and invest in \n     strategic national interests, the current political \n     environment is creating strong pressure to pull back from \n     such efforts.\n\n  This is very important. I encourage my colleagues--especially those \nwho oppose Federal funding for clean energy--to read this report \nbecause what people often forget is that this is nothing new. \nGovernment has always supported strategic energy priorities. As Mr. \nAugustine noted in his testimony, commercial nuclear power was the \nresult of government investments in naval reactors. Do you know why \nnatural gas is transforming our energy sector today? It is because of \nyears of Federal support to develop hydrofracking technology. The \nEastern Gas Shales Project was an initiative the Federal Government \nbegan back in 1976, before hydrofracking was a mature industry. The \nproject set up and funded dozens of pilot demonstration projects with \nuniversities and private gas companies that tested drilling and \nfracturing methods. This investment by the Federal Government was \ninstrumental in the development of the commercial extraction of natural \ngas from shale. In fact, microseismic imaging--a critical tool used in \nfracking--was originally developed by Sandia National Laboratory, a \nFederal energy laboratory.\n  The industry was also supported through tax breaks and subsidies. In \nfact, Mitchell Energy vice president Dan Stewart said in an interview \nthat Mitchell Energy's first horizontal well was subsidized by the \nFederal Government. Mr. Mitchell said of the Department of Energy:\n\n       DOE started it, and other people took the ball and ran with \n     it. You cannot diminish DOE's involvement.\n\n  So the basis of the natural gas revolution that is helping make \nAmerica more energy independent can be traced back to Federal support. \nIn the same way, we must support the renewable energy sector now. We \nneed to be the ones--our country, the United States, Americans--we must \nbe the ones who sell this transformative and environmentally friendly \ntechnology to other nations. We must do this.\n  We need to start by having a conversation about climate change. It \nwould be irresponsible to avoid the issue because it is uncomfortable \nto talk about. The stakes are too high and we would be shirking our \nresponsibility to our constituents, to our children, to our \ngrandchildren, and to posterity. The discussion is not going to be easy \nbecause there are going to be painful tradeoffs. I certainly don't have \nall the answers. I do know we need to have the conversation. We cannot \nleave this issue to future generations. I have a grandchild on the \nway--my first. I don't want to look back and tell him that when his \ngrandfather was in a position to do something about climate change, he \nchose not to because it involved some politically difficult choices. I \ndon't want to tell him that we compromised our moral integrity for \npolitical expediency.\n  We all have constituents who care about this issue. When I go back to \nWillmar, MN, I want to tell my constituents who met in a church and \nspoke about climate change that we heard them. I want to tell them we \nare working together across the aisle to talk about and address one of \nthe most difficult problems we face.\n  I invite my colleagues to join in this endeavor and make dealing with \nclimate change a bipartisan issue. We owe it to the Nation and to \nfuture generations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, let me commend \nmy colleague from Minnesota for making so many thoughtful points in \nthis effort to deal with climate change. Having returned from Oregon, \nwith a whole host of meetings in connection with Earth Day, the Senator \nis spot-on in speaking about the enormity of the problem. It is very \nclear that the planet is getting warmer, drought is becoming more \nserious, the fires are becoming more catastrophic and the storms \nincreasingly brutal. It is very clear that now Democrats and \nRepublicans must come together around this issue.\n  The Senator and I serve together on the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. This will be priority business for us, and his thoughtful \nremarks today are yet another effort in terms of trying to bring people \ntogether. The focus of the Senator's remarks has been not to say it is \nthis person's fault or another person's fault, it is about how \nDemocrats and Republicans need to come together.\n  I commend my Democratic colleague for his good speech and the good \nfortune to chair the subcommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, \nwhere he will be able to focus on these issues.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning business for up to \n30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senate has now moved to the Marketplace Fairness Act. \nI say this, frankly, a little dubiously because I think it really ought \nto be called the Shop Canada or Shop Mexico Act. It will make it \nattractive for businesses located in the United States to set up shops \noverseas as the coercion that is applied to the United States will not \naffect foreign retailers.\n  What I wish to do tonight is speak for a brief period of time--\nbecause we are going to have opportunity throughout the week to discuss \nthis--in the hopes that the points I highlight tonight will help start \na bipartisan effort to attempt to fix what I think are the most serious \nproblems with the Marketplace Fairness Act.\n  The essence of my concern is that coercion and discrimination are not \nwhat America is all about. Those are the fundamental principles of the \nMarketplace Fairness Act. What I wish to do is be very specific with \nrespect to how this coercion and discrimination, particularly against \nsome of the most innovative forces in the American economy, are going \nto take their toll.\n\n[[Page S2837]]\n\n  With respect to coercion, this is legislation that enabled one State \nto impose the enforcement of its laws on 49 other States and the \nterritories without the approval of such States and territories. Let me \nrepeat this. It is coercion. It can be forced on these other States \nagainst their will. In effect, under the Marketplace Fairness Act, \nbusinesses may be audited by a myriad of out-of-State tax collectors \nand be forced to defend themselves in out-of-State courts.\n  A vote for the Marketplace Fairness Act without efforts to try to \npromote some element of voluntary participation is a vote to subject a \nSenator's home State Internet companies to the whim and will of tax \ncollectors and State courts around the country. This, in essence, is \nthe coercion aspect of this legislation.\n  I have suggested to Senators that at a minimum this effort, this \nlegislation should be altered to allow for voluntary compacts. Congress \nwould say States could voluntarily take these steps with respect to \ninterstate tax collection rather than being required to do it. I have \nheard my colleagues who say perhaps this would make one State a haven \nwith respect to Internet sales. The reality is that States rights are \nabout States rights. One State may look to choose to incent one \nparticular type of business or another, but this is ultimately a State \ndecision.\n  If you are, in fact, a supporter of States rights, why would you \noppose something that allows a State to voluntarily choose what course \nit wishes to promote with respect to the collection of online taxes? \nThis is not what this bill is all about. It is not voluntary, it is \ncoercive. That is why, in my view, it undermines what I think the \nprinciples of our country are all about. Our country is not about \ncoercion, it is not about discrimination. This is what the bill, \nregrettably, is all about.\n  Let me outline the second point with respect to how the Marketplace \nFairness Act discriminates against Internet companies. The Marketplace \nFairness Act relies on Internet sellers to determine the address of \nwhere consumers are located in order to generate an approximation of \nwhere goods or services sold by an online retailer will be consumed. \nThere is no similar requirement with respect to brick-and-mortar \nbusinesses--no similar requirement with respect to brick-and-mortar \nbusinesses--even though consumers often travel across State lines in \norder to purchase goods and services that may be unavailable to them in \ntheir home jurisdictions or available at lower sales or use tax rates.\n\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act does not require brick-and-mortar firms \nto obtain and use consumer information to determine where a good or \nservice may be consumed. Why should the Federal Government require \nInternet companies to collect and remit sales and use taxes on behalf \nof consumers but not impose any such burden on brick-and-mortar firms \nproviding goods and services to out-of-State consumers?\n  So the irony of this is that really about 15 years ago--and it has \nbeen particularly satisfying to me in terms of our service in the \nSenate--as we began to look at policies that would allow innovation and \ntechnology to grow--and I will talk a little about how some of those \npolicies led to the first investments in social media--we established \ntwo principles with respect to technology policy: No. 1, we said let's \nensure there is no discrimination. What goes on off-line and what goes \non online should be parallel so that we can encourage both parts of the \nAmerican economy.\n  That principle has made a lot of sense. In fact, it has led to a \ngreat many stores--I am sure at home in Indiana for the Presiding \nOfficer of the Senate--with bricks and clicks looking to try to have a \nvigorous presence in States because the two are mutually reinforcing. \nTo do that we have to ensure there is a policy of nondiscrimination.\n  What I have done is outline very specifically about how the \nMarketplace Fairness Act moves away from that principle of \nnondiscrimination by giving, in many jurisdictions, the brick-and-\nmortar retailers a leg up. And what I am in favor of is continuing that \npolicy which has made sense for 15 years.\n  We also talked about doing no harm and ensuring we especially \npromoted voluntary approaches--voluntary approaches. I think it was \nbefore the Presiding Officer was in the Congress, but one of the things \nI was especially proud of was our help in generating investment in the \nsocial media back when I came to the Senate. There was a great concern \nabout censorship online. Of course, all of us, as parents, were \nhorrified by some of the smut and pornography that was coming available \nonline, all over the Web, and so a big debate was held.\n  There were essentially two approaches: One was to set up a big \ncensorship effort that would say, for example, if somebody posted some \nof this horrible pornography on a Web site or a blog, the Web site \nwould be held secondarily liable for this material posted on the site. \nA lot of us said: No way the Net is going to be able to grow if Web \nsites and blogs are held liable for something that is posted on their \nsite, which they probably aren't even going to know anything about \nbecause there are, of course, thousands and thousands of postings--\nmillions in the case of some of the big sites.\n  So working with a very conservative Republican in the House, \nCongressman Cox, we wrote an alternative approach which encouraged \nvoluntary approaches with respect to dealing with a societal problem, \nand a very serious problem with respect to pornography. Back then the \nCongress didn't know how to deal with these issues, so both \napproaches--both the censorship approach and the voluntary approach to \nhelp parents filter out the smut--actually got into the law and it went \nto the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court struck down the censorship \napproach and upheld the voluntary bipartisan approach Congressman Cox \nand I put together.\n  Today, when we talk to people in the social media, they will tell us \nthat voluntary approach was, to a great extent, what encouraged the \nfirst investments in social media. People in social media will say \nnobody would have invested in the future Facebooks and Twitters and the \nlike if they thought the social media sites, the Web sites and the \nlike, were going to be held secondarily liable for something that was \nposted.\n  That voluntary approach, which did so much to boost our economy, is \nbeing rejected in the Marketplace Fairness Act as it is written because \nthis bill goes to a coercive approach, as I said, that would outline \nthe ability for one State to impose the enforcement of its laws on 49 \nother States and territories without the approval of those States and \nterritories.\n  So I bring up this tonight because I am very hopeful as this debate \ngoes forward and the bill is considered further that at a minimum the \nsponsors of the legislation--and all of us here can count and look at \nvote totals--will see that allowing for voluntary compacts is really \nwhat States rights are all about, No. 1. It is that voluntary approach \nthat has made such a difference in encouraging the innovation and \ngrowth of the Internet and technology.\n  One other point I would like to mention tonight is what this bill \ndoes with respect to America's ability to compete in a global economy. \nThis is, in effect, an unprecedented approach that would apply local \nlaws to the global medium that is the Internet.\n  For example, I just came back--flew about 6,000 miles over the last \nfew days--from meeting with constituents at home. I was in southern \nOregon until the middle of the day yesterday. They have a big e-\ncommerce effort going in a wonderful company called Fire Mountain Gems \nin Grants Pass, OR, with hundreds of employees and a very exciting \nonline business. Their big competitor in Grants Pass, OR--which is a \ntown that has been hard hit economically. We are working hard on their \nforestry issues, particularly trying to get the harvest up. That is \nsomething I am working on as chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, and I had a good chance to talk about resources \npolicy with the Presiding Officer of the Senate.\n  One of the things they very much want to do in Grants Pass is find as \nmany good-paying jobs as they can, given the fact the economy is \nhurting in rural areas.\n  So as I try to boost the harvest in Grants Pass, OR, and get people \nback to work in the woods, I am obviously looking for other areas where \nbusinesses could grow. This legislation, as\n\n[[Page S2838]]\n\nwritten, will deal a significant body blow to a business's ability to \ngrow, such as the one I know about in Grants Pass, OR. Here is why: The \nlegislation doesn't apply to foreign retailers, and the competition for \nFire Mountain Gems is certainly overseas, with a host of companies in \nthis space.\n  It also has huge implications for the northern border and the \nsouthern border of our country because so many of the promising \nbusinesses in those communities are going to say to themselves: We are \npatriotic Americans. We deeply believe in our country and our values, \nbut how are we going to compete? How are we going to figure out a way \nto wade through more than 9,000 taxing jurisdictions? Wouldn't it be \nmore sensible to just move a half hour across the border and not have \nto go through any of this?\n  I just don't think this works as it relates to the global economy. \nMaybe this bill ought to be called the Shop China or Shop Mexico or \nShop Canada bill. Whatever you call it, it seeks to apply local laws to \na global medium. That, in my view, defies common sense, and, by the \nway, that too has been a principle that has been rejected in debates \nabout tech policy over the years.\n  So I hope Senators are going to be open to working with the \nbipartisan group--there are a host of Senators on both sides of the \naisle who care about these issues--to take some of the principles that \nhave been central to the growth of innovation, online business--\nparticularly as it relates to new apps and new technologies--that have \nworked for the last few years and build them into this legislation, \nrather than repudiate the principles of voluntarism and \nnondiscrimination that have been so key, as I have outlined here \ntonight, to investment in the social media, to encouraging innovation \nthrough nondiscriminatory tax policies, and to new innovations that we \nbegan to bring into the policy arena, such as digital signatures.\n  There we had the same thing--a great concern about whether this was \nequitable, whether it would work, but after hearings and a thoughtful \nanalysis, a group of us wrote that law as well. So whether it was \nregulation, whether it was taxes, whether it was innovation such as \ndigital signatures, the four or five laws over the last 15 years that \nhave paid off for technology and innovation and small business--the \nbasic principles behind those laws--are being repudiated in this bill \nand, I believe, will be injurious to the country.\n  So my hope is, as we go forward, that we can take some of those \nprinciples that have been key to growth in the technology sector and \nstart building them into this discussion with respect to collection of \nonline sales taxes.\n  By the way, for more than a decade, this has been a topic. I and \nothers have said we are very open to any and all approaches to collect \ntaxes owed, and particularly ones that don't amount to what looks like \nbureaucratic water torture associated with the collection process. And \nI think Senators are underestimating how difficult this will be.\n  I would particularly cite the proposition that if it was so easy, it \nwould have been done some time ago. By the way, it would have been done \nwith voluntary actions through many of these taxing jurisdictions \nrather than the coercive approach that is advanced in this legislation.\n  I see my friend from New Hampshire. I was particularly struck, I \nwould say to my colleague, about how the principles I am talking about \ntoday--coercion and nondiscrimination--apply in my colleague's State as \nwell because her State, as so many others, would face the prospect \nwhere online retailers would have one set of burdensome rules that \nwouldn't apply to a whole host of other businesses. It brings back the \nprinciple of discrimination we rejected years and years ago.\n  Having heard the Senator from New Hampshire speak eloquently on these \nissues, I look forward to her remarks. When I came to the floor, I said \nthe key to successful tech legislation for the last 15 years has been \ntwo principles: a voluntary approach rather than a coercive approach \nand nondiscrimination rather than discrimination. The Senator from New \nHampshire and I are from States where this bill brings those policies--\ncoercion and discrimination--back in very stark terms that will be \ninjurious to the citizens we represent and harm the cause of innovation \nacross the country.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for all her contributions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I couldn't say it any more eloquently \nthan my friend from Oregon whose small businesses are facing the same \nkind of discrimination our small businesses in New Hampshire are \nfacing.\n  I came straight from the airport--my flight was delayed; so I wasn't \nhere to vote no on this legislation that I think has not been thought \nthrough carefully because, as the Senator from Oregon points out, it is \ngoing to affect innovation and the ability to use the Internet in a way \nthat I think most of this should be used. It is going to set up a whole \nnew set of rules that are very difficult for our businesses in New \nHampshire and Oregon to comply with. I think it is not the best way for \nus to go about taxation and doing it in a fair way. Sadly, as a result \nof this legislation, if it passes, as the Senator pointed out, we are \ngoing to see a whole different set of rules for one set of businesses \nthan for another and that just isn't right.\n  So I plan to come down to the floor and speak at greater length about \nthis tomorrow, but I wanted to come this afternoon, when I heard the \nSenator was speaking as I came from the airport, to join the Senator in \nopposition to the legislation and point out that I certainly would have \nvoted no and intend to continue to do everything I can to try to \naddress what I think is a very unfair way to deal with taxation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from New \nHampshire for her contribution.\n  Obviously, the vote this afternoon didn't go our way. My hope is that \nas Senators from both political parties have a chance over the next few \ndays to lay out the consequences of the two principles we have been \ntalking about--staying away from coercion and staying away from \ndiscrimination--by the time the Senate has completed debate and votes, \nwe can come up with a proposal that will not set back the cause of \ninnovation in this country.\n  We both have talked about the fact that the March numbers on jobs \nwere not where we would like them to be. Particularly distressing is \nthe number of people who seem to be either dropping out of the \nworkforce or working part time because they can't find anything full \ntime. Now we are looking at policies that will make efforts to put \nthose people back to work even harder.\n  So I am very appreciative of the fact that the Senator was able to \ncome to the floor; because what I tried to do over the last 20 minutes \nor half an hour is outline what has worked in technology policy for the \nlast 15 years. It has been nondiscrimination and noncoercion. This bill \nrepudiates both of those. My hope is the Senator and I and other \nSenators on both sides of the aisle can find a way to change this \nlegislation so as to at least not go backward with respect to those \nvalues that have been so key to the growth of jobs in the technology \nsector. To have the Senator here is so helpful, and I am very \nappreciative.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I look forward to working with my friend \nfrom Oregon to try and amend this legislation to address some of the \nconcerns that we, along with a number of other members of this body, \nshare. It should be an interesting week.\n  Mr. WYDEN. A good note to close on.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I address the \nSenate as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Veterans Claims Backlog\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, next month, Americans across the country \nwill gather on Memorial Day to remember the sacrifices made by \ngenerations of men and women in service to\n\n[[Page S2839]]\n\nour country and to preserve our freedoms.\n  There is no group of Americans I hold in higher regard than our \nNation's veterans. Their service and sacrifice have allowed us to live \nin the strongest, freest, and greatest country in the world. We should, \nin the Senate, utilize their service as our role models.\n  America's veterans have fought tyrants and terrorist to keep our \ncountry safe and secure. Yet when they return home from war, they have \nto continue to fight many battles.\n  Veterans are struggling to find a job. The unemployment rate for the \npost-September 11 veteran remains well above the national average of 10 \npercent.\n  Some veterans continue to face difficulties accessing quality health \ncare services, especially those as in my State where there are rural \nareas and long distances to travel for the care they need, and many \nveterans must wait long periods of time for their benefit claims to be \nprocessed by the Federal Government, which is what I would like to \nhighlight today.\n  Honoring those who served our country certainly means more than \npaying tribute to them on Memorial Day. It means keeping our promises. \nWe owe our Nation's veterans the absolute best--the best health care, \nthe best educational opportunities, the best support possible to help \nthem continue to have successful lives after their service to our \ncountry. But all too often, veterans tell me they had to wait months--\nand in some cases years--for their benefits to be processed. This is \nsimply unacceptable.\n  I served on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee for 14 years. I now \nserve on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. Making an improvement \nin the quality of life for our Nation's veterans is one of my top \npriorities, and I want to continue to raise the concerns that are \nraised to me until progress is made.\n  In January of this year, the VA outlined a strategic plan to reduce \ntheir enormous claims backlog. According to this new plan, they \nestimate they will resolve around 1.9 million claims in 2015, which is \nan ambitious goal because that would be roughly an 80-percent increase \nin the productivity over the 2012 level.\n  I certainly appreciate Secretary Shinseki's commitment to eliminating \nthe backlog of claims and his initiatives to transform the claims \nprocess, but there is evidence against the VA's assertion that the \nclaims backlog will be remedied by 2015.\n  In the 2010, the VA projected that by this year--2013--it would take \n160 days per claim to reach a decision. But in the first quarter of \nthis fiscal year, it actually took more than 270 days per claim. It \nseems the numbers are, once again, continuing to be headed in the wrong \ndirection.\n  In fact, the number of claims considered backlogged--or have been \npending for more than 125 days--grew from fewer than 150,000 in 2009 to \n600,000 in March of this year. In total, about 70 percent of the \ncurrently pending claims are considered backlogged.\n  The Presiding Officer has probably heard the saying that past \nperformance is a good indicator of future performance. If this pattern \ncontinues, my fear is--and reality suggests--this problem only gets \nworse.\n  As we draw down in Afghanistan and the Armed Services reduce their \nforce structure, the number of service members who will rely upon the \nVA will increase significantly. If the VA is not able to adequately \nhandle claims now, how will the process work when even more veterans \nclaims are being submitted?\n  As recently as September of last year, the inspector general of the \nVA found that the VA had not yet fully tested their new system, which \nis supposed to help them process these claims more efficiently. At that \npoint, the new system could not even process a claim from the beginning \nof the end of the rating process.\n  I met recently with Kansas veterans who were here in Washington, DC, \nas part of national veterans service organization--the American Legion, \nthe Disabled Veterans of America, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars--and \ntheir No. 1 concern is the unreasonable amount of time it takes for \nbenefits claims to be processed.\n  Oftentimes the conversations I have are with folks who have an urgent \nneed related to their home or health care, but they are stuck waiting \non the VA to get back to them. I know my colleagues in the Senate \nexperience the same kind of stories. These are real individuals, with \nreal needs, whose lives are impacted when their benefits claims go \nunresolved day after day.\n  A step in the right direction was announced this last Friday from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs: The VA is finally responding to our \nconcerns about claim backlogs and expediting the process for claims \nthat have been held for more than 1 year.\n  It is absurd a veteran would have been waiting for 1 year or more to \nhave claims processed, and I am pleased to see the VA is taking action \nand I am glad the message is being heard. I hope it has success.\n  Nonetheless, we certainly know that challenges remain, and it is \nimportant to me that the VA get to the bottom of this issue and come up \nwith a solution to improve the claims process and eliminate this \nbacklog in a timely manner.\n  The government is not the only industry that has to process an \nenormous volume of benefit claims. Large insurance companies process \nclaims successfully every day, so the VA should consult with the \nprivate sector and learn from their experiences a way to process \nclaims. The VA does not need to waste more time and money recreating \nthe wheel when solutions may be ever present in the private sector and \nwithin the agency among those who service claims.\n  Until then, Congress should continue to hold the VA accountable as to \nhow they will resolve this problem in a real way, with real results for \nour veterans.\n  We must never forget that our country has a responsibility to its \nveterans. The brave men and women who have put their lives on the line \nto defend our country deserve our respect and that means receiving the \nbenefits they have earned in a timely manner.\n  Especially at a time when more and more troops are transitioning out \nof the military, and the needs of aging veterans are increasing, I am \ncommitted to keeping our promise to those who have served our country.\n\n\n                       Remembering Don Concannon\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I also wish to speak this evening about a \nKansan who recently died and pay tribute to his life. My tribute this \nevening is to Don Concannon. Don Concannon of Hugoton, KS, is an \nexample of a life I admire and respect so much. He exemplifies so much \nthe folks from my home State of Kansas. It is a tribute to the folks at \nhome who get so involved in their local communities. They volunteer at \nschool. They serve on their church board. They get involved in public \nservice. Kansans are always looking for ways to improve the lives of \nthose around them, their friends and neighbors and people they do not \neven know.\n  One of those Kansans is our former Republican Party State chairman, \nDon Concannon. We have lost a great man, a strong advocate and a \ndedicated public servant when Don recently passed away.\n  Don grew up on a farm in southwest Kansas and graduated from Garden \nCity High School in 1945. Early on in life, Don began serving our \ncountry when he joined the U.S. Navy and fought in the South Pacific \nduring WWII.\n  After the war, Don graduated from Washburn Law School in 1952 and \nmoved to Hugoton to practice law. It didn't take long for him to get \ninvolved in his new community because one month after his arrival, Don \nwas elected Stevens County Attorney and went on to serve the county for \nfour years in that role.\n  That same year, Don married Patricia June Davis and spent the next 49 \nyears by her side before her passing in 2001. Don later re-married his \nwife of the past ten years, Sharon Collins.\n  As a young man, Don became interested in politics and at the age of \n32, Don was elected Chairman of the Kansas Young Republican Federation. \nThe following year, Don served as Chairman of the Kansas Presidential \nElectors for the presidential election between John F. Kennedy and \nRichard Nixon. Then, from 1968-1970, Don served as the Chair of the \nKansas Republican Party. His zeal for politics never faded and kept him \ninvolved for many\n\n[[Page S2840]]\n\nyears--chairing committees in support of his favorite candidates. He \neven put his name on the ballot one year for Governor but fell short by \njust 530 votes in the primary.\n  As a long-time Kansas resident, Don was well known and respected by \nmany throughout our state, but especially in Southwest Kansas.\n  Don was a strong advocate for rural Kansas and the special way of \nlife we enjoy in small communities across our great State. Through his \nservice on several committees focused on the future of rural Kansas, \nDon helped make certain the next generation can return to the towns and \ncommunities they call home.\n  From his participation in Kansas politics to his public service \ncareer, Don was always looking for ways to serve his fellow Kansans and \nimprove their lives. In recognition of that service, Don was awarded a \nlifetime achievement award by Washburn Law School in 2010.\n  His family and friends described him as someone whose generosity, \nenthusiasm, and overall optimism towards life touched the lives of so \nmany. It has been said that Don had the character of ``one in a \nmillion,'' and that he did not ``just participate in life, but made \nlife happen.'' Don had the unique ability to connect with just about \nanyone, but he was especially revered by his family and friends who \nlooked up to him in many ways. Don lived each day to its fullest and \nhis commitment to his fellow man serves as an inspiration to us all.\n  I extend my heartfelt sympathies to his wife, Sharon, his son, Craig, \nhis daughter, Debra, and his many grandchildren.

Mr. President, last week Congress recognized one of the \nplanet's leading visionaries and humanitarians by awarding Prof. \nMuhammad Yunus the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  The ceremony occurred just a few hundred yards from here in the \naugust Capitol Rotunda. There to pay tribute to this proud son of \nBangladesh, this banker to the poor, this Nobel laureate were Members \nof Congress, former heads of state, diplomats, heads of major companies \nand foundations, and grassroots activists--all of whom have been \ninspired by the work of one great man--Prof. Muhammad Yunus. It was a \ngreat privilege for me to be there.\n  More than 6 years ago I introduced a resolution in the Senate to \naward Professor Yunus the Congressional Gold Medal. I was joined in \nthis effort by my friends, former Utah Senator Robert Bennett and \nRepresentative Rush Holt in the House.\n  We had a lot of help outside of Congress in making this happen. \nJoanne Carter and her team at RESULTS were instrumental. Thousands of \nRESULTS grassroots volunteers across the country contacted their \nMembers of Congress and asked them to support the effort to recognize \nProfessor Yunus. Two of those volunteers were Cindy Levin and Richard \nSmiley from Illinois. I am pleased that both could be here to see their \nhard work pay off.\n  I first met Muhammad Yunus more than two decades ago in Bangladesh. \nHis revolutionary concept of microcredit and the Grameen Bank that he \nfounded was helping to lift millions out of poverty. He loaned small \namounts of money traditional banks wouldn't bother with to individuals \ntraditional banks wouldn't bother with.\n  His innovative idea defied old beliefs. He proved banking could be \ndone without collateral and that investing in women worked. Most of \nGrameen Bank's loans go to poor women who go from beggars to \nentrepreneurs.\n  I have seen it myself. Several years ago, in a ramshackle hut in \nUganda, I met with three mothers who worked in the local market. I \nasked them, through an interpreter, how microcredit had changed their \nlives. One woman said: ``My knees have gone soft.'' I didn't understand \nwhat she meant so I asked her to explain. She said that before she \nreceived the microcredit loan that gave her a chance to go to market \nand make a little money, she used to have to crawl on her knees and beg \nher husband for money to feed her children. But she doesn't have to \ncrawl anymore. Her knees have gone soft.\n  Over the last nearly 40 years, more than 160 million people on five \ncontinents have received microloans. His idea changed the world.\n  The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest civilian honor Congress \ncan bestow and the practice dates back to the Continental Congress. \nUnlike other awards, each Congressional Gold Medal is unique to the \nrecipient. It is specifically designed and sculpted according to the \nwishes of the recipient. I couldn't be more thrilled with how this \ntribute to Professor Yunus turned out. It is truly beautiful.\n  The obverse of the medal was designed by Indiana artist Donna Weaver \nand sculpted by Phebe Hemphill. The portrait of Professor Yunus is \nmeant to ``accurately reflect his optimistic and cheerful \npersonality.'' He is depicted wearing the traditional Bengali jamdani \nfabric design.\n  On the reverse, a ``lotus open in full bloom, rising above the water \nand cradling the world in its open petals'' evokes powerful symbolism. \nIt was designed by Wisconsin artist Richard Masters and sculpted by Jim \nLicaretz. The Bangla inscription in the center is a quote taken from \nProfessor Yunus' Nobel speech and reads, ``Let us send poverty to the \nmuseum.''\n  Beyond the typical pomp and circumstance of these ceremonies, last \nweek's event truly made history. Professor Yunus becomes the first \nMuslim to win the Congressional Gold Medal. Additionally, he becomes \nonly the seventh person in history to receive the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom and the Congressional Gold Medal and the Nobel Peace Prize. In \ndoing so, he joins truly exceptional company. Consider the six others \nwith whom he now shares this honor: Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, \nJr., Norman Borlaug, Elie Wiesel, Mother Teresa, and Aung San Suu Kyi. \nTo most of us these individuals are giants of history; to Professor \nYunus they are peers in the struggle to advance human dignity.\n  Many probably thought Professor Yunus would be a contender for the \nNobel Prize in Economics, but in awarding him the Peace Prize, the \nNobel Committee recognized that lasting peace and prosperity can only \ncome when the poor can escape the prison of poverty. As I noted at last \nweek's ceremony, this simple but important lesson from a Bangladeshi \nprofessor should not be lost here in Congress.\n  In addition to those I have already mentioned who contributed to this \nendeavor, there are many more who deserve a great deal of thanks. I \nwould like to thank a few of them.\n  First of all, Professor Yunus' assistant and the director of the \nYunus Centre, Lamiya Morshed. She has worked tirelessly throughout this \nprocess--helping in the medal design and development and successfully \ntaking on the daunting task of planning and coordinating a complex \nseries of ceremonies, receptions, and meetings for Professor Yunus.\n  The dedicated and professional staff of the U.S. Mint deserve great \npraise for their work to design and produce the medal. Throughout the \nprocess one person has held this project especially close to her heart. \nLeslie Schwager, program specialist for the Yunus Gold Medal, worked \ntirelessly with my staff, Lamiya, and within the Mint to keep the \nprocess on track.\n  I would finally like to thank Speaker Boehner and his staff, as well \nas the staff of the Senate Sergeant at Arms, for their cooperation and \nleadership on the ceremony.\n  At last, Prof. Muhammad Yunus, my friend, has received from Congress \nan honor he has deserved for so long. I congratulate him and his \nfamily. I thank the country of Bangladesh for sharing this beloved \nnational hero with the world.\n\n[[Page S2841]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/22/senate-section/article/S2841-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE CALENDAR OBJECTION\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \ndistinguished career of Ann Lordeman, who is retiring after 22 years of \nservice at the Congressional Research Service, CRS. In her time at CRS, \nAnn has been lead analyst on employment and training programs, national \nand community service programs, and programs serving students with \ndisabilities such as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \nIDEA. Her work has contributed in important ways to numerous Federal \npolicies in these areas and benefited many American families, workers, \nand schoolchildren.\n  Ann was deeply involved in deliberations leading to the passage of \nthe Workforce Investment Act, WIA, of 1998 and in deliberations leading \nto the reauthorization of the National and Community Service Act, NCSA, \nof 1990 and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act, DVSA, of 1973. In \nrecent years, she has focused heavily on issues related to the \nfinancing, implementation, and administration of IDEA. In all of these \npolicy areas, Ann has provided technical expertise and critical \nlegislative support to congressional committees, Members, and their \nstaffs.\n  Throughout her career Ann has embraced standards of \nauthoritativeness, objectivity, and confidentiality, which are \nessential to the success of CRS analysts. She is a trusted resource who \nhas supported the development and refinement of legislative proposals \nthrough data analysis, strong understanding of the policy areas she \nworks in, and the anticipation of potential consequences associated \nwith policy options. Ann has also always exhibited a strong service-\norientation; while working on national issues, Ann is never too busy to \nsupport congressional offices trying to resolve problems for families \nseeking appropriate educational services and accommodations for their \nchildren or to identify resources available for communities to help \ndislocated workers. She has helped the citizens of West Virginia in \nthis manner with great regularity over her years of service.\n  Within CRS, Ann is renowned for her generosity and strong inclination \nto mentor and support the growth of new analysts and to work \ncollaboratively with colleagues for the benefit of her congressional \nclients. Her many career achievements warrant recognition, and it is my \ngreat pleasure to commend her on her 22 years of outstanding public \nservice at CRS.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/22/senate-section/article/S2841-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DEAN E. GALLES\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Dean E. \nGalles, a decorated US Army combat veteran of World War II. Dean, on \nbehalf of all Montanans and all Americans, I stand to say ``thank you'' \nfor your service to this Nation.\n  It is my honor to share the remarkable story of Dean's service in \nWorld War II.\n  Dean was born November 9, 1919 in Broadview, MT, a small prairie town \non a rail spur.\n  As a boy, Dean's family moved to Billings where his father continued \nin business. Dean looked up to his father as a role model throughout \nhis life. In 1937, Dean graduated from high school in Billings and \nenrolled at the University of Montana, where he also participated in \nthe Army Reserve Officer's Training Corps. Dean graduated in the spring \nof 1941 and became a commissioned officer in the 7th Infantry Division, \nU.S. Army.\n  Lieutenant Galles sailed with his division to attack Japanese forces \noccupying Attu and Kiska Islands in the Aleutian chain, the westernmost \ngroup of Alaskan islands. Upon landing, the American forces were left \nwith the daunting task of removing Japanese troops firmly entrenched on \nhigh ground.\n  At dawn on May 29, 1943, the Japanese commander ordered a desperate, \nall-out assault on the American forces, which is believed to be the \nlargest banzai charge in World War II's Pacific theater of operation. \nIn spite of the extreme cold weather and high casualties, American \nforces prevailed. Sometime during the battle, Dean was bayoneted twice \nand left for dead. In spite of his wounds, Lieutenant Galles struggled \ntwo miles to alert other Americans.\n  On April 7, 1945, then-Captain Galles led an American assault on a \nJapanese force entrenched on the island of Okinawa. With complete \ndisregard for personal hazards, he moved across open, fire-swept \nterrain and directed the successful attack. During the confrontation, \nCaptain Galles was wounded a third time and received the Silver Star \nmedal for heroism. Dean is still impacted today due to the Japanese \nbullet in his chest from wounds received on Okinawa.\n  Following the third injury, Dean returned to Billings where his wife \nlived, and he began a successful business. After retirement, Dean has \nbeen active in veterans' and civic organizations, where he continues to \nbe a source of inspiration, courage, and patriotism. A fellow veteran \nrecently asked Dean what would he say to Americans yet unborn? In a now \nfrail, but resolute, voice, Mr. Galles replied, ``America is worth \nfighting for; I hope they keep on fighting.''\n  Seventy years would pass before the Army would award Dean the Bronze \nStar medal for Valor for his actions on Attu Island.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of a grateful Nation, I commend Mr. Galles \nand his service to America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/22/senate-section/article/S2841-4", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/22/senate-section/article/S2841-5", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting three \ntreaties which were referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/22/senate-section/article/S2841-6", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 624.

Legislation should be enacted that adopts the \n     following:\n       (1) Enrolls seniors in the same health care plan as Federal \n     employees and Members of Congress, similar to the Federal \n     Employee Health Benefits Plan (FEHBP).\n       (2) Beginning on January 1, 2015, the Director of the \n     Office of Personnel Management shall ensure seniors currently \n     enrolled or eligible for Medicare will have access to \n     Congressional Health Care for Seniors Act.\n       (3) Prevents the Office of Personnel Management from \n     placing onerous new mandates on health insurance plans, but \n     allows the agency to continue to enforce reasonable minimal \n     stands for plans, ensure the plans are fiscally solvent, and \n     enforces rules for consumer protections.\n       (4) The legislation must create a new ``high-risk pool'' \n     for the highest cost patients, providing a direct \n     reimbursement to health care plans that enroll the costliest \n     5 percent of patients.\n       (5) Ensures that every senior can afford the high-quality \n     insurance offered by FEHBP, providing support for 75 percent \n     of the total costs, providing additional premium assistance \n     to those who cannot afford the remaining share.\n       (6) The legislation must increase the age of eligibility \n     gradually over 20 years, increasing the age from 65 to 70, \n     resulting in a 3 month increase per year.\n       (7) High-income seniors will be provided less premium \n     support than low-income seniors.\n\n     SEC. 503. POLICY STATEMENT ON TAX REFORM.\n\n       It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that \n     Congress and the relevant committees of jurisdiction enact \n     legislation to ensure a tax reform that broadens the tax \n     base, reduces tax complexity, includes a consumption-based \n     income tax, and a globally competitive flat tax.\n       (1) Taxes on individuals.--This concurrent resolution shall \n     eliminate all tax brackets and have one standard flat tax \n     rate on adjusted gross income. The individual tax code shall \n     remove all credits and deductions, with exception to the \n     mortgage interest deduction, offsetting these with a \n     substantially higher standard deduction and personal \n     exemption. The standard deduction for joint filers should be \n     equal to or greater than $35,000, $21,690 for head of \n     household, and $17,500 for single filers. The personal \n     exemption amount is $6,800. This proposal eliminates the \n     individual alternative minimum tax (AMT). The tax reform \n     would repeal all tax on savings and investments, including \n     capital gains, qualified and ordinary dividends, estate, \n     gift, and interest saving taxes.\n       (2) Taxes on businesses.--This concurrent resolution shall \n     eliminate all tax brackets and have one standard flat tax on \n     adjusted gross income. The business tax code shall remove all \n     credits and deductions, offsetting these with a lower tax \n     rate and immediate expensing of all business inputs. Such \n     inputs shall be determined by total revenue from the sale of \n     goods and services less purchases of inputs from other firms \n     less wages, salaries, and pensions paid to workers less \n     purchases of plant and equipment.\n       (3) Single system.--The individuals and businesses would be \n     subject to taxation on only those incomes that are produced \n     or derived, as a territorial system in the United States. The \n     aggregate taxes paid should provide the ability to fill out a \n     tax return no larger than a postcard.\n\n                      TITLE VI--SENSE OF CONGRESS\n\n     SEC. 601. REGULATORY REFORM.\n\n       It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that \n     Congress and the relevant committees of jurisdiction enact \n     legislation to ensure a regulatory reform.\n       (1) Apply regulatory analysis requirements to independent \n     agencies.--It shall be the policy of Congress to pass into \n     law a requirement for independent agencies to abide by the \n     same regulatory analysis requirement as those required by \n     executive branch agencies.\n       (2) Adopt the regulations from the executive in need of \n     scrutiny act (reins).--It shall be the policy of Congress to \n     vote on the REINS Act, legislation that would require all \n     regulations that impose a burden greater than $100,000,000 in \n     economic aggregate may not be implemented as law unless \n     Congress gives [their/its] consent by voting on the rule.\n       (3) Sunset all regulations.--It is the policy of Congress \n     that regulations imposed by the Federal Government shall \n     automatically sunset every two years unless repromulgated by \n     Congress.\n       (4) Process reform.--It shall be the policy of Congress to \n     implement regulatory process reform by instituting \n     statutorily required regulatory impact analysis for all \n     agencies, require the publication of regulatory impact \n     analysis before the regulation is finalized, and ensure that \n     not only are regulatory impact analysis conducted, but \n     applied to the issued regulation or rulemaking.\n       (5) Incorporation of formal rulemaking for major rules.--It \n     shall be the policy of Congress to apply formal rulemaking \n     procedures to all major regulations or those regulations that \n     exceed $100,000,000 in aggregate economic costs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/22/senate-section/article/S2852-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2852-S2853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n          COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 42, S. Res. 90.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 90) standing with the people of Kenya \n     following their national and local elections on March 4, \n     2013, and urging a peaceful and credible resolution of \n     electoral disputes in the courts.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign \nRelations with an amendment and an amendment to the preamble and an \namendment to the title.\n  (Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the part printed in \nitalic.)\n  (Strike the preamble and insert the part printed in italic.)\n\n                               S. Res. 90\n\n       Whereas the Governments of the United States and Kenya have \n     long shared a strong bilateral partnership, and Kenya plays a \n     critically important role as a cornerstone of stability in \n     East Africa and as a valued ally of the United States;\n       Whereas Kenya's disputed 2007 presidential election \n     threatened the country's stability and its democratic \n     trajectory, triggering an explosion of violence that resulted \n     in the deaths of some 1,140 civilians and displaced nearly \n     600,000, some of whom have still not returned home;\n       Whereas a mediation effort by former United Nations \n     Secretary-General Kofi Annan and an African Union Panel of \n     Eminent African Personalities, supported by the United \n     States, led to the signing of the National Accord on February \n     28, 2008, which led to a series of constitutional, electoral, \n     and institutional reforms to address underlying causes of the \n     crisis;\n       Whereas, as part of that reform process, the citizens of \n     Kenya participated in a national referendum in August 2010, \n     approving a new constitution that mandated significant \n     institutional and structural changes to the government;\n       Whereas those constitutional changes have led to important \n     reforms in the judicial sector and the electoral system in \n     Kenya that aim to build greater public confidence in \n     government institutions, and which demonstrate meaningful \n     progress;\n       Whereas Kenya's Independent Commission of Inquiry into the \n     Post-Election Violence (the ``Waki Commission'') concluded \n     from its investigation in 2008 that there had been ``no \n     serious effort by any government'' to punish perpetrators of \n     previous incidents of ethnic and political violence, leading \n     to a culture of impunity that contributed to the crisis that \n     followed the 2007 elections, and, since then, despite \n     laudable judicial reforms, few perpetrators or organizers of \n     that violence have been held accountable for their crimes in \n     Kenyan courts;\n       Whereas, based on the findings of the Waki Commission, \n     mediator Kofi Annan submitted a list of key suspects to the \n     Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court \n     (ICC) in 2009, and several have been subsequently charged at \n     the ICC with crimes against humanity;\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2011 Human Rights Report \n     on Kenya notes, ``Widespread impunity at all levels of \n     government continued to be a serious problem. The government \n     took only limited action against security forces suspected of \n     unlawful killings, and impunity in cases of corruption was \n     common. Although the government took action in some cases to \n     prosecute officials who committed abuses, impunity . . . was \n     pervasive'';\n       Whereas President Barack Obama's Strategy on Sub-Saharan \n     Africa, released in June 2012, states that the United States \n     will not stand by while actors ``. . . manipulate the \n     fairness and integrity of democratic processes, and we will \n     stand in steady partnership with those who are committed to \n     the principles of equality, justice and the rule of law'';\n       Whereas, in a February 2013 message to the people of Kenya, \n     President Obama highlighted the power Kenyan communities have \n     to reject intimidation and violence surrounding the upcoming \n     election, resolve disputes in the courts as opposed to the \n     streets, and ``move forward towards prosperity and \n     opportunity that unleashes the extraordinary talents of your \n     people'';\n       Whereas, five years after Kenya's post-election crisis, the \n     country held its first general elections under the new \n     constitution on March 4, 2013, which were largely peaceful;\n       Whereas Kenya's presidential candidates and their political \n     parties committed themselves to a peaceful electoral process, \n     and to resolving any resulting disputes through the judicial \n     process;\n       Whereas the Kenyan Supreme Court ruled on March 30, 2013, \n     that Uhuru Kenyatta was validly elected, and his opponents \n     pledged to respect and honor the decision of the Court;\n       Whereas the White House issued a statement on March 30, \n     2013, stating, ``The electoral process and the peaceful \n     adjudication of disputes in the Kenyan legal system are \n     testaments to the progress Kenya has made in strengthening \n     its democratic institutions, and the desire of the Kenyan \n     people to move their country forward. Now is the time for \n     Kenyans to come together to fully implement the political, \n     institutional, and accountability reforms envisioned in the \n     Kenyan constitution. . ..We welcome and wish to underscore \n     the importance of Kenya's commitment to uphold its \n     international obligations, including those with respect to \n     international justice.''; and\n       Whereas in his inauguration speech on April 9, 2013, \n     President Kenyatta said, ``I will lead all Kenyans - those \n     who voted for me - and those who voted for our competitors - \n     towards a national prosperity that is firmly rooted in a rich \n     and abiding peace in which unity can ultimately be realized. \n     . .Indeed, national unity will only be possible if we deal \n     decisively with some of the issues that continue to hinder \n     our progress. Achieving peace and strengthening unity will be \n     the goal of my Government. This work begins now. We welcome \n     all Kenyans to hold us to account.'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n       That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the people of Kenya on their commitment \n     to peaceful elections, as demonstrated on March 4, 2013;\n       (2) calls on Kenyans to come together to fully implement \n     political, institutional, and accountability reforms \n     envisioned in the Kenyan constitution;\n       (3) calls on the people of Kenya to continue their efforts \n     to end intimidation, impunity, and violence;\n       (4) notes that many of the underlying grievances that have \n     underpinned ethnic divisions and fueled the 2007-2008 \n     violence remain largely unaddressed;\n       (5) affirms that accountability for the 2007-2008 post-\n     election violence is a critical element to ensure Kenya's \n     democracy, peace, and long-term stability;\n       (6) calls on the Government of Kenya to respect commitments \n     to seek justice for the victims of political violence, \n     including by honoring its obligations under the Rome Statute \n     to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Court with \n     regard to the three cases that remain before the Court slated \n     to go to trial in 2013;\n       (7) calls on the Government of Kenya to ensure the \n     International Criminal Court witnesses are fully protected \n     and not subject to interference but afforded the protections \n     they deserve to ensure justice is served;\n       (8) recognizes that, while the Government of Kenya has made \n     important progress since the 2007 election, aspects of the \n     Kenyan reform agenda specified in the National Accord and \n     2010 constitution remain unfinished, particularly with regard \n     to police reform, devolution, land reform, and security;\n       (9) encourages the people and Government of Kenya to \n     support ongoing implementation of constitutional reforms, \n     rule of law, the establishment of county level government and \n     efforts to strengthen governance, security, and judicial \n     institutions that respect the dignity and rights of all the \n     people of Kenya and ensure protection for judges;\n\n[[Page S2854]]\n\n       (10) supports the devolution process in order to enable \n     constitutional reform to be fully implemented;\n       (11) encourages the Government of Kenya to respect and \n     protect the freedom of civil society organizations and \n     activists which have historically led the process of \n     political reform in Kenya;\n       (12) expresses hope that newly elected members of \n     government will herald a new generation of responsible \n     leadership in Kenya; and\n       (13) reaffirms that the people of the United States will \n     continue to stand with the people of Kenya in support of \n     democracy, partnership, and peace.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I further ask that the committee-reported \namendment to the resolution be agreed to; the resolution, as amended, \nbe agreed to; the committee-reported amendment to the preamble be \nagreed to; the preamble, as amended, be agreed to; the committee-\nreported title amendment be agreed to; and the motions to reconsider be \nmade and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee-reported amendment to the resolution was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 90), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The committee-reported amendment to the preamble was agreed to.\n  The preamble, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The resolution, as amended, with its preamble, as amended, reads as \nfollows:\n\n                               S.

We welcome \n     all Kenyans to hold us to account.'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the people of Kenya on their commitment \n     to peaceful elections, as demonstrated on March 4, 2013;\n       (2) calls on Kenyans to come together to fully implement \n     political, institutional, and accountability reforms \n     envisioned in the Kenyan constitution;\n       (3) calls on the people of Kenya to continue their efforts \n     to end intimidation, impunity, and violence;\n       (4) notes that many of the underlying grievances that have \n     underpinned ethnic divisions and fueled the 2007-2008 \n     violence remain largely unaddressed;\n       (5) affirms that accountability for the 2007-2008 post-\n     election violence is a critical element to ensure Kenya's \n     democracy, peace, and long-term stability;\n       (6) calls on the Government of Kenya to respect commitments \n     to seek justice for the victims of political violence, \n     including by honoring its obligations under the Rome Statute \n     to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Court with \n     regard to the three cases that remain before the Court slated \n     to go to trial in 2013;\n       (7) calls on the Government of Kenya to ensure the \n     International Criminal Court witnesses are fully protected \n     and not subject to interference but afforded the protections \n     they deserve to ensure justice is served;\n       (8) recognizes that, while the Government of Kenya has made \n     important progress since the 2007 election, aspects of the \n     Kenyan reform agenda specified in the National Accord and \n     2010 constitution remain unfinished, particularly with regard \n     to police reform, devolution, land reform, and security;\n       (9) encourages the people and Government of Kenya to \n     support ongoing implementation of constitutional reforms, \n     rule of law, the establishment of county level government and \n     efforts to strengthen governance, security, and judicial \n     institutions that respect the dignity and rights of all the \n     people of Kenya and ensure protection for judges;\n       (10) supports the devolution process in order to enable \n     constitutional reform to be fully implemented;\n       (11) encourages the Government of Kenya to respect and \n     protect the freedom of civil society organizations and \n     activists which have historically led the process of \n     political reform in Kenya;\n       (12) expresses hope that newly elected members of \n     government will herald a new generation of responsible \n     leadership in Kenya; and\n       (13) reaffirms that the people of the United States will \n     continue to stand with the people of Kenya in support of \n     democracy, partnership, and peace.\nAttest:\n  The committee-reported title amendment was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``A resolution \n     congratulating the people of Kenya on their commitment to \n     peaceful elections, as demonstrated on March 4, 2013, and \n     calling on Kenyans to come together to continue to implement \n     political, institutional, and accountability reforms \n     envisioned in the Kenyan constitution.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/22/senate-section/article/S2854-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2854-S2855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DISCHARGE AND REFERRAL--S. 437\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Injunction of Secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaties transmitted to the Senate on April 22, 2013, by the President \nof the United States:\n  Convention on the Conservation and Management of High Seas Fishery \nResources in the South Pacific Ocean, Treaty Document No. 113-1; \nConvention on the Conservation and Management of High Seas Fisheries \nResources in the North Pacific Ocean, Treaty Document No. 113-2; and \namendment to the Convention of Future Multilateral Cooperation in the \nNorthwest Atlantic Fisheries, Treaty Document No. 113-3.\n  I further ask that the treaties be considered as having been read the \nfirst time, they be referred with the accompanying papers to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed, and that the \nPresident's messages be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The messages of the President are as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith the Convention on the Conservation and Management \nof High Seas Fishery Resources in the South Pacific Ocean (the \n``Convention''), done at Auckland, New Zealand, November 14, 2009, with \na view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification. I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the \nreport of the Secretary of State on the Convention that includes an \narticle-by-article analysis.\n  The Convention establishes a regional fisheries management \norganization through which Parties will give effect to their duty to \ncooperate in the conservation and sustainable use of the high seas \nfishery resources in the South Pacific Ocean and to safeguard the \nmarine ecosystems in which these resources occur.\n  The Convention requires Parties to apply specific conservation and \nmanagement principles and approaches in giving effect to the objective \nof the Convention. These principles and approaches are enshrined in \nexisting international instruments to which the United States is a \nparty, such as the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions \nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of December 10, \n1982, relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish \nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks of December 4, 1995. In \naddition, the Convention requires that Parties design and adopt \nspecific conservation and management measures, such as limitations on \ncatch or effort, time or area closures, and gear restrictions.\n  The Department of State, Department of Commerce, U.S. Coast Guard, \nand relevant U.S. stakeholders strongly support the Convention. The \nlegislation necessary to implement the Convention will be submitted \nseparately to the Congress for its consideration. I therefore recommend \nthat the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this \nConvention and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, April 22, 2013.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Convention on the Conservation \nand Management of High Seas Fisheries Resources in the North Pacific \nOcean, done at Tokyo on February 24, 2012, and signed by the United \nStates on May 2, 2012 (the ``Convention''). I also transmit, for the \ninformation of the Senate, the report of the Secretary of State on the \nConvention that includes an article-by-article analysis.\n  The Convention establishes a regional fisheries management \norganization through which Parties will cooperate to ensure the long-\nterm conservation and sustainable use of the fisheries resources in the \nhigh seas of the North Pacific Ocean while protecting the marine \necosystems in which these resources occur.\n  The Convention will require implementing legislation, which is being \ndrafted and will be submitted separately to the Congress for its \nconsideration.\n  Cooperation under the Convention will address fisheries resources not \ncovered under preexisting international fisheries management \ninstruments and will help to prevent destructive fishing practices on \nthe high seas that may have impacts on fisheries resources in areas \nsubject to U.S. jurisdiction. Ratification by the United States would \nalso ensure that future U.S. fisheries interests in the region subject \nto the Convention will be factored into allocation decisions. I \ntherefore recommend that the Senate give favorable consideration to the \nConvention and give its advice and consent to ratification at the \nearliest possible date.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, April 22, 2013.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Amendment to the Convention on \nFuture Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries \n(the ``Convention''), adopted on September 28, 2007, at the twenty-\nninth Annual Meeting of the North Atlantic Fisheries Organization \n(NAFO). I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report \nof the Secretary of State on the Amendment, which includes an article-\nby-article analysis.\n  The Amendment serves to bring the Convention in line with modern \ninternational fisheries governance, including revisions to its \ndecisionmaking and objection rules and a new comprehensive dispute \nsettlement procedure. The Amendment also reflects changes to the budget \ncontribution scheme that are expected to significantly reduce U.S. \nannual payments to NAFO. Involved Federal agencies and stakeholders \nstrongly support the proposed changes to the Convention. The \nstrengthened Convention will improve the way NAFO manages the fish \nstocks under its purview and enforces compliance with the measures it \nadopts, which in turn will improve the chances that key stocks in the \nNorthwest Atlantic will recover enough to support resumed fishing.\n  The recommended changes to the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries \nConvention Act of 1995 necessary to implement the Amendment will be \nsubmitted separately to the Congress. I therefore recommend that the \nSenate give favorable consideration to the Amendment to the Convention \nand give its advice and consent to ratification at the earliest \npossible date.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, April 22, 2013.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/22/senate-section/article/S2855-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, APRIL 23, 2013\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.
