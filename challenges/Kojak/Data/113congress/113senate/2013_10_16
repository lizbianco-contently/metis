Mr. President, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 211.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 211, S. 1569, a bill to \n     ensure the complete and timely payment of the obligations of \n     the United States Government until December 31, 2014.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Following the remarks of the Republican leader and me the \nSenate will be in a period of morning business where Senators will be \nallowed to speak for up to 10 minutes each--or at least be in a \nsituation where people can speak up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. President, I am going to wait until Senator McConnell gets to the \nfloor, so I will not give any long remarks here. In fact, I won't give \nany long remarks at any time, but I do have a few things to say.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Senate Chaplain\n\n  While we are waiting for Senator McConnell, I want to take this \nopportunity to say this. Admiral Black has, for me, during this long \nperiod of crisis we have had in the country, been a voice of stability \nand a voice of inspiration. I am being very selfish in saying me, \nbecause it has been so for the entire Senate and for the country. His \nheartfelt prayers are so timely and so sensitive to the needs of our \ncountry and the need we all have to call upon our spirituality to get \nus through periods of difficulty.\n  I can speak for the entire Senate when I say how much we admire and \nrespect this good man, who is a counselor and as much a leader in the \nSenate as anyone who serves in this body.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the eyes of the world have been on \nWashington all this week--and that is a gross understatement--and while \nthey witnessed a great deal of political discord, today they will also \nsee Congress reach a historic bipartisan agreement and avoid a default \non the Nation's bills.\n  The compromise we reached will provide our economy with the stability \nit desperately needs. It is never easy for two sides to reach \nconsensus. Sometimes it is harder than others. This time it was really \nhard. After weeks spent facing off across a partisan divide that often \nseemed too wide to cross, our country came to the brink of disaster. \nBut in the end, political adversaries set aside their differences and \ndisagreements to prevent that disaster.\n  I thank the Republican leader for his diligent efforts to reach this \nimportant agreement. The Republican leader's cooperation was essential \nto reach an accord to pass both Chambers of Congress and also be signed \nby President Obama.\n  As part of our agreement, in order to ensure Congress continues the \nwork of setting this country on a path of fiscal sustainability, this \nlegislation instructs leaders to name conferees to a budget conference \ncommittee that will set our country on a long-term path to fiscal \nsustainability. I know some say that is going to be hard. What we do is \nhard here, and this is really hard, but I think we can get it done. The \ncommittee members selected must have open minds, be willing to exert \nevery option no matter how painful to their own political ideas and \neven their own political parties. This conference committee, led by \nChairman Murray and Chairman Ryan--which will produce its negotiated \nbudget resolution in December--is the appropriate place to discuss our \ndifferent views and the best way to chart a course for economic growth.\n  This legislation also funds the government through January 15 and \naverts default through February 7, during which time we can work toward \na long-term budget agreement that prevents these frequent crises. \nPerhaps most importantly, this legislation ends a\n\n[[Page S7504]]\n\nstandoff that ground the work of Washington to a halt this fall.\n  This is not a time for pointing fingers or blame. This is a time of \nreconciliation. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both \nsides of this great Capitol to pass this remarkable agreement which \nwill protect the long-term health of our economy, avert a default on \nour Nation's debt, and allow us to set a foundation for economic \nexpansion.\n  What we have done is sent a message to Americans from every one of \nour 50 States, but in addition to that, the citizens of every country \nand the world, that the United States lives up to its obligations. Now \nCongress must return to its most important job--fostering economic \ngrowth and protecting middle-class families.\n  I appreciate through all of this the steady hand of President Obama \nto help guide us to this conclusion. I am optimistic that the spirit of \ncompromise which has taken root in the Senate over the last 2 days will \nendure.\n  I do know this: Senator McConnell and I have sat in very serious \ndiscussions the last few days, and we are going to do everything we can \nto change the atmosphere in the Senate and accomplish what needs to be \ndone for our country.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                          Shutdown Resolution\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, this has been a long, challenging few \nweeks for Congress and for the country. It is my hope that today we can \nput some of those most urgent issues behind us.\n  After yesterday's events the majority leader and I began a series of \nconversations about a way to get the government reopened and to prevent \ndefault. I am confident we will be able to do both of those things \nlater today.\n  Crucially, I am also confident we will be able to announce that we \nare protecting the government's spending reductions that both parties \nagreed to under the Budget Control Act and that the President signed \ninto law. That has been a top priority for me and for my colleagues on \nthe Republican side of the aisle throughout this debate, and it has \nbeen worth the effort. Some have suggested that we break that promise \nas part of this agreement. Some have said that Washington needs to \nspend more, that we need to raise taxes, that we need to just tax our \nway to prosperity and balance. But what the BCA showed is that \nWashington actually can cut spending, and because of this law, that is \njust what we have done. For the first time since the Korean war--for \nthe first time in 50 years--government spending has declined for 2 \nyears in a row. And we are not going back on this agreement.\n  There is a lot more we need to do to get our Nation's fiscal house in \norder. Hopefully, once we have gotten past the drama of the moment, we \ncan get to work on it. But for now, let's not understate the importance \nof the Budget Control Act or the importance of the fight to preserve \nit. This legislation is the largest spending reduction bill of the last \nquarter century and the largest deficit reduction bill since 1981 that \ndidn't include a tax hike. Preserving this law is critically important \nto the future of our country.\n  Throughout this debate, the public has rightly focused on ObamaCare--\nfor good reason. This law is ravaging our economy, killing jobs, \ndriving up premiums, and driving people off the health care plans they \nhave and like in droves. Its disastrous rollout is a sign of even worse \nthings to come. The refusal to delay it reflects the kind of stubborn, \nideological obsession that will do untold damage to our country, and \nRepublicans remain determined to repeal this terrible law. But for \ntoday, the relief we hope for is to reopen the government, avoid \ndefault, and protect the historic cuts we achieved under the Budget \nControl Act. This is far less than many of us had hoped for, frankly, \nbut it is far better than what some had sought. Now it is time for \nRepublicans to unite behind other crucial goals.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, leadership time is \nreserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, Senators are \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I had not intended to speak right now. I \nknow the leaders are working on trying to get the process clear so we \ncan move this legislation forward. But I would like to mention a few of \nmy colleagues who really helped in this process.\n  We had a number of Democrats and Republicans who met together and \ntalked to try to come to a resolution on a package we wanted to present \nto the leaders. In fact, the structure of what the two leaders have \nagreed on is very similar to what we had proposed to them.\n  I see some of my colleagues here today who were instrumental. I see \nthe Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski, and I know Senator Ayotte is \nhere, as well as Senator Flake, who happens to be in the Chamber right \nnow, and Senator Kirk, Senator Johanns, Senator McCain, and, of course, \nSenator Collins. Senator Collins really led and spearheaded the effort, \nand she deserves a lot of credit for getting us together and helping to \nmove the ball down the field.\n  I hadn't planned on controlling the floor right now or even talking \nabout this very much, but since we have the opportunity--I know on our \nside of the aisle Senators Manchin, Klobuchar, King, Donnelly, \nHeitkamp, and Shaheen all played a critical role. Again, this had not \nbeen planned by anyone; it just looks as though we have a little bit of \ntime.\n  If it is agreeable, I would like to yield to one of my colleagues to \nsay a word about the agreement we reached or that we were working on to \ntry to present to the leaders and just really say thank you to Senator \nCollins and thank you for all 14 of us. It turns out we had seven \nRepublicans, six Democrats, and one Independent. Basically what we \ntried to do is come up with a sensible framework the leaders could use \nto get us to where we are today. Again, they didn't accept every single \nthing we wanted, but the framework was good, and certainly it was great \nto see everyone work together.\n  Before I turn it over to the Senator from Arizona, I wish to thank \nhim because he was great and very instrumental in moving this ball down \nthe court.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I think it is obvious we are seeing the \nend of this agonizing odyssey this body has been put through but, far \nmore importantly, the American people have been put through. It is one \nof the more shameful chapters I have seen in the years I have spent \nhere in the Senate.\n  But I wish to say that if there is a good outcome, it is the fact \nthat 14 of us were able to join together--Republican and Democrat. \nLeadership, I must fully admit, was provided primarily by women in the \nSenate. I won't comment further on that.\n  Seriously, 14 of us got together and came up with a plan after very \nspirited discussion. I think that plan was probably better than the one \nwe are going to act on today. But the fact is that this group of 14 \npeople is committed to staying together to address other issues of \nimportance and to tell the American people that there are at least 14 \nof us--and there are many others who wanted to join that group and who \nare welcomed to join that group--we are not going to let this kind of \npartisanship cripple this body and injure the American people.\n  I am proud to have worked with Members from both sides of the aisle. \nThis isn't the last crisis we are going to go through, but I think we \nhave the framework for the kind of bipartisanship the American people \nneed and want. So I thank them. I look forward to working with them in \nthe future. I also enjoyed the spirited discussions we had.\n  I wish to thank especially my friend from Maine, who enriched me with \na small side wager we made during the course of this discussion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arizona--he \nbrought a very experienced voice to our group--and especially I thank \nSenator Collins for bringing this group together. I think it shows what \ncourage\n\n[[Page S7505]]\n\nis going to be in the next year in this Chamber and in the Congress. It \nis not going to be just standing here by yourself making a speech with \nno one there. Courage is going to be whether you are willing to stand \nnext to someone you do not always agree with for the betterment of this \ncountry.\n  This was very close to another default--to seeing what we saw in 2011 \nwith the Dow down 2000 points, household wealth down over $2 trillion. \nThat cannot happen again. Thanks to our leader Senator Reid, thanks to \nhis work with Senator McConnell, we averted it this time. I think you \nwill find a strong bipartisan vote in the Senate for this compromise, \nfor this idea of paying our bills, opening the government again, and \nmaking sure we have a reasonable time period to work out a solution \nlong term. That is our challenge.\n  Yes, we have averted this crisis, but we need to stop having these \ncrises. We need to actually come up with a long-term solution in a \nbalanced way that brings down our debt while at the same time doing it \nin a way that will not start another financial crisis.\n  I thank my colleagues for their amazing work, for their good humor \nduring a very difficult time, and for the fact that we are finally \nmoving forward and ending the brinkmanship.\n  I see my friend the Senator from Alaska is here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I join my colleague Senator Pryor. I \ndon't think any of us had planned to do anything coordinated at this \npoint in time. I came to the floor and was anticipating the \nannouncement from both leaders. But I see so many of our colleagues who \nhave been working on this proposal with Senator Collins from Maine. She \nhas truly been remarkable in her persistence and insistence that we \ncontinue this effort to work collegially, to work collaboratively on \nthese very difficult issues that we have been facing these past several \nweeks.\n  I thank Senator Collins for her leadership most particularly, but we \nall know, if you are trying to move the ball, just one person, you \ndon't get anywhere. We do a lot of sports analogies around here. \nHonestly, I am tired of the sports analogies. But what I do appreciate \nis that as a Senate we cannot work together as individuals and expect \nto accomplish the work that is needed, not only for my constituents in \nAlaska but around the country. Regardless of who is in the majority or \nwho is in the minority, in order to make it work for the country we \nhave to be working together.\n  As difficult as all this has been in the past several weeks, what I \nfound encouraging is there has been a nucleus of folks who would come \ntogether as the need arose, or perhaps just for a little moral support, \nand continued the effort to try to find common ground. We went from a \nsmall group to a group of six on each side to a group of seven on each \nside. I think with every passing day we had more colleagues who were \ninterested in helping and participating to try to find that common \nground. As we noted, the agreement that has been reached by our \nrespective leaderships, while it is not what our working group came up \nwith, there are certain elements of it that we had helped to shepherd.\n  But this should not be about who claims authorship, who puts their \nname behind it. What this should be about is whether we can get the \ngovernment open again, we can get focused on dealing with our fiscal \nissues, dealing with the fact that we are up against the debt ceiling \nperhaps tomorrow. Our reality is in front of us right now.\n  Getting caught up with whether it is the Senate that should make this \nhappen or the House that makes this happen, whether it is Leader Reid \nor Minority Leader McConnell, that is not what the public cares about. \nThe news that is coming out today is that there is a deal. There is a \ndeal. That deal should give America hope.\n  But it does not get us out of the mess we are in. I think we are at \npretty low approval ratings. It is going to take a while for us to \nrebuild any credibility. But I think the effort to rebuild credibility \nbegins when we honestly and earnestly roll up our sleeves, tackle the \nbig problems, recognize we have to do it together rather than to \nretreat into our respective corners and just hope that we can get it \nright without talking to one another.\n  I again thank Senator Collins for her leadership on this issue. I \nthank all my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle and the \nRepublican side of the aisle for coming to this point. I am most \nhopeful we will see it quickly resolved today so the country can \nbreathe easily and sleep a little better tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Madam President, I thank Senator Collins, who helped \nlead our group, Senator Pryor, Senator Manchin, and so many others who \nhelped lead our group as well. This was not Democrats and Republicans, \nthis was Americans who were sent here to serve our country.\n  I am blessed to come from the State of Indiana. They gave me this \ngreat honor to serve. I know precisely why they sent me here, which is \nto do the work of the Nation, to protect our Nation, to not worry about \nRepublican or Democrat, but to do what is right.\n  I take that charge very seriously. That is why I am working with my \ncolleagues to see is there a way we can help bring an agreement closer, \nbring an agreement together that protects our credit ratings, that \nprotects our financial situation, and that protects our country. I was \nvery lucky to be part of such an extraordinary group of partners in \nthis effort. I thank all of them.\n  As the Senator from Alaska was saying, we have a lot of work to do, \nas all Senators know. We stand ready, on whatever front our Nation \nneeds us, to do that kind of work. That is not Democrat work, that is \nnot Republican work, but that is American work, to move our Nation and \nour country forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, later today the Senate is likely to \nconsider legislation that would reopen government, avert the default, \nand put us on a long-term path to come up with a plan to deal with our \nunsustainable $17 trillion national debt by reopening the long overdue \nbudget negotiations. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nwill support the plan that has been put forth by our two leaders, \nSenator Reid and Senator McConnell.\n  I am pleased that elements of the compromise that the two leaders \nhave worked out have been taken from a plan that was developed by 14 \nSenators who have worked very hard, on both sides of the aisle, 7 \nDemocrats--actually 6 Democrats and 1 Independent, the Senator from \nMaine--and 7 Republicans, who have come together in good faith and have \nworked very hard over the last 2 weeks to put together a compromise \nplan, a compromise plan that I have to say I actually prefer to that \nwhich we will vote on later today.\n  But elements of our plan have been incorporated into the plan the two \nleaders have presented for our consideration. This was truly a \ncollaborative effort. I want to make sure that all of my colleagues who \nworked so hard on it receive the kudos they deserve for being willing \nto do what this body does too rarely, and that is for both sides to get \ntogether, come out of our partisan corners, stop fighting, and start \nlegislating.\n  This great country deserves a Congress that can govern, and that was \nthe unifying theme of our group. On October 5, a Saturday, when we were \nin session and the shutdown was in its early days, I was sitting in my \nSenate office, watching the floor debate. I was disheartened by what I \nheard because what I heard were partisan speeches from both sides of \nthe aisle and no one offering a path forward. I decided then and there \nto chart out, to outline a possible plan to end this impasse, and I \nmarched over to the Senate floor and gave a speech in which I urged my \ncolleagues to work together.\n  Virtually immediately I heard from colleagues on both sides of the \naisle who wanted to be part of that effort and who have worked night \nand day to try to come up with a plan, a plan that I believe helped lay \nthe foundation for the ultimate compromise reached by our two leaders.\n  Senator Murkowski and Senator Ayotte were the first two Members to \ncall me. I know my colleagues are tired\n\n[[Page S7506]]\n\nof hearing about the women in the Senate, but the fact is they were the \nfirst two to contact me. Senator Joe Manchin was the first person on \nthe Democratic side to call and say: Count me in. I want to work on \nthis as well. Senator Pryor and Senator King were also very early on, \nand Senator McCain endorsed the proposal of our working together and \nthe outlines of this plan. Senator Johanns was such a thoughtful \naddition to our group. Amy Klobuchar was there for every meeting. \nSenator Kirk, Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Senator Jeff Flake, Senator Joe \nDonnelly, Senator Jeanne Shaheen--it was a wonderful group of people, \nunited by our determination to demonstrate that we could compromise, we \ncould govern, we could bring an end to this impasse and do it in a way \nthat was worthy of this great country and our constituents.\n  We worked together over and over. There were a lot of tough decisions \nto be made, a lot of lengthy negotiations. We came up with a plan which \nwe presented to our two leaders, Senator Reid and Senator McConnell. \nNot all elements of our plan were incorporated by the leaders, but I \nthink they would say they built on our work and did, indeed, take some \nof our provisions verbatim. I continue to believe our plan was a great \npath forward, but I am pleased that it paved the way to what I hope \nwill be a solution to the impasse we have been facing, that has been so \nunfair to the American people and has hurt so many people.\n  I think it is important for us to remember that the damage goes \nbeyond the hundreds of thousands of furloughed Federal workers, \nfurloughed through no fault of their own. It goes beyond the damage to \nthe private sector employees who lost business because of the closure \nof our parks.\n  It goes beyond the damage to our disabled veterans who have had to \nwait for their claims to be handled. It goes beyond the anxiety of many \nwho are dependent on very important Federal programs, the most \nvulnerable in our society. It goes beyond the impact on our national \ndefense, although we were able to mitigate that to some extent. It goes \nto something far more fundamental, and that is whether the people of \nthis country can have confidence in our ability to put aside partisan \npolitics and act as patriots committed to doing what is right for our \nNation.\n  I thank the 13 Senators who joined me and worked so hard and did just \nthat--they left their partisanship at the door and negotiated as real \npatriots who care about America. I thank them all. It has been a great \npleasure to work with each and every one of them. All of them \ncontributed so much to the bipartisan plan we presented, and I am glad \nit has helped to bring us to what I hope is an end to a very \nunfortunate chapter in America's history.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I am very proud to be a part of a group \nwho truly put their country first. I have been here probably a shorter \nperiod of time than most of my colleagues--not quite 3 years. I think \npeople know I have been a little bit frustrated at times, if not quite \nfrustrated. I heard stories about how the Senate used to work and that \nwhen the going got tough, the Senators really got going. I have not \nseen much of that in the last 3 years.\n  We had a dichotomy of Senators--Angus King, my dear friend, who is an \nIndependent from Maine, seven Republicans led by Senator Collins, and \nour Democratic colleagues--come together and play off each other's \nstrengths. They did not play off of their egos at all.\n  Two weeks ago I could not believe the self-inflicted pain this \nCongress put upon the people of America by shutting down the \ngovernment--also coming on the brink of a financial calamity, if you \nwill, and not being able to pay our bills. I have watched businesses \nand individuals get into financial problems before. Financial problems \ncan come in many different ways, but basically you have early warnings \nand can step in front of that so you can restructure your spending, \nrestructure your habits, and get yourself whole again--it takes a \nwhile--or you can wait until it hits you, and then you have to \nforeclose or go bankrupt, and it is almost impossible to get yourself \nout of it.\n  This was really congressional-made. There may be times when we have \npressures put upon us as a country where we will have to do \nextraordinary work to keep ourselves afloat, but this is not one, and \nit should not be made because of political dysfunction.\n  I saw our colleagues playing off of the strengths each person brought \nto the group, and it got stronger and stronger each day. We faced the \nshutdown that we thought was absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary and \nshould never have happened, and then we were looking at facing a \nfinancial meltdown, if you will, the insolvency of our country, and \nthat could not be tolerated.\n  As each person played off the other to try to help make this come \ntogether--I think Senator Collins explained it so well--we were able to \nhave a piece of agreed-upon legislation that had a tremendous framework \nand good template that was presented to leadership here in the Senate. \nI applaud both of our leaders, Senator Reid and Senator McConnell, for \ntaking that constructively and working with it. They worked together to \ntry to make the best possible piece of legislation, and we encourage \nour colleagues in the House to accept that legislation.\n  I am hopeful for a large vote in the Senate. I am very much hopeful \nfor that. I am hopeful that our colleagues in the House will accept \nthat in the spirit of a bipartisan agreement we worked on. When we were \ndoing this, we considered the House and what would be acceptable and \npalatable, but, more importantly, we took into consideration the \nAmerican people and what they wanted us to do and why they sent us \nhere.\n  In the spirit of the Senate, I am proud to see the Senate rise to the \noccasion and work the way I heard it used to work. I was able to \nexperience that in the last 2 weeks, and I am proud to have been a part \nof that.\n  I thank all of my colleagues on the Republican side in both the \nSenate and the House. This is truly a time when America rose to show \nits best. Now we have to make sure we complete this.\n  During the negotiation we found out why we could not get to a budget \nconference. This bill will have a mandatory budget conference that has \nto report back and go back to some regular order. That was important \nfor all of us to agree on. Everybody said there will be some criticism \nbecause of the short time period. We have a better framework than we \nhave ever had in order to fix and repair the damage that has been done \nand address the uncertainty that will be lurking if we don't do \nsomething.\n  I am very pleased and proud. I thank Senator Collins, Senator \nMurkowski, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Pryor, Senator King, and Senator \nHeitkamp, and everybody who has worked so hard to make this happen. \nAgain, I am proud to be a part of an extraordinary group of people who \nput the country before themselves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, 5 days ago I wondered why I came to \nthe Senate. I had the same belief the American people had: This is a \nplace which is no longer functioning, stuck in gridlock and not able to \nget anything done.\n  Then an amazing thing happened. Under the leadership of some strong \nand senior Members, a group came together to have a broader discussion. \nWe called the discussion plan B. This discussion presented ideas that \nwould, in fact, find their way toward compromise. Under the strong \nleadership of Senator Collins, as well as the great Senator from Alaska \nLisa Murkowski, we were able to bring people together and begin those \ndiscussions. They started the dialog that I really think had an \nopportunity to present a template for a resolution.\n  Today we are doing something the American people have waited for us \nto do for the last 16 days. We are doing what is responsible and \nopening the government, extending the debt limit, and doing regular \norder. No more special committees, no more supercommittees or pinning \nour hopes on a Bowles-Simpson or Rivlin commission--we are going to \nmake this body function again.\n  I think we have a lot of great hope that our chairman Patty Murray \nand ranking member, Senator Sessions from Alabama, will meet with their \nHouse counterparts in principled negotiations and discussions that will \nonce\n\n[[Page S7507]]\n\nagain tell the American people we are serious about doing their bidding \nand their business.\n  The proof now is in the pudding. We have taken what little confidence \nthe American public had in this institution and the institution of the \nU.S. Congress and once again shook it. It is time that we bring that \nconfidence back. There is no better time than fulfilling the promise \nand commitment of this agreement today and getting back to regular \norder.\n  I thank all of my colleagues--Senator Manchin, Senator Angus King \nfrom Maine, Mark Pryor from Arkansas, who was instrumental in getting \nme to run for the Senate. I occasionally remind him of that. Mark and I \nwere attorneys general together. There have been so many great \nopportunities to have conversations across the aisle that I think bore \nfruit today and will continue to flourish, thrive, and provide \nopportunity for more bipartisan compromise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, Winston Churchill once famously observed \nthat Americans will always do the right thing only after they have \ntried everything else. I think the last 2 weeks demonstrates the wisdom \nof that observation.\n  I join my colleagues in congratulating, first, the leaders for \nputting aside their substantial differences and partisan divide to meet \ntogether over the last 2 or 3 days and hammer out an agreement that is \nnot going to be acceptable or exciting to anyone but will put America \nback together in terms of our government functioning, avoiding the \nthreat of default, and allowing us to move forward with the Nation's \nproblems.\n  My first congratulation is to Senator Harry Reid and Senator Mitch \nMcConnell for coming together as they have in the last 24 hours.\n  I also have to acknowledge the leadership of my senior colleague from \nMaine, Susan Collins. I happened to be presiding when she made her \nspeech last Saturday, and it was really her initiative to stand, take a \nrisk, and say: Let's try to work something out. She outlined the \nbeginning of a framework which was then fleshed out over the last 10 \ndays in discussions among the group we have been talking about.\n  I was interviewed recently on the radio and somebody asked: Don't you \nthink Senator Collins may be subject to some criticism from some corner \nor another about her role in all of this? I paused for a minute, and I \nsaid: That is what leadership is. It is the willingness to bear \ncriticism and stick your neck out. As my dad used to say, it is like \nthe turtle crossing the road--the only way the turtle can cross the \nroad is to stick his neck out. And that is what we are trying to do on \nbehalf of the American people.\n  Senator Patty Murray is not on the floor right now, but I am so glad \nwe are entering into a process where she and her colleagues on the \nBudget Committee will be able to work with Congressman Ryan and try to \nreally solve some of these issues that have been plaguing us so \nseverely. We are doing it, as we should, in the proper process. I am \ndelighted that Senator Murray is now going to step into this role, \nwhich is one of the most important we have had in recent years, and we \nwill be able to work toward a resolution.\n  This is an important and perhaps historic compromise where Congress \nwas really looking into the abyss. Congress was really proving that it \ncould not function and that our system could not function in the \ndivided politics of America today. It now appears that our leaders have \npulled us back from that abyss and given us an opportunity--not a \nguarantee but an opportunity to continue the discussions that started \nwith this terrible shutdown. It will give us the opportunity to try to \nbring our country together and resolve the problems we face.\n  It is a shame we have spent so much time doing what I think is the \nobvious--run the government and pay our bills. Now that we seem to have \npassed through this moment, we can move forward into the long-term \nchallenges of our budget, the challenges facing our people, and our \nability to solve problems so we can prove once again that this \nwonderful Constitution that has been bequeathed to us can still \nfunction, produce results, and govern this country.\n  Abraham Lincoln said we can't escape history. This morning the \nChaplain's prayer talked about being accountable to history, and that, \nindeed, is what we are doing in this body. I hope that history will \njudge today as a moment--and the beginning--of a new era of cooperation \nand civility and problem-solving. This is not about the loss of our \ndifferences or the papering over of legitimate arguments of principle \nbut the ability to try to work together, to talk to each other, respect \none another, and listen to one another. Those are the essential \nqualities of leadership that I believe we are seeing demonstrated here \ntoday, and I hope it is a beginning.\n  I congratulate and thank all of my colleagues but especially the two \nleaders for getting us to this moment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I would like to say a few more words.\n  When the Democratic leader pointed at me to say something a few \nmoments ago, we were not really prepared for that. We talked about \ncoming to the floor later. I am so glad Senator Collins is on the floor \nnow. She really deserves a lion's share of the credit for pulling this \ntogether. I am sorry we had no notice on that.\n  Some have kind of joked about the process and the women of the \nSenate. The truth is that women in the Senate is a good thing, and we \nsee leadership. We are all glad they allowed us to tag along so we \ncould see how it is done. Isn't that right?\n  It was a great experience for us to work together. I know it will be \na Reid-McConnell product at the end of the day, and that is great. That \nis really what we wanted it to be. We talked about, in one of our first \nmeetings, how we understood that we would be the plan B. The problem \nwas there wasn't really a plan A. We would be the plan B, so that if we \ncould help move things along, that would be beneficial and \nconstructive. And I think it was. I think the fact that the leaders \nknew we were working and trying to do some problem solving helped to \nmove the process along. I know it wasn't always a pretty process, but \nwe tried.\n  I think what this is all about today is a victory for bipartisanship. \nWhen we look at all the talk shows and listen to all the talking heads \nand do all that stuff, they never mention this. But the truth is the \nonly way to get work done is by doing it in a bipartisan way. It \ndoesn't really matter if we are in the Senate or on the local school \nboard. If we want to get something done, we have to work with the other \npeople in the room. We may not always agree with them. Maybe that is \nnot who a particular individual would have elected, but that is who was \nelected.\n  I think that is really one of the lessons today; that is, if we work \ntogether, we can solve these problems. That starts by putting the \nrhetoric aside, putting the party labels aside, sitting down, and \nlistening to the other side. We had to do a lot of listening because \nsometimes people have different views. They come at issues from \ndifferent angles. They have different backgrounds to bring to the \ntable. Nonetheless, we have to do a lot of listening.\n  I hope today is a big loss for blame game politics. From my \nstandpoint, when I turn on the television and I see people here on this \nfloor or on the floor down the hall or having press conferences and it \nis just blame, blame, blame, to me that is dead end politics. That is \none of those situations where some people put on a red jersey and some \npeople put on a blue jersey. We shouldn't do that. To me that is how we \nhave ended up where we have, with shutting down the government and with \nrunning the risk of breaching the debt ceiling.\n  We should never allow that to happen. That is what is wrong with \nWashington. We need to work together to get things done.\n  We have always said--I think all 14 of us who were in this group, the \nCollins group, who worked together--we said we can do this if cooler \nheads prevail, and that is what happened. We were so delighted and \npleased to be a part of it. I wish to thank the two leaders for their \nleadership and for encouraging us to, behind the scenes, move forward \nand get this done, and we definitely appreciate that.\n\n[[Page S7508]]\n\n  The truth is we have a lot more work to do. We have a lot of work to \ndo. There is a lot of work in this city that has been left undone, and \nCongress is largely responsible. If we can work together and if we can \ndo what we did today, if we can drop the rhetoric, if we can roll up \nour sleeves, just as they do in Maine and in Arkansas and in other \nplaces around the country--people in this country know that governing \nis hard work, but that is why they sent us here. That is why we run for \nthese jobs. We run for these jobs so that we can make the hard \ndecisions, so that we can make the big decisions. That is what the \nAmerican people are starving for. They want us to work together. I know \nit is the last day before we have some terrible consequences to the \neconomy, but that is what people want. They wish we would have done it \na lot sooner than we did, but nonetheless that is what they want.\n  I hope and pray that, in this body, we will continue to work together \nand we will be problem solvers and that we will get work done. The \nlegislative process is not always pretty, and we understand that. But \nwork will get done at the end of the day, and we will reach those \nbipartisan agreements that will make this country proud.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I am not part of this group of 14, I believe it is, but I wish to \nthank them. I know a little bit about how hard it is to try to pull \nsomething together in an emerging situation, and they have done it. I \nsee Susan and Amy and Lisa here on the floor, three Senators who played \na major role in this effort. I wish to thank them for taking the time, \nhaving the courage, and putting forward the ideas they did. I also wish \nto thank the leaders, Senator Reid and Senator McConnell, because I \nthink their coming together essentially averted what I saw as a \npotential catastrophe.\n  Although there is many a slip between the cup and the lip, I think we \nare in the home stretch. I think what we see is both a continuing \nresolution and the debt limit being extended, albeit not for long. \nComing over here somebody stopped me and said: Well, we will be right \nback here in 3 or 4 months. Our challenge is to make that not so.\n  I also wish to thank Senator Cruz, with whom I have had occasions to \ntangle, but he has said that he will not stand in the way of the vote. \nTo me that is very important, because nobody knows what really will \nhappen if we do not pass the debt ceiling in a timely way. In a way it \nis a big lesson in itself: Let us not go there again, and let us use \nthis 3- to 4-month period in a wise and willing way to sit down, as the \ngroup of 14 did, and work out issues before we are right back from \nwhere we came.\n  I think another part of the agreement that is very good is that it \nallows the Budget Committee to go ahead and conference. Senator Murray \nsits next to me. After her 20 attempts to move this body to conference, \nall of which failed, it looks as though now it will happen. Here is \nwhat that means. That means we will have a budget for next year, from \nwhich the appropriations allocations will be drawn very quickly, and \nthen our bills can be brought into conformance. I happen to chair one \nof the appropriations subcommittees, and that is the committee that \nincludes the modernization of our warheads, the Department of Energy, \nas well as the Army Corp of Engineers. Beginning tomorrow, seven big \nlabs were going to begin to shut down: Los Alamos, Sandia, Lawrence \nLivermore, Lawrence Berkeley; as well as our nuclear program reactors \nwere being shut down and put in safe conditions. Thirty thousand \ncontract employees were going to lose their work, and the contract says \nthey cannot be reimbursed for any day that is not worked. So that \npresented a particular special situation.\n  In the time I have been here, the Senate has become a very different \nbody, and maybe now is not a bad time to say that. We used to be able \nto do much more along the lines of what the group of 14 has done. But I \nthink scar tissue has built up in this house. I think it has built up \nin this house for one reason, and that is the prodigious use of \ncloture--a significant change because a majority body has been turned \ninto a supermajority body. What do I mean by that? What I mean by that \nis everything, albeit but the simplest thing, has to have 60 votes. We \nhad a clean debt resolution and cloture, and we did not have 60 votes \neven to debate the issue on the floor.\n  That has never been what the history of this body has shown. It has \nnever been one of the reasons why I wanted to join this body. I have \nalways felt that this body was sort of the prime of political \nofficeholders--not the bottom but the top--and has always shown a \nwillingness as to how this democratic process can work, by people \nsitting down together, understanding that our two-party system demands \ncompromise to be able to make any progress at all. What I have found is \nthat is less and less available to those of us who want to problem \nsolve, who want to sit down and work out issues.\n  So I look forward to more efforts such as this effort that just took \nplace, and I would very much like to join this esteemed new group of \nSenators for the future, because we cannot be here again in 4 months.\n  I was surprised--and I don't quite know what to do about it--but what \nI find is that people in the House too, who have come here with a very \nsmall number of votes, believe they so know what is best for this \nNation, above anybody else, they are willing to do whatever they need \nto do to get their way. That is just not the way these bodies have \ntraditionally worked. Now, that hasn't worked so far.\n  I think what is before us, which is a very simple 3-, 4-month advance \nof a continuing resolution, of the debt limit, verification of income, \nand the ability of the Budget Committee to go back to work, really \nsignals that this next 3 to 4 months are so important to do what we \nneed to do to restore comity to this body and the other body. Just \nthink if we can find points of agreement in 3 to 4 months and then go \nahead and regularly extend the debt limit for its full length of time, \ndo away with the continuing resolution. It has been 3 or 4 years with \nno budget, and it has to stop.\n  So I am hopeful, with the leadership that now appears to have come \ntogether between Senator Harry Reid and Senator Mitch McConnell, that \nthese months can really be dedicated to a bringing together of both \nsides around problem solving. All I can do is pledge myself to do my \nutmost to help us get there. So this is just one step on the road.\n  Again, there is many a slip between the cup and the lip. So I hope \nthis is going to pass this body today, pass the House, and that we go \nout with a resoluteness to come back another day and work together to \nsolve what are some very major problems before us.\n  So thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I am very happy to be able to come to the floor this afternoon to \njoin those who have already spoken to commend the fact that we have \nfinally come to an agreement, it appears, that will end this government \nshutdown, that will allow the country to pay its bills, and that will, \nhopefully, address some of the uncertainty and harm that has come to \nfamilies, to businesses, and to this economy over the last several \nweeks.\n  I wish to thank and applaud the leadership of Majority Leader Reid \nand Republican Leader McConnell for being able to come together to \nreach this agreement. I also wish to commend the many people who have \ncome to the floor this afternoon, led by Senator Collins, who have been \nworking over the last week to try to come up with some ideas to provide \na framework for an agreement. I was especially appreciative to be part \nof that group of 14 of us, along with Senator Collins--and I think her \nleadership was very important--along with Senator Klobuchar, Senator \nPryor, and the many people who have come to the floor, in providing \nsome impetus for people to work together and to move forward on an \nagreement that could finally end this shutdown. I certainly appreciated \nthe comments of Senator Pryor when he talked about the need for us to \nwork together, to listen to each other, and to put aside the blame game \nand address the many challenges facing this country. That is clearly \nwhere we need\n\n[[Page S7509]]\n\nto go next, and I certainly hope we will all in this Chamber recommit \nourselves to doing that.\n\n  We need to pass this compromise quickly so we can end the shutdown's \nnegative effects on our economy. We need to move forward and think \nabout how we can get some agreement long term in the future, and I \nthink the bipartisan efforts that have been shown over the last week \nwill be very important to doing that.\n  The fact is, while the agreement is good news, we know the agreement \nis only short term and that we are going to have to figure out a way to \naddress keeping the government open, address paying the Nation's bills, \naddress coming up with a long-term budget agreement, and we do not have \na whole lot of time to do that.\n  I hope people will understand the very real impacts I have been \nhearing in my office, I know Senator Collins has been hearing that as \nwell, and people throughout this body have been hearing from people \nacross the country about what the impact has been.\n  Yesterday I participated in a Small Business Committee hearing to \nhear the impacts of the shutdown on small businesses across the \ncountry, and I appreciate the leadership of Senator Landrieu in \norganizing that hearing. It gave a voice to many of the small \nbusinesses, to many of the people across this country who have been \nsuffering as a result of the shutdown. I thought it would be helpful to \nshare a few of those stories as a reminder that as happy as I am that \nwe have reached agreement, we have a lot of work to do in the future to \nmake sure this does not happen again.\n  One of the people we heard from yesterday was New Hampshire community \nbanker Chuck Withee. He is the president of Provident Bank. They have \nfour locations in New Hampshire. He told me that small businesses, as \nwe know, ``are the backbone'' of what they do at his community bank. He \nsaid the ``shutdown has had a material and profound effect on many \nsmall businesses in the Southern New Hampshire region'' because of the \nshutdown of the SBA loan programs.\n  We all know how critical access to capital is to making sure \nbusinesses can operate. Chuck testified that Provident Bank has 12 \nloans that are stalled right now. They are just waiting for the SBA to \nopen. They have a total of $2.7 million in small business loans--that \nis at just one small bank--that are currently on hold because of this \ncrisis.\n  Sadly, according to Chuck, the consequences of this holdup may be \npermanent for some of those businesses:\n\n       There are purchase and sale agreements hanging in the \n     balance, that may lapse and have to be renegotiated. . . . \n     The small business owner may also lose credibility and the \n     ability to negotiate similar contracts in the future.\n\n  He went on to say the numbers do not really include the dozens of \napplications for loans that would have come through the door but did \nnot because of the shutdown.\n  He also talked about a new program that Provident was just about to \nlaunch before the shutdown, a program that would focus on microloans \nfor very small businesses--those businesses that usually have borrowing \nneeds of between $10,000 and $100,000 that would have been able to get \nloans as part of this program. Because of the shutdown, the bank had \nnot continued that program. He indicated they hope to roll it out as \nsoon as the government is operating again. But clearly there are \nbusinesses that have been hurt in the interim.\n  We heard from people across the country at that hearing yesterday, \nfrom another SBA lender, Sally Robertson, who pointed out that one of \nthe borrowers she is working with has posted a $149,000 deposit on a \nnew project--that if they cannot close in a timely fashion, they are \ngoing to lose that deposit.\n  We heard from some small businesses with Federal contracts. They have \ntheir contracts on hold, so they have had to dip into their cash \nreserves or furlough workers.\n  We also heard from a representative from the tourism industry who \npointed out that travel and tourism in this country is losing $152 \nmillion a day during this government shutdown.\n  I know everybody here has heard stories such as that from their home \nStates. I am sure the Presiding Officer has heard those kinds of \nstories from the State of Wisconsin.\n  Hopefully, we will reopen the government, we will pass this agreement \ntoday, we will be able to get those small businesses up and running \nagain, we will be able to provide some certainty for those Federal \ncontracts, we will be able to bring back to work those furloughed \nworkers and make sure they get backpay. But the challenge is that we \ncannot let this happen again.\n  I am hopeful--because we have a budget conference committee going \nforward--there will be a process by which we can put in place a longer \nterm budget agreement so we are not facing another shutdown in January, \nright after the holiday season. We do not want people to think they \ncannot spend money during this holiday season because there is going to \nbe another government shutdown or because the country might think about \nagain defaulting on its debts in early February.\n  As Chuck Withee from Provident Bank said yesterday: Small businesses \nwill remain uncertain. They could face higher borrowing costs if \nCongress comes close to the brink yet again. It is an admonition I am \ncertainly going to take to heart, and I hope all of us will.\n  Again, I thank everybody who has helped in reaching an agreement \ntoday. Hopefully, this will be approved by both Houses of Congress, we \nwill get the government open, we will pay the country's bills, and we \nwill not let it happen again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, this country has gone through over 2 \nweeks of very difficult times. It is extremely distressful that \napproximately 1 million Federal employees have not received a paycheck. \nThese Federal employees have gone 3 years without a raise, they have \nbeen furloughed because of sequestration, and now they have been sent \nhome, in many cases without any pay. Similar to every other working \nAmerican, these are people who are worried as to how they are going to \npay their mortgages, how they are going to pay their car loans, how \nthey are going to pay their college loans, and they are extremely \nanxious.\n  But it is not only the 1 million or so Federal employees who are \nhurting. Obviously, it is the tens of millions of Americans who are in \nenormous anxiety about whether they are going to get the Federal \nbenefits they are entitled to and the Federal services they need.\n  I am talking now, as chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, about Vietnam veterans who have written to me from Vermont and \nelsewhere who are worried that they may not get their veterans' \ndisability benefits. Think about that. People who have put their lives \non the line for this country, were wounded in action, and they are \nsitting at home wondering whether they are going to get a check, which \nthey desperately need in order to keep their family going.\n  I am talking now about people on Social Security who are wondering \nthat if this government actually defaults for the first time in our \nhistory--does not pay our bills--that they may not get a Social \nSecurity check. Millions and millions of seniors depend on that Social \nSecurity check in order to pay their bills and to maintain a very \nminimal standard of living.\n  I am talking about moms who today are walking their kids into the \nHead Start Program and then going off to work, and they are worried \nabout what happens if their Head Start Program is shut down. What does \nthat mean to their child? What does it mean to them? How do they get to \nwork? Who is going to take care of their kid? Are they going to lose \ntheir job?\n  So what has happened in the last few weeks has brought a whole lot of \nanxiety and pain to tens and tens of millions of Americans. Why? \nBecause over in the House we had a handful of rightwing extremists who \ndecided they were going to hold hostage the American Government unless \nthey were able to defund ObamaCare. That was last week. Then more \nrecently, they were going to hold the government hostage unless we made \nmajor cuts in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. That was a few \ndays ago.\n\n[[Page S7510]]\n\n  So I think what has happened has been incredibly unfortunate for our \ncountry. The damage done in terms of our position in the international \ncommunity will take many years to overcome. What do you think the \ninternational community--people in Latin America, people in Europe, \npeople in Asia--believes when they see the United States, the largest \neconomy on Earth, presumably the leader of the free world, government \nis shut down and this country is debating whether we pay our bills? How \ndoes the President of the United States go to the United Nations, go to \nthe world community, and say: Listen. There is an international crisis. \nYou need to follow our lead. And we are the country that cannot even \npay its bills or is threatening not to pay its bills for the last \ncouple weeks and has shut down the entire U.S. Government.\n  So the damage already done by rightwing extremism is irreparable. I \nthink people's confidence in the U.S. Government has been shattered. I \nam thinking about kids in Wisconsin or kids in Vermont who are now \nlooking at the U.S. Government as some kind of joke, where maybe at \nsome point they were thinking of running for office, getting involved \nin the political process, and now they say: It is not something I want \nto do. That is very sad.\n  I intend to vote for the agreement hammered out by the majority \nleader and the minority leader. But I wish to make something very \nclear. If anybody thinks this sequestration budget is a good thing for \nAmerica, they are very mistaken.\n  As I understand it, sequestration will be extended until January 15, \nand we do not know what happens after that. Presumably that is going to \nbe based on negotiations. But according to the CBO, the Congressional \nBudget Office, if, in fact--and I will do everything in my power to see \nthat does not happen--but if the $988 billion sequestration budget were \nto go throughout this year, it would cost us some 900,000 jobs.\n  I have heard many of my Republican friends--and perhaps some \nDemocrats--making the point, and an important point, that we have to do \nsomething about the budget deficit and we have to do something about \nour national debt. I agree with that. I am proud that along with other \nMembers, we have cut the deficit in half from $1.4 trillion to $700 \nbillion. Anyone who does not think that is progress is very wrong. \nCutting the budget deficit in half is significant progress.\n  But let me make a point that is not made terribly often on this \nfloor. Yes, the deficit is a serious problem. Yes, we have to work on \nit. But every poll I have seen--and in my discussions with people in \nVermont--they say: Yes, the deficit is a serious problem. Do something \nabout it. But let me tell you, Senator Sanders, what is a more serious \nproblem; that is, that the middle class of this country is \ndisappearing. Median family income is lower today than it was 24 years \nago. Real unemployment is close to 14 percent. Youth unemployment is \nsomewhere around 20 percent. African-American youth unemployment is \nsomewhere around 40 percent.\n  The people of America are saying do something about the economy. Make \nsure that when my kid graduates high school, there will be a job \navailable for him or her. Do something about the high cost of college \neducation because I do not want my son or daughter to be leaving school \n$25,000 or 50,000 in debt. Make sure, they tell me, that you do not cut \nSocial Security because Social Security is one of the few bedrocks \nremaining to protect some of the most vulnerable people in this \ncountry. Make sure you do not voucherize Medicare, as the Ryan budget \nin the House proposed, ending Medicare as we know it and giving senior \ncitizens an $8,000 check, and when they get diagnosed with cancer, good \nluck to them, because that $8,000 will last 2 or 3 days. Make sure you \ndo not slash Medicaid.\n\n  The important point that has to be made is deficit reduction is an \nissue, but the more important issue the American people want us to \nresolve is to create the millions and millions of jobs this country \ndesperately needs. The sequester budget we are voting on today moves us \nin exactly the wrong direction.\n  If that budget were to go on for a year--right now it is scheduled to \nend January 15. But if that would go on for a year, it would cost us \n900,000 jobs rather than growing the many millions of jobs we currently \nneed.\n  Let me again raise an issue many of my colleagues do not talk about, \nbut I think the American people understand. At a time when we have more \nincome and wealth inequality in this country than since the 1920s, what \nmorality demands, and, in fact, what good economics demands, is you do \nnot balance the budget on the backs of the elderly, the children, \nworking families, the poor. But I do not hear much of that discussion \nhere.\n  If you have a situation in America where the top 1 percent owns 38 \npercent of the wealth, and the bottom 60 percent owns 2.3 percent of \nthe wealth, who should have to experience austerity? Should we go to \nworking families who in many cases have seen a decline in their income \nand say: Guess what. We are going to have to balance the budget on your \nbacks. We are going to have to cut Medicare, cut Medicaid, cut \nnutrition programs, cut the ability of our kids to go to college, \nbecause we need to balance the budget. Guess what. The rich and the \npowerful have too many lobbyists here, so we are going to have to cut \nprograms that impact you.\n  I know many people in the Senate want to move in that direction. I do \nnot. Not only do we have an obscene, unfair distribution of wealth, it \nis as bad when we talk about income inequality.\n  The Presiding Officer has seen the same studies I have seen which \ntalk about how in the last few years 95 percent of all new income \ngenerated in this country went to the top 1 percent--95 percent of all \nnew income went to the top 1 percent, while tens of millions of other \nAmericans saw a decline in their income.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I think if the Presiding Officer had a discussion at \nsome diner in Wisconsin or I did the same in Vermont, and talked to \npeople and said: Look, the wealthiest people are becoming much richer; \nthe middle class is declining; poverty is at an all-time high, how do \nyou think we should deal with deficit reduction? Do you think we should \nbe cutting programs for the elderly, working families, the children, \nthe sick, or the poor, or maybe do we ask the wealthiest people in this \ncountry to start paying their fair share of taxes?\n  Maybe--I know this is a terribly radical idea. Today one out of four \nmajor corporations pays zero in Federal income tax, because a lot of \nthese multinational corporations are stashing their money in the Cayman \nIslands and in Bermuda and in other tax havens. I know it is a very \nradical idea. I guess I am an extremist to think maybe it is more \nimportant for corporate America, which is enjoying record-breaking \nprofits--one out of four major corporations pays nothing in Federal \nincomes taxes--maybe we might want to ask them to pay something in \ntaxes so we do not cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, education \nand nutrition programs.\n  I think what goes on around here is our sense of reality is distorted \nbecause surrounding this building are not working families--they are \ntoo busy back home trying to maintain their family. Not children. We \nhave the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world. \nThey are not here. But all of the lobbyists from the billionaire \norganizations and for corporate America are here, telling us what we \nshould be doing.\n  Well, I think maybe the time is long overdue that we stood for the \nworking families of this country, for the children, and for the \nelderly, and not move for deficit reduction on the backs of the most \nvulnerable people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I have come to the floor a number of \ntimes during this government shutdown to say how absurd this has been \nfor the American people, that we have found ourselves where we are, to \nhave the government shut down, and those who brought forward a strategy \nto\n\n[[Page S7511]]\n\ndefund ObamaCare--the exchanges have opened anyway. That is why I never \nsupported this strategy, because I did not think it was smart for the \ncountry, or achievable.\n  We have been coming up against the debt ceiling issue, so I come to \nthe floor today, after having come to the floor on several occasions, \nexpressing my concerns and frustration.\n  I thank our leader Mitch McConnell and the majority leader Harry Reid \nfor coming together around an agreement ending the shutdown, to address \nthe debt ceiling, even if on a short-term basis, so we can get out of \nthe hole we are in, and start to deal with the big-picture problems \nfacing the Nation.\n  Around this, I was very heartened that a bipartisan group of Senators \ncame together to solve this problem, led by Senator Collins from Maine, \nand seven Republicans and seven Democrats. Let me say among the 7 \nDemocrats was my colleague from New Hampshire Senator Shaheen, who I \nsee in the Chamber. If the Chair would recognize Senator Shaheen, I \nwant to thank her, because what we have been able to do in New \nHampshire is that she and I, even though we come from opposite sides of \nthe aisle, have been able to find ways to work together on behalf of \nour State and on behalf of the country.\n  She was in this group of seven Senators as a Democrat, I was there as \na Republican, both representing the State of New Hampshire, ready with \nan agreement to solve this crisis. So I want to recognize my colleague \nand thank her for being part of a group that wanted to solve these \nproblems for the Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I very much appreciate my fellow \nSenator from New Hampshire Ms. Ayotte for her remarks. I would echo \nthose. She and I have both been to the floor over the past few weeks to \ntalk about the devastating impacts of this government shutdown. It has \nbeen an unnecessary hardship--a very real hardship--placed on so many \nNew Hampshire families, so many New Hampshire businesses, and the \nchallenges it meant for the economy of our State and for the Nation.\n  I ask my colleague if it would be important, as we think about going \nforward and trying to deal longer term with the need to come up with a \nbudget for this country, the need to address paying our bills in the \nlong term, if this kind of bipartisanship we tried to exhibit for New \nHampshire would be important for all of us to think about as we try to \nsolve those challenges long term and also for us to try to reassure the \npeople of New Hampshire that I believe we are going to be working \ntogether to try and do that, and hopefully everyone else here will do \nthe same?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Let me say to my colleague from New Hampshire, the senior \nSenator from New Hampshire, I agree with that. We cannot go through \nthis again. It is incumbent on all of us to work together even though \nwe come from different parties so that we do not go from crisis to \ncrisis in managing this Nation.\n  I do hope with this agreement we are able to come to a longer term \nbudget for the Nation, a longer term fiscal agreement for the Nation to \naddress our $17 trillion debt, to address the challenges facing our \neconomy, to work together to show people we can solve problems on \nbehalf of this country, and that we can make sure we are not continuing \nto go from crisis to crisis as we represent New Hampshire and this \nNation.\n  I know both of us joined that group because we had had it with what \nwas happening here and we were ready to solve the problems together.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank my friend and colleague from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I want to continue to thank the Senators \non both sides of the aisle. We were working together with our \nleadership. I mentioned this was an effort led by Senator Collins, \nSenator Murkowski from Alaska, Senator McCain, Senator Johanns, Senator \nKirk, Senator Flake, on the Republican side of the aisle, and on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, Senator Manchin, Senator Begich, Senator \nPryor, Senator Shaheen, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Donnelly, Senator \nHeitkamp, and we were even tripartisan because we had Senator King with \nus as well in these efforts.\n  I think what we demonstrated is we can come together as a core group. \nWhen things break down here, there are many of us who desire to solve \nthe problems facing the Nation. We know we cannot do it with one party \nalone. It took two parties to get us $17 trillion in debt; it is going \nto take two to get us out of this hole. Just like this fiscal crisis, \nit takes two parties to get us out and solve the Nation's problems. I \nthink that is what we learned from this experience. I want to thank \nthose who have worked so hard on it.\n  Let me say: I am blessed to be a mother. My children just turned 6 \nand 9 years old during this whole crisis situation. It has been hard to \nget home during this time. My family is still in New Hampshire. I still \nlive in New Hampshire. My daughter Kate asked me: Mom, why can't you \njust get the government open? What is wrong? Well, why can't you get \nthis solved?\n  It is a such a commonsense question that I got from her and from our \nson Jacob. Think about the lessons we try to teach our children. Are we \nnot always trying to teach them that when they get into a conflict, you \nhave to work it out? That, yes, you do not get to get everything your \nway, that it is not always your way.\n  Well, those are the lessons I think all of us, regardless if we are \nRepublicans, Democrats, Independents, try to teach our children. So I \nfound myself in a hard position here where she is asking me the tough \nquestion. I had to say to her: You are right, Kate, we have to work \ntogether; otherwise, we are not going to get this solved.\n  Even though I feel very strongly about my principles, I know my \nDemocratic colleagues do also. What kind of lesson am I showing if I \ncannot help get this resolved? That is why I was proud to be part of a \nbipartisan agreement.\n  Let me bring us back to why we got into this government shutdown for \na moment, because the other thing, being a mother of two children, when \nsomething goes wrong, I always ask my children when they make a \nmistake: What did you learn from this? What was the lesson you learned \nfrom the mistake?\n  I did not believe the defunding ObamaCare strategy was going to \nsucceed from the beginning, not because I am not a strong opponent of \nObamaCare. I absolutely am. But the fact of the matter was that the \ngovernment shut down and the exchanges opened anyway. Yet the \ngovernment was shut down, and we put all of those people who were \nworried about whether they were going to get their paychecks, veterans \nworried about what is going to happen--we can go on and on. I have \nheard the impact in my State.\n  By the way, all the flaws those of us believe that do exist in \nObamaCare were all overshadowed by the fact that the government was \nshut down.\n  I do want to fix this law. I want to repeal it. I want to replace it \nwith commonsense reform. But this was not a strategy to make that \nhappen.\n  I guess I would ask the question that I ask to my children: What did \nwe learn from all of this? What we learned is this was not a successful \nstrategy from the beginning. That, yes, you can be against ObamaCare, \nas I am. I am for repealing it and replacing it. But shutting down the \ngovernment was not a smart strategy and not the right direction. I hope \nwe never do this again. I hope we learned our lessons. I ask my \nchildren to do that, I am going to ask myself to do it, and I am going \nto ask others to do it.\n  Let's move forward. Let's work together. Let's find ways--as we get \nto January when the funding for the government expires again, and \nFebruary, let's take on the big challenges facing this Nation, the $17 \ntrillion in debt.\n  Let's get a budget for the Nation. Let's move forward from here, \nlearn our lessons, work together, and get it done for the American \npeople.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. I wish to speak about the issue at hand.\n  Thank the good Lord we are finally having, as the Good Book says, \npeople who will come let us reason together.\n  I am so grateful, for the hundreds of thousands of people who have \nbeen directly hurt by this shutdown. I am very\n\n[[Page S7512]]\n\ngrateful we will avoid a default that would not only hurt the people of \nthis country but would irreparably damage the financial foundation of \nthis Nation. This should have never happened in the first place.\n  We have heard the two previous Senators, one a Democrat and one a \nRepublican, say the same--it shouldn't have happened in the first \nplace. One doesn't hold the country hostage and disrupt people's lives \nto get their particular agenda done, particularly when they are dealing \nwith an existing law that has been upheld as constitutional by the \nSupreme Court. But that is exactly what has happened.\n  We are in a situation in the politics of this country where narrow, \ncertain special interests claim their position is the only position and \nhave it reflected in Congress so that the political ideology of a \nnarrow, small group of extremists can direct the affairs of the \nCongress. This group, especially in the House, can cause the trauma and \nthe turmoil we have been through.\n  We apparently have an agreement. I assume we are going to vote on it \nin the Senate, and it should pass overwhelmingly sometime today. Then \nthe question is will it be put in front of the entire House so \nRepublicans and Democrats alike can vote for this and get us over this \nimmediate potential crisis.\n  December, January, and February are the deadlines set in the \nagreement we will pass today. The first challenge will be for the \nBudget Committee--a conference committee from the Senate meeting with a \nconference committee from the House--to hammer out the differences \nbetween the two budgets, as there are substantial differences. We will \nhave our first test shortly when the conference committee is named and \ngoes to work. We will see whether they can start bridging some of those \ndifferences.\n  Simultaneously, there are going to be many Senators meeting to talk \nabout what has been referred to as the grand bargain, which could be \nunder the umbrella of what the budget conference committee does. Since \nthe Budget Committee is talking about top-line numbers of \nappropriations and the details are left to the individual committees, \nthere need to be many good-will negotiations with respect to each other \nin order to build consensus. We have not seen a great deal of that \naround here, but we are starting to see glimmers of it today.\n  The great test is going to come in the next couple of months by the \ndeadline of December 13 and then, of course, January 15. I don't think \nanybody with common sense would want to approach this by not getting an \nagreement before January 15. That is when this next tranche of severe \nbudget cuts, spending cuts across the board, including half of those \nspending cuts in defense, expires. We have heard defense official after \ndefense official tell us that this is not good for the security of this \ncountry.\n  Hopefully the Budget Committee can achieve an agreement in conference \ncommittee that will avoid that sequester. If all of that is done and \nthe wheels are set in motion about the fleshing out of a Budget \nCommittee agreement--for example, tax reform done in the Finance \nCommittee in the Senate and done in the Ways and Means Committee in the \nHouse, tax reform such as getting rid of a lot of the loopholes, \nproducing revenue, utilizing, for example, some of the revenue to lower \ntax rates, some of the revenue to pay down and lower the deficit, and \nsome of that revenue to replace the sequester that is going to have \nsuch negative effects on the common security of this country. If all of \nthat is done by January 15, then we won't have a problem February 7, \nwhich is the time the artificial, statutorily imposed debt ceiling \nexpires, because that crisis of potential default will have been \nabsolved by virtue of agreements prior to that.\n  That is a lot of good will that is going to have to take place in the \nnext few months. That is a lot of mutual consideration and respect that \nis going to have to reign, instead of much of what we have seen here \nthe past few weeks.\n  I am grateful we have this agreement and that in the next 2 days it \ncan be wrapped up and default can be avoided. I am hopeful, albeit \ncautious, that we can avoid this again, with good public policy.\n  I close by saying that a public office is a public trust. We, as \npublic officials, ought to recognize that our responsibility is to \nrepresent all of the people, not only some of the narrow interests \nrepresented in this country. If we will approach these next 2 days and \nthen the next several months representing and recognizing that a public \noffice is a public trust, then we can get it done. That is my hope, my \nprayer, and why I am very grateful we have come to this point.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, we are obviously pleased that our Senate \nleaders, Senators McConnell and Reid, have negotiated a bipartisan way \nto end this crisis. This agreement will open government, will allow us \nto honor our bills, and it sets up a mechanism, using the regular order \nof the Senate, to resolve the budget impasse and to hopefully negotiate \na budget for this country.\n  The good news is that in passing this compromise agreement we will \nend this self-inflicted harm on our country that has been caused by the \ngovernment shutdown and the threatened failure for us to honor the \nobligations of this country. Make no mistake about it. We have harmed \nour country. The shutdown, which started on October 1, has hurt \nAmerica's economy. The threatened default on our obligations has hurt \nAmerica's creditworthiness reputation. Consumer confidence has been \ndamaged.\n  Consumer confidence is important. That is where people are willing to \ngo out and buy or travel or go to restaurants. As a result of the \nuncertainty caused by this self-inflicted crisis, consumer confidence \nhas fallen dramatically. That has an impact on so many businesses in \nour communities--so many businesses. Many small businesses have been \nhurt very badly.\n  This morning I joined Senator Boxer in bringing some small business \nowners here to demonstrate the harm that was done. We heard from the \noperator of Blackwater Paddle and Pedal Adventures, located on the \neastern shore of Maryland near the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. \nThat refuge, as you know, is closed. This company has two locations, \none in the very historic part of our State where Harriet Tubman \nconducted her Underground Railroad, which is right next to the \nBlackwater Wildlife Refuge. So this is a place people want to go, but \nthey also want to go into the refuge for many reasons. Some get permits \nto hunt, some fish, some bird watch, some ride bikes, some like to look \nat the eagles, of which we have an incredible display there. But the \nfact Blackwater was closed meant this small business owner lost a lot \nof revenue. She related exactly how much money it was. She said: On \nSaturdays, I was doing about $1,500, and that went down to about $150.\n  That is life and death for this small business owner. That is what \nthis shutdown has meant. We can multiply that by hundreds of thousands \nof small businesses across this country that have been harmed \ndramatically as a result of the shutdown. All that added together means \nour economy has been dragged down.\n  We had a hearing yesterday of the Small Business Committee on which I \nserve. Senator Landrieu conducted the hearing. We had a roundtable with \nabout 8 or 10 people. Some were small business owners, giving very \nsimilar stories as to what we heard about Blackwater Paddle and Pedal \nAdventures. Some represented financial groups that did SBA loans, and \nthey gave specific examples of how the SBA loans could not be \nprocessed.\n  What does that mean? They gave an example of a company located right \nnear me in Owings Mills, MD. They had a loan that was ready to be \nclosed but was not closed. That person is in the process of buying \nequipment that might have to be foreclosed if they do not get the SBA \nloan, and they will lose their deposit. The one near my house was \nopening a new motel-hotel. That could be delayed or jeopardized as a \nresult of this.\n\n[[Page S7513]]\n\n  We had all types of examples given, putting real faces on those who \nhave been harmed as a result of this shutdown.\n  Our economy has suffered dramatically. The private contractors who \nrely upon Federal payments in order to pay their workers laid off \nthousands of private contract employees in my State and throughout our \ncountry. Businesses had to lay off additional people, major damage to \nour economy.\n  I take this floor many times to talk about our Federal workforce. I \nam honored to represent a large number of Federal employees, consisting \nof about 10 percent of the workforce in the State of Maryland. Over \n100,000 of these workers were put on furlough. They had to go through \nthe anxiety of not knowing whether they could pay their bills. We hurt \nAmerican families and we hurt our economy.\n  So what do we need to do? How do we move forward? First and foremost, \nwe have to get this agreement to the President and signed as quickly as \npossible. Every day hurts our economy. I hope we can figure out a way \nto get it done today and to the President today and signed today and \nget our economy back on track.\n  Next we have to deal with the economic problems we have. This \nagreement gives us a little breathing space. It sets up a way we pay \nour bills, we keep government open, and we negotiate. But we are going \nto have to negotiate an agreement. What this country needs more than \nanything is predictability. We can't keep leapfrogging from crisis to \ncrisis. That is not governing. We have to govern. The American people \nexpect us to govern. They expect us to work out our problems. They do \nnot want to hear the House is under one party and the Senate is under \nanother party and it is tough for us to work these things out. They \nexpect us to get the job done. They expect us to govern, and governing \nmeans we need to negotiate a budget that covers more than just a couple \nof months, but that takes us through the end of the next fiscal year. \nThat is what we need to do. That will put us on a glidepath for \neconomic growth.\n  Shutting down the Federal Government and teetering on the edge of \ndefault killed middle-class jobs, cost our Nation billions of dollars, \nharmed our economic competitiveness, and severely damaged consumer \nconfidence. We can't go through that again. It worries me that in 1990 \nwe said we wouldn't go through this again--and we did. So we need to \nestablish the right legacy, and that means starting now, with Democrats \nand Republicans working together on a budget that makes sense for our \ncountry. We need to seize this opportunity to bring long-term stability \nand predictability to our economy.\n  The world needs to know America is open for business. One of the most \ndamaging editorials I saw during this shutdown appeared in the state \nnewspaper in China on October 13. It read:\n\n       It is perhaps a good time for the befuddled world to start \n     considering building a deAmericanized world.\n\n  We need to let the world know that America is open for business and \nthat we have got our house in order and we are not going to continue to \ngovern from crisis to crisis. We need to get that done.\n  What we need to do is negotiate a budget that makes sense for this \ncountry. Get this agreement done, get government open, pay our bills, \nbut then negotiate a budget that allows for economic growth.\n  The very first thing we need to negotiate? Getting rid of \nsequestration. Sequestration is mindless across-the-board cuts. It says \nevery priority in government is equally important. That is not true. If \nyou have a problem with your family budget, you don't cut every \nspending item exactly the same percentage. You will make sure you have \nshelter for your family, make sure you have food on the table, maybe \nyou will postpone a vacation or something, but everything is not the \nsame priority. Sequestration says everything is the same priority. We \nneed to get rid of sequestration and we need to do that in the context \nof this budget negotiation.\n  Yes, we want to make sure we have long-term financial stability and \nthat we pay our bills. I was proud to be part of a Congress that \nactually balanced the budget when President Clinton was President. I \nknow there are tough decisions. But we know how to do it.\n  We need to make sure we invest in job growth. We need more jobs in \nAmerica. So, yes, we need to invest in transportation and roads and \ntransit systems. We need water infrastructure to modernize our water \nsystems in this country to allow for economic growth. We need to invest \nin education. We need to invest in research----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for an additional 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank my colleague from Virginia for that extra time.\n  We need to end sequestration, we need to invest in job growth, and we \nneed to have a balance between revenue and spending so we have a way in \nwhich America can continue to grow.\n  We need to deal with our Federal workforce. Shutting down the Federal \nGovernment was a punch in the gut to Federal workers and contractors. \nMake no mistake about it. This agreement intends to hold our Federal \nworkers harmless as far as pay, and more particularly it brings them \nback to work to do the essential work of these agencies.\n  I have talked before about the important work done by many of these \nFederal agencies--the Environmental Protection Agency, protecting our \npublic health, protecting our environment; the Small Business \nAdministration, processing loans for small businesses; the National \nInstitutes of Health, doing ground-breaking research to make the next \ngreat discovery for America; NIST, working to give us technology so \nthat we are competitive; the FDA's food safety programs; and the list \ngoes on and on and on.\n  The bottom line is we need to work together. We not only need to open \nthe government and pay our bills, but we need an agreement for a \nresponsible budget that will give us predictability, job growth, and \neconomic competitiveness to meet the world's global economy. I hope we \nwill take advantage of the time this agreement gives us to put our \ncountry first and do what is right with America's future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his voice \nthroughout this debate. He and I and a number of other colleagues \nrealized early on this self-inflicted crisis of putting our workforce \nin jeopardy was bad policy, bad politics, and bad for our country. I am \nvery glad that the resolution it looks like we are approaching is going \nto make sure our Federal workforce gets back to work and to the job of \nhelping America, and they are going to get compensated for it. But I \nwould add that it is not going to make everybody whole.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, may I ask my colleague to yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank my friend from Virginia for yielding.\n  Through the Chair, I thank Senator Warner for his help in making sure \nwe do what is right for our Federal workforce. They suffered through \nfurloughs because of sequestration, furloughs because of a government \nshutdown, freezes in their pay, attacks on their retirement, attacks on \ntheir health benefits, and they are asked to do more with fewer people \nbecause of freezes in hiring. Yes, we will try to hold them harmless as \nfar as this furlough is concerned, but we have to make sure we attract \nthe very best in public service because of the critical work they do. I \nthank the Senator very much for his help.\n  Mr. WARNER. I agree with the Senator from Maryland.\n  I was in the private sector longer than the public sector, and I have \nrun companies. I have never seen a management style which would say to \nthe workforce, ``We are going to ask you to do more with less money'' \nand then treat them as poorly as they have been treated repeatedly by \nsome of the attacks the Senator from Maryland has laid out.\n  I wish to take a moment, as a number of my colleagues have, to state \nthat it looks as if this self-inflicted political crisis may be finally \ncoming to an end.\n\n[[Page S7514]]\n\n  To paraphrase Charles Dickens, in a way, it may be the best of times \nand the worst of times.\n  In a certain sense, it may be the best of times because over the last \ncouple of days we have seen the leaders of the Senate, Leader Reid and \nLeader McConnell, basically say: Let's put away some of the disputes \nand end this crisis. So I compliment their work and all the bipartisan \nefforts that have been going on to put this to an end. So in a certain \nsense perhaps it is the best of times. Yes, we are about to finally do \nour job. We are about to actually reopen the government and put our \nworkforce back to work, and by a whisker we are avoiding default and \nthe financial calamity which would ensue if we continued down that \npath.\n  But it is also the worst of times in that once again we took this \nconversation to the eleventh hour. We have inflicted damage on our \neconomy and our reputation. And due not to a Republican or Democratic \nskirmish but really due to a small group of ``our way or the highway'' \ncrowd, we have violated the first principle of governing or medicine, \nwhich says: First, do no harm.\n  Unfortunately, the actions of this self-inflicted crisis have done \nharm even if we reopen the government and avoid default. Economist Mark \nZandi has estimated that the cost to our economy is at least $20 \nbillion. Reopening the government and avoiding default isn't going to \nerase the $20 billion hit to an economy that has been struggling.\n  I wish those who advocated for this shutdown, who advocated for this \nbrinkmanship would be willing to come down and explain to folks in my \nState or, for that matter, in their States--if you happen to be a \ngovernment contractor and if some of your workforce was deemed \nessential, they may actually get paid, but for the portion of your \nworkforce deemed nonessential, chances are they won't be paid. One \ncompany in Virginia with 5,500 people--30 percent of its workforce was \ndeemed nonessential. The company has tried to pay those people through \nthis period. Some will be paid, some will not. Those individuals, those \nfamilies will not recover. I would like to have somebody come down and \nexplain what all this was for in terms of the hurt in their personal \nlives.\n  I would like for some of the folks who advocated these tactics to \ncome and explain to a restaurant owner in Hampton, VA--where the \nworkforce at NASA Langley, which was 3,500 strong, was reduced through \nthis furlough to 7 people--with the lost receipts for the restaurant \nover the last 2 weeks, how their tactics somehow improved the fortunes \nof that private sector business.\n  I would like for those who advocated that it was smart politics to \nshut down the government and take us to the verge of default to explain \nto the motel owner on Skyline Drive in Virginia who lost a couple of \nweekends of the peak fall foliage season and won't see any of those \ndollars come back, how it was in their best interest to shut down.\n  It is not just in Virginia. It is Yosemite in California and national \nparks in Texas. I would be anxious for some of those who advocated \nthese tactics to explain to those private sector business owners who \nwon't see those dollars come back. They are not going to get recouped.\n  I would like those who come to this floor and talk about trying to \nget rid of our debt and deficit and the burdens on the taxpayer to \nexplain how these tactics of shutting down the government and bringing \nour Nation to the verge of default helps the American taxpayer. The \nAmerican taxpayer comes out a giant loser from these tactics.\n  The Federal Government workforce rightfully is going to be repaid, so \nthere is no savings there. As a matter of fact, the cost of starting \nand stopping any enterprise is enormous. Anyone who has run any kind of \nbusiness understands that.\n  So I hope those who have advocated these tactics will come down and \nexplain to the American taxpayers how this created a bigger deficit and \nexplain why this made sense.\n\n  I would like for those who advocated these tactics to come down and \nnot just talk to the American people but talk to the world and say how \nthis helped America's national reputation.\n  America has been ranked by the credit agencies as the most secure \ncredit in the world. That is why, when there are crises around the \nworld, investors buy dollars. It gets into sophisticated finance, but \nit means everything we do in America is a little bit cheaper because we \nare viewed--to paraphrase a company term--like the rock.\n  We have gone through two of these self-inflicted crises. The last two \nor three of these crises brought us close to the fiscal cliff or close \nto default, and the last time cost us a downgrade from one of the \nrating agencies. We saw yesterday the second rating agency, Fitch, put \nus on negative outlook. As a former Governor of the State of Virginia, \nwhere we kept our triple-A bond rating, you don't get back your \nreputation overnight by saying: Oops. Never mind.\n  We will be paying the price for these kinds of tactics for months or \nmaybe years to come.\n  I would like those who advocated these tactics to come down and \nanswer the kinds of headlines we saw in the Financial Times and Wall \nStreet Journal where countries that may or may not be that friendly to \nus--China and Russia and others around the world--were saying: We need \nto move away from an American-centered economy around the world, a \ndollar-centered economy around the world--how this hit to our \nreputation was somehow in the best interest of our country.\n  I am glad Leader Reid and Leader McConnell worked out what appears to \nbe at least a short-term solution. I am glad many of my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle tried to find common ground. It appears we will \nreopen the government. It appears we will avoid defaulting and going \ninto uncharted territory where we, candidly, don't really know how bad \nit could have been.\n  But before we celebrate too much, let's recognize that the reports \nare true as far as what the avoidance of this catastrophe will mean. It \nmeans we have 90 days before the government runs out of money again. We \nhave 113 days until the debt ceiling might have to be raised again.\n  So my first hope as we move forward is that those who practiced the \ntactics of shutdown and threatening default will say: Never again will \nwe put the full faith and credit of the United States of America at \nrisk. Never again will we shut down our government, hurt our Federal \nworkforce, hurt taxpayers, and hurt private businesses simply because \nwe didn't get what we wanted in a political dispute.\n  I hope as well in the coming weeks we will recognize that the people \nwho work for the United States of America, our Federal workers, deserve \nbetter; that when we come on the floor of this Senate or the other body \nand have our policy debates, we don't criticize the workforce the way \nit was repeatedly criticized; that we recognize that when we want to \ntake a pound of flesh out of some program, we don't start with the \nFederal workforce because in the tight budget times we will face for \nthe foreseeable future, we are going to have to ask that workforce to \ndo more with less resources. Again, as somebody who has been in \nbusiness longer than I have been in government, management 101 says \nthat if you want your workforce to do better and do more with less, you \nstart by acknowledging their challenges and rewarding them, not simply \nbashing them, not simply leaving this overhang of future furloughs or \nthe kind of uncertainty that still seems to be around this place.\n  The second thing I hope we will go forward on is recognizing that \nsequestration was set up to be so stupid that no rational group of \npeople would ever let it happen. Well, we have let it happen now for \nabout 8 months so far. As challenging as it has been over the last 8 \nmonths, in this next fiscal year, which started on October 1, it is \ngoing to get exponentially worse.\n  I understand the concerns of my colleagues on the other side and my \nconcern as well that we have to find a way to cut back on some of our \nspending. But there are smarter ways to do it than sequestration. So in \nthis ensuing period, I hope we are able to work through that.\n  I do believe we need to take these next 90 days--or an even shorter \nperiod if we need a report back from the Budget Committee by mid-\nDecember--and recognize that this constant--every 3 months, every 6 \nmonths--manufactured budget crisis does our country no good.\n\n[[Page S7515]]\n\n  If both sides will enter this next phase of negotiations with a \nlittle more sobriety, a little less willingness to call out each other \nby name, and actually recognize that we do have to get our balance \nsheet in order--if we want to avoid a repeat in January and February of \nthese last couple of weeks--we have seen the damage we have done to our \ncountry--we are going to have to roll up our sleeves and recognize that \nwe are going to have to deal with our entitlements. That means folks on \nmy side of the aisle are going to have to think about how we preserve \nMedicare, Social Security, and Medicaid in a way that is affordable \nover the long haul. My friends on the other side of the aisle will have \nto realize what kind of government we want and what kind of government \nwe are going to be willing to pay for.\n  As somebody who has spent the last 4 years combing through these \nnumbers repeatedly, I don't think we can pay for the level of \ngovernment the American people have expected with our existing Tax \nCode, so we are going to have to find ways to close down some of these \nloopholes, make our Tax Code more progrowth, but at the same time \ngenerate more revenue than we currently have.\n  It is never over until it is over, as I have found in the Senate, but \nmy hope and prayer is that we will not do any more damage; that we will \nput a halt to this hemorrhaging of the $20 billion we have already \ninflicted on our economy; that we will say to that motel owner that we \nare not going to be willing to shut down a national park again come \nJanuary; that we will say to that restaurant worker outside the Federal \nfacility: You are going to be able to predict that the Federal \nGovernment isn't going to be laid off willy-nilly; that we will say to \nour Federal workforce we are going to ask you to do more with less, but \nwe are going to support you in a way we have not done to date; that we \nwill say to the American taxpayer we are not going to deepen the \ndeficit by taking irrational actions by shutting down government; and \nwe will say to the world that once again you can count on the United \nStates of America to pay its bills in an orderly and regular fashion, \nand never again will we put the full faith and credit of America in \njeopardy.\n\n  I hope and pray we will use this period to actually put a fix in \nplace. The incremental amount of additional revenues needed to be \nchanged or the incremental amount of changes that need to be made to \nour entitlement programs are relatively small and can be phased in over \na period of a decade or more. I agree with the Senator from Maryland \nthat we also have to invest. But I cannot help but think the best jobs \nprogram we can have for an economy that is anxious and ready to recover \nis to make sure that we in Washington do not create and manufacture \nanother political crisis that puts that recovery in jeopardy.\n  It is the best of times and the worst of times. I hope we celebrate \nthat we have done our job and avoided this calamity, but let's make \nsure we never do this again. Let's make sure we take the 90 days before \nthe next CR expires and the 113 days before the debt ceiling comes and \nreally get our fiscal House in order and make sure we give the American \npublic the confidence they need to move forward.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words to applaud the \nSenate bipartisan leadership for the ongoing negotiation to do what the \nAmerican public wants us to do, to reopen our government, affirm the \nfiscal soundness of the United States, and finally begin a true dialog \nof a budget conference to find a path forward for 2014.\n  This is what America wants us to do. They want us to work together in \nthe Senate--Democrats and Republicans. They want the Senate and the \nHouse to work together. They want us to stop the foolish shutdown that \nhas needlessly hurt individuals, our communities, our economy, and our \nprestige. Now is the time to do that and then begin the repair work \nthat is ahead.\n  The deal that has been worked on by Senator Reid, Senator McConnell, \nand others is a bipartisan deal. As the Presiding Officer knows, that \nis necessary. The American public has provided a divided Congress--one \nHouse with a Democratic majority and one House with a Republican \nmajority. If we are to get over this short-term hump--and indeed, if we \nare to get over the next hump through a budget negotiation--it is not \ngoing to be just one side dictating the terms. Those who thought they \nwould shut down the government and dictate terms were wrong. Those who \nthought they could threaten default on the debt and dictate terms were \nwrong. When the American public has put one party in control of each \nHouse, the only way to find an agreement and come forward is for people \nto listen to each other and find compromise.\n  Again, we are not there yet. We hope we will be voting later in the \nday, but I think it is appropriate to say we appreciate the leadership \nof Senator Reid and Senator McConnell and finding--in a very \nchallenging time--a path forward to do what is right for the country. \nWe encourage those efforts and look forward to being on the floor later \ntoday to have a vote and send the appropriate signal, that the U.S. \nGovernment is open and the full faith and credit of this wonderful \nNation stands unblemished.\n  If we do that today, the real work, in some ways, now begins. This \nwhole exercise in brinkmanship could have been avoided if Congress had, \nin March, done what we in the Senate have been asking them to do and \nstarted a budget conference.\n  I have spoken about this many times on the floor--probably with a \nlittle bit of extra passion because I serve on the Budget Committee. \nBeing on the Budget Committee has been an education for this naive \nfreshman Senator. After working with others to pass a budget at 5 a.m. \nin the morning on March 23, I sort of believed that somehow government \n101 would next say we would then take the Senate budget and the House \nbudget--that indeed were very different documents--and put them \nimmediately into a conference where we could find a compromise and move \nforward. That is what was contemplated by the 1974 Budget Act under \nwhich Congress operates.\n  What was odd is that after we did all of that work to pass the budget \nagain and again and again, an effort to begin a budget conference was \nblocked. That was surprising. We would not be in a shutdown if we had \ndone it in March. Nevertheless, we are at a place where we are going to \nfix the brinkmanship and then engage in the kind of dialog between the \nHouse and Senate so we can move forward.\n  Again, if there is to be a deal--and budget deals have proven to be \nelusive in this body in recent years--make no mistake. It is going to \nhave to be a bipartisan deal. I feel very strongly about some issues, \nbut the deal will certainly not be to my liking in all particulars. The \nHouse may feel strongly about some issues. They can't expect a deal \nthat will be--in all particulars--to their liking. A divided government \nmeans we have to listen to each other, negotiate, find common ground, \nand that is what the American public has sent us to do.\n  In conclusion, I am proud of the Senate budget. What a budget \nconference will be is essentially an opportunity for each House to put \ntheir best document on the table and say: This is a budget that will be \ngood for America. Having worked with my colleagues on the Senate Budget \nCommittee in January, February, and March, I am proud of the budget we \nhave passed.\n  I have done a lot of budgets. I did many budgets as a city councilman \nand a mayor in Richmond. I worked on budgets as the Governor of \nVirginia. We won some awards in our State for our fiscal acumen, and I \nthink I know something about budgets.\n\n  What I know about the Senate budget and believe very strongly is \nthis: If that Senate budget were to be put in place today, without \nchanging one comma, without changing one apostrophe, it would be good \nfor the Nation. The Senate budget we passed--fully aware there would be \na conference, fully aware there would be negotiation and compromise--\nnevertheless, the Senate budget we passed does a lot of good. It is a \nbudget that is focused primarily on economic growth--growing\n\n[[Page S7516]]\n\nour economy, adding jobs. The best anti-deficit strategy is a growing \neconomy. In putting our budget together, we focused on issues such as \ninfrastructure and educational investments that would help grow the \neconomy.\n  We focused on the protection of key services, recognizing we have to \ndeal with expense items. There are key services Americans depend on, so \nwe reject the across-the-board, slash-and-burn of the sequester and \ninstead find targeted ways where we can find savings that would \nnevertheless protect key services. The budget expresses a willingness \nto reform--to reform the way we spend, to reform programs such as \nMedicare, where cost growth has been so significant, to reform Defense \nspending in smart ways that will keep our Nation safe, as well as, yes, \nto reform tax policy, the tax expenditures, which is the polite way of \nsaying loopholes, deductions, credits, exemptions--all of those tax \nexpenditures that turn our revenue collection system into a kind of \nswiss cheese. We need to do tax reforms as well. If we are going to \nreform on the spending side, we need to reform tax expenditures as \nwell.\n  Finally, the Senate budget offers us a path forward to credibly \nreduce the deficit and to replace the foolish, nonstrategic, across-\nthe-board sequester cuts that have harmed Virginia and have harmed the \nNation. That is not to say there will not be cuts. But if we are going \nto have cuts, they should be done with a strategic sense. Any CEO, any \nGovernor would say that cuts should be strategic rather than across the \nboard.\n  So I am very proud of our Senate budget, and I look forward to having \nan intense dialogue between Senate and House Members where we put the \ntwo budgets on the table, where finally a conference can begin, where \nthe American public can see the different choices the House and Senate \nmake, and thereby be educated about the choices. I think that if we sit \nin a conference and we have the two budgets on the table, folks will \nsee the many virtues of the Senate approach. But all Senators involved \nin those discussions--and we don't know yet who they will be--as proud \nas they are, as proud as I am about the Senate budget--we will have to \ngo into this with the full knowledge that we will not find the kind of \ndeal going forward without being willing to listen, dialogue, and \ncompromise.\n  I will conclude by saying it seems as though compromise is sort of a \ndirty word these days. Yet we have to reflect back that our very form \nof government depends upon it. The three branches, the checks and \nbalances between the branches, assume a degree of dialogue and \ncompromise. The legislative branch itself, with two Houses--it would \nhave been easier with one--but with two Houses, on matters such as \nthese, the need to get bills and legislation and budgets through both \nHouses requires compromise.\n  So I am glad we are finally entering that stage of a true budget \nconference--an opportunity to dialogue and compromise, which we should \nhave done last spring. We can enter into it with pride that the Senate \nbudget is a strong document that will help the economy, but also enter \ninto it fully realizing that this short-term deal is not going to be \nsolved by a House or a Senate plan that just had the support of one \nparty. It had to get solved with a bipartisan deal that originated, \nthankfully, in the Senate. We will have to be willing, in order to find \na long-term budget solution, to bring that same spirit to the table.\n  With that, Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent to speak for such time as I \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I come to the floor today with both a great deal of \nenergy and a sense of relief--relief that it appears we have reached a \nbipartisan agreement to reopen the government, pay America's bills, and \ngive us a path forward to deal with the ability to negotiate on some of \nour long-term fiscal challenges.\n  I come with a sense of energy because I think it shows that when \nthere is a will, we find a way. This needs to be a sensible approach. I \nhave a sense of optimism that this spirit of compromise that produced \nthis new agreement will continue in the Senate as we work together.\n  I am so relieved we are going to extend the debt limit, at least to \nFebruary 7, 2014. During this entire debate over the last several days, \nI was so apprehensive that America would become a deadbeat nation.\n  I was appalled, like so many Americans, that the families of four of \nour soldiers who had fallen in the line of duty were not going to get \ntheir death benefit. The wonderful Fisher family, who has been so kind \nand so generous to our veterans, paid that. This is the United States \nof America. We have a duty to our military. We have a duty to our \nmilitary families. We were not going to be able to do that. That is \njust one example.\n  I was concerned about our T-bills, our famous Treasury bills, that \nhave been not only part of the fiscal underpinning of the global \neconomy, but also have given confidence to modest and conservative \ninvestors: Well, I will invest in T-bills because nothing will ever \nhappen to our government.\n  I was concerned that our T-bills would go the way of junk bonds. So \nnow, because we have extended the debt limit, we have agreed to pay the \nbills on debt we have already incurred. This is an excellent way of \nmoving forward.\n  I also am pleased we are going to have, as part of this agreement, \nthe reopening of the entire government. This means our government will \nbe on a continuing funding resolution until January 15, 2014. This will \nenable us to set the framework for what our funding will be for the \nrest of the fiscal year.\n  Why are we in a shutdown of our Federal Government? The Presiding \nOfficer is a member of the Appropriations Committee. I chair that \ncommittee. That is the committee that actually puts money in the \nFederal checkbook for the entire fiscal year. However, we are not wild \nspenders. We have a cap placed on us. That comes from the Budget \nCommittee.\n  The Budget Committee sets the budget for the entire Federal \nGovernment. It sets what the cap should be on discretionary spending, \nwhich is the Appropriations Committee, on mandatory spending, which are \nprograms that must be funded, whether it is Social Security, Medicare, \nveterans' benefits, and others that no matter what, they are to be \nfunded. Then they also set what revenue we should have and where we \nshould get it. The Budget Committee is absolutely crucial for us to do \nour work.\n  I am pleased there has been a commitment from the leaders to appoint \nconferees on the budget resolution so the Budget Committee can do its \nwork and give back to we appropriators no later than December 16 what \nour cap is for spending for the entire fiscal year. If we can do that, \nwe appropriators can do our job. I will say more about what \nappropriations are.\n  This is going to be a very tight schedule. The Budget Committee has \nbeen unable to meet because six Senators used their parliamentary tools \nto block the Budget Committee meeting, even though the Senate passed a \nbudget with over 70 votes on March 23. We have wasted 6 months and we \ndon't want to waste the next 6 weeks.\n  I am pleased there appears to be the ability for the Budget Committee \nto meet in conference with the House of Representatives. That means the \nchair of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator Patty Murray, and the \nranking member or vice chairman, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, will \nmeet with Paul Ryan, the Republican chairman in the House Budget \nCommittee, and Chris Van Hollen, another Marylander and a very able \nranking member.\n  I wish them well because we need to know how much discretionary \nspending we are going to have, we need to be able to look at mandatory \nspending, and we need to look at revenues. If we can pass this \nagreement reached by our leadership on both sides of the aisle, \nDemocratic leader Senator Reid, and Republican leader Senator \nMcConnell,\n\n[[Page S7517]]\n\nwe can, within hours, reopen our government and pay our bills.\n  These are our constitutional responsibilities. The American people \ndeserve a government that works as hard as they do. We need to put our \nFederal Government and our Federal employees back to work. This \nagreement does that. It says to the American taxpayer and to the entire \nworld, America is not a deadbeat nation. We can work together to enact \nbipartisan, fiscally responsible legislation to keep our government \ngoing. There is no doubt that we have significant fiscal challenges \nahead of us.\n  As we prepare to vote, I would encourage all of us to take stock of \nwhat has happened in the Senate the past several days. It is time we \ntake stock of where we are and what it means. The crisis we have just \nlived through might be very good for TV ratings, but it is lousy for \ncredit ratings. It is good for TV ratings because the Nation was \ngripped by what they saw. They couldn't believe it. I was in the Senate \nworking, and I couldn't believe it either; that we could not in a \nstraightforward way come to grips with the fact that we needed to \nreopen government, but we were being held back by those who wanted to \ndefund ObamaCare.\n  This crisis of the U.S. Government and the fear that the U.S. \nGovernment might not pay its bills has created a crisis of confidence. \nAs we work on implementing the deal we are promoting, we also have to \nwork to ensure that we rebuild the confidence of the American people \nand those who depend on and look to the U.S. Government, those that are \ntreasured allies and emerging nations to whom we would say be a \ndemocracy and be like us. We have to use our time not only to get our \nfiscal act together, but we have to restore the confidence in our \nability to govern.\n  America is a middle-of-the-road nation. We need an environment where \nthe middle speaks, where the middle class now speaks and says: Please \nrepresent me, meet our national security needs, make public investments \nin physical infrastructure and in human infrastructure such as \neducation and access to higher education. Please make public \ninvestments in research and development that will create new ideas for \nthe new jobs in the new economy of the 21st century. This is what they \nwant us to be able to do.\n  For those of us in this great institution called the Senate and the \nother side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives, we have to be \nmiddle-of-the-roaders. It is the middle, maybe a little to the center \nleft or to the center right, but we have to be in the middle. Middle-\nof-the-roaders are the ones who helped bring us to this deal.\n  I wish to thank those who put forth some other ideas during this \ndebate, Senator Collins, Senator Klobuchar, and the so-called group of \n12. They had some very interesting ideas. As we go forward on \nimplementing the deal, we ought to consider some of them. They helped \ncreate a climate and a tone where people showed they wanted to be \npragmatic and also wanted to be patriotic, which is to make sure that \nthe esteem of the U.S. Government continues to take hold both among our \nown people and around the world.\n  I wish to be sure we all work together. I fear the middle-of-the-road \nlegislator could be an endangered species. I hope not. I hope the \nmiddle-of-the-roaders don't become roadkill. We can show now it is not \nonly the deal that has been made, but we must vote on the bill, pass \nthe bill, and then we need to implement it.\n  America and its government cannot go from one crisis to another. We \ncannot govern by crisis. We cannot govern by one party or the other \nextorting it from the other--my way or I will shut it down. We have to \nshow that we are a deliberative body. We have to show we are a nation \nof laws and rules, not of people, personalities, and pundits. We need \nto demonstrate that.\n  I compliment those who have been voices of moderation and voices for \ncreating the climate to bring us to this point.\n  I also wish to thank our leadership for being willing to step to the \nplate and be leaders. I would also like to thank Senator Reid and \nSenator McConnell for the leadership and statesmanship they possess.\n  We are on the brink of brinkmanship. We had enough of gamesmanship, \nand they stepped forward to show us what statesmanship is. I wish to \nthank them for what they did.\n  I chair the Appropriations Committee. I am not a solo act. I have 12 \nwonderful subcommittee chairmen who are eager and itching to go to \nwork. I have an outstanding Republican conservative as my vice \nchairman, Senator Shelby of Alabama. We want to work. We want to work \ntogether and we want to work with civility, mutual respect, and get the \njob done.\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the dome, we want to govern. \nWe want to govern wisely. We want to govern efficiently, and we want to \ngovern respectfully.\n  I say to my colleagues on my side who have elected me the chair of \nthis committee, they may count on me to do my best.\n  I say to those on the other side of the aisle, they may count on me \nto continue to run an inclusive committee of discussion, open debate, \namendments, so we can move our process forward. Everybody feels \nincluded. Everybody has their say. Everybody has their day. At the end \nof the day though, we will vote.\n  To my colleagues on the other side of the dome, let us work together. \nWe have shown in the past we know how to talk to each other, we know \nhow to listen to each other, and we can get the job done. I believe \nAmerica wants us to get on with the job. Americans want to be able to \nhave a government they can count on. Americans want to be able to have \na government that works as hard as they do. They want to have a \nCongress that acts in the interests of the Nation, of the next \ngeneration, and not of the next election.\n  I am ready to vote for the agreement reached by our leadership, go to \nwork, and do everything I can to make sure we follow the middle of the \nroad--that sensible center--and to make sure the American middle class \nhas their day and their say.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today on a day when we are ever \nhopeful that we will be able to complete legislation tonight that will \nremove the threat of a default as well as to open the government and to \nallow us to go forward now with negotiations on short-term budget \nissues for the next year and even beyond. I am confident that will \nhappen, that we will be able to complete most or all of the work \ntonight.\n  In a larger sense, the reason it is vitally important we get this \nagreement effectuated is because there are an awful lot of people out \nthere hurting, and hurting for several reasons. We have had a \nrecovering economy, but job growth hasn't moved fast enough. We still \nhave, by way of example in Pennsylvania, over \\1/2\\ million people out \nof work--at last count, 501,000 Pennsylvanians out of work. The \npercentage number really doesn't tell you much. It has been hovering \naround 7\\1/2\\ percent or a little higher for a long while, but more \nthan \\1/2\\ million people out of work is devastating.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, his State of Ohio and Pennsylvania \nhave a lot of similarities in terms of our workforce. When I go across \nPennsylvania, we have sometimes the biggest urban areas, such as \nPhiladelphia, still having high unemployment numbers, and sometimes \nvery small counties having an equally high percentage of people out of \nwork. My home area of northeastern Pennsylvania has still far too many \npeople out of work.\n  So when you add a tough economy still for a lot of people, plus the \nimpact of the indiscriminate, across-the-board cuts by way of \nsequestration--which I believe is bad public policy, and we will talk \nmore about that later, and it will be the subject of greater debate \nthan it has been--and, thirdly, you add the impact of the shutdown, \nand, finally, you add this time of coming perilously close to a \ndefault, it has been, for all those reasons, a difficult period for the \ncountry and a very difficult period for\n\n[[Page S7518]]\n\nthose who are trying to make ends meet every day.\n  We have a chance in the next couple of hours to vote in a manner that \nwill lift some of that anxiety, some of that worry. I was here this \npast weekend on the floor talking about a letter I had received from a \nwoman in northeastern Pennsylvania. She talked about her circumstance \nand her husband's circumstance as a result of the government shutdown, \nbut then she talked about her parents, ages 85 and 83. Here is what she \nsaid about her parents:\n\n       . . . they should not have this uncertainty. These should \n     be their golden years. It breaks my heart to hear my mother \n     saying she can't sleep and has a stomachache from the worry \n     about where our country is headed. Middle and low income \n     families cannot afford another economic downturn. We are just \n     barely recovering from the last one.\n\n  That letter that came from northeastern Pennsylvania I think spoke \nfor people across our State and across our country as to what people \nhave been living through, trying to recover from the recession of \nseveral years ago and then being hit with a government shutdown and \nthen our coming to the brink of default.\n  For all those reasons, we hope the work that is done today with the \ncompromise agreement Majority Leader Reid and Republican Leader \nMcConnell have entered into becomes the consensus not only here in the \nSenate but in the House as well. No legislation can remove all of the \nanxiety and the worry people have, but certainly it will provide some \nmeasure of relief for families.\n  We had another story that came to us yesterday of a family in \nPennsylvania, led by the mother of the family. Kelly Brown is her name. \nShe has four children, and the children's ages are 17, 14, and she has \ntwo 9-year-old twins. This story was in the Pottstown Mercury, Tuesday, \nOctober 15. Kelly's story is emblematic of the impact of the shutdown--\njust the shutdown itself--and what that did to her.\n  Kelly is in an apartment in southeastern Pennsylvania with her four \nchildren. She was moving along the path to getting a mortgage and being \nable to move into a house kind of one county over, not too far from \nwhere she was living. In the first couple paragraphs of the story, it \nsays:\n\n       Then the government shutdown froze her mortgage. And over \n     the weekend, the home's seller notified Brown that she \n     couldn't wait any longer.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis story dated October 15 of this year entitled ``Gov't shutdown \ncould leave single mom, kids, homeless.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Mercury, Oct. 15, 2013]\n\n         Gov't Shutdown Could Leave Single Mom, Kids, Homeless\n\n                            (By Frank Otto)\n\n       Boyertown.--Kelly Brown was all set. With a pre-approved \n     mortgage through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, she had \n     an agreement on a house in Boyertown where she could move \n     with the four children for whom she has full custody.\n       Currently in an apartment, it would be the first house \n     Brown, 44, would have since she lost her home in a divorce \n     settlement seven years ago.\n       Then the government shutdown froze her mortgage. And over \n     the weekend, the home's seller notified Brown she couldn't \n     wait any longer.\n       ``Three weeks ago we were celebrating getting my first \n     house,'' Brown said. ``And now we're here.''\n       With the agreement in place before the shutdown, Brown and \n     her own real estate agent, Jack Dolan, of Keller Williams, \n     began putting money into the home through appraisals, \n     deposits and improvements such as the removal of asbestos.\n       ``We thought, of course the government won't shut down,'' \n     Brown said.\n       As September ended, the shutdown did indeed occur, which \n     put the pre-approved mortgage through the Department of \n     Agriculture on hold.\n       Brown continued forward hoping the shutdown wouldn't affect \n     her move out of her apartment in Upper Frederick, where she'd \n     given notice prior to the shutdown.\n       She'll have to be out of the apartment she shared with her \n     sons, Oliver, 17, Noah, 14, and 9-year-old twins Duncan and \n     Isabella, by Nov. 2.\n       The settlement on the home in Boyertown was scheduled for \n     Oct. 25.\n       ``We were moving ahead `thinking the shutdown is going to \n     end. The shutdown is going to end,' '' Brown said.\n       Then, with the mortgage still frozen and no clear \n     resolution to the shutdown in sight, the seller notified \n     Brown through Zuber Realty, their Realtor, that they couldn't \n     wait any longer and were going to move ahead with attempting \n     to sell the house to someone else.\n       ``Over the weekend, they said they would no longer give us \n     any time,'' Brown said. ``They said they'd sell the house to \n     somebody else, knowing all the money we had already paid and \n     it was through no fault of my own.''\n       Richard A. Zuber, owner of Zuber Realty, said the seller \n     couldn't hold the house out any longer without getting a \n     return on the property.\n       Zuber said the decision rested with the seller, who intends \n     to stay open to selling to Brown if no buyer is found once \n     the shutdown ends.\n       ``We definitely have sympathy because it's not their \n     fault,'' Zuber said. ``This all hangs on the federal \n     government.''\n       Brown said Dolan suggested attempting to rent the house \n     until the shutdown was over but the seller was not in favor \n     of that.\n       At this point, Brown is concerned that she might not have a \n     place to live with her family come Nov. 2. She has no \n     relatives in the area and now has to brainstorm.\n       ``I work for the (Montgomery County) Office of Children and \n     Youth as a caseworker,'' Brown said. ``It's kind of ironic \n     because this is what I do. I help families that have neglect \n     or abuse of children and help them with services to find \n     housing.''\n       An additional concern is that her son, Oliver, is applying \n     to colleges now and expecting acceptance letters.\n       ``What's going to happen with that?'' she said. ``Where are \n     we going to have a mailbox?''\n       Serving as a classroom aide in the Pottstown School \n     District while she got her master's degree to become a social \n     worker, Brown said she's ``devastated'' after all the work \n     she put in.\n       ``We were finally at that point where we could do it,'' \n     Brown said.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. My office is working with Kelly now to see if we can't be \nhelpful. But the point is she should never have had to go through that \nanxiety and worry, and risk not being able to move into that house that \nshe had a chance to move into.\n  That is what real life is. Real life is trying to complete a mortgage \napplication and moving along to go from an apartment to a home with \nyour four children and being stopped because of a shutdown here. And in \nthe case of the earlier letter I referred to, it is a daughter talking \nabout her parents and the worry they have, and the literally sleepless \nnights and pain and anxiety because of what is happening or not \nhappening here in Washington.\n  We hope and pray on days such as this that the actions taken will \nlift some of that anxiety and provide a measure--and maybe it will only \nbe a very small measure--of comfort and what we hope will be some \ndegree of stability.\n  I think once we get past this period, we can get back to the work the \nAmerican people expect us to focus on, which is--if I could put this in \na sound bite, what I hear from people in Pennsylvania saying they hope \nI will do as one of their representatives--that we will work together \nto create jobs or work together to help the middle class, work together \nto move the economy forward, or some variation of that, and that is \nwhat we hope to get to.\n  As important as it is to begin the process of talking about and \nnegotiating on a budget for the next year and on the longer term fiscal \nquestion, it is very important for both parties to get back to the \nfocus of building a stronger middle class and building a stronger \neconomy.\n  You don't have to go very far or read the paper for many days to find \nevidence that the middle class has never been more under siege, never \nbeen more undermined or weakened over time than the middle class is \ntoday. On September 19 of this year, in The New York Times, there was a \ngraph--I won't put the graph in the record but I will summarize it very \nbriefly--of all kinds of data that indicated what has happened to the \nmiddle class in the last generation. The headline over the description \nof the graphs was ``standing still,'' with a big question mark. The \npoint it makes is that the middle class is virtually where it was many \nyears ago, if not further behind.\n  I am quoting from some of that summary where it says:\n\n       The costs of maintaining a middle-class life-style have \n     increased.\n\n  Then in the middle of the page there is a graph that talks about the \nmiddle 20 percent of the country--basically what most would describe as \nthe middle class. And in that 20 percent you can tell, just from a \nlittle more than a generation--this graph goes from 1967 to 2012--that \nthe share of total income\n\n[[Page S7519]]\n\nof that middle 20 percent of the country has gone from 17.1 percent to \n14.8. That is a substantial erosion of income for the middle class. \nThat is a problem and a challenge we should work on in the days ahead, \nin addition to working on our budget.\n  I will make one final point about what we should do on the other side \nof this important work we are going to do today to complete this \nagreement and to lift the threat of default and to make sure we open \nthe government and move to negotiations.\n  On July 20 of this year there was a long piece in The New York Times \nabout not just the middle class but also about other measures of how we \nare doing as a country. Two data points jumped out at me and, frankly, \nwould outrage anyone reading it. They listed the top 20 countries that \nare our peers. This category was the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development, so-called OECD countries--in other words, \nthe 20 countries in the world that are most similar to the United \nStates by way of economies and, to a certain extent, by population. So \nwe are compared to our peers. That is the measurement. If you look at \nthe top 20, under two categories--infant mortality and child poverty--\nthe United States of America ranks 17th in both out of 20. And 17th, \nobviously, is right near the bottom. Instead of being in the top 3 or \ntop 5 or even the top 10, the United States, when it comes to child \npoverty and infant mortality, is ranked No. 17 in the world out of 20.\n  So as we move to focusing on the middle class and focusing on job \ncreation strategies, and even focusing on budgets and whatever else \npeople want to debate and negotiate about around here, I hope we will \nall feel challenged by the admonition that we cannot lose sight of what \nis happening to our children. This is the most powerful country in the \nworld. Our economy may not be demonstrating it right now, but we are \nand we will be, and we can never say we are doing the job we must do if \nwe are not focused on the needs and the challenges faced by our \nfamilies, especially the most vulnerable member of any family--a child. \nInfant mortality and child poverty are two indicators where this \ncountry is far, far behind, and we all need to do more on those issues.\n  We are happy we are moving to a resolution of this long nightmare the \ncountry has lived through and these families have lived through, but \neven on the other side we have some major challenges that should be a \nsummons to our conscience to do something about them, and I hope our \nactions and our work can be commensurate with the challenges faced by \nfamilies and especially the challenges faced by our children.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Pennsylvania \nin expressing relief and optimism that, finally, it looks as though we \nare rid of the wasteful and useless government shutdown we have been \nput through for the past 2 weeks; that it looks as though we are rid of \nthe dangerous threat of American default that we have faced for the \nlast few days; and let's hope that together we are also rid of the \nmalicious spirit that led us down this evil path in the first place.\n  A colleague the other day on the Senate floor used the analogy of a \nfire in an airplane's cockpit distracting the pilots from flying the \naircraft where it needed to go as they had to put out the fire.\n  That is kind of what we have been through these past 2 weeks. I hope \nwe will have no more of our own countrymen lighting fires in the \ncockpit just to try to get their way. We need as a nation to get our \nheads up, fly the plane, and ready ourselves for the weather ahead.\n  The last 2 weeks have been wasted in this useless artificial crisis \nand has distracted us from real crises, real problems, undeniable \nproblems--things which the Speaker of the House can't make go away by \nfinally allowing a vote but which will require us to work together to \nsolve them. None is more significant to our children than what our \ncarbon pollution is doing to the Earth's atmosphere and oceans. It is \nnot enough just to put out the fire in the cockpit. We have to wake up \nto the real problems ahead and around us.\n  I know the Presiding Officer from Ohio is a keen enthusiast and \nstudent of history. I recently saw part of ``The Dust Bowl,'' Ken \nBurns' documentary series. The Dust Bowl calamity was an economic \ndisaster and a human disaster, but it was also described in the show as \nhaving been an economic disaster and a human disaster because it was \nfirst and foremost an environmental disaster--indeed, one of the two or \nthree most devastating environmental disasters in the United States.\n  The Dust Bowl happened, creating such disaster for so many good, \nhard-working families, because, simply put, we messed with Mother \nNature. To plant wheat, we tore up the deep-rooted buffalo grass which \nhad protected the prairies for generations. We ignored the cycles of \ndrought which were the Great Plains' history. The result was tragedy \nand destruction.\n  There are obvious parallels from the Dust Bowl experience to where we \nare now on carbon pollution. Most obviously, lesson No. 1, you mess \nwith Mother Nature at your peril. And are we ever messing with Mother \nNature. We just broke through 400 parts per million of CO2 \nin the atmosphere after at least 800,000 years--which is longer than \nhomo sapiens have been a species--in the range between 170 and 300. Our \nwhole species has come to the success we have seen on this planet in a \nsafe window of 170 to 300 parts per million of CO2 in the \natmosphere, and we have now broken out of it. And it is not just 400, \nit is 400 and climbing.\n  Let's move from our atmosphere to our oceans. Our oceans are \nacidifying at the fastest rate ever recorded. We have to go millions of \nyears back into the geologic record to find anything comparable. When \nwe go there, what else do we find when we look back to those points in \nthe ancient geologic record? It isn't pretty. In fact, it is downright \nominous.\n  The second lesson is that the cause of such a calamity can be a \nperfectly normal activity, just at the wrong scale. Look at the Dust \nBowl. There is nothing wrong with plowing. Plowing the Earth is \nprobably the single most valuable action humankind has ever learned to \ndo. Plowing is essential to farming. Yet it was that ordinary \nactivity--plowing--which brought on the Dust Bowl and the vast human \ntragedy that ensued because it was at the wrong scale.\n  Similarly, there is nothing inherently wrong with burning fossil \nfuels. We do it when we drive to the market, and we call it up when we \nflip on the light switch. Yet burning fossil fuels at too great a scale \nis leading us to the brink of a new disaster.\n  What changes and makes it no longer perfectly normal and OK is when \nwe know the consequences of the scale of our activity. Once we know the \nconsequences we are causing, that activity is no longer so benign and \nresponsibility cannot be so easily shrugged off. If only the farmers at \ntheir plows had listened to the warnings of the cattlemen and Native \nAmericans and not put every corner of every farm to the plow.\n  There is a third parallel, which is that there is a lot of lying done \nwhen there is money to be made. In the Dust Bowl, land dealers and \nspeculators told farm families that plowing the prairies would make \nmore rain fall. Rain follows the plow, they were told. They had nothing \nto worry about. And the land speculators sold, and they sold a pack of \nlies. The race to plow created more speculators and more hucksters and \nmore lies.\n  Today we have the deniers--a sophisticated, well-honed apparatus of \ninstitutions and strategies designed to spread lies, designed to sow \ndoubt, designed to delay action. Today it is done on a scale that makes \nthe Dust Bowl hucksters look like piddling amateurs. It is funded by \ngiant corporations such as ExxonMobil and Koch Industries. It uses the \nslickest Madison Avenue strategies. It maintains a stable of pet \nscientists willing to be trotted out and to recite from the polluters' \nplaybook. It operates through a network of false front organizations \ndesigned to look more independent and credible than their funders are \nand designed to hide the money flow.\n  When history looks back and this story is fully told, I believe this \napparatus of lies will take its place beside great American scandals \nsuch as Teapot Dome and Watergate. But for now it churns merrily on its \nway, cranking out the propaganda.\n\n[[Page S7520]]\n\n  Regrettably, this apparatus has captured large segments of the \nRepublican Party and silenced others. The polluters have maneuvered the \nquestion of carbon pollution right into the middle of the Republican \nParty's culture wars. The fossil fuel industry must be really chortling \nat having pulled off that fete. But it does not bode well for the \nRepublican Party. Lies are ultimately revealed. The choice to make \nbedfellows of the polluters will soon enough be very damaging to the \nRepublican Party. For the polluters, they have played the Republican \nParty for suckers, and they will grin all the way to the bank. They \nwon't care.\n  The last parallel is the lesson that when you are messing big-time \nwith Mother Nature, things can go precipitously wrong. Mother Nature \ncan turn on you very suddenly. Wheat farming on the plains was a \nbonanza, with bumper crops year after year. Families who had never \nowned land, who had never before had a place to call their own, saw \ngolden futures as far as the eye could see as the wheat ripened. And \nwithin just a few years the devastation was complete and families' \ndreams were shattered. The Dust Bowl came on fast.\n  There is a phrase--``a fool's paradise.'' It is called a fool's \nparadise because it looks like paradise for a while if you don't look \nahead and take the precautions to protect paradise and fend off \ncalamity. Not looking ahead is what gets you to the ``fool'' part.\n  Young people are looking ahead. Voters under 35, by a ratio of 66 to \n27--more than 2 to 1--say that climate change is a problem we need to \naddress. And when asked about climate deniers, 74 percent of \nIndependent young voters said they would describe climate deniers as \nignorant, out of touch, or crazy. For self-identified Republican young \nvoters under 35, 53 percent identify climate deniers as ignorant, out \nof touch, or crazy.\n  I ask unanimous consent to conclude in 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. So I ask my Republican friends, how is climate denial \na winning strategy when 53 percent of your own young voters think it is \nignorant, out of touch, or crazy? How is that looking ahead? We in \nCongress get elected to look ahead. We don't get elected to put our \nheads in the sand. We certainly don't get elected to parrot the lies of \nthe special interests.\n  Well, we are not looking ahead. We are sound asleep here in Congress. \nWe are having a snooze while nature's alarms are ringing all around us. \nIt is time for Congress to wake up. We have a duty. We need to wake up \nto our duty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, it now appears that at some point this \nevening we will reach the end of the latest Washington-manufactured \ncrisis of the month. But, unfortunately, the real crisis facing the \ncountry remains, and that real crisis is the growing sense among our \npeople that we are losing the American dream.\n  Why do people feel this way? Because more than 4 million Americans \nhave been out of work for 6 months or more, because millions more find \nthemselves stuck in jobs that do not pay enough for them to live the \nway they are used to, and while their paychecks aren't growing, their \nbills are. Ask the young couples and single parents how much they are \nspending every month to provide childcare for their children. Ask the \nstudents, young Americans who are stuck with thousands of dollars in \nstudent loans they are now struggling to pay.\n  This is the real crisis facing America; that our status as a land of \nopportunity seems to be eroding and that so many of our political \nleaders seem oblivious to it. And now, as we emerge from this latest \nstandoff, we have done nothing to address it.\n  There were two issues at play in this showdown. The press coverage \nmixes them together, but there are two distinct and separate issues, \nand they should be examined that way.\n  It started with ObamaCare--a law that was sold to people as something \nthat would help them get affordable health insurance. But that is not \nwhat it is going to be. We have all heard the news of what a fiasco the \nrollout of the exchanges has been. But as bad as the rollout of the \nexchanges and the Web site has been, we need to realize that was \nsupposed to be the easy part. The most difficult and disruptive parts \nof that law are yet to come.\n  In the months to come, a new insurance fee--a new tax on hard-working \nAmericans--will be added to insurance policies. People will be required \nto give up existing coverage they are happy with if it doesn't meet the \nstandards created by ObamaCare. And if they don't buy the insurance, \nthey eventually will have to pay a tax that goes up to $695 a year or \n2.5 percent of their income. Employers with more than 50 full-time \nemployees will be required to offer a certain type of coverage to their \nemployees. So many of them are moving people to part-time work. And \nfull time, by the way, is no longer defined as 40 hours; it is now 30 \nhours. So many employers are moving employees to under 30 hours a week.\n  Today, for many Americans, ObamaCare is just a Web site that doesn't \nwork, but in the months to come this law is going to hurt millions of \npeople. It is going to cost them hours at work and maybe even their \njob. It is going to cost them the insurance they have now and are happy \nwith. It is going to force them to leave their existing doctor. It is \ngoing to raise rates for people who buy insurance for themselves.\n  What do we tell these people who are being hurt by this law? To deal \nwith it because it is the law of the land? Is it not our job to fight \nfor them? Is it not our job to be their voice and to protect them from \nthe harmful effects of this law? That is why I continue to believe we \nshould not waste a single penny more of taxpayer money on this damaging \nlaw.\n\n  One of the most important powers and responsibilities that we have as \nMembers of Congress is the power of the purse. It is under our \nConstitution, which gives the Congress the power to decide what to \nspend money on and what not to spend taxpayer money on.\n  I know of no one in my party who supported shutting down the \ngovernment. On the contrary, we argued that we should fund the entire \ngovernment except for one thing, ObamaCare. In fact, the House of \nRepresentatives passed a law that did just that.\n  But the Democrats took the position that either we fund ObamaCare or \nwe fund nothing at all. They took the position that funding ObamaCare \nwas more important than funding the government. They were willing to \nput our country through this government shutdown just to save their pet \nproject. Within days of the showdown, by the way, a second issue was \nadded, the Federal debt limit. The press portrays the debt limit as \nsimply a law that allows us to pay our bills, and therefore they fall \nfor the argument that failing to raise the debt limit equals a default \non our debt. But the debt limit is a lot more than simply permission to \npay our bills.\n  Every year, our government is spending more money than it takes in, a \nlot more money than it takes in. As the years go by, that annual \ndeficit adds up to what we call the national debt. It is growing at an \nalarming rate. The debt limit is a law that limits the amount of money \nthe government can have as debt at any single time. But we depend on \nborrowed money to pay our bills. So if we do not raise it again, \neventually we will not have enough money to pay all of our bills. That \nshould scare us.\n  Reaching the debt limit is like this. When the bank calls on you to \ncollect the monthly mortgage payment, if you don't pay them, your home \nis going to be taken away, your credit is going to be ruined, and your \nability to borrow money in the future is going to be hurt. But what if, \nbecause you don't make enough money, the only way to pay your mortgage \nis by using your credit card? You can't do that forever, but you also \ncan figure out what other expenses to cut so you don't have to keep \nusing your credit card to keep paying the mortgage. That is what real \npeople in the real world do.\n  But that is not what we are asked to do here. They are asking us to \njust pay the bill and keep using the credit card and let tomorrow worry \nabout tomorrow. We cannot do that forever because at some point even \nthe credit card is going to stop working.\n  Yet that is what has happened here again. So the debt will keep \ngrowing.\n\n[[Page S7521]]\n\nWith each passing year, we will get closer to the day that we face a \nreal debt crisis--not one caused because the Congress cannot pass a \nbill, but one caused because no one will lend us money anymore.\n  That is how we arrived at the point we find ourselves today. We have \na President and a majority in the Senate that would rather face a \ndefault before seriously dealing with the debt. We have a President and \na majority in this Senate that would rather shut down the government \nbefore they would shut down ObamaCare or even make any meaningful \nchanges to it.\n  Tonight the government will be reopened and the debt limit will be \nlifted, but our real problems are still here. In the months and years \nto come they are only going to get bigger and harder to solve. For \nthose of us who realize this, who clearly understand that the direction \nin which we are headed threatens the American dream and all of the \nthings that make our country special, this is the time to reflect on \nthe way forward. Because if we do not figure out how to change course \naround here, if we do not figure out the way to change the course our \nNation is on, we will forever be known as the generation that ushered \nin America's decline.\n  History is not going to distinguish between Republicans and \nDemocrats. It will judge us all harshly for our failure to act. To \navoid this fate we must once and for all begin to address the national \ndebt, not with accounting gimmicks but with real and measurable steps. \nIt does not have to be solved in one sweeping measure, but we must \nbegin the work of moving toward a sustainable level of spending. This \nwill take time because we are still saddled by too many leaders \nunwilling to address the issue in a meaningful way.\n  Let's do what we can while they are still here, and at the same time \nlet's work to replace these irresponsible leaders on the left with \nleaders who will finally step up and save our Nation from the real debt \ncrisis that awaits us.\n  As for ObamaCare, it too will be harshly judged by history. That is \nwhy I am personally so disappointed that we were not able to achieve \nany meaningful changes to it. But this fight is not over. It has only \njust begun. In the months to come, millions of Americans will begin to \nconfront the costs and the consequences of this law. It will be the \nreason why they are now working part-time. It will be the reason why \nthey lost the insurance they used to have. It will be the reason why \nthey cannot see the doctor they have been seeing for all these years. \nIt will be the reason why their insurance premiums have gone through \nthe roof.\n  We have been warning people about this for years, and we have done \neverything we could to keep this harm from reaching our people. But now \nObamaCare is going to start hurting real people in real ways, and when \nit does this there is going to be a mad scramble in this town to fix it \nor get rid of it.\n  This has happened before. In June of 1988, Congress passed a bill \ncalled the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act. It promised new medical \nbenefits for the elderly, a cap on hospital and doctor bills, and it \nprovided prescription medicine. Then the true cost of the program began \nto reach the American people and, as seniors began to learn the true \ncost of this new program, it fueled a revolt.\n  At first, the politicians minimized it. They minimized the protests, \nand they refused to make any changes to it at all. But before long, the \nonslaught of calls and mail to congressional offices became so much it \nwas impossible to ignore. Before long, Congress was in full retreat, \nand by 1989 it was fully replaced.\n  For ObamaCare the day of reckoning is also coming. In the last few \ndays I have been startled by the number of people who have told me they \nare ready to give up. They are ready to give up on the idea that we can \nmake a difference. They are ready to give up on the idea that things \nwill ever get better. But we cannot give up on America, and we cannot \ngive up on the American dream. We cannot give up, because where are we \ngoing to go? If this country declines, if we lose what makes it \nspecial, what is going to replace it? So no matter how long it takes, \nno matter how many disappointments lie ahead, we must never give up, \nand we must never accept that this life today is the new normal.\n  For those around the world who look at the events of the last few \ndays and weeks as evidence that America's best days are behind her, you \ndon't understand our people. Our politics does not define our country. \nWe are a unique people, a collection of men and women with sharply \ndifferent views, with different backgrounds and beliefs. We share a \nfree society, and everyone has a right to express their views, to argue \nand battle and debate.\n  Sometimes our differences bring us to points of great conflict, when \nthe Nation appears on the verge of being ripped apart at the seams. Yet \nfor over 200 years we have been held together because, while we are \ndivided by many things, we are united by a powerful and timeless idea.\n\n  Before I describe that idea I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute to conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. For over 200 years we have been held together because, \nwhile we are divided by many things, we are united by a powerful and \ntimeless idea, the idea that every single person has the God-given \nright to determine the course of their own life, the God-given right to \ngo as far as our talent and our work will take us. So we argue about \nthe best way to achieve that, and we have a tendency to put off \ndifficult decisions before we absolutely have to make them.\n  But we have faced greater tests before. We have not always rushed to \nmeet the challenge, but in the end we have never failed to do so. And \nlet there be no doubt that we will do so again. The day is coming when \nour people will realize that the time has arrived once again to \nconfront the challenges before us. The day is coming when our people \nwill do what must be done to keep the American dream alive. I know it \nis hard to see right now, but we are one day closer to the moment when \nAmericans will do what we have always done. We will confront and solve \nthe challenges of our time, and we will make any sacrifice and \nundertake any task to make sure that we leave for our children what \nAmericans of yesterday left for us: The single greatest nation in the \nhistory of the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am optimistic that soon we will be able \nto enact legislation to reopen our government and affirm the world's \nlongstanding confidence in our financial stability and system of \ndemocracy. The current situation is an unfortunate byproduct of our \nsometimes discordant form of government which at this time happens to \nbe divided between our two parties.\n  Despite the challenges of recent weeks, I hope this experience \ndemonstrates to the Senate, to the other body, and to the \nadministration, that the Nation is best served when we work together. \nIf we allow our current hardships to pass, only to immediately entrench \nand get ready for the next crisis, we will be wasting an opportunity to \nextract a positive outcome from these last, difficult weeks.\n  Under the rules of the Senate, individual Senators are provided with \nsignificant power to shape the activity of this body. That is the way \nthe Senate was designed to operate, and it has served this body and the \ncountry well. Recognizing that the rights entrusted to each of us can \nbe powerful, we must be judicious in their application. We must always \nremember that each of us was elected by the people. If we work in \ncooperation, and even opposition, with a sense of realism and respect \nfor ourselves and our institution, I believe this body can function \neffectively.\n  In getting past our current fiscal stalemates, I hope that we can \nnext achieve a long-term agreement that will reduce our debt through \nstructural changes to government spending. As a part of that process, \nwe must talk seriously about the President's health care law, its \nserious flaws and its impact on families and businesses. I have \nconsistently opposed this law, and one of my goals is seeing that it is \nrepealed, delayed or made voluntary. Achieving that goal may take \nlonger than we\n\n[[Page S7522]]\n\nwould prefer because we are in the minority, but the law's declining \npopularity should give Senators from both parties reason to reevaluate \nit.\n  As part of a sustainable budget plan, I hope we can reach a long-term \nagreement on a farm bill to provide producers and consumers with \ncertainty and to preserve the security Americans enjoy by our ability \nto generate, independently, food and fiber for ourselves and for the \nworld.\n  The farm bill this body adopted earlier this year would help \naccomplish those goals and save $23 billion over the next 5 years.\n  If we can achieve a responsible budget agreement for fiscal year 2014 \nand beyond, I am confident the Appropriations Committee can produce \nbipartisan bills to fund the government in a responsible manner. I hope \nall Members have begun to recognize that our inability to act on \nindividual appropriations bills has reduced each Senator's opportunity \nto help shape Federal programs and has eliminated a principal means of \noverseeing the executive branch.\n  The Appropriations Committee has long been able to produce bills that \nreflect input from all Members, reflecting their different needs and \ntheir different priorities. The committee has continued to do so since \npassage of the Budget Control Act, which will have the effect of \ncutting--reducing spending by more than $2 trillion from discretionary \naccounts over the next 10 years. It is the only significant deficit \nreduction legislation enacted in recent memory. I supported that act, \nas did a majority of Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  Now we have given ourselves another opportunity to make broader \nbudget reforms. It will be of benefit to the legislative branch and the \npeople who elected us if we can establish a budget framework that will \nenable us to deal in a more transparent manner with all legislation, \nincluding appropriations bills and reform measures to simplify our Tax \nCode.\n  I am pleased that we seem close to resolving the current impasse, and \nI hope that over the coming weeks we can devote ourselves to thoughtful \nand productive deliberations on the budget.\n  It is important that we act to restore the confidence of the American \npeople in the Senate. We must take real steps to strengthen our \nNation's fiscal foundation so our economy can grow, and American \nfamilies and businesses can prosper.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there has been a lot of debate on the \nfloor of the Senate about ObamaCare, which is also called the \nAffordable Care Act. It passed about 3\\1/2\\ years ago. Why did we do \nthis? Why did we enact this law? It wasn't easy and it took months to \nachieve. The goal was quite simple: We wanted to make sure 40 to 50 \nmillion uninsured Americans would have a chance to have health \ninsurance.\n  That is a worthy goal because even uninsured people get sick. If you \ndon't have health insurance and get sick and show up at the hospital, \nthey will take care of you, but then when you can't pay the bill, they \ntransfer that obligation to everyone else. It is estimated we spend \nabout $1,000 a year in health insurance premiums to cover the care of \nuninsured people. Not only do these people without insurance live \nwithout the peace of mind of having protection when they get sick, the \nrest of us with health insurance pay for it. That is not right. In a \nsociety such as ours, we should accept responsibility to not only have \nhealth insurance but to make it available for everyone.\n  When we took a look at the health insurance market, here is what we \nfound. There were parts of health insurance that were just plain wrong.\n  Imagine someone in your family has a preexisting condition. It is not \nuncommon. Think of the possibilities. There are only a few that come to \nmind: asthma, diabetes, cancer survivor, women. It turned out that if \nyou had issues such as those in your background, you could be \ndiscriminated against and people would not sell you health insurance. \nObamaCare eliminated discrimination based on preexisting conditions. \nWhen the Republicans come to the floor and say they want to repeal \nObamaCare, they are repealing that protection for families who have a \nchild or a member of the family with a preexisting condition. That is \nwhat they are saying.\n  ObamaCare also said that if you have a limit on your policy of how \nmuch it will pay in any given year, that is stricken. Why would we do \nthat? Because you never know what could happen. Tomorrow morning a \ndoctor's diagnosis or an accident could result in hundreds of thousands \nof dollars of medical bills that you could pay because there was a \nlimit on your protection. That limitation was stricken by ObamaCare. \nThose who want to eliminate ObamaCare would allow the insurance \ncompanies to put those restrictions in again.\n  What about parents who have children fresh out of college and looking \nfor a job? Some of them will be lucky and will get a job with health \ncare benefits. Some won't be so lucky. They may get a job without any \nbenefits or they may not get a job. With ObamaCare, we kept those \nkids--your sons and daughters--on your family health insurance plan up \nto age 26. Those who want to eliminate ObamaCare want to eliminate that \nopportunity for American families to give their kids health care \nprotection while they are looking for a job.\n  We also basically said that senior citizens under Medicare should not \npay out of pocket over $1,000 a year for their prescription drugs. We \nclosed the so-called doughnut hole. Eventually they will not be paying \nout-of-pocket. We are reducing the financial obligation of seniors to \nreach into savings accounts for the medicine they need to stay strong, \nhealthy, and independent.\n  Those who want to abolish ObamaCare--and we heard it a minute or two \nago from the Senator from Florida on the Republican side of the aisle, \nas well as the junior Senator from Texas--are basically saying to \nseniors: Pay more out of pocket for prescription drugs.\n  I don't think that is right.\n  What we are offering with insurance exchanges across America now in \n50 States is the same opportunity for uninsured people that Members of \nCongress have today. Members of Congress are under the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program, which covers 8 million Federal \nemployees and their families. That means we have an open enrollment \nperiod every year, and we can choose--my wife and I--from nine \ndifferent policies in the State of Illinois. We take the one we want, \nand we have good coverage. It is not the most expensive or the best, \nbut it is good coverage. We get to shop. It is hard for many Members of \nCongress to remember or believe that most Americans never have that \nluxury. They can't shop for health insurance. Some of them are denied \nany health insurance. Some work for an employer who says ``take it or \nleave it,'' and some just can't afford to buy anything. The insurance \nexchanges offer the opportunity for the 40 to 50 million uninsured and \nthose buying in the private insurance market to go shopping for the \nbest policy for themselves and their families.\n  Competition and shopping in a marketplace is what Americans are \nlooking for, and that is what the Republicans want to close down. They \nwant to close that down. Some would say: Obviously, there is a \nRepublican plan for health insurance. The Republican plan for health \ninsurance--this blank piece of paper. They have no plan. They have no \nideas. They are just opposed to ObamaCare, and that is why they \ninitially shut down this government. They wanted to defund ObamaCare.\n  Two interesting things happened after they made that announcement:\n  The marketplaces came online and ran into serious problems. They are \ncurrently restructuring them because they were not prepared for the \noverwhelming response to these insurance marketplaces. I am sorry they \nweren't. I don't know who is responsible for it, but we need to know. \nIn the meantime, we have the insurance marketplaces up and running.\n  The second thing that happened as the marketplaces went online--after \nthe Republicans announced they wanted to defund ObamaCare and therefore\n\n[[Page S7523]]\n\nshut down the government--was the popularity of ObamaCare increased. \nPeople across America said: Finally. This is a good idea. Those of us \nwho have access to the marketplace can finally go shopping for health \ninsurance.\n  Exactly the opposite of what the Republicans thought would happen \nhappened. The American people are open and more receptive to the idea \nof going to these marketplaces if they don't have health insurance or \nif they have health insurance they can't afford. The health insurance \nmarketplace is open for business, and people across the Nation have \nstarted shopping for it. Many people have waited for years, even \ndecades.\n\n  I came to the floor when the junior Senator from Texas was holding \nthe floor for 21 hours and asked him to consider the case of a young--I \ncall her young--lady I met in Illinois named Judy. She is a housekeeper \nin a motel that I stay in in southern Illinois. She is in her early \nsixties, worked every day of her life, never had health insurance not \neven for one day of her life, and she now has diabetes and she is \nworried. We got some local doctors to see her and give her some \nrecommendations and try to help her, but she has never had health \ninsurance.\n  I asked Senator Cruz from Texas: What are we going to do with Judy? \nIf she doesn't have this marketplace where she can go for health \ninsurance for the first time in her life, what is going to happen to \nher?\n  He said to me: She needs to get a better job.\n  Well, it is easy for us to say that, but this poor woman has worked \nhard all of her life. There is not a lazy bone in her body. She is \ndoing the very best she can. Senators ought to realize that some \npeople--even working as hard as they can--cannot get health insurance \nunless ObamaCare goes through.\n  Sixteen States and the District of Columbia have created their own \nexchanges. Those State-operated exchanges have opened fairly smoothly.\n  California had 7,700 applications for health insurance on the first \nday.\n  Kentucky is a great success story for ObamaCare. More than 5,000 \npeople or families enrolled for health care and there were 10,000 \ncompleted applications on the first day. I understand that the number \nof people who have now enrolled for health care is closer to 10,000. \nThink about that. There are 10,000 families in the State of Kentucky \nwho now have a chance to get health care. Those who want to defund it \nand close it down are closing down their opportunity to have protection \nfor their families.\n  New Mexico is partnering with the Federal Government for individual \nand family coverage, but it is operating the shop exchange, which \nallows small businesses to find group coverage for their employees. In \nthe first couple of days, 428 different employers in New Mexico signed \nup for coverage. They got a better deal in the competitive marketplace \nthan they could find in the private sector beforehand. Republicans want \nto shut down that opportunity for these businesses. It doesn't make \nsense.\n  The Federal Government is managing the marketplace in 34 States, \nincluding my home State of Illinois. By Friday of last week there had \nbeen 8.6 million unique visitors to the Federal exchange Web sites.\n  What we are finding across America is that people have been waiting \nfor this chance. I met a lawyer who contacted the insurance exchanges \nand found that for his business--a small business--it cut the premiums \nthey are going to pay annually by one-third. Six out of every ten \npeople who sign up for health insurance under the ObamaCare insurance \nexchanges will pay less than $100 a month in premiums. For less than \nwhat many of them are paying for cable TV, they will have health \ninsurance coverage they can afford.\n  When the other side starts talking about closing down ObamaCare and \ncan't come up with any replacement whatsoever, I think we ought to stop \nand ask whether that is in the best interest of a better America. If \nyou or someone in your family has ever lived with a serious illness and \nno health insurance, you will never, ever forget it. I have been there. \nYou will never, ever forget it. We ought to offer every American family \na chance to get affordable, quality health insurance for the first time \nin their lives.\n  The second issue, which relates to this and which I find hard to \nbelieve, after trying to defund ObamaCare by closing down the \ngovernment, they started on a new approach. Senator Vitter of Louisiana \nhad an amendment that would restrict--at least in terms of costs--the \navailability of health insurance for some Federal employees who work \nhere on Capitol Hill and Members of Congress. I think that is totally \nunfair, and it troubles me that the Republicans have gone from \ndefunding ObamaCare to defunding the health insurance of their own \nstaff employees. These are hard-working people in my office, and I bet \nthey are hard-working in every Senate and House office. They stay late, \nanswer the phones, and try to help people who are struggling with \nredtape. When a family is facing difficulties and can't afford a \nlawyer, our people try to help them out with government agencies as \nbest they can. They answer the mail, they answer the phones, and they \nanswer emails. The notion that we are going to limit or restrict their \nhealth insurance is absolutely unacceptable and unfair. These people \ndeserve good health insurance just as every American does.\n  When Senator Vitter comes to the floor with his amendment which would \ndramatically increase the cost of their health insurance, it is \nfundamentally unfair. It is mean. It is small. It is beneath our \ndignity. We ought to stand behind our employees whom we hire to \nrepresent us across the United States of America. If we do, we will \ndefeat this Vitter amendment if it ever comes back for consideration.\n  ObamaCare has started--and there have been some bumps in the road, \nthat is for sure--and now that we have these marketplaces open, people \nare going to see what opportunities are available to them. As most \npeople know, Members of Congress and many of their staff members are \ngoing to be covered with the same insurance, as everyone is buying in \nthe insurance marketplace. Not all congressional staff members are \ninvolved, but many will be. Members of Congress will all be directed to \nthe insurance exchange if that is what they choose to buy for their \nfamilies. I am prepared to do just that. I think it will be quality \nhealth insurance, which is what every American deserves.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Durbin, the \nassistant majority leader, for his speech. One of the privileges of \nthis job, as the Senator from Connecticut knows, is the learning \nexperience, if you will, of sitting in the Presiding Officer's chair \nand listening to Senators speak. We hear a whole range of talks, a \nwhole range of discussions, from a whole range of talents in this body. \nSometimes we hear Senators with great charisma delivering very \nimpressive political speeches and appealing to patriotism, and other \ntimes we hear Senators who just focus on the substance and the \nimportance of an issue, bringing us down to Earth about what really \nmatters. The speech of Senator Durbin was exactly that regarding what \nthis health care law means.\n  We can talk about repealing ObamaCare, and that sounds good to some \ncrowds back home. But think of the tens of millions of Americans who \nwill now have health insurance in Connecticut and in Ohio and Illinois \nand all over this country, through Medicaid, through joining the \nexchanges--so many of them have full-time jobs and have never had \ninsurance.\n  I spoke to a woman in Youngstown who was speaking at a townhall \nmeeting. She said, I am 63 years old, I work two jobs, I have never had \ninsurance. This was before we passed ObamaCare. She said, I just want \nto stay alive for the next year and a half so I can be on Medicare and \nhave insurance. Imagine that a person's goal in life is to stay alive \nso they can have health insurance.\n  This new law, as it is beginning to take effect, as people started \nsigning up 3 weeks ago, means people such as the woman in Youngstown \nwill have insurance--maybe Medicaid or maybe exchanges or some \nfinancial assistance. It may mean the $7,000 tax that Senator Durbin \ntalked about, the $7,000 that all of us pay as a result of those who go \nto a hospital and can't afford to\n\n[[Page S7524]]\n\npay, get treatment, get care, and somebody has to pay for it and it is \nspread around to those with insurance.\n  It means in my State about 100,000 people who are in their late teens \nand twenties are now able to sign on to their parents' health plan. It \nmeans close to a million seniors in Ohio have already gotten preventive \ncare such as osteoporosis testing, diabetes, whatever preventive \ntreatment, with no costs, no copays, no deductibles. It means all of \nthat. It means more of our premium dollars will go to health care, not \nto executive salaries, not to marketing, not to insurance company \nprofits. All of that is good news.\n  While it may not sound as exciting as speaking to a Lincoln Day \ndinner or people at a political rally holding Confederate flags, we do \nknow what it is going to mean to millions of Americans who may not be \ngoing to those rallies but who have worked hard all of their lives and \nare rewarded for it.\n  I wish to make a couple of comments about how important the news is \ntoday that we can finally reopen the government. America is going to \nhonor its debts and pay its bills as we have every day, every week, \nevery month, every year for more than two centuries. We are finally \ngoing to do the right thing, and that is good news to people from \nGallipolis to Chillicothe to Toledo and all over my State.\n  It means that after this vote is done this evening in the Senate, and \nI hope later in the House of Representatives, the President will sign \nthis law to pay our bills and reopen the government.\n  It means we need to focus on what matters in this country. What \nmatters in this country is jobs, and that means investing in \ninfrastructure, whether that infrastructure is Sinclair Community \nCollege in Dayton or Owens Community College in Toledo, or whether that \ninfrastructure is a water and sewer system in Napoleon or Bowling \nGreen, or whether that infrastructure is a health care clinic in \nZanesville, or a whole host of things that matter long term to the \nfuture of this country.\n  I was speaking to Senator Coons from Delaware earlier today about the \nimportance of manufacturing. We are working with a number of our \ncolleagues on bipartisan legislation which focuses on manufacturing and \ninfrastructure. Twenty years ago, thirty years ago in this country--\nthese numbers are not precise but estimated--about 25 percent of our \nGDP was manufacturing. Manufacturing was about 25 percent of our GDP. \nFinancial services was less than 15 percent of our GDP. That has \nreversed in this country.\n  We know what it means to cities such as Springfield and Mansfield and \nLima in my State where manufacturing jobs have shut down far too often \nand those jobs have gone overseas. We still give tax breaks in this \ncountry, believe it or not, to companies that outsource, that shut down \nand move overseas. So a company that shuts down in Ravenna or shuts \ndown in Portsmouth and moves to China gets tax incentives to do that. \nThat has to stop. We have to work on that.\n  We can support a whole host of legislation I have been working on \nwith Senators Blunt and Collins and Graham and Sessions and Burr to \ndeal with the issue of the Chinese gaming the currency system. That \nwill mean literally hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country that \ncan return or that will not be lost because they are gaming the \ncurrency system.\n  On job training, the so-called SECTORS Act will match up skills \nlocally determined by workforce investment boards and community \ncolleges and local businesses and local labor unions with the needs of \nthose businesses--match up the job skills with the needs of those \nbusinesses.\n  Last, with Senator Blunt, I am working on a national network \nmanufacturing proposal that will help companies and universities and \ntechnology come together in a way that can spur industries regionally \nin this country. We know that, for instance, glass in Toledo--the fact \nthat Toledo has been, for decades, a major glass manufacturing center--\nnot just providing a lot of jobs in a variety of different kinds of \nglass, including everything from plate glass to windshields to drinking \nglasses, but it also evolved into the job-creating industry of solar \npanels. We know how that can work. This will be a partnership between \nSenator Blunt and myself and others, as well as with the \nadministration, on how, in fact, we can help with manufacturing and \ncontinue to lead the world the way we have for the lifetime of myself \nas well as the lifetime of the Presiding Officer.\n  We know what we have to do today to pay our bills and reopen the \ngovernment. We know what we need to do in the weeks and months ahead. I \nlook forward to working on those issues with my colleagues.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, since the government shut down about 16 \ndays ago, I have been coming to the floor of the Senate to express my \nchagrin at this manufactured crisis. Then, of course, the second \nmanufactured crisis, the crisis of perhaps doing the unthinkable: a \ndefault, where we would become a nation that did not pay our bills for \nthe first time in our history. I think history is going to analyze this \nperiod of time in our Nation's governance and will not look fondly upon \nwhat has happened here.\n  Just this morning, I held a press conference, as I am chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, to talk about what is happening \nacross the country in this shutdown--superfund sites, more than 500 not \nbeing cleaned up. We had businesspeople there, small businesspeople who \nhave their businesses near wildlife refuges. This is the season where \npeople go hunting and fishing and spend their dollars to help support \nthe tourist industry in our great Nation. In many States tourism is No. \n1, 2, or 3. In my State, California, it is the No. 3 industry. So when \na park closes down or the Army Corps recreation land closes down or the \nrefuges close down, this is not just sad because that is not the right \nthing to do for the environment, it is sad because many people rely on \nthose beautiful areas being open to the public.\n  We need to keep the doors of the government open to the people. This \nis a government of, by, and for the people. Our government should never \nbe closed. That does not mean we are going to agree on every law or \nevery regulation or every single thing that happens in government. We \nare always going to have disagreements.\n  I have said here quite often, I have served with five Presidents--\nthree Republican Presidents, two Democratic Presidents. I am a \nDemocrat, and there were many times I did not agree with my President, \nwhether he was a Republican or a Democrat. But I knew there were ways \nto win the day. You have to stick to your principles and fight the \nbattles and do everything you can to win the moment, to change the law, \nto change the way a law is enforced, to write a new law, to repeal an \nold law, but you do it within the framework of governance, not within \nthe framework of chaos. There is never a reason--never a reason--to \nthreaten to close the government. There is never a reason to threaten \nto default on our debt.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article that just hit \nnow from Business Insider be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From Business Insider, Oct. 16, 2013]\n\n        S: The Shutdown Took $24 Billion Out of the US Economy\n\n                          (By Steven Perlberg)\n\n       The S has cut the annualized U.S. growth view closer to \n     2% from 3%, Bloomberg is reporting. The ratings agency--which \n     recognizes the Senate deal will be approved--says that the \n     shutdown has taken $24 billion out of the economy and cut \n     0.6% off of yearly fourth quarter GDP growth.\n       ``If people are afraid that the government policy \n     brinkmanship will resurface again, and with it the risk of \n     another shutdown or worse, they'll remain afraid to open up \n     their checkbooks. That points to another Humbug holiday \n     season,'' S wrote in a release.\n       They also said the impact of the debt ceiling is getting \n     worse by the day for the U.S. economy.\n       Here's the full release:\n       New York (Standard & Poor's) Oct. 16, 2013.--The U.S. \n     government has been shut down for more than two weeks. \n     Earlier today, Senate leadership crafted an agreement to end \n     the shutdown and avert a debt\n\n[[Page S7525]]\n\n     default. However, the deal needs to be voted on by both \n     chambers of Congress.\n       We believe that to date, the shutdown has shaved at least \n     0.6% off of annualized fourth-quarter 2013 GDP growth, or \n     taken $24 billion out of the economy. However, the closer we \n     get to breaching the debt ceiling, the higher we expect the \n     economic impact to be.\n       In the summer of 2011, as we approached the last debt \n     ceiling standoff, consumer confidence plummeted and hit a 31-\n     year low in August when the debt ceiling issue came to a \n     head. Given that this round of debt-ceiling negotiations is \n     occurring after two-plus weeks of a government shutdown, the \n     total impact on the economy will likely be even more severe.\n       While we believe the Senate deal will be passed and the \n     debt ceiling will be raised, the impact of a default by the \n     U.S. government on its debts would be devastating for markets \n     and the economy and worse than the collapse of Lehman \n     Brothers in 2008.\n       Should a default occur, the resulting sudden, unplanned \n     contraction of current spending could see government spending \n     cut by about 4% of annualized GDP. That would put the economy \n     in a recession and wipeout much of the economic progress made \n     by the recovery from the Great Recession.\n       As we've said, we expect the Senate deal to be approved. \n     However, the current chatter coming out of Washington \n     suggests that any continuing resolution will be a temporary \n     one, with an early 2014 timeframe for the next set of \n     Washington deadlines. The short turnaround for politicians to \n     negotiate some sort of lasting deal will likely weigh on \n     consumer confidence, especially among government workers that \n     were furloughed. If people are afraid that the government \n     policy brinkmanship will resurface again, and with it the \n     risk of another shutdown or worse, they'll remain afraid to \n     open up their checkbooks. That points to another Humbug \n     holiday season.\n       The bottom line is the government shutdown has hurt the \n     U.S. economy. In September, we expected 3% annualized growth \n     in the fourth quarter because we thought politicians would \n     have learned from 2011 and taken steps to avoid things like a \n     government shutdown and the possibility of a sovereign \n     default. Since our forecast didn't hold, we now have to lower \n     our fourth-quarter growth estimate to closer to 2%.\n       Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, part of McGraw Hill \n     Financial (NYSE: MHFI), is the world's leading provider of \n     independent credit risk research and benchmarks.

Here is what has happened because of this 16-day \nshutdown. Here is what has happened because that shutdown was paired \nwith a flirtation with a default.\n\n       The S has cut the annualized U.S. growth view closer to \n     2% from 3%. . . .\n\n  That is a percentage point off growth. This is what Bloomberg is \nreporting.\n\n       The ratings agency--which recognizes the Senate deal will \n     be approved--\n\n  So this is after they recognize the deal will be approved. And thank \nGod it looks as though it will be.\n\n       says that the shutdown has taken--\n\n  Mr. President, hear this:\n\n       $24 billion out of the economy and cut 0.6% off of yearly \n     fourth quarter GDP growth.\n\n  This is what is so important, and I hope everyone within the sound of \nmy voice hears this:\n\n       ``If people are afraid that the government policy \n     brinksmanship will resurface again, and with it the risk of \n     another shutdown or worse, they'll--\n\n  The people will--\n\n     remain afraid to open up their checkbooks. That points to \n     another Humbug holiday season,'' S wrote in a release.\n       They also said the impact of the debt ceiling is getting \n     worse by the day for the U.S. economy.\n\n  There is a full release, and I have put that in the Record.\n  To speak in layman's terms, what the economists are saying is this \nshutdown and this flirtation with a default has taken a huge bite out \nof our economy--a huge bite. Why did we face it? Because some folks do \nnot like the health care reform act.\n  It is their total right not to like it. It is their total right not \nto love it. It is their total right to try and change it. That is all \ntheir total right. But you cannot shut down the government and stamp \nyour feet and say: Because I don't like this and I don't like who is \nPresident, I am shutting down the government.\n  Now here is the good news--and it is good news: Bipartisanship here \nin the Senate is leading America out of this painful, partisan, self-\ninflicted crisis. As someone from the largest State in the Union, I can \ntell you, relief does not even begin to describe how I feel. I am also \ngrateful--grateful--to the two leaders who came together, the \nDemocratic leader and the Republican leader of the Senate, both who \nhave had many disagreements and will continue to in the future about \nthe proper road ahead, but when history called them, they were there. \nThey were able to set aside their differences and reach an agreement to \nopen up this government, to pay our bills, and to set out a path to \nnegotiation on all those differences that we know we have between the \ntwo parties--very legitimate differences.\n  I think what we learned, as we read the S comments here, is that \nthis has to end, this brinkmanship has to end. We have to say as \nAmericans: You do not have to shut the government down. You do not have \nto threaten to default. That is not the way we should proceed. It is \ntoo painful for this Nation. It is too costly. Mr. President, $24 \nbillion--that is what S puts on it. That is what is taken out of the \neconomy. That does not even include what it costs us as a Federal \nGovernment to shut down, to reopen, to start again. But bipartisanship \nhere in the Senate is leading the way forward.\n  We always are told: If you do not know history, you are doomed to \nrepeat it. That is the reason why I have tried--and many others have \non, frankly, both sides--to come down here and talk about the mess we \nhave been in.\n  I would like to say if you are walking down the street and it is a \npretty nice day, and you feel good, and the Sun is a little bit behind \nthe clouds but looks as if it is going to come out, you have a few \nproblems at work you have to work on, you have a couple of kids you are \nworried about, you are thinking about how you are going to go on that \nnext vacation, but you feel pretty good and optimistic--you have \nproblems but everything is manageable--why would you hit yourself in \nthe head with a brick at that very moment? That is really what this \nself-inflicted wound on our Nation has been about.\n  Yes, we have our problems. Yes, we are coming out of the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression. Yes, we have to deal with \ndeficits, debts, with education, with the environment, with climate \nchange. We can go on and on. Yes, America has its issues. Of course, we \nhave. But we do not need self-inflicted wounds. We have enough issues \nthat are critical, including world peace and Iran's nuclear ambitions \nand Syria's chemical weapons. I serve on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. Everything has taken a back seat to this situation.\n  Now I am very happy. I learned that the House is planning--assuming \nthis all goes well tonight and everybody votes to open up this \ngovernment and pay our bills--that the House is going to take up the \nWater Resources Development Act next week. That is a bill that passed \nhere by more than 80 votes. It is critical. It addresses flood control. \nIt addresses dredging of our ports. It has a recreation piece. It has a \nlot of important policy in it to help move our Nation forward. Most \nimportant, 500,000 jobs depend on our passing WRDA.\n  So from what I have read, that WRDA bill is going to come forward, \nand I am very pleased. Then we will take our bills to conference. That \nis the way we do things here.\n  We resolve our differences in a conference. I feel Chairman Shuster \nand I can do that with our colleagues. We will have a vote on something \nthat creates jobs and moves us forward. In the meantime, we have been \nmired for 2 weeks in a government shutdown and a frightening inching up \nto the default date. It has taken the wind out of our sails, the winds \nout of America's sails. It has taken our energy. All of us are very, \nshall I say, we are still even a little anxious until this is done.\n  It has been a couple of weeks of anxiety, of great difficulty. Here \nwe are. What about the people out there who have suffered, who have \nworked without a paycheck--worked without a paycheck--policemen, \nfiremen, all of our workers still working without paychecks.\n  We are on the verge of correcting that in moments. I can only say I \nam very thankful to our two leaders. I am very thankful to the \nbipartisan team. I do not want to start naming names because I am \nfearful I will forget some.\n\n[[Page S7526]]\n\nBut I know Senator McCain was part of it, Senator Collins, Senator \nDonnelly, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Heitkamp. I know I am leaving \npeople out which I did not want to do. I think Senator Johanns was part \nof the team, Senator Flake, Senator Manchin, Senator Shaheen, Senator \nKirk. I am ever so grateful. I just thought of Senators Ayotte and \nMurkowski. I think that may cover it--Senator King--doing this by \nmemory. They got together when things looked grim. They said the Senate \nis going to lead. I am so grateful to them because even as things \nfaltered, they were still at it, still working.\n  Senator Pryor was part of that group. They did not give up. To me, \nthat is so important. We need to talk to each other. We need to work \ntogether. How did we get 80-some votes for a WRDA bill? It was \nbipartisan. How did we get all of those votes we had last time for the \nhighway bill? It was bipartisan. We worked hard. As chairman of that \nEPW Committee, the things we get done are all bipartisan.\n  When we get into our corners it is not good. When we try to use as \nleverage the very government itself or the debt ceiling itself, it does \nnot work. In closing, I am going to say again what this article says \nfrom S:\n\n       If people are afraid that the government policy \n     brinkmanship will resurface again, and with it the risk of \n     another shut down or worse, they'll remain afraid to open up \n     their checkbooks. That points to another Humbug holiday \n     season.\n\n  Meaning the Christmas season, which is so critical to our economy. We \nneed to learn from this sad history of the last few weeks; that, yes, \nwe will have our disagreements. That is the greatness of our Nation; \nthat we do have the freedom of thought, we do have different political \nparties, we do have different ways of looking at issues. It is fine, \nbut do not ever shut down the government, do not ever play games with \nthe full faith and credit of America. Let's get to the negotiating \ntable and we will be just fine. We will work out those differences.\n  The last thought is elections have consequences. This is where we \nbattle it out. In the next one we are going to battle this out. That is \nimportant. We never said it would be smooth sailing, but we have to \nkeep the government open and we have to pay our bills. I hope that is \nwhat we learned.\n  I am looking forward to the next hour and a half or so. Maybe we will \nbe voting a little sooner. I thank the Presiding Officer for his \nleadership in all of this darkness of time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Sometimes in the Senate we deal with numbers that are a \nlittle too big for constituents and even for us to fathom. One number \nwe throw around in Connecticut is the number $50 billion. That is the \namount of money we need over the next 20 years to make the necessary \nimprovements along our rail line in order to keep it in a good state of \nrepair, never mind to do the expansions we so badly need to get our \neconomy back and running in Connecticut. It is only basically to do all \nof the repair work that we need to keep trains running safely from \nBoston to Washington, DC. We need $50 billion to get that done.\n  I give you that number because what we have learned today is that S \nestimates that the cost of this 2-week shutdown to the U.S. Government \nis $24 billion, half of what the northeastern States need to maintain \nin state of good repair the most important rail line to the Nation for \nthe next decade.\n  In 2 weeks we lost $24 billion to this economy. This is the same \namount of money that it took to do the Big Dig in Boston and half the \nmoney that we need to do important improvements along the longest, \nbiggest, most important stretch of rail line in this country--for \nnothing, for absolutely nothing.\n  We are hopefully going to consent on a path forward shortly that will \nallow us to vote on a bill that essentially represents the same offer \nthat has been on the table to both Republicans and Democrats for 2 \nweeks. This is to reopen the government and to operate until January of \nnext year and to extend the debt ceiling until February of next year.\n  Of course, the cost is not only in the short-term, not only about all \nof that money we lost, but $2 billion of that was lost money to the \nTreasury of the United States. It is also what we lose every single day \nthat we continue forward on this theory that it is somehow best to run \nthis country by manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis.\n  As the chairman of the European Affairs Subcommittee of the Committee \non Foreign Relations, I have been able to hear on a daily and weekly \nbasis European impressions of this country from the outside. They look \nat this Nation with envy because they see the demographic trends which \nallow this country to stay relatively young compared to the rest of the \nworld. They see relative economic growth compared to countries in \nEurope and throughout the industrialized world. They see us on a \npathway to energy independence, whereby we are not going to be reliant \non oil from the Middle East. We will be able to produce, whether it \nwill be gas or renewables, at home.\n  They look at our country with wonder because they see all of these \ntrend lines running in favor of the United States, essentially \nleapfrogging, catapulting the rest of the world with respect to the \nglobal recovery. The only thing stopping us from that inevitability, \nthat global economic rebirth for the United States, is government by \ncrisis.\n  Mark Zandi came to the Joint Economic Committee. He is a bipartisan \neconomist. He has advised Senator McCain and criticized both parties. \nHe says the same thing. He says the only thing stopping a robust \nrecovery in this Nation is the fact that we essentially write budgets \nand extend debt ceilings for 2, 3, 4 months at a time.\n  I come to the floor because my only hope, my only vision of a paper-\nthin silver lining to this fiasco over the past 2 weeks is that the \nAmerican public has just said definitively that they don't want this to \nbe the way the government runs any longer. If there is one message to \nthis handful of conservatives, mostly in the House of Representatives \nbut a few in the Senate that have caused this shutdown, the message is \nvery simple. They are not going to be able to advance their ideological \naims--in this case trying to end, repeal or delay the health care \nbill--by shutting down the government and threatening default on \nAmerican debt.\n  President Obama and our majority leader had to draw a line. They had \nto draw a line because that is what the American public was demanding, \nthat we put an end to this governance by crisis. If there is a silver \nlining, it is hopefully--even though we are only extending the \ncontinuing resolution and the debt ceiling for a matter of months--that \nwe won't go through this catastrophe again because the American public \nhas said enough is enough.\n  They know what we should know in the Senate. There is enormous room \nfor compromise moving forward.\n  Today a group of Senators held a meeting on delivery system reform. \nThere were 18 Senators who came to this meeting to hear a presentation \nby the Bipartisan Policy Center on a bipartisan proposal to save over \n$500 billion to the U.S. Treasury simply by reordering the rules of how \nwe run Medicare, not by trimming benefits, not by requiring more in \ntaxes, simply by reordering the way we pay for health care. It was a \nproposal backed by everyone from Bill Frist to Tom Daschle, and it \nsuggests there is so much room for agreement between Republicans and \nDemocrats if we just decide to set policy for years rather than for \nmonths.\n\n  I know we walk away from this with a sense of both outrage and \nhopefulness that we can maybe figure out a way to come together. \nAlthough this is my first year in the Senate, I have been in this place \nfor 6 years, between the House and this body--but this feels like \n``Groundhog Day'' in the sense that every time we find our way through \none of these crises, we all say to each other: This is the last time. \nWe all lock arms and say: Isn't it great that we found bipartisan \nagreement, and now we can use this momentum moving forward to avoid \nthis kind of crisis in the\n\n[[Page S7527]]\n\nfuture. I have seen this play before. It seems within days or weeks we \njust fall back to our old habits of digging trenches and fighting each \nother more than we talk to each other and again governing by crisis.\n  I think this time is different, just because the depth of the \ndysfunction was different than ever before, the cries of the American \npublic were greater than ever before. But we should remember, as this \nreport from the Bipartisan Policy Center on delivery system reform \ntells us, there is still enormous room for the two parties to set out \ngoals we agree on. If we push aside the most strident extremist voices \nthat largely come from the tea party caucus of the House of \nRepresentatives, there is so much we can do.\n  As my European friends remind me on an almost daily basis, the only \nfactor stopping the American economy from powering forward and becoming \nonce again a giant of manufacturing, of global financial services, and \nof innovation--the only thing stopping us from that leapfrog forward--\nis figuring out that governance by crisis holds us back.\n  We made the promise to each other before that when we get through one \nof these crises it will be our last. I commend our leaders--I commend \nLeader Reid and Senator Murray--for setting up a process for the rest \nof this year where we can come to some resolution on a budget that sets \npolicy for years rather than for months. This time, though, the promise \nwe have made to each other has to stick. It is the only way forward for \nthis place, and it is the only way forward for an economy that is just \nwaiting to be unshackled and to conquer the world again.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, here we are again: Another unnecessary \ncrisis; a proposal that maintains the status quo; very little time to \nread and evaluate the bill. In fact, we still don't have a final \nversion of the text. No time to explain it to our constituents.\n  This is Washington at its worst. It is exactly the kind of thing the \nAmerican people are fed up with and exactly why several colleagues and \nI began this effort to delay and defund ObamaCare back in July.\n  It appears this particular fight will end much the same way ObamaCare \nbegan: in a last-minute deal, negotiated in back rooms, then forced on \nCongress and on the American people.\n  The Washington establishment can't bring itself to believe this is \nwhy Congress's approval rating is so low--because Washington doesn't \nlisten to the American people. It ignores them. And when the American \npeople can no longer be ignored, the administration shuts down national \nparks, blocks veterans from going to their own memorials, uses the IRS \nto target certain groups, and holds hostage critical funding for cancer \nresearch, low-income women and children, veterans' health benefits, \nborder security, and our National Guard. It is shameful how Washington \ntreats the American people, and the people are right to be upset about \nit.\n  The media keeps asking, was it worth it? My answer is it is always \nworth it to do the right thing. Fighting against an abusive government \nin defense of protecting the individual rights and freedoms of the \nAmerican people is always the right thing.\n  Some say we shouldn't have fought because we couldn't win. But this \ncountry wasn't built by fighting only when victory was absolutely \ncertain. In fact, some of the most important victories in our history \nwere the result of fighting battles against significant odds. And even \nif victory seemed difficult or impossible, that wouldn't excuse me or \nanyone else from doing the right thing. Avoiding difficult battles, \nafter all, is how we ended up in this kind of mess--a government with \n$17 trillion in debt which we add to at a rate close to $1 trillion a \nyear, out-of-control spending, a broken entitlement system, a Tax Code \nno one understands--all because Washington is willing to act only when \nthere is guaranteed political gain. When the avoidance of political \nrisk becomes our dominant motivation, only the Washington establishment \nwins the American people lose.\n  Furthermore, in Washington, victories are rarely immediate and very \nfew end up being permanent. ObamaCare wasn't enacted overnight and it \nwon't be repealed overnight. We must remind the American people of the \nharmful effects of this law at every opportunity if we are ever going \nto see it repealed. We have repeatedly warned the American people will \nbe shocked when they realize the way the President has misled the \nAmerican people about ObamaCare.\n  The embarrassing rollout of the exchanges doesn't even begin to \nscratch the surface. Every day brings a new story of a family whose \ndeductible has doubled or a married couple who can't keep the plan they \nhave or a business that can no longer provide health insurance for its \nemployees or workers who are seeing their hours cut or losing their \njobs altogether.\n  The realization that the administration has either been dishonest or \nincompetent--or perhaps a combination of both--is just starting to dawn \non the American people. Even the President's friends in the media are \nwatching this slow-rolling train wreck and are demanding the President \ndo something to stop it. The Chicago Tribune, the President's own \nhometown newspaper, puts it this way:\n\n       Last spring, President Barack Obama said, ``there will \n     still be, you know, glitches and bumps'' in the rollout of \n     the new system. But what we're seeing now is no glitch or \n     bump. There is a growing mountain of evidence that Obamacare \n     has fundamental problems in design and implementation.\n\n  The Tribune goes on to say:\n\n       We encouraged a one-year delay in the law. We recognize \n     that's not going to happen. Obamacare is here. It's time, \n     though, for the Obama administration to level with Americans \n     about what's happening here. It's time to stop blaming \n     Republicans and start talking about what needs to change.\n\n  So it is interesting to see that the Chicago Tribune, the President's \nown hometown paper, is calling to a significant degree for exactly what \nI have been calling for since July--for a 1-year halt, a 1-year delay, \na 1-year timeout to protect the American people from the harmful \neffects of this law, a law the President himself has acknowledged isn't \nready for prime time, a law the President himself has indicated he is \nnot willing to follow as was written. Incidentally, this again was \nexactly what we were arguing for all the way back in July and it now \nappears that the President's hometown paper was with us.\n  Almost everyone but the President seems to recognize this law is \ngoing to be terrible for the American people. It is costing jobs. It is \nhurting families. It is making people's health care situation worse, \nand it won't solve the problems in our broken health care system. And \nlet me be clear. There will be very real consequences for people in \nboth parties as a result of the implementation of this law.\n  Today Washington has the upper hand, but the American people will \nalways have the last word. This is not over. We have an obligation to \nfight for the American people, and I do not intend to let the American \npeople down.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to describe \nthe damaging impacts that the Federal Government shutdown is having on \nthe nine treaty tribes in my home State of South Dakota and across \nIndian Country. It is my hope that today we can come to solution to \nthis crisis, but I think it is important for my colleagues to \nunderstand the impact the shutdown has had so that we can avoid making \nthe same mistakes in the future.\n  Across the Nation, the Federal Government shutdown is imposing \nnumerous hardships for our citizens, tribal nations, and low-income \nindividuals. Some of the poorest counties in the United States are \nlocated within South Dakota reservation borders. Federal assistance \npayments to the poorest of the poor have been halted for these tribal \nmembers needing aid to feed their families and heat their homes.\n  Any negative changes to Native American program funding will have \nwidespread effects. As the House Republicans continue to prevent the \nFederal Government from opening, doors will continue to be shut for \nthose needing the most help.\n\n[[Page S7528]]\n\n  Last week, I met with President Bryan Brewer of the Oglala Sioux \nTribe, located on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Federal and tribal \nemployees living on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, where the \ngeneral unemployment rate is already at 80 percent, are being \nfurloughed or have had their work hours cut in half. This funding lapse \nalmost forced the tribe's Department of Corrections to close, allowing \nprisoners to be freed. The tribe was given approval to use alternate \nfunding sources; however, they do not know if those funding sources \nwill be replenished when the shutdown ends.\n  Yesterday, the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation was also forced to close \nthe Emergency Youth Shelter Program that provides a temporary home for \n30 tribal youth due to the lapse of Federal funding. The tribe is \nactively looking for alternate bed space.\n  I recently heard of a story of a single parent on the Lake Traverse \nReservation. The mother recently lost her 3-month-old child and was in \nneed of aid to provide a proper funeral for her child. The Bureau of \nIndian Affairs provides burial assistance to eligible tribal members; \nhowever, due to the shutdown, the Bureau had to turn away the young \ngrieving mother.\n  Last week, I took to the floor to speak on the significant impact a \nsnow storm had on South Dakota communities. The snowstorm has also \nserved a blow to tribal communities. Chad Morgan, a young Cheyenne \nRiver Sioux Tribal rancher, lost 90 percent of his cattle herd and is \nnot able to report the his loss to the Farm Service Agency. Tribes also \nhave spent significant funding to clear roadways of snow for tribal \nmembers needing dialysis treatment.\n  The Rosebud Sioux Tribe also reported to me that the Low Income Heat \nand Energy Assistance Program has been put on hold. Nearly 75 percent \nof Rosebud Sioux tribal families rely on this vital funding to heat \ntheir homes, especially now that winter snows have started.\n  Our tribes are facing major setbacks and are forced to find ways to \nfund programs that have already seen drawbacks due to the budget \nsequestration cuts.\n  Tribal communities cannot afford to have the Federal Government \nshutdown continue. Asking tribes to rob Peter to pay Paul is not a \nhealthy way to run a government. Tribes across Indian Country are \ncontinuing to make strides in economic development and self-\nsufficiency. The United States, however, has a treaty and trust \nresponsibility to our tribes and tribal members. Congress needs to act \nquickly today in order for the Federal Government to meet these \nresponsibilities and to meet the needs of tribal nations across Indian \nCountry.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, now, more than 2 weeks into the \ngovernment shutdown and at the brink of default, we are acutely aware \nof what happens when politicians turn their backs on public policy and, \ninstead, advance partisanship over service to the American people.\n  Let's be clear about this government shutdown. It is a self-imposed \ncrisis manufactured by a small group of hard-line conservatives in the \nHouse of Representatives over their opposition to the Affordable Care \nAct. A dedicated group of public servants, Democrat and Republican, \nhere in the Senate have worked frantically over the past 2\\1/2\\ weeks \nto find agreement in spite of the obstruction of an extreme minority \nwho put their own ideology above the good of their constituents and the \nNation.\n  Last week, I held a hearing in the Senate Commerce Committee about \nthe impacts of the government shutdown to the public and the U.S. \neconomy. We heard firsthand stories about the damage and disruption \ncaused by the shutdown on our families, our businesses, our government, \nand our standing in the world.\n  The message we heard--loud and clear--was that the longer this \nshutdown continues, the worse things will get. It has never been more \napparent just how important the countless services, provided by the \nFederal Government, are to the economic security of millions of \nfamilies and the Nation.\n  In West Virginia, we are keenly aware that the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration personnel are not able to conduct regular reviews of \nmine safety. Four miners have died across this country during the \nshutdown. I am not saying that these accidents would not have happened \nif the government's doors had been open over the past 3 weeks, but I do \nbelieve that we owe it to the hard-working men and women who work in \nour Nation's mines to make sure that as long as they are on the clock, \nthe government's safety experts are as well.\n  The shutdown is causing problems above ground too. Federal \ninvestments in research and development, for example, have long helped \nspur innovation in the United States. Just because House Republicans \nhave shuttered the research arm of our government does not mean that \noverseas competitors such as China are pausing their research as well. \nUnfortunately, these vital government services are in the spotlight \nbecause they are currently not in existence, quite frankly.\n  To further demonstrate the real-life consequences of the shutdown, I \nreleased a report during the hearing that provided a snapshot of the \nimpacts of the government shutdown on the public and the U.S. economy.\n  Because of the shutdown, experts from the Department of \nTransportation and the National Transportation Safety Board cannot \nmonitor our highways, railroads, and pipeline networks and study how to \nmake them safer. Scientists and technical experts at NASA, the National \nScience Foundation, and Department of Defense aren't performing basic \nresearch and engineering that private aerospace and technology \ncompanies need for commercial success.\n  Consumer Product Safety Commission officials cannot monitor our ports \nand stop hazardous products from entering our stores. I am particularly \nconcerned about keeping dangerous imported products off of store \nshelves and out of the hands of our children, especially with the \nholiday season approaching.\n  The fights we continue to have over paying our bills and funding \nvital government services are a distraction. Congress is no longer \ndoing big things that support families and our communities. It is no \nlonger acting as one body, for the people, but instead as factions \npitted bitterly against each other.\n  I fear that people have lost confidence in their government and \nconfidence in their future. I fear they are asking whether government \ncan even make a difference in their lives anymore.\n  Last week's hearing in the Commerce Committee proved beyond a shadow \nof a doubt this shutdown is doing great harm to our country. Sadly, it \nwas totally avoidable. As we move towards an apparent bipartisan \nagreement that will reopen the government and avoid default, I hope \nthose who so recklessly drove us toward financial catastrophe have \nlearned their lesson.\n  In a matter of months, we will again have to address questions \nrelated to funding the government and the debt limit. The conservative \nfringe in the House and the so-called leadership there that was held \nhostage by their threats can force us to repeat these last 3 weeks or \nthey can learn from this great mistake and shift their focus to the \nlarger issues facing our Nation. We may disagree on the best \nprescription for these ills, but I look forward to participating in a \nfair and honest debate.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded and that I be allowed to speak as if \nin morning business\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Detaining Terrorists\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, in the words of Yogi Berra, ``It's \ndeja vu all over again.'' It seems as though every several months this \nadministration manages to repeat the same disturbing pattern of \ntreating captured foreign terrorists first and foremost as ordinary \ncriminals.\n  Over the past 10 days we have watched this pattern play out with the \ncapture and all-too-brief interrogation of Abu Anas al-Libi, one of the \nalleged\n\n[[Page S7529]]\n\ncoconspirators behind the 1998 bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya \nand Tanzania that killed hundreds of innocent people, including 12 \nAmericans.\n  Instead of sitting in a cell at Guantanamo Bay where he could be \nfully interrogated for all the intelligence he likely has from his \ndecades-long association with Al Qaeda terrorists, including a long \nassociation with Osama bin Laden, al-Libi is now enjoying the \nprotections of our criminal justice system. Yesterday in the Southern \nDistrict of New York, he had his initial appearance in Federal court, \nwhere he entered a plea of not guilty to the pending indictment. He now \nhas a court-appointed lawyer at his disposal.\n  From all indications, any interrogation of al-Libi has ended, at \nleast for the time being. If past terrorist cases are any guide, it \nwill take weeks or months of plea negotiations and bargaining with this \nterrorist before we can even think about once again conducting an \nintelligence interrogation, and we may never have that opportunity \nagain with this now criminal defendant.\n  We all remember the case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the 2009 \nChristmas Day Underwear Bomber, who tried to detonate a suicide bomb in \nan airplane over the skies of Detroit. Shortly after being taken into \ncustody, Abdulmutallab was read his Miranda warnings, and it took 5 \nlong weeks of plea negotiations before we would again have the \nopportunity to interrogate him.\n  Why does this matter? Why do so many of my colleagues and I \ncontinually come to this Senate floor to raise this issue? The answer \nis simple: We have been down this road before of treating terrorists as \nif they were criminals, sacrificing intelligence for the sake of \ncriminal charges and Miranda rights.\n  The results on September 11, 2001, were predictable and disastrous. \nWe lost numerous chances to gather intelligence that could have been \nused to neutralize future threats. We were in a reactive mode, reacting \nto but not preventing the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the 2000 \nattack on the USS Cole, and the 1998 embassy bombings, the same attack \ninvolving al-Libi.\n  It took the reality of the 9/11 attacks to get this trend reversed. \nPrevention became the norm as criminal and intelligence investigators \ncame together to use all lawful means, including criminal prosecution, \nto counter the threat of international terrorism.\n  No one is saying criminal prosecution should not be one tool, but it \nseems as though now we either just kill terrorists by using drones or \ngive them Miranda warnings. Dead terrorists don't talk and terrorists \nwith lawyers always want something in return if they are going talk. We \ncannot defeat Al Qaeda, and its growing affiliates, if we don't first \nhave good intelligence on their leadership, intent, networks, and \ncapabilities.\n  As we have seen in Benghazi, and more recently in Kenya, Al Qaeda and \nits affiliates continue to carry out terrorist attacks against the \nUnited States and its interests. Suspected terrorists were captured in \nLondon over the weekend, and we face growing threats in Syria, Libya, \nand across the globe. Al-Libi, as a long-time member of Al Qaeda and \nclose confident of bin Laden, undoubtedly has valuable intelligence \nthat could be used to foil future plots.\n  To defeat these terrorists and keep this country and our allies safe \ndemands clear leadership and sound policies from the President. \nUnfortunately, in this area, we have neither. In the 5 years since this \nadministration summarily dismantled the CIA's detention and \ninterrogation program and ordered the closure of Guantanamo Bay, we \nstill cannot get vital intelligence interrogations prioritized over \ncriminal prosecutions.\n  Since 2009, we have been asking basic questions of senior \nadministration officials, such as, if we captured Al Qaeda leader Ayman \nal-Zawahiri, where would he go? The only firm answer that has been \ngiven is that Guantanamo Bay is off the table.\n  In the capture of al-Libi, it appears as though this administration \nhas finally settled on its own detention policy. In 2011, al-Shabaab \nleader Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame was captured while returning to Somalia \nfrom Yemen where he was acting as an intermediary between al-Shabaab \nand Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Because of this administration's \nperennial resistance to placing more detainees at Guantanamo Bay, \nWarsame was instead held on a U.S. Navy vessel for 2 months and \ninterrogated by the High Value Detainee Interrogation Group, or the \nHIG. Predictably, he was then Mirandized and brought to Federal court.\n  Those who thought the shipboard detention of Warsame was an anomaly, \na one-time necessity, have now been proven wrong. Rather than hold \ndetainees at the first-rate facility at Guantanamo Bay that is run by \ndedicated military personnel who treat the detainees there very \nhumanely, this administration has, with the detention of al-Libi, made \nit clear that it prefers to use our naval warships as floating prisons. \nI can't imagine that this is what those who so strongly advocated for \nthe closure of Guantanamo had in mind as a replacement facility.\n  Over the past week or so some people have raised the point that the \nrestrictions on the fiscal year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act \non the administration's ability to transfer detainees from Guantanamo \nBay to the United States for trial justified the administration's \nunwillingness to place any new terrorists there. That argument simply \ndoes not withstand scrutiny in the case of al-Libi.\n  First, those restrictions applied most recently only to fiscal year \n2013 and so are no longer in place. Second, as with Warsame, \nAbdulmutallab, and other terrorists, we cannot even reach the question \nof where al-Libi may be tried, whether in a Federal court or in a \nmilitary commission at Guantanamo Bay, because this administration will \nnot even consider designating him as an enemy combatant for \ninterrogation purposes.\n  If the administration would be willing--in just one case--to allow a \nfull intelligence interrogation at Guantanamo Bay of a high-valued \ntarget without Miranda and without rushing to criminal charges, I would \nwelcome the opportunity to work with this administration to ensure that \nthere are no statutory obstacles to the appropriate future prosecution \nof a terrorist. If this administration also wants to suggest a better--\nnonfloating--option to Guantanamo Bay outside the United States, I am \nhappy to listen.\n  But so far they have been unwilling to do that despite their public \nclaims that all options are on the table when it comes to handling \nterrorists such as al-Libi. They have been unwilling to make it clear \nthat intelligence collection is the first priority; that long-term \ndetention for intelligence purposes is appropriate and necessary; and \nthat all intelligence value of any suspected terrorist will be \nexhausted before any discussion of potential charges.\n  Instead, the short-lived, onship interrogation of Abu Anas al-Libi \ndemonstrates that this administration has once again chosen to gamble \nwith our national security for the sake of safeguarding a criminal \nprosecution. They are taking the gamble that plea negotiations will be \nquick and effective and that any intelligence could have been gained in \nthe meantime will not be lost. This is a risk none of us should be \nwilling to take.\n  It is time that we stop needlessly giving this advantage to \nterrorists. Our intelligence professionals need real-time, actionable \nintelligence about Al Qaeda and its activities, and the best place to \nget that is often from captured terrorists without Miranda warnings, \ndefense attorneys or initial appearances in court.\n  Getting a conviction and lengthy sentence of an avowed terrorist can \nbe a worthy goal, but ultimately that conviction will mean nothing if \nAmericans are harmed because we threw away the opportunity to get \nintelligence when we needed it most. It is time to end this dangerous \npattern and put all lawful options for handling Al Qaeda terrorists \nback on the table.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the deal that the \nSenate is getting ready to vote on. This is a terrible deal. This deal \nembodies everything about the Washington establishment that frustrates \nthe American people. This deal kicks the can down the\n\n[[Page S7530]]\n\nroad. It allows yet more debt, more deficits, more spending, and it \ndoes absolutely nothing to provide relief for the millions of Americans \nwho are hurting because of ObamaCare.\n  To all the young people who are coming out of school right now and \ncan't find a job because of ObamaCare, this deal does nothing for them. \nTo all of the single moms who are struggling and being forced into \npart-time work, trying to feed their kids on 29 hours a week because of \nObamaCare, this deal does nothing for them. To all of the hard-working \nfamilies who are getting massive premium increases from their health \ninsurance companies right now and trying to figure out how they are \ngoing to make ends meet with health insurance costs going up 200 to 300 \npercent because of ObamaCare, this deal does nothing for them. To all \nof the seniors and all the people with disabilities who are getting \nnotifications in the mail right now telling them they are losing their \nhealth insurance because of ObamaCare, this deal does nothing for them.\n  This fight was always about the American people who are hurting \nbecause of ObamaCare, and unfortunately today the Senate is saying: You \ndon't have a voice in Washington.\n  This is a terrible deal. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  None of us should be surprised that when the Senate votes, this deal \nis going to pass, and it is going to pass by a big margin. None of us \nshould be surprised, but the outcome could have been different.\n  I ask the Presiding Officer to imagine a different world. We saw in \nthe last 2 months millions of Americans rise up, sign a national \npetition, light up the phones to the Capitol, and speak up against the \nenormous harms ObamaCare is visiting upon them. We saw the House of \nRepresentatives stand with courage and listen to the American people.\n  I ask the Presiding Officer to imagine a world in which Senate \nRepublicans united to support House Republicans. Imagine that one piece \nbeing different from what we saw. Imagine, after the House Republicans \nstood together with the American people, if all 46 Senate Republicans \nhad stood together and said: We are united against the train wreck that \nis ObamaCare. We are united with the American people that if President \nObama is going to give an exemption for big business and for Members of \nCongress, the American people deserve that very same exemption.\n  I want you to imagine if Senate Republicans stood together and simply \nsupported House Republicans and the American people. I want the \nPresiding Officer to imagine what would have happened if all 46 Senate \nRepublicans had united and gone together and said: The House of \nRepresentatives has passed a bill funding the VA. We should fund the \nVA.\n  The majority leader of the Senate refused to allow the Senate to even \nvote to fund the VA. I want you to imagine all 46 Senate Republicans, \nif we had stood together and simply supported the House Republicans in \nsaying the House of Representatives has voted to reopen our national \nparks, to reopen our war memorials, and the majority leader of the \nSenate refused to allow the Senate to even vote.\n  I want my colleagues to imagine simply that Senate Republicans stood \ntogether and said: We support the House Republicans in standing with \nthe American people. If that had happened, I believe this result would \nhave been very different.\n  It is heartbreaking to the American people that Senate Republicans \ndivided as they did and decided to direct their criticism, direct their \nattention, direct their cannon fire at House Republicans and at those \nstanding with the American people. Yet, at the same time, to the \nmillions of Americans who rose up in the last couple of months, I want \nto give a word of encouragement--a word of encouragement about the path \nforward.\n  A couple of months ago the Washington establishment scoffed at the \nnotion that the American people might rise up. That was viewed as \nsilly, parochial, couldn't happen. A couple of months ago the \nWashington establishment scoffed at the notion that the House of \nRepresentatives would stand strong saying: We should fund every bit of \nthe Federal Government, but we shouldn't fund ObamaCare. Yet what we \nhave seen in the last 2 months has been extraordinary. Millions of \nAmericans are speaking in overwhelming numbers saying ObamaCare isn't \nworking. The unions are jumping ship. Democratic Members of the Senate \nand the House went to the President and said: We want to be exempted \nfrom ObamaCare. This law isn't working. And it is worth reflecting on \nhow extraordinary it is to see the American people rise up in such \nincredible numbers and to see the House of Representatives engage in \nwhat I consider to be a profile in courage, standing with the American \npeople.\n  Now, a path forward--the way we are going to stop ObamaCare, the way \nwe are going to stop the suffering, the harms being visited on millions \nof Americans--is the path we have seen these past couple of months--the \nAmerican people rising up. The answers are not going to come from \nWashington. Washington is broken. But the answers are going to come \nfrom the American people.\n  So today I am encouraged. I am encouraged by the millions of \nAmericans who want to get back to our free market principles, get back \nto the Constitution, and stop this train wreck of a law that is the \nbiggest job killer in this country, that is hurting people all across \nthe country. It is sad that today the Senate is telling people all \nacross this country who are struggling, who are trying to provide for \ntheir kids, and who are getting notifications in the mail that their \nhealth care has been dropped--maybe a person has an elderly parent and \nthat health care policy is providing for the family. Maybe people have \nchildren facing debilitating diseases. Yet they are getting a \nnotification in the mail that their health insurance has been dropped \nbecause of ObamaCare. It is sad that the Senate says we will do nothing \nto answer their plight. We created their plight, but we will do \nnothing. It is sad that when we have James Hoffa, the president of the \nTeamsters, saying ObamaCare is destroying the health care of millions \nof working men and women in this country and the families who depend \nupon them, that the Senate says: We are closed for business. The \nWashington establishment has exempted itself, so the problems, the \nsuffering of working America is not the concern of the Washington \nestablishment. That is sad.\n  But at the same time, I am optimistic. I am inspired by the millions \nof Americans who have risen. And if the American people continue to \nrise up, I am confident that in time the Senate will follow the lead of \nthe House of Representatives and listen to the American people. That is \nour job. That is our responsibility.\n  This is a terrible deal today. It is a terrible deal for the American \npeople. At the same time, the path forward--if the American people \ncontinue to rise up, we are going to turn this around. We are going to \nrestore jobs. We are going to restore economic growth. We are going to \nrestore the ability of people who are struggling to climb the economic \nladder and to achieve the American dream, and we are going to stop the \nNo. 1 job killer in this country; that is, ObamaCare.\n  I rise in opposition to this deal that doesn't serve the best \ninterests of the men and women each of us represent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I know the hour is getting late. The passage of this \nbill is nigh, and so I will be brief, but I wish to make a few points.\n  First, this is hardly a day of exultation and happiness. The sad \ntruth is that we have ended just where we started. When we began \nseveral weeks ago, our goal was simple: Open the government, pay our \nbills, and then let's negotiate. The proposal that will be before us \nshortly does just that and no more. We open the government. We pay our \nbills. Then we can sit down and negotiate. But along the way, many \npeople have been hurt. Millions of people didn't get paychecks. The \neconomy has been dented, and the civility in Washington--whatever was \nleft of it--evaporated. So to say this is a good day because one party \nmight be doing better than another--no. It is a day that is, in a \ncertain sense, grim. We have finally achieved our goal--the same place \nwhere we started--but at a cost. It never should have been this way.\n  Second, I wish to salute two of our leaders. I salute our Democratic \nleader\n\n[[Page S7531]]\n\nand my dear friend Harry Reid. From the beginning he was stalwart. He \nled with his strength. He said that we cannot govern in a way where any \nfaction says: Unless we get our way, we will hurt the American people \nby closing down the government, by letting us default. He said: We \ncannot stand for that any longer. We have had enough of that in \nWashington, and we are not going to bend to that type of awful \npolitics.\n  He stood firm. He stood strong. He didn't waiver. Tonight we are \npassing the bill that he sought and we sought 3 weeks ago.\n  I would also like to salute the Republican leader Senator McConnell. \nWe all know he has a difficult political situation. We all know it \nwould have been easier for him to duck. We all know that when it became \nclear the House of Representatives was so tied in a knot that it \ncouldn't function, it couldn't pass any bill, Leader McConnell stepped \nup for the good of the Nation and showed courage. He deserves our \nthanks as well.\n  Finally, I will make one more point. If there is a silver lining that \ncan come out of this gray cloud, it is that perhaps, moving forward, \nthe politics of brinkmanship, of confrontation has reached its peak in \nthis body and in this country.\n  We have seen that a small faction in either House, when it says ``my \nway or no way,'' when it says ``I am going to do such hurt to innocent \npeople that you will have to succumb to me''--we saw they failed, \nhopefully with large bipartisan votes, certainly in this Chamber and \nperhaps in the other. And we have seen that many on both sides of the \naisle have come together and said: We are not going to go along with \nthis type of politics, from wherever it comes.\n  Perhaps when January 15 and February 7 come about, we will not see a \nrepeat of what we have seen these last few weeks because it has been \nrepudiated by the vast majority in this body and in the other body and \ncertainly by the American people, a very small percentage of whom \nsupported the politics of brinkmanship--the reckless, irresponsible \npolitics of brinkmanship that some have exercised over the last few \nweeks.\n  So that would be the silver lining in this cloud, that we can go back \nto the old way of legislating where we sit down, we talk over our \ndifferences, we negotiate, and we come to a conclusion for the good of \nAmerica, the way the Founding Fathers envisioned it. They did not \nenvision what happened here in the last 3 weeks, and it was not \nAmerica's finest moment. But out of this great darkness can come some \nlight--the desire on both sides of the aisle, of the majority of both \nparties to say: Enough brinkmanship. Let's sit down, let's negotiate, \nand let's move forward so this great country will be led by its \ngovernment instead of pulled down by its government. That is my fervent \nwish.\n  After these last 3 weeks we are ending where we started, \nunfortunately, and people have been hurt as that happened. But perhaps \nthe lessons of the last 3 weeks will sink in amongst us all and we will \nnot see a repeat of what has happened.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Unanimous Consent Agreement--\n                            H. Con. Res. 25\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased we have reached an agreement \nthat will reopen the government and allow us to pay our bills and \nprovide a path forward now for bipartisan budget negotiations. As part \nof this bipartisan deal, I will once again tonight ask unanimous \nconsent to begin a bipartisan budget conference.\n  The budgets that passed the Senate and the House 6 months ago are \nvery different. Nobody thinks it is going to be easy to get to a deal. \nBut I know I would not have fought so hard for so long to begin \nbipartisan negotiations if I did not think we could find some common \nground and work something out.\n  I do not think there is anyone in Congress who wants to put the \ncountry through the last few weeks again, and I am hopeful we can now \nwork together in a budget conference to end these constant crises and \nwork now toward a balanced and bipartisan deal that the American people \nexpect and deserve.\n  So I tonight ask unanimous consent that if the Senate passes H.R. \n2775, as amended, the Senate then proceed to the consideration of \nCalendar No. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that the amendment at the desk, which \nis the text of S. Con. Res. 8, the budget resolution agreed to by the \nSenate, be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table; that H. Con. Res. 25, as amended, be agreed \nto, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable; that the motion for the Senate to insist on its amendment be \nagreed to; that the Senate request a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses and authorize the Chair to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate, with a ratio of 12 Democrats and \n10 Republicans; that the conferees be instructed to report back a \nconference report by December 13, 2013; that if the Senate receives \nfrom the House a request to go to conference on S. Con. Res. 8, the \nagreement be modified so that the Senate agree to the request to go to \nconference on S. Con. Res. 8, with the remaining provisions related to \nthe conference remaining in effect; further, that it not be in order \nfor the Senate to consider a conference report with respect to H. Con. \nRes. 25 or S. Con. Res. 8 if it includes reconciliation instructions to \nraise the debt limit; and that all of the above occur with no \nintervening action or debate; finally, that H. Con. Res. 25, as \namended, and agreed to, be held at the desk until a message is received \nfrom the House relative to H.R. 2775, and if the House fails to concur \nin the Senate amendment to H.R. 2775, this agreement be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues a courageous Ecuadoran journalist who has been recognized by \nthe Committee to Protect Journalists International Press.\n  Janet Hinostroza has anchored the investigative news show ``30 Plus'' \nfor the past decade and hosted the news program ``La Manana de 24 \nHoras,'' both on the private Ecuadoran television channel Teleamazonas. \nShe also hosts a radio program on 98.1 FM Mundo and is the local \ncorrespondent for Univision, while managing a production company \nspecializing in journalistic programming and audiovisual products.\n  Ms. Hinostroza has attracted the wrath of the Ecuadoran authorities \nfor reporting on such important issues as human and arms trafficking, \nthe Ecuadoran police, corruption, and extrajudicial killings. She \nrecently investigated a scandal involving a loan by a state-owned bank \nto a businessman who defaulted. I am informed that her reporting \nuncovered irregularities in the loan and connected the businessman to \nthe then-head of Ecuador's central bank, who was President Rafael \nCorrea's cousin. As a result, she received anonymous phone calls \nthreatening her safety and she had to temporarily leave her television \nnews program.\n  Teleamazonas, like many Ecuadoran news outlets that engage in \nreporting critical of the government, is regularly targeted with \nharassment by official censors. Ms. Hinostroza's program is required to \ndesignate regular time slots, legally reserved for reporting official \ninformation in times of crisis, to present presidential rebuttals to \nher reports, contrary to Ecuador's broadcast laws.\n  In recognition of Ms. Hinostroza's brave and important work and \ncommitment to fighting for a free press, next month the Committee to \nProtect Journalists will award Ms. Hinostroza the International Award \nfor Freedom of the Press.\n  Unfortunately, the harassment of Ms. Hinostroza is only one example \nof a steady deterioration of democratic principles in Ecuador. It is \nthe responsibility of democratic governments to foster an environment \nof pluralism, and nothing is more basic to that than public access to \ninformation from a free press. Instead, the Ecuadoran Government has \ncarried out a relentless assault on the media, and recently it went a \nstep further by restricting the autonomy of nongovernmental \norganizations.\n  A decree adopted in June creates burdensome new procedures for \nnongovernmental organizations, both Ecuadoran and international, to \nobtain legal status to operate in the country. Like a free press, civil \nsociety plays a crucial oversight role in any democratic society. The \nEcuadoran decree is similar to what we have seen in other countries \nwhose repressive governments are using laws and decrees to silence \ntheir critics.\n  I ask unanimous consent that excerpts from a recent report by Human \nRights Watch about the Correa government's latest efforts to \nconsolidate power and silence its critics be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From Human Rights Watch, Aug. 12, 2013]\n\n                  Ecuador: Clampdown on Civil Society\n\n       (Washington, DC).--Ecuador should revoke a presidential \n     decree that grants far-reaching powers to the government to \n     oversee and dissolve nongovernmental organizations, Human \n     Rights Watch said today.\n       On June 4, 2013, President Rafael Correa adopted a decree \n     that creates new procedures for Ecuadorean nongovernmental \n     organizations to obtain legal status and requires \n     international organizations to undergo a screening process to \n     seek permission to work in Ecuador. The decree also grants \n     the government broad powers to intervene in groups' \n     operations. It gives the government authority, for example, \n     to dissolve Ecuadorean groups for ``compromis[ing] public \n     peace.''\n       ``The Correa administration has damaged free speech, \n     expending a lot of its energy focusing on the media, and now \n     it's trying to trample on independent groups,'' said Jose \n     Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. \n     ``Officials can now essentially decide what groups may say or \n     do, seriously undermining their role as a check on the \n     government.''\n       Correa presented a draft proposal of a similar decree in \n     December 2010, but it was shelved after criticism from local \n     and international groups.\n       Under the decree, the authorities are creating an \n     electronic Unified System of Information of Social Groups, \n     which would store documentation from organizations. \n     Ecuadorean organizations are required to file a series of \n     documents to obtain legal status and approval of their by-\n     laws. Groups have one year from the publication of the decree \n     on June 20 to present the required paperwork.\n       Government officials from ministries related to the work \n     done by the group--for example, the Health Ministry if the \n     group works on health-related topics--review the \n     documentation and have the authority to grant or deny the \n     group legal status. Once they obtain legal status, groups \n     must inform authorities when they select directors and a \n     legal representative and if they add or remove members. They \n     must also provide the government with information about \n     projects with international funding, and get government \n     authorization to revise their by-laws.\n       The decree limits groups' ability to choose who can be a \n     member or participant, undermining their right to free \n     assembly, Human Rights Watch said. The decree imposes on \n     Ecuadorean groups an obligation to respect the ``right'' of \n     anyone who ``due to their place of residency or having a \n     specific labor, institutional, union, occupational, or \n     professional qualification directly related to the objective \n     or nature and/or purposes of the organization, is interested \n     in participating in it.'' Groups with certain territorial \n     coverage or those that are ``the only ones in their \n     location'' may not reject people with a ``legitimate \n     interest'' in participating.\n       The government officials who grant a group legal status \n     have broad monitoring powers to make sure that it only \n     carries out `authorized' work. Officials may dissolve a group \n     if they consider the organization is ``mov[ing] away from the \n     objectives for which it was created,'' or if it is involved \n     in activities that ``compromise public peace'' or ``interfere \n     with public policies that undermine national or external \n     security of the state.''\n       International groups seeking to work in Ecuador must \n     request permission from the Technical Secretariat of \n     International Cooperation, providing information on the \n     ``purposes and work they wish to carry out in the country.'' \n     They have to provide documents that ``demonstrate [their] \n     legal existence,'' including their by-laws in Spanish. The \n     government will then ask Ecuadorean embassies and consulates \n     in countries where the international group operates for \n     information about the ``legality, solvency, and seriousness'' \n     of the organization. Based on this information, it will \n     decide whether to sign an agreement with the international \n     group to authorize it to work in Ecuador.\n       The decree also imposes vaguely defined prohibitions on \n     international groups--for instance, they are not allowed to \n     conduct activities that ``undermine security and public \n     peace.'' It also allows government officials to monitor a \n     group's activities ``to ensure the true fulfillment of its \n     obligations'' and to revoke the international agreement if \n     they decide the group violates it.\n       On August 7, a lower court judge rejected a constitutional \n     challenge filed by Fundamedios, an organization that monitors \n     freedom of expression, against the decree. The group has \n     filed an appeal, which remains pending before the courts.\n       Under international law, however, as part of their duty to \n     promote and protect human rights, governments must ensure \n     that human rights defenders are allowed to pursue their \n     activities without reprisals, threats, intimidation, \n     harassment, discrimination, or unnecessary legal obstacles. \n     The Inter-American Court of Human Rights held in 2003 that \n     ``[r]espect for human rights in a democratic state depends \n     largely on human rights defenders enjoying effective and \n     adequate guarantees so as to freely go about their \n     activities, and it is advisable to pay special attention to \n     those actions that limit or hinder the work of human rights \n     defenders.''\n       The rights to freedom of expression and association may be \n     subject to limitations, but the limitations must adhere to \n     strict standards so that they do not improperly impede the \n     exercise of those rights. Any restrictions should be \n     ``prescribed by law, necessary in a democratic society, and \n     proportionate to the aim pursued'' and should not ``harm the \n     principles of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness.''\n       Article 16 of the American Convention on Human Rights \n     states that the right of freedom of association ``shall be \n     subject only to such restrictions established by law as may \n     be necessary in a democratic society, in the\n\n[[Page S7534]]\n\n     interest of national security, public safety or public order, \n     or to protect public health or morals or the rights and \n     freedoms of others.''\n       In 2012, the UN special rapporteur on the rights to freedom \n     of peaceful assembly and of association has called on \n     countries to ensure that these rights ``are enjoyed by \n     everyone and any registered or unregistered entities'' and \n     that no one is subject to ``harassment, persecution, \n     intimidation or reprisals'' for exercising them. Moreover, \n     the rapporteur has stated that, ``[s]uspension or involuntary \n     dissolution of associations should be sanctioned by an \n     impartial and independent court in case of a clear and \n     imminent danger resulting in a flagrant violation of domestic \n     laws, in compliance with international human rights law.''\n       ``Instead of adopting reasonable measures to facilitate the \n     work of nongovernmental organizations, the Correa \n     administration is following the lead of countries such as \n     Russia, Bahrain, Uganda, and Venezuela, which have imposed \n     unjustified restrictions that violate fundamental rights and \n     limit spaces that are critical to democratic society,'' \n     Vivanco said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/16/senate-section/article/S7534-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE FUNDING\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a bill I \nintroduced last week to provide forward funding appropriations for the \nIndian Health Service. The IHS is charged with delivering health \nservices to American Indians and Alaska Natives as part of our Federal \ntrust responsibility, and I believe that forward funding the IHS is the \nright thing to do, just like Congress forward funds our VA as part of \nour obligation to our veterans.\n  The budget uncertainty we have put our tribal health providers in is \nshameful. We may not be able to ensure our Nation's indigenous children \nwill receive their immunizations. We might not be able to ensure our \nelders will be able to receive the care they need. We cannot guarantee \nbasic medical services will be provided, including prenatal and dental \nfor our first Americans, who rely on funding from the Indian Health \nService. The situation is disgraceful, and the health statistics of our \nfirst Americans reflect that.\n  Without Federal funding for fiscal year 14, HHS has determined that \nthose receiving care from the Indian Health Service will continue to \nreceive clinical care, but for tribes that operate their own health \nprograms, payments will not be transferred. Yet, just like the Indian \nHealth Service, our tribal health providers must keep providing care. \nThe budget uncertainty we have imposed on those delivering health \nservices is unconscionable.\n  As I mentioned previously, my bill to forward fund the Indian Health \nService makes sense because the IHS is charged with delivering health \nservices to American Indians and Alaska Natives, as promised by the \nUnited States for the removal of Indians from their lands. The United \nStates calls this obligation the Federal trust responsibility. This is \nnot a relationship based on race--but a legal and political \nrelationship defined by treaties, Executive orders, the U.S. \nConstitution, statutes, and Supreme Court decisions.\n  Health care services are either delivered by the Indian Health \nService or by tribal health providers themselves operating under Indian \nSelf-Determination Act agreements. Delayed funding means health care \nproviders cannot budget with certainty, recruit health professionals, \nretain health professionals, adequately deliver services, nor manage \nfacility maintenance and construction efforts. Late funding for tribal \nhealth programs has significantly hampered the delivery of health \nservices for American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n  Let me take this opportunity to remind you of the health status of \nour Nation's first peoples. For too long in our Nation's history, \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives have experienced severe health \ndisparities compared to other Americans as a result of the poor \neconomic and social conditions. According to the Indian Health Service, \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives die at higher rates compared to \nother Americans from many causes: alcoholism is 522 percent higher, \ndiabetes is 182 percent higher, unintentional injuries is 138 percent \nhigher, homicide is 83 percent higher, and suicide is 74 percent \nhigher.\n  We must recognize the historical traumas that played a role in these \npercentages, including the removal of lands, forced relocation and \nassimilation of Native communities, new diseases introduced, deaths \nexperienced, and the loss of indigenous cultures. These are wounds that \nhave been internalized and manifest themselves in high rates of \nalcoholism and substance abuse, driving the statistics of domestic \nviolence, sexual assault, and suicide. And this sadness is passed down \nfrom one generation to the next.\n  Our tribes are working to break this cycle. Under the Federal policy \nof Indian self-determination we have empowered tribes to address the \nneeds of their tribal members. Yet whether it be the denial of full \noperational support costs for Indian programs or the ceasing of payment \nunder a government shutdown, we are failing on that promise.\n  Just as this Nation has made a promise to its veterans for the \ndelivery of health care, we cannot forget the promise made to American \nIndians and Alaska Natives. In 2010, Congress forward funded the VA. \nVeterans groups, alarmed by the impact of delayed funding and concerned \nabout the VA's ability to plan and manage its resources, demanded \nforward funding. Let me tell you our tribal health providers have those \nsame concerns. Our tribal health providers have demanded that Congress \nforward fund IHS appropriations so they may better manage the health \nfunds for American Indians and Alaska Natives, and I think we should do \nso.\n  The present government shutdown demonstrates why this is so \nimportant: we have compromised the delivery of health services for our \nfirst Americans, especially those who receive care from tribally \nadministered hospitals. Forward funding would allow Indian health \nprograms to more be more effectively managed and improve health \noutcomes for our first Americans. Tribal administrators would know how \nmany physicians and nurses they could hire without wondering if funding \nfor positions would be available. They would also be able to manage \nclinics without the uncertainty of shutting them down.\n  I am proud to introduce this bill to forward fund HIS, and I hope my \ncolleagues support this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/16/senate-section/article/S7534-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   Sergeant Benjamin C.

Benjamin C. Edinger. Sergeant \nEdinger grew up in Green Bay, riding his bike across the city and \nplaying ball in the city parks. He graduated in 1999 from West High \nSchool, and joined the Marine Corps in 2000.\n  Sergeant Edinger began his career in the Marine Corps as a small \ncomputer systems specialist, later passing through rigorous trials to \njoin Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance, the Marine Corps' most elite \nunit. He was part of the initial invasion of Iraq, and was on his \nsecond tour of duty in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom with the 2nd \nForce Reconnaissance Company. Sergeant Edinger participated in 61 \ncombat missions as a gunner. On November 14, 2004, in Al Anbar \nProvince, he suffered shrapnel wounds as a result of enemy combat. He \nlater died from his injuries on November 23, 2004.\n  Sergeant Edinger is remembered by his family, friends, and fellow \nmarines as a kind and considerate person, and a tough and courageous \nmarine.\n  I am proud that Sergeant Edinger will be honored with this trail \ndedication in the city he called home, and in the State and country he \nloved and served.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/16/senate-section/article/S7534-3", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7534-S7535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           BOYS & GIRLS CLUB\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, today I wish to mark an important \nbirthday in my hometown of Springfield, MO. This year the Boys & Girls \nClub of Springfield celebrates its 75th year of operations. These 75 \nyears have been marked by dedication and service to the young people of \nSpringfield and the surrounding area. The club's commitment has helped \nshape the community,\n\n[[Page S7535]]\n\nmold business and civic leaders of tomorrow, and made a lasting impact \non the region.\n  Through the Boys & Girls Club, young people of all backgrounds have a \nplace to build relationships and grow as individuals. With adults from \ntheir own community, these children foster relationships not only with \neach other but also with a set of great role models committed to making \neach day better for every child.\n  The Boys & Girls Club of Springfield got its start in 1938 while the \ncountry was still in a depression. Mrs. Jennie Lincoln got the idea to \nlaunch the group from her husband, Judge A.W. Lincoln, who discussed \nthe need for an organization to serve youngsters with special problems. \nWithout hesitation, the Springfield community joined the effort. The \nCommercial Street Business Men's Club agreed to the free use of the \nbasement of their building at 219 East Commercial as the first \nheadquarters--they even provided utilities for free. This basement \nbecame home to the North Side Boys Club for 11 years. Even as the \nDepression continued, Mrs. Lincoln enlisted her friends to create the \nBoys Club Women's Auxiliary to raise funds for programs and essential \nexpenses for the Boys Club. Today, the auxiliary continues to be an \nimportant arm of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Springfield, raising \nthousands of dollars each year for scholarships.\n  The original Girls Club was established in 1963 by the Community \nService League, now known as the Junior League. The Girls Club \nflourished under the direction of Genevieve Kynion, who served as the \ngroup's executive director for 21 years. In 1991, the Boys & Girls \nClubs merged.\n  The Boys & Girls Club of Springfield owes its lasting success to many \npeople--from volunteers, to employees to various charitable and \ncommunity organizations that have extended financial support. The club \ncontinues to grow today, offering multiple locations to provide \nservices to its 600 after school attendees. The club's generosity \nextends beyond afterschool activities as they serve more than 100,000 \nmeals each year.\n  Today, many of those kids who spent their early years at the Boys & \nGirls Clubs are elected leaders, champions of commerce, church elders \nand business leaders. Their careers are varied but distinguished with \nalumni ranging from former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft to famed \nactor Brad Pitt. The Boys & Girls Club continues to positively \ninfluence the city of Springfield in immeasurable ways. I look forward \nto seeing its ongoing success as the Boys & Girls Club continues to \npromote their motto that every child can truly ``be great!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/16/senate-section/article/S7535-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                2 NOT 1\n\n Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, on Friday, October 19, 2013, the 2 \nNot 1 Annual Fatherhood Conference is being held in Louisville, KY.\n  The motto of the non-profit is ``Changing the Lives of Children, One \nFather at a Time!'' The group's purpose is to educate low-income \nindividuals and communities on the subject of fatherhood and the \nbarriers that impede the successful interaction of father and child.\n  Shawn Gardner, the President and Founder of 2 Not 1, has put together \nthe conference which is expected to be a big success. Private groups \nsuch as 2 Not 1 are doing some excellent work to help disadvantaged \nkids.\n  I have been provided the names of the winners to be announced at the \nevent and want to recognize these individuals for their good work. The \nfollowing people are receiving awards on Friday night:\n  Ebony O'Rea, Female Supporter of Fatherhood;\n  John Marshal, Community Dad; and\n  Mike Warner, Father of the Year.\n  The mission of the group is to promote the safety and wellbeing of \nchildren by implementing strategies to keep fathers involved and \nfamilies together. Cheers to those receiving awards and to all the good \npeople working to improve the lives of kids who are missing male \nguidance in their lives.\n  I share the belief that fathers matter in the lives of their children \nand am encouraged that this organization is helping to strengthen \nfamilies by equipping fathers with parenting strategies.\n  I am grateful to be a parent of three sons. My own family life is \npretty challenging right now as I work hard to serve our Nation in \nWashington and fly home on the weekends to spend time with the boys or \nanswer homework questions over the phone.\n  We know that life is not perfect, and that some children will still \ngrow up without fathers. Sometimes, our best efforts fall short but \nwith persistence, determination, and grace toward one another, we can \nmake a huge difference in the lives of children by mentoring \nfathers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/16/senate-section/article/S7535-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARED \n    IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 12978 WITH RESPECT TO SIGNIFICANT NARCOTICS \n                TRAFFICKERS CENTERED IN COLOMBIA--PM 22\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of The United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.:\n\n                              S. Res. 269\n\n       Whereas diplomats from the Islamic Republic of Iran, the \n     European Union, the\n\n[[Page S7537]]\n\n     United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, China, \n     and Russia continue to discuss the Government of Iran's \n     illicit nuclear weapons program;\n       Whereas President of Iran Hasan Rouhani has in the past \n     bragged about his success in buying time for Iran to make \n     nuclear advances;\n       Whereas Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, who \n     retains control over Iran's nuclear program, recently claimed \n     that Iran did not desire nuclear weapons but said that if \n     Iran ``intended to possess nuclear weapons, no power could \n     stop us'';\n       Whereas the Government of Iran continues to expand Iran's \n     nuclear and missile programs in violation of multiple United \n     Nations Security Council resolutions;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has a decades-long track \n     record of cheating on and violating commitments regarding its \n     nuclear program and has used more than 10 years of diplomatic \n     negotiations to buy more time to expand its nuclear weapons \n     program;\n       Whereas Iran remains the world's number one exporter of \n     terrorism and as recently as 2011 was plotting to assassinate \n     a foreign official on United States soil;\n       Whereas, over the last three decades, the Government of \n     Iran and its terrorist proxies have been responsible for the \n     deaths of Americans;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran and its terrorist proxies \n     continue to provide military and financial support to the \n     regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, aiding his regime's mass \n     killing of civilians;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran continues to sow instability \n     in its region and to threaten its neighbors, including United \n     States allies such as Israel;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran denies its people their \n     fundamental freedoms, including freedom of the press, freedom \n     of assembly, freedom of religion, and freedom of conscience;\n       Whereas international and United States sanctions imposed \n     on Iran have assisted in bringing Iran to the negotiating \n     table;\n       Whereas other countries, such as North Korea, have used \n     diplomatic talks regarding their nuclear programs to allow \n     time for the development of nuclear weapons;\n       Whereas, based on the Government of Iran's stockpile of low \n     enriched uranium and its plan to continue installing advanced \n     centrifuges, the Government of Iran could agree to suspend \n     all enrichment above 3.5 percent and still be in a position \n     to produce weapons-grade uranium without detection by the \n     middle of next year;\n       Whereas, if the Government of Iran starts up its heavy \n     water reactor in Arak, it could establish an alternate \n     pathway to a nuclear weapon, producing enough plutonium each \n     year for one or two nuclear weapons;\n       Whereas 19 other nations currently access peaceful nuclear \n     energy without any enrichment or reprocessing activities on \n     their soil; and\n       Whereas the Government of Iran could likewise achieve \n     access to peaceful nuclear energy without enrichment or \n     reprocessing activities on its own soil: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) it shall be the policy of the United States that the \n     Government of Iran will not be allowed to develop a nuclear \n     weapon and that all instruments of United States power and \n     influence remain on the table to prevent this outcome;\n       (2) the Government of Iran does not have an absolute or \n     inherent right to enrichment and reprocessing technologies \n     under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \n     done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and \n     entered into force March 5, 1970 (commonly known as the \n     ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'');\n       (3) relief of sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program \n     imposed upon Iran by the United States should only be \n     provided once Iran has completely abandoned its nuclear \n     weapons program, including any enrichment or reprocessing \n     capability, and has provided complete transparency to the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency regarding its work on \n     weaponization of a nuclear device; and\n       (4) until the Government of Iran has taken the actions set \n     forth in paragraph (3), Congress should move to pass a new \n     round of additional sanctions without delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 270--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF WORLD POLIO \n  DAY AND COMMENDING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND OTHERS FOR THEIR \n                 EFFORTS TO PREVENT AND ERADICATE POLIO\n\n  Mr. KIRK (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Wicker, Mr. \nRubio, Mr. Boozman, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Begich, Mr. Isakson, and Mr. \nMurphy) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 270\n\n       Whereas October 24 of each year is recognized \n     internationally as World Polio Day;\n       Whereas polio is a highly infectious disease that primarily \n     affects children and for which there is no known cure;\n       Whereas polio can leave survivors permanently disabled from \n     muscle paralysis of the limbs and occasionally leads to a \n     particularly difficult death through paralysis of respiratory \n     muscles;\n       Whereas polio was once one of the most dreaded diseases in \n     the United States, killing thousands of people annually in \n     the late 19th and early 20th centuries and leaving thousands \n     more with permanent disabilities, including the 32nd \n     President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt;\n       Whereas severe polio outbreaks in the 1940s and 1950s \n     caused panic in the United States, as parents kept children \n     indoors, public health officials quarantined infected \n     individuals, and the Federal Government restricted commerce \n     and travel;\n       Whereas 1952 was the peak of the polio epidemic in the \n     United States, with more than 57,000 people affected, 21,000 \n     of whom were paralyzed and 3,000 of whom died;\n       Whereas safe and effective polio vaccines, including the \n     inactivated polio vaccine (commonly known as ``IPV''), \n     developed in 1952 by Jonas Salk, and the oral polio vaccine \n     (commonly known as ``OPV''), developed in 1957 by Albert \n     Sabin, rendered polio preventable and contributed to the \n     rapid decline of the incidence of polio in the United States;\n       Whereas, although the United States has been free from \n     polio since 1979, this preventable disease still needlessly \n     lays victim to children and adults in several countries where \n     challenges, such as active conflict and lack of \n     infrastructure, impede access to vaccines;\n       Whereas the Federal Government is the leading public sector \n     donor to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative and provides \n     technical and operational leadership to this global effort \n     through the work of the Centers for Disease Control and the \n     United States Agency for International Development;\n       Whereas the eradication of polio is the highest priority of \n     Rotary International, a global association founded in 1905 in \n     Chicago, Illinois, that is now headquartered in Evanston, \n     Illinois, and has more than 1,200,000 members in more than \n     170 countries;\n       Whereas Rotary International and its members (commonly \n     known as ``Rotarians'') have contributed more than \n     $1,000,000,000 to, and volunteered countless hours in, the \n     global fight against polio;\n       Whereas Rotary International, the World Health \n     Organization, the United States Government, the United \n     Nations Children's Fund (commonly known as ``UNICEF''), the \n     Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the United Nations \n     Foundation have joined together with national governments to \n     successfully reduce cases of polio by more than 99 percent \n     since 1988, from more than 350,000 reported cases in 1988 to \n     223 reported cases in 2012;\n       Whereas polio was recently eliminated in India and is now \n     endemic only in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan;\n       Whereas terrorist and militant groups continue to target \n     and murder health care workers who seek to save the lives of \n     children;\n       Whereas the sanctity and neutrality of health care workers \n     must be respected, as these workers deliver the most basic of \n     life-saving interventions to children and communities;\n       Whereas the recent polio outbreak in the Horn of Africa, \n     comprising Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya, continues to result \n     in new cases of the disease, exacerbating the protracted \n     humanitarian crisis in the region and highlighting the urgent \n     need to finally eradicate polio before progress is lost;\n       Whereas countries around the world are placing an \n     unprecedented emphasis on polio eradication, including by \n     implementing Emergency Action Plans to boost vaccination \n     coverage in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan;\n       Whereas the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has \n     developed the Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan \n     2013-2018 (referred to in this preamble as the ``Endgame \n     Strategy'') to capitalize on the opportunity to eradicate all \n     polio disease;\n       Whereas the Endgame Strategy also outlines a legacy \n     planning process to ensure that lessons learned in the effort \n     to eradicate polio, as well as the assets and infrastructure \n     built in support of that effort, are transitioned to benefit \n     other development goals and global health priorities, \n     including the continued delivery of health services to the \n     most vulnerable children in the world;\n       Whereas the global effort to eradicate polio is the largest \n     internationally coordinated public health effort in history, \n     with a network of over 20,000,000 volunteers worldwide; and\n       Whereas the eradication of polio is imminently achievable \n     and will be a victory shared by all of humanity: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of World Polio Day;\n       (2) commends the international community and others for \n     their efforts in vaccinating children around the world \n     against polio and for the tremendous strides made toward \n     eradicating the disease;\n       (3) encourages and supports the international community of \n     governments and nongovernmental organizations in remaining \n     committed to the eradication of polio;\n       (4) condemns the deplorable actions of terrorist and \n     militant groups that murder innocent health care workers who \n     are striving to save the lives of children around the world;\n       (5) urges the international community of governments to \n     strengthen the support and security protection of health care \n     workers who risk their lives to provide polio vaccinations; \n     and\n\n[[Page S7538]]\n\n       (6) encourages continued commitment and funding by the \n     United States Government and international donors to the \n     global effort to rid the world of polio.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 271--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT UNITED \n STATES MILITARY ASSISTANCE FOR CAMBODIA SHOULD BE SUSPENDED UNTIL AN \n INDEPENDENT AND CREDIBLE INVESTIGATION OCCURS INTO THE JULY 28, 2013, \nPARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, AND ELECTION REFORMS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED BY \n                       THE GOVERNMENT OF CAMBODIA\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 271\n\n       Whereas independent domestic and international \n     organizations have raised serious concerns regarding the \n     integrity of the parliamentary elections held in Cambodia on \n     July 28, 2013;\n       Whereas, according to Human Rights Watch, ``the Cambodian \n     government-controlled National Election Committee (NEC) has \n     failed to address credible allegations of voter fraud and \n     other irregularities or systematic unfairness in the election \n     process'';\n       Whereas opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) \n     leader Sam Rainsy noted in an October 7, 2013, Cambodia Daily \n     op-ed article that the inaugural meeting of the newly formed \n     government was boycotted by 55 CNRP-elected parliamentarians \n     as a result of the refusal of the ruling Cambodian People's \n     Party to address ``shocking election irregularities'' that \n     allegedly denied CNRP additional parliamentary seats;\n       Whereas United Nations' Special Rapporteur for Human Rights \n     in Cambodia Surya P. Subedi noted that ``it is critical for \n     the new National Assembly to be represented by the two key \n     parties, for the National Assembly to be truly representative \n     of the whole of the Cambodian people and for it to be \n     concluded that the right to vote was effectively exercised on \n     28 July'';\n       Whereas in a September 23, 2013, statement, the United \n     States Embassy in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, called for ``a \n     transparent review of irregularities in the July 28 national \n     elections which would help efforts to assess and address \n     flaws in the electoral process and give the Cambodian people \n     greater confidence in the electoral system'';\n       Whereas the CNRP boycott calls into question the legitimacy \n     of the Cambodian National Assembly and government; and\n       Whereas the policy of the Administration of a strategic \n     rebalance toward the Asia Pacific Region should include \n     support for democracy, human rights, and justice in Cambodia: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States should suspend military assistance for Cambodia \n     until--\n       (1) an independent and credible investigation occurs into \n     the July 28, 2013, parliamentary elections in Cambodia, and \n     any recommendations arising out of such investigation are \n     fully implemented; and\n       (2) the Government of Cambodia, in consultation with civil \n     society and political parties in Cambodia, is implementing \n     election reforms to prevent incidents of fraud and abuse in \n     subsequent national and local elections in Cambodia.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 272--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING OCTOBER 20, 2013, \n                 AS ``NATIONAL CHARACTER COUNTS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nBlunt, Mr. Enzi, and Ms. Landrieu) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 272\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the United States requires that \n     the young people of the United States become an involved, \n     caring citizenry of good character;\n       Whereas the character education of children has become more \n     urgent, as violence by and against youth increasingly \n     threatens the physical and psychological well-being of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas, more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and the positive \n     effects that good character can have in personal \n     relationships, in school, and in the workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and that, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas, although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play an important role in fostering and \n     promoting good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the importance of \n     character education in preparing young people to play a role \n     in determining the future of the United States;\n       Whereas effective character education is based on core \n     ethical values, which form the foundation of a democratic \n     society;\n       Whereas examples of character are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and honesty;\n       Whereas elements of character transcend cultural, \n     religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the character and conduct of our youth reflect the \n     character and conduct of society, and, therefore, every adult \n     has the responsibility to teach and model ethical values and \n     every social institution has the responsibility to promote \n     the development of good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages individuals and organizations, \n     especially those that have an interest in the education and \n     training of the young people of the United States, to adopt \n     the elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society;\n       Whereas many schools in the United States recognize the \n     need, and have taken steps, to integrate the values of their \n     communities into their teaching activities; and\n       Whereas the establishment of ``National Character Counts \n     Week'', during which individuals, families, schools, youth \n     organizations, religious institutions, civic groups, and \n     other organizations focus on character education, is of great \n     benefit to the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning October 20, 2013, as \n     ``National Character Counts Week''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States and \n     interested groups--\n       (A) to embrace the elements of character identified by \n     local schools and communities, such as trustworthiness, \n     respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; \n     and\n       (B) to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, \n     programs, and activities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 273--DESIGNATING OCTOBER 26, 2013, AS ``DAY OF THE \n                               DEPLOYED''\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN (for himself, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Blunt, Mr. \nTester, and Ms. Heitkamp) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 273\n\n       Whereas more than 2,500,000 individuals serve as members of \n     the United States Armed Forces;\n       Whereas several hundred thousand members of the Armed \n     Forces rotate each year through deployments to over 150 \n     countries in every region of the world;\n       Whereas more than 2,300,000 members of the Armed Forces \n     have deployed to the area of operations of the United States \n     Central Command since the September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks;\n       Whereas the United States is kept strong and free by the \n     loyal military personnel from the active, National Guard, and \n     Reserve components, who protect the precious heritage of the \n     country through their positive declaration and actions;\n       Whereas members of the Armed Forces serving at home and \n     abroad have courageously answered the call to duty to defend \n     the ideals of the United States and to preserve peace and \n     freedom around the world;\n       Whereas members of the Armed Forces personify the virtues \n     of patriotism, service, duty, courage, and sacrifice;\n       Whereas the families of members of the Armed Forces make \n     important and significant sacrifices for the United States;\n       Whereas the Senate designated October 26 as ``Day of the \n     Deployed'' in 2011 and 2012; and\n       Whereas all 50 States designated October 26 as ``Day of the \n     Deployed'' in 2012: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 26, 2013, as ``Day of the \n     Deployed'';\n       (2) honors the deployed members of the United States Armed \n     Forces and their families;\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States to reflect on \n     the service of those members of the Armed Forces, wherever \n     they serve, past, present, and future; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     Day of the Deployed with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 274--SUPPORTING LIGHTS ON AFTERSCHOOL, A NATIONAL \n      CELEBRATION OF AFTERSCHOOL PROGRAMS HELD ON OCTOBER 17, 2013\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, \nMr. Baucus, Mr. Whitehouse, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Cochran, and Mrs. \nFeinstein) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n[[Page S7539]]\n\n                              S. Res. 274\n\n       Whereas more than 28,000,000 children in the United States \n     have parents who work outside the home and approximately \n     15,100,000 children in the United States have no place to go \n     after school;\n       Whereas high-quality programs that expand learning \n     opportunities for children, such as afterschool, before-\n     school, summer, and expanded learning programs, provide safe, \n     challenging, engaging, and fun learning experiences that help \n     children and youth develop social, emotional, physical, \n     cultural, and academic skills;\n       Whereas high-quality afterschool programs and high-quality \n     expanded learning programs provide students with hands-on, \n     engaging lessons that are aligned with the school day;\n       Whereas high-quality afterschool programs complement \n     regular and expanded school days, and support working \n     families by ensuring that the children of those families are \n     safe and productive during the hours parents are working;\n       Whereas high-quality afterschool programs engage families, \n     schools, and diverse community partners in advancing the \n     well-being of children and youth in the United States;\n       Whereas high-quality afterschool programs that partner with \n     high-quality community-based organizations build stronger \n     communities by integrating the school with the larger \n     community;\n       Whereas Lights On Afterschool, a national celebration of \n     afterschool, before-school, summer, and expanded learning \n     programs held on October 17, 2013, highlights the critical \n     importance of these high-quality programs in the lives of \n     children, their families, and their communities; and\n       Whereas nearly 2 in 5 afterschool programs report that \n     their budgets are in worse condition today than at the height \n     of the recession in 2008, and more than 3 in 5 afterschool \n     programs report that their level of funding is lower than it \n     was 3 years ago, making it difficult for afterschool programs \n     across the United States to keep their doors open and their \n     lights on: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports Lights On Afterschool, a \n     national celebration of afterschool programs held on October \n     17, 2013.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 24--PROVIDING FOR A CONDITIONAL \nADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE SENATE AND AN ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE OF \n                            REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. REID of Nevada submitted the following concurrent resolution; \nwhich was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Any such motion shall be debatable. In any case \n     in which such point of order is sustained against a \n     conference report (or Senate amendment derived from such \n     conference report by operation of this subsection), no \n     further amendment shall be in order.\n\n     SEC. 405.

SENSE OF SENATE ON UNDERUTILIZED FACILITIES OF THE \n                   NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION \n                   AND THEIR POTENTIAL USE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     (NASA) is the ninth largest real property holder of the \n     Federal Government, with more than 124,000 acres and more \n     than 4,900 buildings and other structures with a replacement \n     value of more than $30,000,000,000.\n       (2) The annual operation and maintenance costs of the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration have increased \n     steadily, and, as of 2012, the Administration has more than \n     $2,300,000,000 in annual deferred maintenance costs.\n       (3) According to Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the \n     Administration continues to retain real property that is \n     underutilized, does not have identified future mission uses, \n     or is duplicative of other assets in its real property \n     inventory.\n       (4) The Office of Inspector General, the Government \n     Accountability Office (GAO), and Congress have identified the \n     aging and duplicative infrastructure of the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration as a high priority and \n     longstanding management challenge.\n       (5) In the NASA Authorization Act of 2010, Congress \n     directed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to \n     examine its real property assets and downsize to fit current \n     and future missions and expected funding levels, paying \n     particular attention to identifying and removing unneeded or \n     duplicative infrastructure.\n       (6) The Office of Inspector General found at least 33 \n     facilities, including wind tunnels, test stands, airfields, \n     and launch infrastructure, that were underutilized or for \n     which National Aeronautics and Space Administration managers \n     could not identify a future mission use and that the need for \n     these facilities have declined in recent years as a result of \n     changes in the mission focus of the Administration, the \n     condition and obsolescence of some facilities, and the advent \n     of alternative testing methods.\n       (7) The Office of Inspector General found that the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration has taken steps to \n     minimize the costs of continuing to maintain some of these \n     facilities by placing them in an inactive state or leasing \n     them to other parties.\n       (8) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has a \n     series of initiatives underway that, in the judgment of the \n     Office of Inspector General, are ``positive steps towards \n     `rightsizing' its real property footprint'', and the Office \n     of Inspector General has concluded that ``it is imperative \n     that NASA move forward aggressively with its infrastructure \n     reduction efforts''.\n       (9) Existing and emerging United States commercial launch \n     and exploration capabilities are providing cargo \n     transportation to the International Space Station and offer \n     the potential for providing crew support, access to the \n     International Space Station, and missions to low Earth orbit \n     while the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     focuses its efforts on heavy-lift capabilities and deep space \n     missions.\n       (10) National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     facilities and property that are underutilized, duplicative, \n     or no longer needed for Administration requirements could be \n     utilized by commercial users and State and local entities, \n     resulting in savings for the Administration and a reduction \n     in the burden of the Federal Government to fund space \n     operations.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the levels in this concurrent resolution assume--\n       (1) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     should move forward with plans to reduce its infrastructure \n     and, to the greatest extent practicable, make property \n     available for lease to a government or private tenant or \n     report the property to the General Services Administration \n     (GSA) for sale or transfer to another entity;\n       (2) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     should pursue opportunities for streamlined sale or lease of \n     property and facilities, including for exclusive use, to a \n     private entity, or expedited conveyance or transfer to a \n     State or political subdivision, municipality, instrumentality \n     of a State, or Department of Transportation-licensed launch \n     site operators for the promotion of commercial or scientific \n     space activity and for developing and operating space launch \n     facilities; and\n       (3) leasing or transferring underutilized facilities and \n     properties to commercial space entities or State or local \n     governments will reduce operation and maintenance costs for \n     the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, save money \n     for the Federal Government, and promote commercial space and \n     the exploration goals of the Administration and the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/16/senate-section/article/S7558-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n         Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs\n\n  Mr. KAINE.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has just \nconfirmed Zach Fardon to serve as the next U.S. Attorney for the \nNorthern District of Illinois.\n  Mr. Fardon is going to be an outstanding U.S. Attorney. He has a \nsuperb resume. He served for six years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in \nChicago, where he worked on one of the highest-profile prosecutions in \nour state's history, the prosecution of Governor George Ryan. He also \nserved for several years as a First Assistant U.S. Attorney in \nNashville, which was the number 2 position in that office. \nAdditionally, he has experience working as a public defender in \nNashville, which has given him perspective from both sides of the \ncourtroom.\n  It is hard to imagine a more bipartisan nominee. Senator Mark Kirk \nand I worked together every step of the way in identifying our next \nU.S. Attorney. We established a blue-ribbon, bipartisan screening \ncommittee to evaluate candidates for this job. Our screening committee \nhighly recommended Mr. Fardon, and Senator Kirk and I agree that Mr. \nFardon is an outstanding pick.\n  Former U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, the man whose shoes Mr. \nFardon will fill, agrees that he is up to the task. When Mr. Fardon was \nnominated, Pat Fitzgerald said ``Zach is a wonderful person, a great \nlawyer and a natural leader.''\n  I want to commend and thank Gary Shapiro, who has served as Acting \nU.S. Attorney for over a year, for his service and his excellent work. \nHe has been a tremendous asset to the Northern District of Illinois. \nBut it is important to get Senate-confirmed leadership in place in this \noffice, and I believe Zach Fardon will do an outstanding job.\n  Now that the Senate has confirmed Mr. Fardon, he can get to work \naddressing the urgent problems of gang and gun crime in the Northern \nDistrict of Illinois. I have talked with Mr. Fardon about the need for \nthe U.S. Attorney's office to take a leading role in this fight, and he \nagrees.\n  I am glad that the Senate has taken this step today, and I wish Mr. \nFardon well as he takes on this new role. I look forward to working \nwith him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/16/senate-section/article/S7559-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NOMINATION DISCHARGED\n\n  Mr. REID.
