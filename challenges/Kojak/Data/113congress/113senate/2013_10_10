Mr. President, I would object to any further proceedings \nwith respect to these measures en bloc.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The measures will be placed on the calendar.\n  Mr. REID. The President issued a warning to Congress:\n\n       The full consequences of a default by the United States--or \n     even the prospect of a default by the United States--are \n     impossible to predict and awesome to contemplate. Denigration \n     of the full faith and credit of the United States would have \n     substantial effects on the domestic financial markets and the \n     value of the dollar in exchange markets.\n\n  The President went on to warn of ``risks, the costs, the disruptions, \nand the incalculable damage'' of failing to avert such a default.\n  This is not Barack Obama; this was Ronald Reagan in 1983.\n  Four years later in 1987, Reagan again warned Congress about the \nimpacts of a default on the economy. He said:\n\n       This brinkmanship threatens the holders of government bonds \n     and those who rely on Social Security and veterans benefits. \n     Interest rates would skyrocket, instability would occur in \n     the financial markets, and the Federal deficit would soar.\n\n  Yet three decades later, an alarming number of Republicans have \ndenied or downplayed the seriousness of a first-ever default on the \nfull faith and credit of the United States.\n  To these default deniers, east is west, north is south, black is \nwhite, and right is wrong.\n\n[[Page S7358]]\n\n  Let's talk about what raising the debt actually means. It simply \nmeans we are going to pay our bills. It is not a vote to spend more \nmoney to authorize new programs or to buy new things. It is a vote to \npay the bills.\n  The Federal Government has already incurred these bills, bills for \nroads and bridges--we have already built them--the warships we have \nalready commissioned, wars that have been waged and tax breaks that \nhave been charged on a national credit card.\n  A vote to avert default is a vote to pay the bills for all these and \nmore.\n  Many Republicans are in the press today, and have been for the past \nweek or 10 days, arguing, Why worry about it? It will all work out.\n  These same Republicans who argue that we should default on the \nNation's bills voted time and time again to spend borrowed money, and a \nlot of it, without any regard for the long-term effect it would have. \nThese Republicans voted to sell government bonds to China, Saudi \nArabia, and Japan to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Republican Senators have come to this floor and lamented raising the \ndebt. We have to raise this debt because of two unpaid wars costing \ntrillions of dollars; tax breaks for the wealthy costing trillions of \ndollars, all given to the rich with borrowed money; wars fought with \nborrowed money.\n  During the Bush administration, these same Republicans were happy to \nrun up America's credit cards to the tune of trillions of dollars. \nTheir theory was lower the taxes; it will be great for the economy. \nThey are now howling about the debts they created, the debts they voted \nfor. Never mind that with little help from Republicans in Congress, \nPresident Barack Obama has reduced the ratio of deficit to gross \ndomestic product from 9 percent to 4 percent. This is very good, in \nspite of the debt he has been trying to get charge of; it wasn't his.\n  Now that the bill for the Republicans' excesses has come due, the \nbills for wars they supported and the tax cuts they have received, they \nare not willing to pay them. They want to walk out on that check.\n  Many of these same Republicans also say we can avoid default by \nprioritizing whom to pay and when we pay them. They say we should pay \nforeign debtholders first. They all agree with that. China would be \nfirst, then Saudi Arabia, and maybe Japan.\n  We shouldn't and couldn't pay Social Security recipients under that \nscenario, veterans or Medicare. No matter how much we would want to, we \ncouldn't do it. There would be no money to do it. In addition to having \nshockingly skewed priorities, Republicans are also using very flawed \nlogic.\n  Here is a real-world example. Let us say the Presiding Officer has a \nmortgage, car payment, and a cell phone bill. The Presiding Officer has \nto decide: Which one should I pay? I can't pay them all. Which one \nshould I pay?\n  It doesn't matter if the Presiding Officer picks one of them because \nhe has defaulted anyway. He can't pay his bills. He likely would never \nbe able to buy another car, cell phone, certainly not a house. His \ncredit would be ruined for the foreseeable future.\n  The same thing would happen to our country. One week from today--and \nthat is not a definite time, it could be a couple days before or a \ncouple of days after, but we are there; let's say a week from now and \nuse that as a point of reference--the United States has no money. It \ncan't borrow any money. The Federal Government paid China but failed to \npay Social Security recipients, unemployment benefits or the salaries \nof our brave men and women fighting in uniform.\n  The damage not only to our credit rating, world credit rating, but \nalso to our global reputation would be profound and irreversible. The \nrisks, the costs, the disruptions and the damage would be incalculable. \nThis is what President Ronald Reagan said.\n  Why don't they listen to this man they say is such a great leader--\nand was. I agree. He was a tremendous President. I didn't agree with \nhim all the time, but he was a real leader. He, more than anyone else, \nis responsible for ending the Cold War. There are many who say he \ncouldn't fit in the Republican Party of today.\n  Robert Dole, who was the majority leader of the Senate from the State \nof Kansas, a patriotic American, said himself he doesn't fit in the \nRepublican Party today.\n  The stakes couldn't be higher. A global economic recession, and \npossibly even depression, face this great country. This is why \nPresident Obama reached out to House Republicans, inviting them to the \nWhite House yesterday afternoon for a serious discussion. Guess what \nthey said. We are too busy. We will send a few of us, but we are too \nbusy. Remember, the House is led by this same man who said he wanted to \nhave a conversation, but they are unwilling to have one with him.\n  I was disappointed to hear that the same intractable Republican \nleaders who caused the current government shutdown were unwilling to \neven allow their Members to meet with the President for a constructive \nconversation. Again, they will send--I think they picked 17 out of the \n232 they have. This great conversation is one they don't want.\n  They want to talk, but their actions tell another story. They have \ncaused enough economic turmoil with the reckless shutdown of the \nFederal Government. If that is not enough, now we have the debt ceiling \ncoming in about 1 week. If Republicans force default on the Nation's \ndebt, it would be magnitudes worse than the damage they have already \ncaused our great country with this senselessly created government \nshutdown.\n  Yesterday, Fidelity, the Nation's largest mutual fund manager, with \n$500 billion in assets, announced it would sell all of its short-term \ngovernment bonds because of the threat of default. Today there will be \nmore.\n  Yesterday, government bonds were considered the safest investment in \nthe world. Will they be so tomorrow? Time will only tell. If the United \nStates fails to pay its bills, that safe haven will disappear very \nquickly.\n  We are going to vote Saturday on the ability to proceed to a clean \ndebt ceiling. We will find out how Senate Republicans wish to proceed. \nEconomists say the consequences of not paying our bills, not extending \nthe debt ceiling, would be immediate and catastrophic. This isn't a \nbunch of Harvard leftwingers.\n  Even Republican economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin said debt deniers are \ndead wrong. He said a failure to raise the debt ceiling leads to very \nbad economic outcomes and chaos in financial markets.\n  Fidelity's move is only the first sign of economic chaos and will \ncontinue to spread the closer America comes to defaulting on its bills. \nWith every day that passes, it is more and more important for \nRepublicans to stop denying the reality of default and start working \nwith us to find common ground.\n  All we have said is open the government. Let us pay our bills. We \nwill negotiate with them on anything. We will have a conversation with \nthem about anything. Open the government. Let us pay our bills. Then we \nwill negotiate.\n\n\n                     Recognition of Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                            The Debt Ceiling\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to start this morning by \nquoting something my good friend the majority leader said back in \n2007--back when Congress was weighing whether to raise the debt \nceiling. Here is what the majority leader said back then:\n\n       Until we change the policies that led down this path, we \n     will be back year after year, digging the hole ever deeper.\n\n  And, of course, that is essentially what so many Americans are saying \ntoday: If we are going to address the debt ceiling, then let's also \naddress the root causes of the debt. It just makes good sense.\n  One would think our friend the majority leader would continue to \nagree with this logic as well, but that is not what he has been saying \nlately. He is basically saying that it would be irresponsible for \nCongress to address the most pressing problem we face in the country, \nthat it would be reckless to raise the debt ceiling if that also meant \ndoing something about the debt. In other words, he now seems to think \nthe best thing to do about our crushing Federal debt is to do nothing \nat all. That is why my friend the majority leader introduced \nlegislation this week to now allow another $1 trillion to be added to \nthe debt with no strings attached at all, none, just a $1 trillion\n\n[[Page S7359]]\n\ndebt ceiling increase: Just keep raising the credit card limit and \nletting someone else deal with it later on.\n  We now have a debt close to $17 trillion--nearly double what it was \nin 2007. We are borrowing nearly $2 billion a day--$2 billion a day--\nand apparently our friends on the other side are fine with that. They \nwant us to give Washington a free pass to borrow and spend $1 trillion \nmore. He is so comfortable with all of this, my friend the majority \nleader rejected the President's own proposal this week to do a short-\nterm increase followed by a negotiation on reforms.\n  Well, in my view, we were sent here to solve problems, not to defer \nthem. We were sent here to confront the challenges of the moment, not \nignore them. That is why the majority leader's proposal just won't fly, \nbecause it is completely at odds with the wishes of most Americans. And \nthat is something the President and a lot of other Senate Democrats \nagreed with when a Republican President was asking for a debt limit \nincrease. Of course, the problem is a lot more serious now than it was \nback then.\n  Here is something else. Neither side wants to default on our debts. \nNeither side will allow it. That is certainly the case, and people \nshould know that. It is irresponsible to do nothing about the debt, and \nit is irresponsible to be stirring up anxiety about default, but that \ndoesn't mean the American people are wrong to ask that a debt limit \nincrease include reforms aimed at actually tackling the problems that \ngot us in this position in the first place, especially since what our \ncountry has routinely done in the past is just that.\n  Going back to the Eisenhower administration, requests to raise the \ndebt ceiling have often been tied to important fiscal reforms--nearly \ntwo dozen times going back to the Eisenhower administration. That is \nhow we got the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings reforms in the 1980s. That is how \nwe achieved balanced budgets in the 1990s. That is how we secured \nsignificant spending reductions in President Obama's first term--\nspending reductions on which he later campaigned.\n  Now President Obama seems to think Congress should just increase the \nborrowing limit on his already maxed-out credit card without a single \nnegotiation. He seems to think the representatives of the American \npeople should just do what he says when he says it and because he says \nit, no questions asked--no questions asked. You know, that is not just \nirresponsible, it is not the way Presidents of both parties have dealt \nwith this problem in the past. Reagan negotiated, Clinton negotiated, \nand if President Obama wants America to increase the credit limit, he \nwill negotiate too.\n  I would also like to address one of the President's favorite talking \npoints these days. He says he won't negotiate over ``the bills Congress \nhas already racked up.'' Look, if the President actually believed his \nown talking point, he wouldn't threaten to veto virtually every \nRepublican attempt to get spending under control. We have tried \nendlessly. The only times we can even get him to discuss sensible \nbudget reforms is when he is absolutely forced to--when Washington has \nto deal with things like the debt ceiling. So let's drop the tired \ntalking points and just get about negotiating.\n  I know the President doesn't like the fact that Americans elected a \ndivided government, but they did. We have a divided government, and no \nmatter how much he tries to divide us, at the end of the day he is \ngoing to have to deal with a Congress he doesn't entirely control.\n  The American people can be persuaded to raise the debt ceiling, but \nthey are not in any mood to simply hand over a blank check. They are \nlooking for sensible reforms. So if the President wants to increase his \ncredit limit, let's get to the table and negotiate. He has been \ninviting Members of Congress to the White House this week. In fact, we \nwere told earlier today that Senate Republicans have been invited to \nmeet with the President tomorrow morning. That is a good start but only \nif it means he has decided to drop his refusal to negotiate on \nsolutions. But if this is just a meeting where he simply reiterates \nthat he won't negotiate, then it certainly won't be very productive.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 1 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I received an email this morning from an \nold friend. He is the father of a disabled veteran. This veteran is a \nquadriplegic--a victim of a roadside bomb in Iraq. He has gone through \nmultiple surgeries. At some point most people would have given up on \nhim. In fact, they even talked about, at the age of 24, his being sent \nto a nursing home for the rest of his life. His father said: No, we are \nnot going to let that happen to our son. He brought him to Chicago, \nwhere he received extraordinary treatment at the Rehabilitation \nInstitute, and he started his slow, steady climb back to life. He is \nhome now. He is a father, married, has two small children, and his mom \nand dad live with him to help out. The people in the community he lives \nin--it is not in Illinois, it is in North Carolina--have been so \ngenerous, building the perfect home for him and his wheelchair and \ngiving him as many opportunities as he could possibly enjoy in his \nlife.\n  This is a great story of a great family and a great American hero. \nBut his father wrote me an email today and said: We are worried. We are \nworried about the November disability check. Senator, we need it. We \nneed that check.\n  I wrote back to him and I said: I will move Heaven and Earth and do \neverything I can to make sure that payment is made.\n  And I believe it will be made. Somehow, it will be made. But I had to \ntell him that we are facing an unnecessary crisis in America created by \npoliticians on Capitol Hill.\n  Shutting down the government of the United States of America? What \ndoes that say about our Nation? What does it say about us in the Senate \nand the House that we have reached this point, that we are deciding \ntoday on the four or five bills that just passed the House? The House \nhas decided what little agency of government, what little spending \nprogram they will approve each day--each day. It is estimated it will \ntake them almost 2\\1/2\\ months to fully fund the government at this \npace--2\\1/2\\ months of uncertainty as they decide day by day what \nlittle program, what little agency they will reopen. Well, that is just \nplain wrong, and every time they have offered that, we have said to \nthem: Open the government. It is essential.\n  There was a story 2 or 3 days ago about five American families who \nwere notified that they had lost their sons and daughters, who were \nkilled in Afghanistan. Traditionally, the U.S. Government comes through \nquickly after that tragic information is shared with the family and \ngives them a financial helping hand to arrange for them to come to \nDover, DE, for the arrival and return of their fallen hero. But because \nof the government shutdown brought on by the Republicans, there was a \nquestion as to whether we could even make that payment.\n  Luckily, a charity stepped forward--Fisher House. This is an \nextraordinary charity that does so many great things for veterans who \nare disabled and need help. They said: We are going to step in and help \nthese families until the government gets its act together, until the \npoliticians reopen the government.\n  Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced yesterday this new \ndevelopment. Well, God bless the Fisher House charity, but it shouldn't \nhave been necessary. If we had done our job, it wouldn't be necessary; \nthe government would be open; this family whom I love, with this \ndisabled veteran, wouldn't be worried about that next check if we \nsimply did the responsible thing and opened the government.\n  Then there is a second issue which, although hard to believe, is even \nlarger in scope. The Republicans refuse to give us a chance to extend \nthe debt ceiling of America. What is the debt ceiling? This morning I \nlistened as the minority leader said it is raising the credit card \nlimit. No, it isn't. That is not an accurate statement. It is raising \nthe authority of our government to borrow money to pay for what we have \nalready spent. Many of the same politicians who voted for the spending \nbills\n\n[[Page S7360]]\n\nnow don't want to pay for them. They do not want to extend this debt \nceiling--the credit of the United States. That is totally \nirresponsible. It is like ordering the biggest meal on the menu and \nthen refusing to pay when the bill comes. That is where they stand. \nThat is what they are arguing.\n  But it gets even worse. It will be the first time in the history of \nthe United States of America that we will have defaulted on our \nnational debt--the first time we have called into question the full \nfaith and credit of the United States of America. How serious is that? \nLet me tell you how serious it is. Pick up the morning paper. ``World \nleaders fear a default by U.S.'' in the Washington Post. I read it, and \nit says:\n\n       That default scenario is bringing increasingly urgent pleas \n     from foreign leaders, some who describe their grave concern, \n     others who chide the United States about the risks of \n     political brinkmanship, beg its leaders to act responsibly \n     and wonder whether the world's superpower is showing some \n     cracks.\n\n  Now, are you ready for this? Do you know who was preaching to us \nyesterday about responsibility in governing the United States of \nAmerica? Are you ready for this? This is a quote from Russian President \nVladimir Putin:\n\n       This is highly important for all of us. I am hopeful that \n     all the political forces in the United States will be able to \n     resolve this crisis as quickly as possible.\n\n  So now we are being preached to by President Putin about how to run a \ncountry. Well, that is embarrassing, and it is totally unnecessary. The \nfailure to extend the debt limit of the United States is irresponsible \nand reckless.\n  It isn't only the Russians who are calling us to task but our closest \nally, the United Kingdom. This is what an analyst in London's financial \ndistrict had to say:\n\n       The outlook for the British economy is decent but still \n     fairly fragile. Anything like a U.S. debt default with \n     significant global repercussions would be bad news for the \n     U.K.\n\n  That is a quote from Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global \nInsight in London.\n  The Japanese, now emerging from a terrible economic circumstance, one \nof our greatest creditors, are worried about their debtor, the United \nStates, paying its debts. Is anyone else embarrassed by this? We all \nshould be. This is the creation of politicians in Washington.\n  The Republican shutdown, the Republican refusal to extend the debt \nceiling is irresponsible and reckless. It will not only hurt these \nforeign nations, it will not only hurt the reputation of the United \nStates as an economic leader in the world, it is going to hurt families \nand businesses all over the United States. But don't take the word of \nthis Democratic Senator; go to the Business Roundtable, one of the \nstrongest supporters of the Republicans in Congress. They sent us a \nletter last week and called the default on America's debt catastrophic, \nbegging Republicans and Democrats not to do anything this senseless.\n  What impact will it have on families? Hold on tight. Watch what \nhappens as we get up to this cliff or go over it when it comes to the \ndebt ceiling. You can follow it every day. If you have a mutual fund, \nif you own a stock, if you have a savings account, or if you have a \nretirement account, you can watch it melt away as the politicians give \ntheir speeches on Capitol Hill.\n  It is totally irresponsible and reckless.\n  We need to open this government. We need to pay our bills. We can sit \ndown and negotiate everything and anything--that is the offer that has \nbeen made--only after we have met our responsibilities.\n  Let me also add that Speaker Boehner said last week and some of us \nwere relieved to hear it: There will never be a default on America's \ndebt. He followed that up within 24 hours with a list of nonnegotiable \nconditions before he would agree to that. That is not responsible. It \nis reckless. It is reckless political conduct. How can we do this to \nthe families, to businesses, to the farmers, and to our allies around \nthe world?\n  It is time to say, as the Chaplain of the Senate did yesterday, \nenough is enough. It is time for grownups to stand up on the other side \nof the aisle and join grownups on this side of the aisle to do the \nright thing: Open the government, pay our bills, sit down, and honestly \nnegotiate through these issues. We don't have much time. October 17 is \nthe deadline. Today is October 10. We have 1 week before the bottom \nfalls out of our economy and the economies around the world.\n  I listened to economists on the other side, the so-called really \nconservative economists, say: It really doesn't matter. We can default. \nWe really don't need to extend our debt ceiling. These flat-earth \neconomists are the same folks who are in denial when it comes to other \nscientific evidence in so many other areas, whether it is climate \nchange or evolution--you pick it. They are entitled to their views, as \nfringe as they may be, as extreme as they may be. But to think that \nMembers of Congress, Members of the Senate are buying this line of \nbaloney is hard to understand and impossible to justify to the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I think one of the things we ought to be \nobserving, here at least, is courteous rules among ourselves. This is \nmeant to be the greatest deliberative body in the world. If we follow \nthe rules, follow the regular order, follow the committee process, and \nfollow the ways through the committee processes for resolving \ndisagreements and disputes, I think we can get through this.\n  I believe on both sides of the aisle there are pragmatic people \ndevoted to this country who want to solve the two major problems we \nhave facing us right this minute; that is, to reopen government, \nbecause we are now in the 10th day of a shutdown; and, No. 2, to meet \nthe debt obligations of the United States of America as mandated in the \n14th Amendment of the Constitution.\n  I call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and on both \nsides of the dome: Let's reopen government. Let's pay our bills. And \nlet's get through the regular committee processes to solve our \nproblems.\n  There are those on the other side of the dome in the House of \nRepresentatives that are proposing a new supercommittee. We have been \nthere, and we have done that. After the 2011 crisis, when we faced our \ndebt limit, there was a process put in place called a supercommittee. \nIt went nowhere. This new idea will go nowhere as well. It is a new \nprocess that will only result in more delay.\n  I think we have two supercommittees. I call them supercommittees \nbecause they are great committees. They are wonderful committees. That \nis the Budget Committee chaired by Senator Patty Murray and her ranking \nmember Senator Jeff sessions, himself a distinguished judge from \nAlabama, so he knows about conflict resolution. There is the \nAppropriations Committee that deals with discretionary spending, \nchaired by me and my vice chairman Senator Richard Shelby, again a \nseasoned fiscal conservative who knows how to concentrate on the bottom \nline so we can be a more frugal government but also be an effective \ngovernment. Let that committee do its job.\n  There is also the Finance Committee chaired by Senator Max Baucus. I \nknow the ranking member Senator Grassley from Iowa is on the floor. He \nhas an incredible history of being a compassionate conservative and he \nknows the Tax Code and knows the values of Iowa--which is, let's put \ncountry above party.\n  Instead of inventing new committees and new processes, free us up to \ndo our job. Free us up to be able to do what the committee process is \nmeant to be able to do.\n  For me and the Appropriations Committee, we moved all of our \nappropriations bills. We are ready to come to the floor. We are ready \nto go to conference if called up, if we have a method for being able to \nmove. We are ready to do it.\n  Senator Murray on the Budget Committee is ready to go to conference \nwith the House. But 21 times she was blocked by 6 naysayers primarily \nrepresenting a tea party, small faction within the Republican Party.\n  The Republican Party, the Grand Old Party, has traditionally \nunderstood that you maintain the values of the country, that you are \nfiscally conservative, but you follow the rules that were established. \nThe rules of the Budget Committee passed by the Senate in the Budget \nControl Act say they\n\n[[Page S7361]]\n\nwere supposed to have their job done on April 15. Well, we moved the \nbudget on March 23, over 200 days ago, and over 20 requests to go to \nconference with me, with Congressman Paul Ryan, and with his House \ncounterparts to work out what our discretionary spending should be. \nWhat should our revenues be? What should we evaluate in terms of our \nmandatory spending where we can take a look at it but not shrink those \nearned benefits like Social Security and VA benefits that people count \non and work their whole life for and even put their life on the line? \nWe have to be able to do our job.\n  I will tell you what has been the latest situation that has so \nshocked me. We are on the verge of being a deadbeat nation. We are on \nthe verge of being a global deadbeat nation. What is a deadbeat? A \ndeadbeat is someone who does not meet their financial obligations.\n  Over the last 3 days, we have heard about how the families of the men \nand women who died in the line of duty serving their country and are \nentitled to a death benefit were not going to get it because of the \ngovernment shutdown.\n  The Fisher family--well known for serving military families, well \nknown and so deeply cherished--offered to step forward to pay that. The \nphilanthropy of the United States, instead of the public responsibility \nof the United States.\n  I want to thank the Fisher family for stepping forward. But, my gosh, \nwhat humiliation. We are the United States of America, with the \nstrongest and best military in the world, and to honor its obligation \nto its own, the United States has to borrow money for a death benefit. \nThat is deadbeat. I think it is humiliating. I think it is despicable. \nIt shows just how low we have sunk.\n  We can get it back. It is in our power because this isn't being \ninflicted on us. This is what is being inflicted on us by other \nAmericans sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States of \nAmerica. When they took that obligation, they didn't take that \nobligation to just uphold the Amendments they like--like the second \none--but they took that obligation to uphold all of the Amendments.\n  Let's start with the 14th, which says that the debt of the United \nStates of America should not be called into question. That is clearly \nin the Constitution. No matter what, America will pay its bills. The \nreliability of the United States of America to meet its debt \nobligations is the financial glue that helps to hold the global economy \ntogether.\n  I am not going to go into doomsday or Armageddon or whatever. But if \nyou actually read what the ambassadors of China and Japan--one a great \nally and the other a formidable competitor--say: We are holding your \ndebt. Pay your bills, or a fiscal crisis will begin to unravel in your \ncountry and around the world.\n  We cannot be a deadbeat nation. If we are a superpower, we must first \nof all show our power by meeting our financial obligations. How we get \nour public house in order by reducing our public debt is the subject \nagain of the Appropriations Committee, the Budget Committee, and the \nFinance Committee. We have the capability to do it. I am really calling \nupon my friends on the other side of the aisle--and there are many. And \nit is not that we are pals. It is because we have come together out of \nmutual respect to solve mutual problems, being of help to each other \nmutually, that we have been able to keep the government functioning and \ndoing it in a way that is smart and affordable.\n  So I say, please, let's reopen government. I am calling upon the \nHouse to pass the Senate continuing fiscal funding resolution that \nwould reopen government on November 15 and that process to lay the \ngroundwork for resolving our appropriations bills and canceling \nsequester.\n  I call upon those six that are blocking us--meaning the Senate--from \ngoing to the Budget Committee to do this. Those are two simple acts \nwithin our power to do. I hope that we can do it.\n  I intended today to speak about how the shutdown is affecting \nMaryland. We are really being hard hit. Maryland and Virginia have the \nlargest concentration of Federal agencies, both civilian and military, \nin America. And, gee, we are proud of that. We are so proud of the fact \nthat we have the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \nwhich works with our private sector that enables us to sell products \naround the world.\n  We are so proud of the fact that we have the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, to make sure that \nwe are looking out for large and small, whether it is to make sure that \nour mattresses are not flammable or that our cribs and swimming pools \nare safe for our children. I am proud of those agencies.\n  I am sorry that my Federal employees are not working. It is having a \nterrible impact on the Maryland economy. Both our comptroller and our \nGovernor are talking about the significant amount of lost revenue that \nwe are having because people aren't working and they aren't buying. If \nyou talk to small businesses where these agencies are located, it is \njust terrible.\n  I just want to tell one story. The Social Security Administration is \nheadquartered in Maryland in a community called Woodlawn, a wonderful \ncommunity with a vibrant, civic engagement. It is just great. Across \nthe street from the Social Security Administration is a small business \ncalled the Salsa Grill. It is usually crowded with lunch hour people, \nearly morning coffee, those little baby showers that we women like to \nhave or a birthday party the guys are throwing for one of their pals at \nlunchtime. The Salsa Grill last Friday, instead of 30 customers, had 3. \nThe owner was quoted as saying if the shutdown goes on much longer, he \nwon't be able to hang on any longer. This is what makes our economy \ngreat.\n  I talked to one of the largest automobile dealers in Maryland. The \nshowrooms were empty in the Baltimore-Washington corridor last weekend, \neven though they had wonderful cars, new cars. They were ready to do \ndeals for the old 2013 models they wanted to move out--empty; empty. \nThis ripples through our economy. This is not just, ``Oh, we are going \nto contain government.'' We are hurting ourselves.\n  The fight about ObamaCare is over. Let's say goodbye to that fight. \nLet's get on to the fiscal issues of the United States of America. I \nsay here, as the chair of the Appropriations Committee, I am ready to \nnegotiate. I am ready to meet, to compromise, to see how we can have \nour domestic and defense discretionary spending done in a way that \nbegins to reduce our public debt but will also have a progrowth way of \npublic investments, making sure our country is safe, that we are \nbuilding roads, building the superinformation highway, educating our \nyoung people, and doing research and development.\n  I know my time is up, but I believe very strongly that we have to \nsolve our problems. I am ready to say to the other side of the aisle \nthat I am ready to work together. That is because I have done it in the \npast. We actually like doing it, for us pragmatists to get into a room, \nsolve problems, give and take, and actually learn from each other. I \ncould give many examples of that.\n  Right now we need to set the example for the world that we are the \ngreatest deliberative body. We have to get back to deliberating instead \nof delaying.\n  Please, for the House, pass the continuing funding resolution. For \nthe Senate, limit your objection to the Budget Committee going into \nconference. Let's reopen the government, let's pay our bills, and sit \ndown and negotiate in a way worthy of a great country, and let's honor \nthe Constitution of the United States.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments by the \ndistinguished chair of the Appropriations Committee. As she said, she \nis ready to meet, ready to negotiate, ready to compromise, ready to \nwork together.\n  I come today to say tomorrow Republican Senators are finally going to \nget a chance to talk with President Obama about reopening the \ngovernment and dealing with the debt this Nation has, dealing with the \ndebt limit.\n  Until very recently, President Obama has been far more interested in \nspeaking with the press than in actually speaking with Republicans. \nThen we have this invitation to the White House. This morning in the \nWashington Post, what the administration\n\n[[Page S7362]]\n\nsays--it is a front-page article and it continues over to page 4--it \nsays the White House ``emphasized that Obama will not be negotiating.''\n  We have the chair of the Appropriations Committee saying she is ready \nto meet, negotiate, and compromise, and the White House says President \nObama will not be negotiating.\n  The question is, why are we going over to the White House in the \nfirst place if the President is not interested in negotiating? Is it \njust to give him a photo op? I went to meetings like that during the \nhealth care debate more than 3 years ago. The President at the time \nwould invite Republicans to a meeting and then he would reject every \nidea we would offer. If he had been more willing to accept Republican \nideas, negotiate then, we would have had a bipartisan health reform \nbill that was accepted by the American people instead of a law that \ncontinues to have more people opposed than in favor of it.\n  That is going to be my message to the President tomorrow morning when \nwe meet. This needs to be a real discussion, a real negotiation, when \nwe agree on how we can reopen the Government, reduce our debt and help \nour economy grow. This is the sixth time in 5 years that President \nObama has requested an increase in the debt ceiling. How much is he \nasking for? According to the majority leader, I understand it is $1 \ntrillion to extend between now until after the 2014 election.\n  That is an incredible amount of money. Just trying to figure out how \nmuch money that is, it is over $1 million a minute. It is $1 million \nevery minute between now and 14 months from now. The President needs to \nrealize that is unsustainable. We have a $17 trillion debt. It is a \ndebt on the back of our children and our grandchildren. We have \nfamilies all across the country who have aspirations, anxieties, and \nanger about even the idea that their children and grandchildren will \nnot be able to get careers, get jobs.\n  If we as a nation are going to incur more debt, we also have to find \nreal savings. We cannot continue to increase our credit card debt, \nanother new credit card after the President has maxed out the last one, \nand send this bill to the American people. It is time to set \npriorities. We want to get moving on real solutions, not just to our \nshort-term problems but the long-term issues that face us as a nation \nas we try to work together in governing this Nation.\n  The House of Representatives has passed 12 individual continuing \nresolutions. These bills would open many different parts of the \ngovernment right now, parts that we all agree should be kept operating. \nThe House voted to pay for FEMA, Head Start, the National Institutes of \nHealth, to open our national parks. Those bills have been sent to the \nSenate. They have been sitting here without action at all.\n  Here in the Senate I know a lot of Democrats are saying they support \nthese functions. We see this picture on the front page of the \nWashington Post this morning with the mayor, Mayor Vincent Gray, the \nmayor of Washington, DC, on the steps of the Capitol, talking to the \nmajority leader saying, ``Sir, we are not a department of the \ngovernment. We are simply trying to be able to spend our own money.'' \nYet the majority leader, who is blocking these votes to allow the \nDistrict of Columbia to do what they are requesting and what the House \nhas said yes, they should be able to do, the majority leader is saying, \n``Don't screw it up, OK? Don't screw it up.''\n  The majority leader continues to object to votes on these bills. \nHistory supports bipartisan action of the House and not the \nstonewalling of the President and the Democratic leadership in the \nSenate.\n  In the middle of the last government shutdown, Congress passed and \nPresident Clinton signed laws to allow a wide variety of specific \nprograms to function. It is a precedent we should be following today.\n  The President also keeps saying he will not negotiate on the debt \nlimit. He tries to make people believe that never before has Congress \nincluded ``issues that have nothing to do with the budget and nothing \nto do with the debt''--this is the President's quote--in its \nnegotiation over the debt limit.\n  The facts are not on the President's side. Even the Fact Checker in \nthe Washington Post gave the President four Pinocchios on that claim, \nessentially saying it was completely not true. Negotiations have \nactually occurred many times on the debt limit.\n  From 1978 until 2013, the debt limit has been raised 53 times. Of \nthose votes, the debt ceiling increase was linked to something else \nmore than half the time. So more than half of the debt limit increase \nvotes since 1978 carried other provisions. They were not, as the \nPresident claims, clean increases.\n\n  The President wants to ignore that history. The President wants to \npretend that raising the debt limit is something that has to be done \nwithout any deliberations, negotiations, dissent, and on his terms \nalone. He says he will not negotiate at all.\n  It is strange to be coming from his mouth because that is very \ndifferent from the position that came out of his mouth when he was \nSenator Obama. That was not that many years ago. In 2006, Senator Obama \nvoted against a debt limit increase because he said it was a sign that \nWashington cannot pay its bills. Senator Obama complained that the \nFederal debt had increased by $5 trillion in 5 years. Under President \nObama, Washington's debt has grown by more than $6 trillion in 4 years.\n  Senator Obama said, ``The more we depend on foreign nations to lend \nus money, the more our economic security is tied to the whims of \nforeign leaders whose interests might not be aligned with ours.''\n  Under President Obama, foreign holdings of Federal debt have \nincreased by 82 percent.\n  Senator Obama said that, ``Washington is shifting the burden of bad \nchoices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren.'' He \nsaid at the time, ``America has a debt problem, and a failure of \nleadership.''\n  A debt problem and a failure of leadership.\n  President Obama is now asking for his sixth increase in debt in less \nthan 5 years. Why is this, then, not a debt problem and a failure of \nleadership?\n  Senator Obama was right to say at the time we have a debt problem. \nPresident Obama should remember what made him say that in 2006, and do \nsomething about it now. He should join Republicans willing to talk \nabout real entitlement reform as part of negotiations over raising the \ndebt ceiling. He should be willing and anxious to talk about his health \ncare law and how it is going to become a major factor driving \nWashington's debt even higher in the future if we do not replace it \nwith responsible reforms today.\n  The President should embrace bipartisan continuing resolutions passed \nby the House as a way of reopening as much of the government as \npossible while we have responsible and reasonable discussions, \ndeliberations, and negotiations. President Obama should stop posturing, \nstop playing games, and stop punishing the American people as he has \nbeen doing under this current government shutdown.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday we learned that for the \nremainder of the government shutdown one of America's great charitable \norganizations, the Fisher House Foundation, will provide survivor \nbenefits to military families who have lost a loved one on the field of \nbattle. Fisher House is really just almost too good to believe, a \nwonderful charity that has helped military families all across our \ncountry, including folks in seven different facilities in Texas, from \nthe VA North Texas Health Care System to the William Beaumont Army \nMedical Center in El Paso, the Carl R. Darnall Medical Center, the \nMichael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center, to the Brooke Army Medical Center \nin San Antonio, the Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, and the \nSouth Texas Veterans Health Care System. I personally extend my thanks \nand express my gratitude to Fisher House for making such a tremendous \ncommitment to our military heroes and making such a generous offer for \nthe families of the fallen.\n\n[[Page S7363]]\n\n  Secretary Hagel was quoted when he announced that Fisher House was \ngoing to fill the gap left by the cutoff of Federal funds, saying he \nwas ``offended, outraged, and embarrassed that the government shutdown \nhad prevented the Department of Defense from fulfilling this most \nsacred responsibility in a timely manner.''\n  I agree with his outrage and sense of offense and embarrassment. But \nI want to recall how we got here. If our friends across the aisle had \nsimply agreed to delay the individual mandate and to eliminate the \nspecial congressional carveout under ObamaCare, this never would have \nhappened.\n  We have now reached day 10 of the shutdown. Over the last week and a \nhalf, administration officials have done as much as they possibly can \nto make this shutdown as painful as possible. They made the decision to \nbarricade the World War II memorials and monuments along the National \nMall, hoping to keep out our veterans, many near the end of their \nlives, for whom these monuments were built as a way of honoring their \nsacrifice. They kept these barricades in their way to impede or perhaps \nprevent them from visiting things such as the World War II Memorial.\n  The Obama administration we know has temporarily closed or interfered \nwith privately run parks and historic sites, such as the Claude Moore \nColonial Farm in Northern Virginia.\n  Why would the administration, in order to turn up the heat or \nincrease the pain of the shutdown, impose itself to shut down a \nprivately run park? Well, there is a reason for that, and it is because \nthis is a cynical game--not one designed to get to a solution but one \nto gain political advantage. It should be offensive, embarrassing, and \noutrageous--to use the words of Secretary Hagel--for a political party \nto try to use a shutdown for such craven political gain.\n  Meanwhile, our Democratic friends have refused to support legislation \nthat would reopen our memorials and national parks and fund the \nNational Institutes of Health. I heard the distinguished assistant \nmajority leader come to the floor a few days ago and decry the fact \nthat cancer research for children was being temporarily stopped because \nof the shutdown. We have come to the floor and offered a bill that \nwould reopen it, along with clinical trials, and it has been refused by \nour Democratic colleagues. We have come to the floor--and the House has \npassed these bills--and said: Let's fund the Veterans' Administration \nto make sure the backlog of disability claims gets taken care of and so \nour veterans who have given so much and sacrificed so much don't have \nto wait on getting their disability claims processed. That was objected \nto by the majority leader. They also objected to funding our military \nReserves. As I said, they seem intent on maximizing the pain in hopes \nof gaining political advantage. That is outrageous, that is \nembarrassing, and it should be embarrassing.\n  Before I conclude, I want to say to all the military families out \nthere who have lost a son, a daughter, a husband, a wife, a father, or \na mother on the field of battle--I want to leave you with the words of \na great American President who said:\n\n       I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of \n     your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of \n     the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours \n     to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.\n\n  Those noble and inspiring words in that prayer are the type of \ntribute we should be giving to those families who have lost loved ones \non the field of battle, not the sort of shortsighted political \ntreatment that has been given by the efforts across the aisle to shut \ndown every reasonable opportunity to alleviate some of this hardship \nand to mitigate some of the pain.\n  We have done it together successfully when it comes to paying our \nuniformed Active-Duty military. We got a unanimous consent agreement \nbetween the parties to make sure our Active-Duty troops are getting \npaid. Why is it we can't do the same thing with the survivors of those \nwho lost their lives on the field of battle?\n  When I asked unanimous consent yesterday for the majority leader to \nagree to that piece of legislation, he asked to delay consideration of \nthat request until the Defense Department could announce its proposal \nwith the Fisher House. Again, I commend the Fisher House for stepping \nup and trying to fill the void, but why should we not do our job? Why \nshould Congress not act? We should act and I hope very soon. We can do \nour job and honor these fallen and their families in an appropriate way \nby coming together as Republicans and Democrats and making sure these \nsurvivor benefits to the families who have lost loved ones on the field \nof battle are paid on a timely basis without being caught up in the \npolitical games occurring inside the Halls of Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, a colleague recently described on this \nfloor his experience flying in a private aircraft when a fire broke out \nin the cockpit of the plane. He observed that putting out the fire \ndistracted the pilots from flying the aircraft and that they \nprecipitously lost altitude. This tea party shutdown and the tea \nparty's threat to our country's credit, like that fire in the cockpit, \nare distracting us from flying the plane.\n  I dispute the notion that those who caused the shutdown have good \nstanding to come to this floor and criticize the way the Obama \nadministration is implementing a shutdown that we don't want on our \nside of the aisle and that the Obama administration does not want. The \ntea party and Speaker Boehner, for their insistence on lighting that \nfire in the cockpit, are answerable to history and their consciences.\n  In the spirit of getting back to flying the plane, I will talk about, \nas I usually do, a real and looming crisis--not the manmade fire the \ntea party has lit in the cockpit of our government. That tea party \nshutdown could end tomorrow if the Speaker of the House would simply \ncall up the measure the Senate passed. He refuses to do so, and it is \nhis continued indulgence that keeps this shutdown going.\n  Climate change is for real. It is not manmade, nor is it something \nthe Speaker can turn off with a vote. It is coming at us, and it is \ntime to wake up to what carbon pollution is doing to our atmosphere and \nocean.\n  Regrettably, one of the reasons Congress is still asleep is that the \nworst culprits--the big corporations that do the worst carbon \npolluting--are pretending it is not that bad, it is not that serious, \nand they should keep doing what they are doing; the status quo is fine. \nIt causes me to wonder why it is that corporations seem never to admit \nthey are wrong. Why is ``oops'' a word they can't seem to use?\n  When it turned out that people would be a lot safer with seatbelts, \ndid the car industry say: Oops. We should have put those in and put \nseatbelts in the cars. No. They fought and they had to be defeated, and \nthen we got seatbelts.\n  When cigarette makers found out their product made people really \naddicted and really sick, did they say: Oops. We better figure out a \nway to not kill so many people. No. They fought and they lied for \ndecades.\n  When it turned out that lead paint damaged children's brains, did the \nlead paint companies say: Oops. We better warn folks about that and \nclean it up. No. They fought against protections and had to be \ndefeated. Indeed, they are still fighting.\n  When it turned out that aerosol refrigerants and propellants were \neating away at the Earth's ozone layer, did the manufacturers say: \nOops. That is dangerous, and we better come up with a safer product. \nNo. They fought the change, but they lost, and now they are making \nmoney making new safer products.\n  When acid rain was killing off the fish in the northeastern lakes, \ndid the big utilities say: Oops. We better clean up our emissions. No. \nThey fought the changes until they were forced to clean up.\n  When the flame-retardant industry found out its product was dangerous \nand ineffective, did they say: Oops. This flame-retardant stuff is \nhurting people and doing creepy things in nature, so we better knock it \noff. Nope. It is still fighting while whales turn into swimming toxic \nwaste.\n\n[[Page S7364]]\n\n  Now that carbon pollution has blown through 400 parts per million of \nCO2 in the atmosphere--a first in human history--and \nlaunched the most rapid acidification ever seen in the oceans--and by \nthat I mean going back to geologic time--are the polluters saying: \nOops. We better take our billions of dollars in profit and trillions of \ndollars in capital and invest seriously in new fuels and power sources. \nFat chance.\n  Corporations that are harming people never say ``oops,'' and for two \nbig reasons. One reason is there is a lot of money at stake. They would \nnot be in the business if they were not making money, and they don't \nwant to stop. The other reason is that corporations don't have \nconsciences, they have reputations. A reputation is something you can \nmanage. Huge chunks of Madison Avenue and K Street are dedicated to \nmanaging corporate reputations. So with no conscience and only a \nreputation, you manage the problem that you are harming people.\n  By now, the strategy for managing a corporate reputation while \nhurting people is well developed. It is a common one across cigarettes, \nacid rain, lead paint, flame-retardants, refrigerants, and now carbon \npollution. There is a playbook, and guess what. The big carbon \npolluters are following the playbook: one, pretend to care--that is \nimportant; two, attack the science, and if you can't attack the \nscience, attack the scientists themselves; three, claim it will cost \nconsumers a fortune; and four, make your goal not victory but doubt.\n  Pretend to care.\n  I don't know if you remember those phony-baloney Exxon ads that were \nall over the place a while ago with guys in lab coats, and they had \nthese Lucite molecules floating around. They wanted you to believe they \nwere out there looking for tomorrow's clean fuels. Well, you got had.\n  Since 2005 ExxonMobil has been making tens of billions of dollars in \nprofit every year. It is hard to pick through their numbers, but \nsources report that over that same time it only spent tens of millions \nper year on clean energy--about what it spent on advertising. They \nspent as much advertising their clean energy, it appears, as they did \ninvesting in it, and it was a tiny fraction of their profits, let alone \ntheir revenues.\n  Remember BP and their green Sun baloney? BP pulled completely out of \nsolar and completely out of U.S. wind investments once it had laid down \na fat barrage of advertising about being beyond petroleum. Pretend to \ncare.\n  Attack the science and even the scientists themselves.\n  The polluters have to do this through proxies. Nobody will really \nbelieve it if Exxon's fingerprints are all over the attack on the \nscience, so others do the dirty work.\n  One example is Virginia's tea party attorney general Ken Cuccinelli, \nwho attacked the top climate scientist at the University of Virginia. \nHe used his powers of office--the special powers of office that are \nentrusted to attorneys general. Having been an attorney general, I know \nsomething about how precious and special those powers are. He used \nthose powers to harass and subpoena a college professor. UVA's lawyers \nstuck up for the professor, and the Virginia Supreme Court threw that \nnonsense out. But for the polluters behind it, it was right out of the \nplaybook.\n  You may remember the polluters whipping up a phony scandal called \nclimategate, pretending that a group of climate scientists were doing \ndishonest work. The scientists had to endure audit after audit, every \nsingle one of which gave them a totally clean bill of health. It turned \nout it was the cooked-up, phony scandal that was dishonest, but the \npolluters had a field day in the meantime. It was right out of the \nplaybook.\n  Claim it will cost consumers a fortune.\n  This is a playbook classic. The big polluters are always talking \nabout how it will cost you to clean up their act. Implicit is that they \nare going to put all the costs on to you and that they are not going to \neat any of it and that their shareholders are not going to bear any of \nit.\n  Let's get past that. What they conveniently overlook is that, for \ninstance, under the Clean Air Act--yes, complying with the Clean Air \nAct did cost utilities a lot of money, but for every $1 that was spent \ncleaning up to comply with the Clean Air Act, Americans have saved \nabout $40. They spend $1, you save $40, and they want you to believe \nthat is a big problem?\n  The Office of Management and Budget does a little calculation called \nthe social cost of carbon. The latest cost is $36 per ton of \nCO2 emitted. For every ton of carbon pollution the polluters \ndon't sell, we save $36. But they will never tell us that side of the \nstory, nor that there are more jobs now in green energy than in the \nentire oil and gas industry, nor that we are in an international race \nfor tomorrow's clean energy technology innovations. It is a race these \nbig international corporations are perfectly happy to have America \nlose. It is no skin off their nose.\n\n  Last, their goal is not victory, it is doubt. They don't want to \nconvince anyone that climate change isn't happening. They don't need to \ndo that. Of course, they couldn't do that in any kind of a fair debate. \nAll they need to do, the playbook strategy says, is to convince us, as \nwe are driving down the road listening to the radio, that nobody is \nsure yet; that there is some doubt, but we don't need to do anything \njust yet; that people can move on to their next worry; this one is \nstill up for grabs. They will keep trying to push action on carbon \npollution over that horizon of doubt, never having to prove their case.\n  The American people are being played for chumps in this game. It is a \nracket, and we are the mark.\n  Even so, even with all of that, the facts around us--what is \nhappening to our woods and shores and farms and weather--are becoming \nso clear that even with the playbook they are losing, just like they \nultimately lost on cigarettes and seatbelts, on lead paint and acid \nrain and the ozone hole.\n  Here is what Americans are saying: 61 percent of Americans say the \neffects of climate change are already affecting them personally or they \nsee it happening in their lifetime.\n  Fifty-eight percent said the country should do more to address \nclimate change, including 51 percent of Independents, while just 14 \npercent--14 percent--said we are doing enough already.\n  Sixty-five percent of voters support ``the President taking \nsignificant steps to address climate change now''--65 percent. That \nnumber jumps up to 70 percent when looking at voters under 40 years \nold.\n  Sixty-six percent of young voters--two out of every three--say \nclimate change is a problem to address, while just 27 percent say \nclimate change is a natural event that humans can't affect, and only 3 \npercent don't believe climate change is happening.\n  Fifty-three percent of people say they would be less likely to vote \nfor a politician who did not understand that climate change is a real \nproblem.\n  Even in the red State of Texas, 70 percent believe global warming is \nhappening, and more than half say more should be done about global \nwarming at all levels of government.\n  Today is day 10 of the tea party shutdown. As we have pointed out \nover and over, it is a manufactured crisis. It goes away the instant \nSpeaker Boehner stands in the House and calls the measure the Senate \nhas passed, without amendments and without gimmicks, to the floor. It \nwill pass. The crisis will be over.\n  This crisis is different. This is not a crisis of a fire in the \ncockpit that is being kept burning by Speaker Boehner who could stop it \nat any time; this is for real. This is Mother Nature--400 parts per \nmillion for the first time in 800,000 years is serious.\n  The tea party Republicans are wildly out of step with the American \npeople on both issues, and it is time for them to wake up.\n  Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request, if I may ask the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia to yield for one moment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators on the majority side be limited \nto 10 minutes each until 1 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for up to 8 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page S7365]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                QRM Rule\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, on August 28 of this year, the six \nFederal regulators of the banking industry reported out on their charge \nto promulgate a rule required by Dodd-Frank known as the QRM rule or \nthe qualified residential mortgage.\n  The qualified residential mortgage rule was a rule that Senator \nLandrieu, Senator Hagan, and I put into the Dodd-Frank legislation to \nprovide for a parameter for residential mortgage loans to be exempted \nfrom the risk retention requirements of Dodd-Frank if they met a \ncertain standard. These regulators were charged with establishing that \nstandard. That law passed over 5 years ago and we are just now getting \nthe promulgation of the rule, but I am happy to say I rise on the floor \nof the Senate to memorialize my support for a job well done. The \nqualified residential mortgage rule, which is being circulated now \nuntil October 28, is the right answer for the requirement of Dodd-Frank \nand for the American housing industry.\n  For the education of the Senate and the public at large, the Dodd-\nFrank law, in its desire to make sure loans that were underwritten were \nbetter underwritten and loans that were made were better made loans so \nthere would be less default and less problems in the housing industry, \nrequired the banking industry to make only qualified residential \nmortgages as defined.\n  The original discussions within the banking industry were that part \nof that definition would be a required 20-percent downpayment, which I \nand many people in America strenuously objected to, because a 20-\npercent requirement to exempt from risk retention would be far too \ngreat a downpayment for most American families to meet, would have \nprobably meant a decline in the housing market, even greater than we \nexperienced in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011, and would have had a \nnegative impact on America's economy, unemployment, and America's \nhealth and well-being.\n  So the banking regulators did a great job in their rule which does \nthe following: First of all, it equates QRM, or the qualified \nresidential mortgage rule, with the QM rule, or the qualified mortgage \nrule, which Richard Cordray, the Director of the Consumer Finance \nProtection Bureau, promulgated 1 year ago. Mr. Cordray did an \noutstanding job of seeking input from people in the industry and the \ntrades affected by the housing industry and wrote a rule that made \nsense. That rule required the following: It required good, solid \nunderwriting. It required a maximum ratio of total debts to total gross \nincome of 43 percent so we would not have somebody borrowing more than \nhalf of their take-home pay or their gross pay in order to service \ndebts. That would mean people would have the money to pay their \nmortgage.\n  It required people to verify their income, credit, employment, the \nvalue of the property that is being purchased with the loan. All of \nthose things are the standards that served America well for years until \nthe subprime lending took place from 1999 until 2006.\n  So I commend Richard Cordray and the Consumer Finance Protection \nBureau for defining a qualified mortgage as one that is well \nunderwritten. A required downpayment is not necessary to have a \nqualified mortgage because underwriting is what led us into the \ndifficulties of the past 5 years in the housing industry.\n\n  We went through a recession that was not a downpayment recession but \nan underwriting recession, and Congress itself was partially to blame \nwhen it mandated that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae hold a certain \npercentage of their portfolios in what is known as qualified \nresidential mortgages for the purposes of meeting the needs of \nunderserved people in our society. Those underserved people in society \nended up being credit risks or higher credit risks. They became known \nas subprime lenders. They got guaranteed by the government. They were \nsold in securities. When they defaulted, the securities went down, the \nAmerican housing industry went down and the American Federal Reserve \nhad to bail out people such as AIG and we went through the worst \nhousing crisis in the history of the United States.\n  So the proposal of the six banking regulators to merge QRM and QM, \nthey are recognizing that underwriting is the key to sound loans. By \nrequiring good underwriting to exempt from the 5-percent risk retention \nrequired in Dodd-Frank, we are ensuring a robust housing market, robust \nand available capital through Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and private \ninstitutions, to ensure housing in America can return to the heights it \nhas known in the past.\n  Quite frankly, we are never going to get below 7 percent \nunemployment, we are never going to get higher than 2 percent growth in \nAmerica in our economy until we return to a robust housing market. We \nare not going to return to a robust housing market until we get \nliquidity in the credit markets for residential mortgages of a \nconventional nature. That is only going to happen when Freddie Mac and \nFannie Mae can secure well underwritten loans and guarantee them so \nthey can be sold in the marketplace.\n  The banking regulators who are now circulating the QRM rule for \npublic comment did precisely the right thing by recognizing that \nunderwriting was the problem and not downpayments.\n  Lastly, one of the things the regulators did put in their proposal \nfor circulation for input was what if they did require a downpayment of \n30 percent, would that be an exemption for the risk retention under \nQRM. I would implore the regulators not to consider doing that because \na 30-percent downpayment would be even worse than a 20-percent \ndownpayment. It would restrict even more Americans from becoming \nhomeowners, and it would not address the problem. The problem was \nunderwriting. The problem was not downpayment. Credit enhancements such \nas private mortgage insurance and things of that nature can supplant a \ndownpayment requirement, but nothing can supplant quality underwriting.\n  Richard Cordray wrote a good rule, the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau is enforcing that rule, and I commend the bank regulators for \nmerging the QRM rule with the QM definition to ensure that we return to \na robust economy with a strong housing market, don't revisit the \nproblems of the past with shoddy underwriting, and instead look forward \nto a brighter future for the American housing market.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, for nearly 2 weeks I have \nwatched the debate on the Senate floor as well as on the House floor, \nand I have become more and more frustrated. My frustration is, in \npart--I would say in large part--driven by the contrast to what I see \ngoing on in my home State of Colorado.\n  During the past several weeks, Coloradans have come together in the \nwake of Biblical rains and beyond devastating flooding to begin the \nlong process of rebuilding our State better and stronger. We in the \nWest--and I think I can say we as Americans--are rugged cooperators. \nSure, we are each strong individuals--and that is a strong point of \nview in the West; it is the core of who we are, that we are strong as \nindividuals--but we know we are best when we band together, despite any \npolitical or philosophical differences, to face our shared challenges. \nI am doing my level best to bring that spirit to Washington, DC, \nespecially now in this time of shutdowns and ultimatums and ideology \nthat doesn't make sense to the people I represent in Colorado. I invite \nall of my colleagues to come to Colorado to see the collaborations \noccurring in these flood-ravaged communities such as Jamestown, Lyons \nand Estes Park and Fort Morgan. There are no games. There is no \nposturing. There is no politics. There is just a doggedness to make \ntheir communities better. I surely hope the strength and the focus of \nColoradans could be an inspiration to all of us as we tackle what are \nvery pressing policy issues.\n  On that note, I wish to speak about one of my constituents, someone I \nwork for--Jeff. He is a Federal employee. He demonstrates the \nresilience, to me, of the people of Colorado. But his situation also \ntypifies the worst of what this shutdown and this brinkmanship is doing \nto the real people, the good people of my State of Colorado.\n  Jeff is a Federal employee. He was trapped for 3 days in last month's \nflood. That flood cost him almost everything. He has very few \npossessions\n\n[[Page S7366]]\n\nleft. Once he was free, he went immediately back to his day job. He was \nworking for an agency that is integral to the flood disaster response. \nWhat happened? The government closed. So now he rents out an apartment. \nHis home is inaccessible, literally, due to the flooding. He doesn't \nhave a paycheck and he is being told he is not essential and he \nshouldn't come in to work.\n  There are a lot of reactions I have to that. There are a lot of \nreactions anybody who is paying attention would have to that. One is \nthat now there is one less pair of boots on the ground helping with the \nflood response efforts in Colorado.\n  To a certain extent, politics is about finding the right strategy to \nadvocate for what a person believes is right. But what is going on \nright now is shameful. What is happening to Jeff is flatout shameful.\n  What we are seeing is one faction of one party, in one Chamber, in \none branch of government, holding this Nation's health, economy, and \nsecurity hostage and, in the process, causing the Federal Government to \nshut down and threatening a government default on our obligations. By \ndoing so, these individuals are holding our flood recovery hostage. It \nmakes no sense.\n\n  I guess you have to ask yourself why. Why would a small group, a \nfaction, be doing this? It strikes me that in part they are doing it \nbecause they are obsessed with undermining a law that is providing \naffordable health care to Americans, some for the first time in their \nlives, a law that is saving seniors hundreds of dollars a year on \nprescription drugs and is leveling the playing field when it comes to \nproviding health care and putting consumers back in charge of their own \nhealth care.\n  I want to make this clear: After having legally passed both Houses of \nCongress, being affirmed by the Supreme Court, and then serving as a \nreferendum in the just concluded campaign that overwhelmingly reelected \nPresident Obama, the Affordable Care Act is settled law. Let me say \nthat again. The Affordable Care Act is settled law.\n  But describing it as settled law alone I know is not enough to \nresolve this latest crisis. So I would like to take viewers and my \ncolleagues back a decade when the Presiding Officer was a Member of \nHouse at that time, when President George W. Bush pushed us to pass \nwhat was an unpaid-for Medicaid prescription drug benefit.\n  Members of my caucus over in the House felt that this massive unpaid \nlaw was thrust upon us without due consideration and at a time when we \nshould not be racking up further debt. Many of us on my side of the \naisle were literally reeling with anger after it passed. It also passed \nin ways with which we disagreed, in the middle of the night, literally. \nThe desk in the House was kept open--I think the Presiding Officer \nknows--for close to 4 hours to find those last votes.\n  I was angry. I voted against that Medicare prescription drug benefit. \nI am sure I was as angry as some of my colleagues were when the \nAffordable Care Act passed over 3 years ago.\n  So what did I do? I took a lot of deep breaths. I listened to the \ncounsel of people I respect, I listened to my own counsel, and I not \nonly decided it was settled law, but I decided to start holding \ntownhalls and listening sessions so I could help my constituents sign \nup for it. I knew it was the settled law of the land, just like \nObamaCare is today, and I wanted my constituents to be best served by \nits implementation.\n  So I went out and spread the word about the benefits, figured out \nwhat questions my constituents would have. I wanted them to sign up. I \nwanted to make it a success. I wanted them to have those benefits.\n  So let's fast forward to today. Far from helping people, our friends \nand colleagues on the other side of the aisle have relentlessly spread \nuncertainty about ObamaCare, attacking its implementation at every \nturn, and now to close down the Federal Government over their concerns \nabout it.\n  We are in the 10th day of a government shutdown. Our national \nsecurity has suffered. Seventy percent of the intelligence community is \nfurloughed. We do not have enough food inspectors on the job. Our \nveterans are not getting the services not only that they need but that \nthey have earned. Our national parks are closed, hurting economies like \nours in Colorado. I mentioned Estes Park. Estes Park is the gateway to \nRocky Mountain National Park. If Estes Park is going to recover from \nthese devastating floods, Rocky Mountain National Park has to be open \nfor business.\n  This is not how the greatest Nation in the world can go on doing \nbusiness. I have said from the very beginning--I think the Presiding \nOfficer agrees with me--the Affordable Care Act is far from perfect. No \nmandate law is. As with every law, it will undoubtedly need some \nimprovements and some constructive changes during its implementation. I \nam committed to doing that, just like we did after President Bush moved \nhis prescription drug law to the finish line.\n  In the past few days we have seen statements indicating that some \nRepublicans are starting to understand that this partisan focus on \nObamaCare is futile. So as their next step they have seized on yet \nanother destructive tactic, manufacturing a new crisis, an even more \nserious, potentially devastating crisis than shutting down the \ngovernment. What have they done? They are threatening the full faith \nand credit of the Federal Government to push their budget demands. They \nhave threatened to force us past the deadline, which is October 17--\nthat is a week from today--when the United States will no longer be \nable to meet its financial obligations.\n  Grandstanding on funding the government is bad enough. If we do not \nagree on a way forward to reopen the government, but we also do not \nagree on a way to ensure that the Treasury Department does not default \non our Nation's debt obligations, we will seriously damage global \nconfidence in the United States, make no mistake. There are some voices \nin this building who think that will not happen. They are wrong.\n  If we damage the global confidence in the United States, we are going \nto hamper our economic recovery, we will slow job creation, and we will \nmake borrowing costs more expensive for government and families alike. \nThis is no way to win the global economic race in which we find \nourselves. Coloradans are telling me in every way they can that they \nexpect a lot better than this.\n  Ronald Reagan used to joke in only the way he could that he was not \nworried about the debt; it is big enough to take care of itself. But \nevery American should worry if Congress refuses to meet the obligations \nwe have already made.\n  I know many Americans are worried about our debt and our capacity to \npay the bills we have incurred. I have been worried about this for a \nlong time. I think if you would ask anybody around here, they would \ntell you I would vote in a minute for a sensible grand bargain. It is \ntrue. I have worked across the aisle and built a record of efforts to \nreduce wasteful spending and set our budget on a more sustainable \nfooting. It should be one of our top priorities. It has to be one of \nour top priorities.\n  I have been a longtime supporter of the line-item veto. I supported \nthe initial structure around which the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction \ncommission worked. I called for an end to earmarks. I worked with \nSenator Coburn from Oklahoma on ending some wasteful public subsidies, \nincluding those for the political party conventions every 4 years. It \nis why I was the first Democrat to champion a balanced budget amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution in many a year. I am not the only Member, as \nwell, of my party who has been fighting for commonsense reforms.\n\n  This is critically important work. I would love nothing more than to \nbring a serious deficit reduction plan to the floor and pass it along \nwith raising our debt limit to avoid an American default.\n  But let me be crystal clear: To default on our debt because a grand \nbargain eludes us would make our debt and deficits even worse and \nthrust us into an economic tailspin. It is irresponsible to even \nsuggest forcing America into default as a legitimate negotiating \nposition.\n  Let's sit down and have a grownup discussion about these important \nissues, but not like this. Let's fund the government, let's pay our \nbills, and then let's sit down and negotiate again. Negotiation is \ngood. Compromise is good. But we cannot have this important set of \ndiscussions with one party constantly threatening to shut down\n\n[[Page S7367]]\n\nthe government or throw our country into default, each of which makes \nour deficits and debt even worse.\n  We have, literally, centuries of examples of a Congress \ncollaborating, working together. We have done that for over 200 years. \nWe can debate, we can have contentious back-and-forth, but in the end \nwe need to compromise and agree. We need a comprehensive and balanced \ndeficit reduction plan that can pass both Chambers and be signed into \nlaw.\n  No party gets to threaten the American economy and shut down the \ngovernment when they do not get their way. No party gets to jeopardize \nmiddle-class families' 401(k)s or senior citizens' retirement savings \nor set our economic recovery back just because their positions are not \nstrong enough to prevail on their own.\n  That just is not the way to address our Nation's shared problems. And \ntrust me, our debt and deficits are a shared problem. We can do better.\n  I want to begin to conclude by again referring to the Coloradans I am \nso fortunate to represent, just like the Presiding Officer, I know, is \nhonored to represent the good people of Wisconsin. Coloradans have \nshown the true strength of our State in the wake of this tragic \nflooding that literally has wiped communities off the map and destroyed \nthousands of homes. If we could have done anything to prevent that \nnatural disaster, we would have.\n  We now face a potential manmade disaster. We have to protect \nAmericans from a looming manmade disaster that is emerging right here. \nWe have to bridge the partisan divide. We have to end this government \nshutdown. We have to stave off an American default. We have to pay our \nbills. We could do this today if Speaker Boehner would just allow the \nHouse to vote on a clean funding resolution that we have already sent \nto the House, with the House numbers in it, by the way. So let's just \nsee a vote in the House. The continuing resolution would pass in the \nHouse today with Republican and Democratic votes.\n  So let's just vote. Let's hold the vote. The Presiding Officer and I \nserved in the House. When we were eager to go to work we would shout: \nVote, vote, vote; work, work, work. It is time for the House to go to \nwork. Let's vote to end this debt ceiling crisis and make sure our \nNation pays the debts it has already incurred.\n  These are the basic functions of Congress. If we fail to act, history \nwill never forgive us--any of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the multiple \nissues that have now presented themselves to us in the Senate and to \nthe U.S. Congress and, frankly, the American people.\n  I have been in several hearings this morning. The first was with \nSecretary of the Treasury Jack Lew, where the Finance Committee \ndiscussed with him the pending expiration of our debt ceiling and what \nhis understanding is of how that will impact the country. He raised a \nlot of serious concerns--very legitimate serious concerns--that others \nare raising.\n  We then followed that up with a hearing in the Banking Committee \nwhere we had representatives from a number of the various industries in \nthe United States also discussing what is going to happen in the United \nStates if the country does not increase the debt ceiling. And there are \nserious consequences that will happen if we do not do this.\n  But what I tried to do in both of those hearings--and I will refer to \nmy conversation with Secretary Lew--was to focus us back on the \nbroader, bigger threat. Secretary Lew basically said that we have a \nmanufactured crisis in the United States because of our unwillingness \nat this point to face the debt ceiling and simply extend the debt \nceiling without any kinds of conditions or negotiations.\n  I reminded him that the crisis we face--the big crisis we face--is \nthe debt crisis, and it is very real. I guess in a sense it has been \nmanufactured over the last 20 or 30 years by Congresses and Presidents \nwho have refused to control spending and have put us into tremendous \ndebt.\n  Our debt ceiling we are negotiating about right now--or I think \nwishing we could negotiate about right now--is $16.7 trillion. It has \ngrown by trillions of dollars over the last 5 or 6 years.\n  What the President has asked us to do is to once again increase the \ndebt ceiling by another $1 trillion or more with no reforms, no fiscal \nchanges in our policies to deal with the mounting spending crisis we \nface. The President's position is: You give me this $1 trillion or more \nof new debt authority, and I will then talk to you about reforming our \nfiscal policy. The problem is we have been trying to negotiate over \nfiscal policy now and trying to get reforms put into place for years \nand we have not been able to get there.\n  When I asked Secretary Lew about this, he basically said: We have \nmade progress on our overall debt crisis in the past few years, and I \nthink we can continue to work on those kinds of steps if you will \nsimply pass this clean debt ceiling extension and do so in a way that \ninvolves no negotiations from the President in any way.\n  I reminded him that a major part of the progress we have made in the \nlast couple of years was made when we met the debt ceiling 2 years ago \nin 2011. It was the Budget Control Act that put into statute over $2 \ntrillion of reductions in our spending path. That was attached to the \ndebt ceiling as we moved forward. It was literally the debt ceiling \nnegotiation that generated the only significant spending controls this \nCongress, this country, has seen for years and years. Yet the President \nrefuses to take another step now that we have met the debt ceiling \nagain and negotiate for further reforms.\n  By the way, there is another reason we have made some progress in the \npast few years. That is that we have implemented massive new taxes on \nthe American people. The ObamaCare legislation itself contains nearly \n$1 trillion of new taxes, and although they were delayed for a few \nyears, they are now beginning to fully hit the American people. Last \nJanuary, the President was able to win his argument and succeed in \ngetting the top income tax brackets raised, an impact on our Tax Code \nthat I think was harmful rather than helpful and clearly was damaging \nto the creation of jobs and to businesses across the United States. \nBut, nevertheless, another $500 billion to $600 billion of tax revenue \nwas put into the mix there.\n  So what have we done? We have made a plan to control discretionary \nspending over the next 10 years and reduce it by about $2 trillion. If \nwe stick to that, we will get $2 trillion worth of spending reductions. \nWe have raised taxes by at least $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years, \nall of which, I believe, has been harmful to our economy, but has \ngenerated revenue to try to help reduce the debt cycle. But we have not \naddressed the two critical parts of reform that we must address in this \ncountry if we are ever going to get control of our spending excesses \nand stop the out-of-control spiral toward insolvency that we see; that \nis, reforming our entitlement system and reforming our broken Tax Code.\n  What have we seen there? Virtually minimal, if any at all, reforms of \nentitlements. They seem to be off the table. Yet they are the part of \nour spending problem that is the biggest and the most out of control. \nOn tax reform, we have seen no reform of the Tax Code. We have a Tax \nCode that is the most unfair, the most complicated, the most expensive \nto comply with, and the most anticompetitive code we probably could \nhave created if we did it on purpose. Yet we have no reforms of the \ncode. Instead what we have done is add to the code another $1.6 \ntrillion of new taxes on the American people.\n  What we are asking is whether we can move forward in trying to deal \nwith our fiscal problems in this country by negotiating over \nentitlement reform and tax reform. I frankly believe we ought to be at \nthe negotiating table talking about that. But what we have been told \nis: No, as soon as you raise the debt ceiling by--the amount we are \nhearing is somewhere in the neighborhood of $1 trillion--as soon as you \nraise the debt ceiling, then we can talk further about other \nnegotiations, then we can get engaged in trying to deal with our debt \ncrisis.\n  I pointed out, as I said to Secretary Lew, that the last major \nprogress we made on spending reform happened in negotiations relating \nto our debt ceiling. Why cannot we negotiate now and\n\n[[Page S7368]]\n\nmake significant fiscal reform in addition to dealing with our debt \nceiling? It is that debt crisis that is the biggest problem.\n  I was on the Bowles-Simpson Commission, the President's own \ncommission, that he put together some years back, 2 or 3 years now. We \nspent a full year studying the impacts on our economy of America's \nfiscal excess and what we needed to do. The Bowles-Simpson Commission \ncame up with a plan. It was a proposal. We concluded that--this was 2 \nor 3 years back--we needed to reduce our spending path, our debt path \nin the United States by at least $4 trillion. We concluded we had to \ndeal with that by reforming our entitlement system and we had to deal \nwith it by controlling discretionary spending. We agreed to having some \nof that tax revenue the President was demanding. We also agreed that in \nthe overall mix we would have about a 3-to-1 ratio of spending cuts to \nrevenue.\n  The President did not accept that recommendation. Many of us tried \nfor months and months and months afterward to get that recommendation \nto the floor for a vote. But it has not made it to the floor for a \nvote.\n  My point is, negotiations have been under way for years and years. \nSignificant plans have been developed that would help us move forward. \nWe know what to do. We need to have the will to do it. So far, the only \nreforms we have been able to get in the last few years as a result of \nthe debt crisis that we face have come when we have met these pressure \npoints dealing with our debt ceiling.\n  We are not asking to shut down the government for the purpose of \nsimply making a point. We are trying to get to negotiations. We want to \nsee the government reopened. We are not seeking to have the debt \nceiling expire. We want to have negotiations to be able to put together \nthe kinds of fiscal reforms that should always accompany extensions of \nthe debt ceiling.\n  I believe the reason Congress put a statutory debt ceiling in place \nin the first place was because it wanted to give America a gut check \nevery so often about the spending problems we have. We have put almost \nhalf of the entire spending system of the government on auto pilot. We \ndo not even have the opportunity to vote on it here in Congress.\n  Ultimately, we have to deal with the debt ceiling. Ultimately, we \nhave to deal with the funding to keep our government operational. Let's \nnot just move forward and accomplish those objectives, leaving in place \nthe unrestrained fiscal crisis we are dealing with in this country. \nLet's use this opportunity to put together the kinds of fiscal reforms \nthat should accompany decisions to allow our country to increase its \ndebt.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Yesterday I came to the floor with the distinguished \nmajority leader to raise the issue of survivor benefits to those who \ndied in the line of duty. Reportedly, 26 servicemembers have died since \nthe government shut down on October 1, including 5 in combat. Their \nfamilies have been denied the basic survivor benefits, which include a \ndeath gratuity, $100,000 of life insurance, a housing allowance paid \nfor a year, paid in a lump sum, as well as burial and other related \nexpenses.\n  Yesterday I asked unanimous consent that we take up and pass the \nHouse bill. The majority leader and I entered into a conversation, and \nthere was a question as to the intervening action by the Department of \nDefense to try to work around the lapse of the funding. Fisher House, \nwhich is a wonderful charitable organization, helps to operate and fund \nseven different facilities in my State alone. I know they are \nextraordinarily generous and do very good work. They offered to enter \ninto a contractual agreement with the Department of Defense to fill the \ngap during the interim. But what I would like to do is ask unanimous \nconsent that we take up and pass the House legislation, which would \nalleviate the need for Fisher House and the Department of Defense \ntrying to figure a workaround. We would actually pass legislation that \nwould reopen that stream of funding so that these families could get \nthe benefits they deserve.\n\n\n               Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.J. Res. 91\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nconsideration of Calendar No. 216, H.J. Res 91, making continuing \nappropriations for death gratuities and related survivor benefits for \nsurvivors of deceased military servicemembers of the Department of \nDefense for fiscal year 2014, and for other purposes; that the measure \nbe read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, the senior Senator from \nTexas has always been very courteous to me. Yesterday was no exception \nin withholding his unanimous consent request when we discussed this \nissue. It was about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, as he indicated.\n  I indicated that I thought that if we waited until 3:30 we would have \nthis matter revolved, as that is what I had been told. In fact, it was \na little after 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon that Secretary Hagel \nissued a statement announcing that the Department of Defense had \nentered into an agreement, as my friend said, with the organization my \nfriend mentioned, and that would provide the family of fallen \nservicemembers--over the weekend, the Senator from Texas is correct, we \nhad five soldiers killed, one of whom was a woman, four men and one \nwoman. The agreement Senator Hagel came up with would give everyone--\nprovide to family members of the military the full set of benefits they \nhave been promised, including the $100,000 death benefit gratuity. So \nthe death benefit issue has been resolved. The Department of Defense \nstepped forward and took care of everything, so this issue is largely \nmoot. It is clear the action on this legislation is now just for show \nhere.\n  We all agree it is bad that the government shutdown led to this added \ngrief for the families who had suffered such a terrible loss. Now we \nneed to do what we can to prevent any further bad results--and there \nhave been plenty of them in other areas. The right thing to do is to \nprevent more of these in other areas, and the House should just vote to \nopen the government. This issue has been taken care of, and it is \nterrible that we even got to this point.\n  We should not forget that as long as the government remains closed \nand the Republicans refuse to open the government, the military is \nunable to, for example, buy armor and equipment needed to prevent \nfuture deaths in the military. For the families of FBI agents killed in \nthe line of duty, it is the same problem--they can't receive their \ndeath benefits. Veterans' benefits are delayed and disrupted.\n  As for this bill, the Secretary has now acted. We all agree the issue \nis taken care of. If my friend from Texas feels more comfort as a \nresult of doing this, which I think is unnecessary, I don't object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 91) was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, if I could respond briefly, I appreciate \nthe majority leader not objecting to the consideration of this \nlegislation. He believes this issue has been resolved by this \ncontractual arrangement between Fisher House and the Department of \nDefense, but ultimately the Department of Defense would have to \nreimburse Fisher House under what I understand is the purported \narrangement to be made. This obviates the need for any of that kind of \nworkaround, together with any legal questions that might arise as to \nwhether this is actually something the Department has the authority to \ndo. I am not suggesting they don't; I am just saying this alleviates \nall those considerations.\n  So I am pleased we were able to come together in a bipartisan way, as \nwe were on the military pay for uniformed military, and pass this \nnarrow piece of legislation. I think maybe now that we have passed the \npay for Active-Duty\n\n[[Page S7369]]\n\nmilitary and we have passed the provision that provides for survivor \nbenefits for the families of the fallen, perhaps that paves the way to \nbe open for some other narrow bills until we can come together on a \nlarger bill.\n\n  We have offered, for example, funding for the National Institutes of \nHealth, NIH. A few days ago the distinguished assistant leader from the \nDemocratic side gave a very eloquent speech about children's cancer \nresearch. Under the bill that was passed by the House on a bipartisan \nbasis that we have called up here, that funding would be restored, as \nwould funding for the Veterans' Administration so they can process \ndisability benefits, which they are not able to do now because of the \ncutoff in funding.\n  There are a number of areas where I think we can work together \nconstructively if we will do so. I am pleased we were able to take care \nof this one.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would ask a question through the Chair.\n  I say through the Chair, I think what we did here was the right thing \nto do, and I am sorry, I am painfully sorry that this government \nshutdown is hurting so many innocent people. It could come to an end \nwith one decision by the Speaker to call one bill on the floor of the \nHouse. He refuses to do so. So we are trying to put out these little \nfires and spare the American people the pain and injustice that is \ncoming about as a result of this shutdown. But I would say to the \nSenator from Texas that even the Veterans' Administration bill passed \nby the House fails to fund some critical areas for veterans. It does \nnot fund the appeals process for veterans disability claims. Those have \nstopped. Secondly, it doesn't fund the cemetery rights of veterans who \nare seeking to be buried in national cemeteries. While we pay for \nfunerals, the people who prepare the grave sites and such are not being \npaid. It doesn't have the Department of Labor program to hire \nunemployed veterans coming home. That is not funded. The HUD program \nfor homeless veterans is not being funded. The notion that we are \nsomehow taking care of veterans with the House action is far from true.\n  The last point I wish to make is that over 500,000 Federal employees \nare actually veterans. Many of them are furloughed today. One-fourth of \nall employee veterans are disabled. Many of them are furloughed today.\n  If we really care about veterans, opening the government to make sure \nall of these agencies are serving our veterans seems to me to be a \nreasonable approach. I ask if the Senator agrees.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, responding to the question of the \ndistinguished assistant majority leader, I would say that we would all \nlike to try to find some way to get back to business as usual when it \ncomes to funding the government through the regular appropriations \nprocess. We haven't done that for a long time, and so we have been \noperating not on individual bills--I think there are 13 separate bills \nas part of the appropriations process. So now we have unfortunately \nalready degenerated to this continuing resolution process, which has \nits own problems.\n  I would say to my friend that for every one of the hardships we can \nmitigate through passing narrow legislation absent a global agreement \non the continuing resolution, it seems to me we ought to be doing that. \nIf there are other suggestions the Democratic side has about how we can \ndo that, I think that would be a good thing to do.\n  The problem is that I know the majority leader--I will give the \nmajority leader the benefit of the doubt. I hope he didn't really mean \nhe thought this was a show process, trying to restore these survivor \nbenefits through this unanimous consent request, and I will give him \nthe benefit of the doubt.\n  I do think there are a lot of questions raised in the minds of the \nAmerican people whether what is happening here is being done purely for \npolitical purposes. We have veterans of World War II and Korea who come \nto the World War II Memorial only to be met with barricades. I have met \na number of the Honor Flights of the ``greatest generation'' at a \nnumber of these memorials, and they have basically decided to go around \nthe barricades, as I believe is their right under the Constitution.\n  It seems as if there is an effort made to maximize the pain \nassociated with the shutdown. We know 83 percent of the government is \nbeing funded. Why can't we try to chip away at some of these narrow \nprovisions and mitigate some of the hardship that we can rather than \ngetting in our corners, squaring off, and creating more and more \nproblems? I think this is important. We ought to be doing this. We \nshould have done this a long time ago.\n  I would say to my colleagues, there were reports that Secretary Hagel \nnotified the administration of this lapse in survivor benefits before \nthe shutdown even occurred. It took the President 9 days before he \nfinally ordered the Department of Defense to come up with a workaround, \nthankfully with the help of the Fisher House.\n  I think there is an impression that a lot of gamesmanship is going \non. I don't think it becomes the Senate. I think Congress's approval \nrating is in the toilet, and we ought to be doing everything we can to \naddress the problems where we can.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield the floor to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would make several points.\n  First, I was with an Honor Flight group at the World War II Memorial \nlast week, a great bunch of World War II veterans who came in from \nIllinois, and it didn't surprise me one bit--there was no barricade \nstopping these veterans. They were on their way to their memorial, and \nthey went.\n  The reason why there was any question about this memorial and access \nwas because of the decision by the Republicans to shut down the \ngovernment.\n  I was going to remind the Senator of Texas, who is a learned attorney \nand a former Texas Supreme Court justice, of the story we were told in \nlaw school. It was an anecdotal story, an apocryphal story of someone \nwho killed both his parents, went to the courtroom, and then threw \nhimself on the mercy of the court because he was an orphan. In this \nsituation we have our Republican friends lamenting the impact of a \ngovernment shutdown on World War II veterans coming to Washington, and \non these tragic stories of families who have lost someone they love in \ncombat. But all of this is unnecessary. All of it could have been \navoided if the Republican Speaker of the House would call one bill for \na vote which he knows will pass. It would open the government. That is \nthe simple and honest answer.\n\n  This notion we are going to have a series of small appropriations to \nfund our government--all of the appropriations bills that have been \ncalled so far and passed the House amount to about 18 percent of the \ndiscretionary domestic budget. At this pace, the House only has to pass \n79 more bills to open our government. We think at this pace it will \nonly take them about 2\\1/2\\ months to do it. Is that any way to run a \ngreat Nation? It isn't.\n  We need to open our government, serve our people, spare them the \ninjustice and pain which comes from this Republican shutdown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, my friend, the distinguished senior \nSenator from Illinois, gave an analogy that applies to a lot of what my \nfriend from Texas said. First of all, we haven't done appropriations \nbills. We haven't done appropriations bills because the Republicans \nwon't let us. We can't even get cloture on a way to proceed to one of \nthem.\n  But I want to be sure the record is clear that my friend from Texas \ndoesn't have to give me the benefit of the doubt on what I said. If \nthere were ever an example of this whole process being for show, it is \nthis: We have a lot of things we should be working on. The country is \nwithin 1 week of defaulting on its debt for the first time in the \nhistory of this country. We should be focusing on that. The government \nshould be open.\n  We had the unfortunate incident where we had five of our troops \nkilled over the weekend in Afghanistan, and it brought to our attention \nthey were not going to get their benefits because the part of the \ngovernment that gives them that money is closed.\n\n[[Page S7370]]\n\n  Now, we didn't close it. But Secretary Hagel, a former Republican \nMember of this body, worked it out so they are all taken care of. They \nare all taken care of. So this unanimous consent I agreed to is for \nshow. It doesn't mean anything. They are being taken care of anyway.\n  So I appreciate the Senator giving me the benefit of the doubt, but \nhe doesn't need to give me the benefit of the doubt. This whole thing \nis for show. This whole government shutdown is for show. It is a show \nthat I don't quite understand the ending of, but that is where we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, may I inquire, under the previous order, \nhow much time remains for the minority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8\\1/2\\ minutes remaining for the \nRepublicans.\n  Mr. RUBIO. I ask unanimous consent that 5 minutes be added to that \ntotal, for a total of 13 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, with all this focus on the fighting going \non in Washington these days, I think we are losing focus on the biggest \nissue facing this country, and that is the pervasive and growing sense \nwe are losing control of our country; that we are losing the American \ndream.\n  Why do people feel this way? Because millions of them have been out \nof a job for months, and maybe even years, and because millions more \nfind themselves stuck with jobs that don't pay enough for them to live \non or certainly for them to live as they used to.\n  When people hear news that the economy is recovering, that \nunemployment is down by .1 percent this week or this month, that the \nstock market is up and that the recession is over, it makes people \nangry. And rightfully so. Because the recession might be over on Wall \nStreet, but it is not over for millions of people who are out of work \nor stuck with jobs that do not pay enough to live on.\n  What makes all this worse is that while their paychecks aren't \ngrowing, their bills are growing. Ask the young couples out there, the \nsingle parents, how much it is costing them every month or week to \nprovide childcare for their kids. Ask the young Americans who are \nsaddled with thousands of dollars in student loan debt.\n  How are people making it through these times? Well, I am reminded of \na few years after we got married, when my wife and I hit a rough patch \nin our finances. What we did was we got rid of one of the cars and we \nmoved in with her mom for 6 months. That is what many of us have had to \ndo at some stage in our life, but it was usually temporary. Now people \nare doing that with the feeling it might not be temporary; that this \nmight be the way it is for a while. And they ask themselves: Is this \nthe new normal? Is this the way it is going to be from now on?\n  This is what millions of people across this country are feeling these \ndays; that maybe the American dream--if you work hard, you can improve \nyour life--isn't what it used to be; that maybe the American dream is \nactually even slipping away.\n  But why is this happening? Whose fault is this, is the normal \nreaction some people have. Well, there are a few reasons why this is \nhappening. One is the economy has changed. The nature of our economy \nhas changed. Globalization, for example, has sent thousands of middle-\nclass jobs overseas. Information technology and advances have replaced \nmany of our middle-class jobs with machines. Another reason why is that \nwe simply have too many people who never get the education or the \nskills they need for the better paying jobs this new economy is \ncreating. And we can't ignore, for example, the breakdown of our \nculture and our families and what that is doing. It is trapping people \nin a cycle of poverty and of dependence. These are all contributors to \nwhat we face today.\n  But one of the major reasons why this is happening, why so many \npeople are trapped in dead-end jobs, why so many people have been \nunemployed for so long, is because our economy is not creating enough \njobs to live off of. One of the reasons why that is happening is \nbecause our country is headed for a debt crisis. The real debt crisis \nis not the looming debt limit. The real debt crisis is that every year \nour government is spending more money than it takes in. And, by the \nway, one day we are not going to have to worry about raising the debt \nlimit because no one will want to lend us money anyway.\n  Too often around here we talk about the national debt as if it is \nsimply an accounting problem. The national debt is a lot more than \nthat. How does the economy create good jobs? It creates good jobs in \ntwo ways: No. 1 is through innovation--when people invent a new product \nor service. The other is through investment--when people risk the money \nthey have to start a new business or when a business reinvests its \nprofits into the business to grow. The fact we are headed for a debt \ncrisis and that we have no serious long-term plan in place to address \nit is discouraging innovation and that is discouraging investment.\n\n  Who wants to innovate in an economy that is headed for a debt crisis? \nWho wants to risk their money to start a new business in an economy \nthat is headed for a catastrophic disruption? And who wants to reinvest \ntheir profits to grow their business in a country where the government \nis going bankrupt?\n  Having people trapped in low-wage jobs, having people unemployed for \nmonths or years at a time, having people unable to afford to get \nmarried or start a family doesn't have to be the new normal. It doesn't \nhave to be this way forever. We can turn this around. But to do so we \nhave to stop chasing all these temporary gimmicks that promise us some \nsort of momentary boost to our economy. We have to stop ignoring the \nproblems headed full speed at us. We have to return to the basics--to \nthe basics that made us such a prosperous nation.\n  Our national debt today stands at close to $17 trillion. In the last \n5\\1/2\\ years alone it has grown by over $6 trillion. So when you hear \nthe President or the Democrats here in the Senate say they want us to \npass what they call a clean debt limit increase, here is what they are \nreally asking for: They are asking us to borrow another $1 trillion but \nnot do anything meaningful to slow the growth of that debt.\n  Why would we continue to do this? When are we finally going to get \nserious around here about putting in place a serious long-term plan to \nbring this debt under control? In order to do that, the first thing we \nhave to understand is what is causing this debt.\n  Look, we have a broken Tax Code. It is full of all sorts of special-\ninterest loopholes. But the reason why we have this massive debt isn't \nbecause rich people aren't paying enough in taxes. Even if we taxed \nevery millionaire every penny they made this year, it wouldn't make \neven a small dent in the debt. Yes there is some serious waste going on \nthroughout our government. For example, we have to reverse the changes \nthe Obama administration has made to these welfare programs that \nbasically gut the work requirement and leave people dependent on \ngovernment. We need to reform the way we give foreign aid. We must and \nshould do all of these and even more. But even if we did all that, it \nis still not enough.\n  What is driving our debt is the way we spend money on two very \nimportant programs: Medicare and Social Security. They are spending \nmore money than they take in, and that gap is growing rapidly every \nsingle year.\n  I warn you, anytime anyone talks about making changes to these \nprograms, you get accused of trying to hurt the elderly. So speaking \nfor myself personally, let me set the record straight. I come from a \nState with millions of people--millions of retirees--who depend on \nthese programs, and one of them is my own mother. She worked hard for \nher entire life and paid into these programs so they would be there for \nher when she retired. I would never support any changes to these \nprograms that would hurt my mother. But these programs are going \nbankrupt, and anyone who is in favor of doing nothing about them is in \nfavor of bankrupting them.\n  The good news is this: The good news is we still have some time to \nsave Medicare and Social Security, and we still have time to do these \nchanges without making any changes to the benefits of seniors such as \nmy mom. But to do so is going to require younger workers, like myself, \nto accept that\n\n[[Page S7371]]\n\nwhen we retire, our Medicare and our Social Security is going to be \ndifferent than our parents.\n  So instead of spending all of our time around here trying to figure \nout how to raise the debt limit, we need to spend more of our time \ntrying to figure out what we can do to put in place a serious long-term \nplan to bring this debt under control so that our economy can start \ncreating more of those good-paying, middle-class jobs, so that people \ncan start building for themselves the better future they always dreamed \nof.\n  The American dream is under assault. That is the real crisis. When \nare we going to get serious about solving it? This dream of earning a \nbetter life is the universal hope of people everywhere. But we are \nreminded that for much of human history most people found themselves \ntrapped by the circumstances of their birth. That meant no matter how \nhard they worked, no matter how talented they were, they were only \ngoing to go as far as their family went. They could only do whatever it \nwas their parents did. One of the things that made America so special \nis that here that has been different. Here, through hard work and \nsacrifice, people from all walks of life, from every corner of the \nworld, have had the real opportunity to earn for themselves a better \nlife.\n  This is what we call the American dream. As Americans, that is our \nidentity. It is what holds us together as a nation. It is what holds us \ntogether as a people, and it is what has made us exceptional.\n  I know people are discouraged about how tough times are. I know some \npeople are very disappointed about how the last election turned out. I \nknow many people are angry and, quite frankly, disgusted by the way \nthis process is working or failing to work these days. But no matter \nhow bad things may seem, we cannot give up on America and we cannot \ngive up on the American dream. We have to do everything we can to make \nsure this country remains a place where anyone from anywhere can \naccomplish anything.\n  So despite how ugly Washington looks right now, I actually remain \nconfident that, in the end, that is exactly what we are going to do. I \nhave no doubt that, in the end, our children will grow up to be the \nmost prosperous generation that ever lived. Despite all the challenges \nwe face right now, when all is said and done, I believe with all my \nheart we will still go down in history as the generation that saved the \nAmerican dream and left our children what our parents left for us--the \nsingle greatest Nation in the history of the world.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, mindful of the hour and that the Senate \nis about to recess, I want to say to my colleague from Florida, who is \nmy friend, that I have optimism and I have faith in our country as \nwell.\n  I think it is interesting that the stock market, the Dow Jones, has \nsurged 243 points--I just checked it a couple of minutes ago--on just \nthe rumors that the debt ceiling will be lifted and we will not go \nthrough this crisis. But I am told at the other end of the Capitol, the \nHouse of Representatives is going to have difficulty in getting any \nagreement to stop the shutdown of the government and pass a continuing \nappropriations bill. So here we are, back in the soup again.\n  If we do just a short-term debt extension, lifting the debt ceiling, \nthen for however long it is--5, 6 weeks--come Thanksgiving we are going \nto be back in the soup again.\n  There has got to be a change in attitude, and the attitude has got to \nbe I respect the other fellow's point of view, I respect his difference \nof opinion, now let's work it out together. And it is only then we are \ngoing to solve this problem.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/10/senate-section/article/S7371-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are hearing a lot of discussion right \nnow about the role of government and the role of the public sector.\n  We know there is a minority in the House of Representatives who ran \non shutting the government down and think they have achieved something \nas we see the economy teetering now, as we see people who have been put \nout of work, who have mortgages, car payments, and concerns about their \nchildren and so on, and all the services that are in jeopardy, from \nfood safety to law enforcement to what happens in the case of an oil \nspill and all of the things in between.\n  I found it interesting with our colleagues who have embraced the idea \nthat in the greatest country in the world and in the greatest democracy \nin the world there is no need for the public sector. No one else is \nhaving this debate around the world. They are embracing every tool of \nthe public sector to embrace their private sector to try to beat us by \nouteducating and outinnovating us in a global economy, as the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer understands. So we are in a global race \nwhere everybody understands it is all in. We use all the tools that we \nhave.\n  We have the greatest private sector, the most robust private sector \nentrepreneurs that can beat anybody in the world. But we also have a \npublic sector that creates the framework and support for that by having \na rule of law, by having basic protections in place for the public.\n  As I had the opportunity to listen to our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, particularly in the House, it seems every time there \nis a story--a salmonella outbreak--gosh, we had better bring some folks \nback. We have veterans hurting so we had better bring something back. \nWe have women and children not getting baby formula through the WIC \nProgram so we should do something about that. We have concerns about \nnational safety so we should do something about that. It is almost as \nif we are educating these Members about the role of government in this \nprocess as they go. I didn't realize we did that. So maybe that \nfunction ought to be working. It is a chaotic way for the greatest \ndemocracy to operate, but that seems to be what is happening right now.\n  I remember in my times traveling to China, the last time I was there, \nwhere they said to me: Oh, you are here in Beijing on a great day; you \ncan see across the street.\n  We are lucky. We can see across the street almost every day because \nwe collectively have decided that one of the things we need to do to be \nable to breathe the air is to have certain rules, certain protections \nand standards in place so we can breathe the air. That is important to \ndo through the public sector. We can't say: I will do the air in front \nof this desk, and you do the air in front of this desk, and somebody \nelse will protect the air over here. It doesn't work that way. We do it \ntogether. So we don't have to worry about saying: I am in D.C. on the 2 \ndays a year we can breathe the air and look across the street. We have \nthe confidence of knowing that we have a quality of life, including the \nability to see across the street and breathe the air, because in a \ncivilized society, the greatest democracy in the world, we have made \nsure that those standards are there for our citizens.\n  I remember on a trip to Russia a few years ago they were talking \nabout wanting to get more private sector investment into Moscow in \nRussia. I came home talking to our businesses and they said: The \nproblem is they don't have a rule of law. We don't trust how we can \ninvest there because we are not confident in their government, their \nrule of law. We don't have that problem here. We have the epitome of a\n\n[[Page S7372]]\n\nsystem with checks and balances, a rule of law. Up until all of this \nhad begun, we have had the confidence available in the private sector \non how to invest and know that there is a system in place.\n  I had the opportunity, with my agriculture hat on a few months ago, \nto be in Haiti where we see a great desire, meeting with the Haitian \npresident, to bring in more business and investment from the United \nStates. The problem is, you bring a shipload of cargo into the harbor, \nand you can't get it off the ship without paying bribes. They have no \nlaw enforcement system, judicial system, rule of law.\n  That is not true in our country. We do it through something \ncollectively that we call government, that creates a way for us to make \nsure we can drink the water, breathe the air, see across the street, \ndrive on the roads, have the opportunity for education for all of our \nchildren, and know that we can walk into a restaurant and have some \nlevel of confidence that the food is safe or go into the grocery store \nand know that.\n  We have research institutions that suddenly, after our colleagues in \nthe House have been saying--and for years I have had personal debates \nwith folks who said: We don't need a National Institutes of Health. Let \nthe private sector do it. Yet we know collectively we are willing to \nshare a risk of basic research to try to find cancer cures, to go over \nand over again on research until they get that one that may be able to \nmove forward and be successful, in which case the private sector comes \nin and takes it from there. But we have done it together and shared the \nrisk because we know it is in all of our interests to save lives--- in \nour own, our family Members, and others--whether it is Alzheimer's, \nParkinson's, juvenile diabetes, cancer. All of those things are done \ncollectively through this thing that we call government. That is why we \nhave the best standard of living in the world. We are the wealthiest \ncountry in the world. We are the envy of the world. People want to come \nhere and invest. They want to be a part of the opportunities in this \ncountry. And now we are debating whether or not, literally, there \nshould be a public sector. Should we fund the police and the \nfirefighters and the judicial system? There are those on the other side \nof the aisle who would say: We don't mean that. Every time we bring up \nsomething: We didn't mean that. I am not sure what they mean then in a \ncivilized society.\n  We know we have challenges around issues of finance and debt. As \nchair of the Agriculture Committee, I am proud of the fact--and I have \nsaid so many times on the floor--that we are the only committee on a \nbipartisan basis that has actually brought a deficit reduction bill to \nthe floor that has passed in the Senate. So I take a backseat to no one \nwhen we are looking at ways to cut duplication, to cut things that \naren't important, to strengthen those things that are, and to save \nmoney.\n  But we do not do it by destroying our economy, by shutting down the \nservices we all count on to protect us as consumers, to make sure our \nchildren have opportunities, to make sure we are safe and secure in \nthis country. Obviously, that makes no sense. It is totally \nirresponsible.\n\n  What we are not talking about enough is that we have begun to see \nthings happening in terms of the debt and deficit. We can continue to \ndo that. In fact, the yearly deficit has been cut in half. I don't hear \npeople talking about that, but the numbers say that.\n  A few years ago we set a goal of $4 trillion in debt reduction over \n10 years. We are more than halfway there--not all the way there, but we \nhave put in place a mechanism through cuts, through new revenue, \nthrough interest savings yielding $2.5 trillion in debt reduction out \nof the $4 trillion.\n  What is happening by shutting down the Government and threatening a \ndefault? That debt is going to go back up. We are going to undermine \nthe work we have already done by adding increased costs through \ninterest payments and delays that will actually increase the debt. We \nsaw that in the last go-around in 2011. Even though there was not \nactually a default on the full faith and credit of the United States of \nAmerica, we saw it because of exactly what is happening now. We had a \nlot of talk--in my judgment some very irresponsible talk--and posturing \nback-and-forth instead of working together in a reasonable way. We saw \nthe markets affected, a drop of 2,000 points in the market, $800 \nbillion in retirement savings of folks who worked hard all their lives \nand maybe are still working and cannot figure out why in the world we \ncannot work together in a reasonable, rational way to solve problems. \nThere was $800 billion retirement savings gone. During that time in \n2011, that summer, July and August, anyone who was signing up for a new \nmortgage is paying on average $100 more a month in payments because the \ninterest rates were higher.\n  Instead of building on what we have already done together or even \nacknowledging it--it may not make good politics to acknowledge folks on \nthe other side of the aisle. Unfortunately, it seems they certainly do \nnot want to give credit to the President or give credit for anything we \nhave actually been doing together. But the reality is the deficit has \nbeen cut in half and we are more than halfway to the goal that was set \nfor savings over 10 years.\n  There is nothing that has been happening in the last few days--\nshutting down the government, threatening possible default on the full \nfaith and credit of the United States--that is helping us reach that \ngoal. It is actually going in the opposite direction. As interest rates \ngo up, billions of dollars will be added to the debt.\n  We have tried to figure out over the last number of months how to \ncontinue bringing down the debt and tackling long-term challenges \nwhile, by the way, creating jobs. The best way to get us out of debt is \nto create jobs so people can go back to work and be part of the \neconomy. That is the best thing, and we are sure not hearing enough \ntalk about that.\n  I am very proud to come from a State that makes things and grows \nthings. It is manufacturing that is bringing us back, that is driving \nthe economy, and it is agriculture where we have the biggest exports, \nin terms of export surpluses, in the country. We need to make things \nand grow things, focus on that. That will bring down the debt as we \ncreate more opportunities and more jobs.\n  In the last 6 months we have tried to go to a conference committee, a \nnegotiating team, a formal negotiating process between the House and \nSenate on a 10-year budget that will bring down the debt, create jobs, \ndo things in a fair and balanced way that puts middle class families \nfirst. We have tried to do that, as of today, 21 times. In fact, the \nchair of the Budget Committee has come to the floor and moved that we \nget to that process 21 times, joined by distinguished Members of the \nRepublican caucus in the Senate who have come to say the same thing, \nlet us go to a budget negotiation, a formal budget negotiation. Over 21 \ntimes the same folks who shut down the Government, the same folks who \nsay it doesn't hurt anything if we default as a country, even though \nevery economist, every business leader is begging and pleading and \nproviding facts and information as to why it would be a complete \ndisaster--the same people who are saying defaults don't matter, \ngovernment doesn't work, except when they are reading something in the \npaper and somebody is saying there is a problem--they, those same \npeople have, 21 times been able to block the Senate from going to a \nformal negotiation with the House on the budget.\n  We are in this crazy place where, on the one hand, when we step back \nwe are actually seeing the economy slowly moving forward--of course \nuntil now, when it is beginning to be stymied by all of this. But the \neconomy has been moving forward. The yearly deficit is coming down. We \nhave been tackling the long-term debt. We are coming out of this. Then \nwe have a group of folks who have decided in the big picture that there \nis no value in a democracy, in the greatest country in the world, in \ngovernment. They don't seem to care about what it takes to provide an \neconomy and so on.\n  Now they are saying they are willing to jeopardize the faith and \ncredit of the United States of America, have America default on our \nbills and potentially send us not only and probably into a great \nrecession similar to the one we just came out of, but economists tell \nus it could send us back even further, into the thirties or forties. \nThey just do not know.\n\n[[Page S7373]]\n\n  We are in a global marketplace right now where we don't know what \nhappens when we default on our bills, when we lose the confidence of \nthe world to invest in America or to even purchase our debt. We don't \nknow what happens when small businesses see all their capital dry up \nand people are not able to get mortgage loans again or they cost much \nmore than they did before and all the other ramifications of our not \npaying our bills.\n  There are colleagues who say the Secretary of the Treasury--who, by \nthe way, came down and did an excellent job in the Finance Committee \ntoday. It was very serious. It was very sobering, but I thought he was \nclear and he was factual and I very much appreciate his coming to the \nSenate Finance Committee. But there are those who say he says October \n17 is the last time extraordinary measures can be used to stop us from \nfalling off the cliff and going into default and losing the full faith \nand credit of the United States--except, no, it could be the next day, \nit could be the day after.\n  Coming from a car State it reminds me of someone who is driving in \ntheir car and they look and it is on empty. You may have a little bit \nmore. Sometimes they say you have 5 miles more, you have 10 miles more, \nmaybe you have 30 miles more, but you are on empty and you are going to \nstop--the car is going to stop. The question is how often do you want \nto risk that and play that game when you know the car is going to stop.\n  That is, in my judgment, the kind of absurd and irresponsible debate \ngoing on right now--about whether the car stops immediately or in 2 \nmiles or 3 miles or 30 miles. Why in the world would you want to put \nyourself in that position? Lord knows, defaulting on the full faith and \ncredit of the United States of America is much more serious than \nrunning out of gas in your car.\n  There is no reason for this--none, zero. This is a manufactured \ncrisis. Do we need to continue to work together to tackle the long-term \ndebt of this country? Absolutely. Count me in. Do we need to focus on \nwhat is happening to middle-class families who are getting squeezed on \nall sides and have a hard time just holding on? Do we need to focus on \njobs in this country, making things and growing things and outeducating \nand outinnovating the world? Absolutely. Count me in. Count me in at \nthe head of the line on that.\n  We in Michigan right now, in terms of our hard work and ingenuity, \ntake a backseat to nobody. But to find ourselves in this craziness is \nbeyond my understanding. I know people at home are going: What in the \nworld is going on here? Can't you guys just come together and figure \nthis out and quit making up crises and quit creating artificial \ndeadlines and get things done?\n  I think it is important at this point in our history that we remember \nPresident Ronald Reagan said: ``Never before in our history has the \nFederal Government failed to honor its financial obligations.''\n  We are the greatest country in the world. Others look to us. They \nwant to be like us. They want a vibrant middle class like America has \nhad. We need to fight hard to keep ours and keep it growing. We need to \nmake sure we do not fail to honor the financial obligations of this \ngreat country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I just listened to my colleague from \nMichigan talking about the need to reopen the government and the need \nto deal with the debt. Of course, I agree with that, as do my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle. We also heard discussion about \nthe fact that we should not be manufacturing crises. Unfortunately, we \nhave a crisis on our hands; that is, the crisis of debt at record \nlevels, so I wish to talk about that a little today and talk about why \nthis discussion is so important, particularly on extending the debt \nlimit because that would be the place naturally for us to deal with the \nproblem that faces this generation and certainly future generations \nreaching this historic level of debt.\n  In a matter of days, we are told, our Nation is going to be reaching \nthis debt limit which is $16.7 trillion. Think about that. That is \nsixteen thousand billion dollars. It is impossible to comprehend that \nnumber, but let's try: $16.7 trillion would produce a stack of $1 bills \n1 million miles high. That is enough, by the way, to go to the Moon and \nback. It is now bigger, by the way, than our entire economy. Only once \nin our history have we had debt as a percent of our economy so large \nand that was after World War II. We were able quickly to address that. \nWe didn't have the long-term liabilities we have now, and we had very \nhigh defense spending from World War II we were able to reduce. But \nother than that, we have never been here before. I would say we are in \nuncharted territory.\n  By the way, it is not just that we have this huge level of debt and \ndeficit and the overhang on the economy, but it is the fact that the \neconomy is also weak. I think they are related. I think this huge level \nof debt and deficit is akin to a wet blanket over the economy.\n  Here is an interesting chart. It shows the debt limit rising twice as \nfast as the economy has grown in the last 2 years so the debt increase \nhas gone up by about $2.4 trillion and unfortunately our GDP increase \nhas been less than half of that. That is the problem we are trying to \nface. It is a lot of back-and-forth.\n  I know for some people it looks as if this is politics. It is not. It \nis about a fundamental issue. There are fundamental disagreements, and \nI respect those disagreements, but we have to address this problem and \nwe have to do it in the context of the debt limit. If we do not, we \nwill simply be kicking the can down the road again and letting down the \npeople we represent. If you divide that debt among the American people, \neach of us--every man, woman, and child in America--owes around \n$50,000. By the way, of course, that is far more than the annual per \ncapita income for that man, woman, and child in America. If you think \nabout that, it is about $140,000 to $150,000 per household on average. \nThat is where we are today.\n\n  I don't think it is constructive to be pointing fingers of blame \nbecause, frankly, for decades Republicans and Democrats alike have \nspent more money than the government takes in. There have been more \npromises made than can be kept, and we have gone through a process of \nmortgaging the future of our kids and grandkids as a result. Here we \nare. In some respects, the greatest single act of bipartisanship here \nin the Congress has been the overspending. The question is not how we \ngot here but what we are going to do about it. Where are we going?\n  Yesterday the President said that raising the Nation's credit limit \nby another $1 trillion really pays for last year's deficit spending, \nnot next year's spending. I guess we could have that debate. I would \nsay it is about the future because we are borrowing more money to pay \nthe bills of the country going forward, and that is what many of us \nwant to talk about--how, going forward, we can reduce those bills.\n  The truth is that whether you say you are paying for the past or \npaying for the future, it really doesn't matter to the American people \nand it doesn't matter to our children and grandchildren who end up \npaying the bill. Long after we are gone, this huge level of debt and \ndeficit is going to be something they are going to have to deal with.\n  We all know the consequences if we don't raise the debt limit. \nWithout a debt limit increase, the Federal Government will be unable to \nborrow to meet its expenses. We are borrowing 20 cents of every dollar \nthe Federal Government spends, so the government would be unable to \nmeet all of its obligations.\n  There has been discussion about meeting the interest on the debt, and \nthat is only about 8 percent of revenue coming in. I assume that could \nbe met, but it is true that there are other obligations that can't be \nmet if the government can't borrow because the government is spending \nmore than it takes in and needs to borrow to make up the difference.\n  The deficit, some have said--including some of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle today--is lower now, and somehow that is an \nindication that we are OK in terms of the deficit. I would remind folks \nthat the deficit this year is the fifth largest deficit in the history \nof our country--in our entire history. It is over $640 billion. More\n\n[[Page S7374]]\n\nsignificantly, the Congressional Budget Office, which is the \nnonpartisan group around here that analyzes this stuff, says it is \ntemporarily lower than $1 trillion. In other words, they say that \nwithin a decade it will get back up to $1 trillion. Whether it is $640 \nbillion or $1 trillion, it is way too high.\n  Entitlement spending, by the way, will then push these annual \ndeficits up to the equivalent of $3.4 trillion a year--five times what \nthey are today--within a few decades. That is based on the \nCongressional Budget Office. At that point, the national debt would be \n2\\1/2\\ times as large as the entire economy. Today it is about the size \nof the economy; it is a little bigger. It would be 2\\1/2\\ times as \nlarge as our whole economy. I saw one CBO report recently that simply \nstops calculating the interest cost at that point because they cannot \nforesee our economy functioning under those kinds of conditions. Think \nabout your own family budget or think about your business. You could \nnot function either. The bank would not be able to lend you any money.\n  Both of these outcomes--default today and bankruptcy in the future--\nare unacceptable. That is why it is time for us to work together to try \nto do something about them. As the debt ceiling is raised, it is time \nto address the underlying problem. That is what we are saying.\n  By the way, the American people are saying that too. Based on the \npolling I have seen this week, the American people by better than a 2-\nto-1 margin are saying: Don't raise the debt limit without doing \nsomething about the spending. They get it because for them it is like \nthe credit card--when you reach the limit, you realize you have to do \nsomething about the underlying problem, which is how much you are \nspending.\n  The President says: ``Pass the debt limit increase now and we will \naddress the spending later.'' I wish it were that simple, but I think \nhe knows, as well as everybody in this Chamber and every person who is \nwatching at home today, that Congress simply doesn't reduce spending \nunless it is forced to do so. If you don't think that is true, let me \nremind you of what the history is here. In the past three decades--I \nhave gone back and looked at all of these deficit reduction plans that \ndid get through Congress, and there were not many, but there were some. \nIn every single instance where there was any significant deficit \nreduction, it came as a result of what? A discussion about the debt \nlimit because that is the time in which there is some pressure here in \nCongress to actually do something about it. I found one in 2005, which \nwas a relatively small reduction in spending, but otherwise every \nsingle one of them--the Gramm-Rudman rescissions in the 1980s; the 1990 \nAndrews Air Force Base agreement that the first President Bush \nconducted with Democrats; the 1993 balanced budget talks; the 1997 \nbalanced budget agreement Bill Clinton negotiated with Newt Gingrich--a \nDemocratic President and a Republican Speaker; and, of course, the pay-\ngo rules that many Democrats are fond of, those pay-go rules came out \nof a debt limit discussion; and finally, we only have to look back a \ncouple of years ago to the Budget Control Act. As my colleague has said \non his side of the aisle, there have been some successes in reducing \nspending on the discretionary side of spending--which is about one-\nthird of the budget that is appropriated every year--that came out of \nthe Budget Control Act, which is a result of what? The debt limit. In \nother words, Members listening to the folks back home.\n  I am listening to my constituents back home in Ohio right now, and \nthey are saying: Don't max out the credit card again and go over the \nlimit unless you do something about the problem. It is little wonder \nthat the American people, by this margin of 2 to 1 that I talked about, \nare saying: Don't do it without the spending reductions. They know that \nis the only way the spending cuts are likely to happen.\n  Why is it that any increase in the debt limit should also include \nprogrowth provisions? Well, because one way to get at the debt and \ndeficit is spending restraint. We talked about the discretionary \nspending being about 35 percent of the budget, and we made progress \nthere. The other 65 percent of the budget is the mandatory spending \nside, and we have not made progress there. The other part would be \nrevenue, and on the first of this year taxes were raised by $620 \nbillion. What we have not done is deal with the mandatory side.\n  Finally, of course, economic growth helps. As we are extending the \ndebt limit, we should also look at how we can help give the economy a \nshot in the arm. Tax reform is the way to do that, and I think there is \na consensus in this body that we need to do it. That would seem to make \nsense as well.\n  We have already made progress on one of the three legs of the stool, \nwhich is dealing with the discretionary spending. It has been pretty \nmuch flat for the last couple of years. By the way, for the first time \nsince the 1950s there has actually been a reduction in spending for 2 \nyears in a row, but that is only 35 percent of the budget. The fastest \ngrowing--again, 65 percent of the budget--we have not dealt with. That \n65 percent grows to 76 percent of the budget in the next 10 years based \non the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n  On the tax side, the same Congressional Budget Office tells us that \nstarting in 2014--that is next year, around the corner--taxes as a \npercentage of our economy will be above the historic level. In other \nwords, there will be more taxes coming in from the tax increases that, \nin part, we passed earlier this year, but the part we have not dealt \nwith is mandatory spending. It is the biggest and the fastest growing \npart of our spending. Let's face it. It is politically difficult to \ndeal with, but that is what we were hired to do, and that is what the \nPresident was hired to do in terms of providing leadership.\n  With ObamaCare, of course, we added a new health entitlement program \nto this part of the budget--the 65 percent. These health entitlements \nwere already growing more quickly than the rest of the budget, even the \nrest of mandatory spending. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office \ntells us that in the next 10 years the health entitlement programs grow \nby over 100 percent. These are vital programs--Medicare and Medicaid--\nbut they have to be reformed so they are sustainable in the future and \nare there for our kids and grandkids. With 10,000 baby boomers retiring \nevery day and health care costs continuing to rise, we have a real \nproblem, and we have to address it. All of us know that--Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, as well as the President and the Congress. Again, \nhistory tells us the best way is to link this with the debt limit \nbecause that is the opportunity and has traditionally been the \nopportunity to make progress.\n  By the way, over the long term, overall revenue is projected to \nincrease and discretionary spending is projected to be flat. The entire \nincrease in our deficit--these huge debts and deficits going forward \nthat I have been talking about--is due to the mandatory spending. \nAgain, that is the Congressional Budget Office, not me.\n  A good place to start, of course, would be some of the mandatory \nspending reforms the President has proposed. That would seem to be less \ncontroversial. If they are in the President's budget, that means he \nsupports them. The President sent up a budget this year, and he \nincluded over $700 billion of spending reforms on the mandatory side of \nthe budget. That is why what I have been advocating is, let's start \nthere. Let's look at the President's own proposals. These are not the \nproposals that all Republicans support, but after all we should have a \nnegotiation.\n  This notion that the President says he refuses to negotiate has never \nbeen true. Every President has negotiated. I think the American people \nare confused by this. How could the President of the United States say \nin the context of this debt limit discussion that he refuses to even \ntalk to the other side? That makes no sense. The first President Bush \nrolled up his sleeves; we talked about the 1990 agreements. President \nClinton rolled up his sleeves; we talked about the 1997 balanced budget \nagreement he negotiated with then-Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. \nThat is what Presidents do. We need them to lead, particularly on these \ntough issues.\n  As we talked about earlier, these are politically tough issues. The \nPresident says he doesn't want to be held hostage over the debt limit. \nHe is not. He has been given the opportunity to lead using his own \nproposals--at least that is my suggestion.\n\n[[Page S7375]]\n\n  We can also take a very simple step as we are going through this to \nbe sure that this newest health care entitlement, which is the \nAffordable Care Act, which is a new entitlement program, doesn't become \neven more of a deficit driver than many of us on this side fear it will \nalready be. The Affordable Care Act includes a provision that requires \nthat when you get your subsidies under the exchanges, you have to \nverify your income. That makes sense. You have to verify your income \nbetween 100 percent of poverty and 400 percent of poverty. Below that \nit would be Medicaid, and above that it would be the subsidies under \nthe exchanges.\n  Under a final regulation the administration put out, they said: We \nknow you should verify your income, and that is what the law says, but \nwe are going to give all of the exchanges another year to do it--not \nuntil 2015. Well, obviously the concern there is that will be an \ninvitation for fraud, waste, and for big new expenses.\n  As a result, the Federal Government body in charge of this, the CMS, \ncame out and said: No, for Federal exchanges, we will require people to \nfile their income, but not for State exchanges. There are about 17 \nStates and the District of Columbia that have State exchanges. They \nsaid to them: You guys can wait--in fact, not just until 2015, but \nthere is no date certain.\n  That is something we in the Congress should deal with. The Democrats \nhere in the Chamber who voted for the Affordable Care Act certainly \nshould support that because the intent of the bill when they signed up \nfor it and when the President supported it was, of course, that you \nwould verify your income. That is an example of a simple step we could \ntake to prevent the distribution of subsidies until we have a system to \nverify those subsidies are going to the right people.\n  Finally, let's give the economy a shot in the arm. As part of this \nprocess, let's take a step forward and say: Let's reform the Tax Code. \nWe are going to differ about the details, but let's get started on it.\n  So my proposal would be, as we have a vote on extending the debt \nlimit, let's do these important reforms we talked about on the monetary \nside, but let's also commit to tax reform. Let's force the process. \nLet's facilitate it. Let's expedite it.\n  The American people are not looking for us to just get the spending \nunder control; they want to see this economy grow. Again, they are not \nhappy with this, where the debt is increasing at twice the rate of the \neconomy. They want to see opportunities for their kids to get a job. \nThey want to see the opportunity to have the dignity and self-respect \nthat comes with a job.\n  We know that tax reform, done properly, will promote growth, it will \ncreate jobs. Again, we are going to differ on some of the details, and \nthat is OK. Let's get started on it.\n  Perhaps the President doesn't think that spending and the deficits \nare a real problem. If he thinks that, he should say it. He says just \nthe opposite. He has said he does think it is necessary for us to \naddress these problems. In fact, in his own budget, he sent proposals \nforward. So what we need to do is get together and negotiate and talk \nand deal with this underlying problem. A debt that is nearly $17 \ntrillion is unacceptable to everybody, I hope, and I would think we \nwould welcome the sign that Republicans are giving now that we want to \nnegotiate, we want to talk.\n  Negotiations, by the way, I don't think are a sign of weakness. I \ndon't think coming to the table is a signal of a failure of leadership. \nI think just the opposite; I think it shows strength and shows \nleadership. Again, I can promise my colleagues Republicans don't \nsupport all of the President's suggested savings in his budget, and a \npurely Republican agenda would look very different from whatever might \nemerge from bipartisan negotiations. But, again, the American people \nsent us here to get this done.\n  Using President Obama's own proposals, let's take that first step \ntoward entitlement and progrowth tax reform and onto some common ground \nto break the gridlock in DC and finally do something positive about \nthat underlying problem we all acknowledge.\n  Yes, we face serious problems, real challenges, but we also have an \nopportunity to do something positive, to deal with the problem we all \nacknowledge--something that will not only prevent a debt limit crisis \ntoday but a debt crisis tomorrow.\n  I hope to move forward on this important project. I think we owe it \nto the people we represent.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, October 1 was a significant day. Two \nthings happened to the constituents in my State. The first we talk a \nlot about here, and that is basically the shutdown of the government, \nthe failure to pass a continuing resolution that would keep the doors \nof government open for the thousands and thousands of Americans, and \nNorth Dakotans, who depend on government services. This horrible \nimpasse continues to have a horrible impact and continues to have \nconsequences that people didn't foresee.\n  The second thing that happened, which hasn't gotten a lot of \nattention, is the expiration of a long-term farm bill. After \nnegotiating in this body, and with a large bipartisan vote, we were \nable to accommodate concerns. We came together after negotiating, and \nwe came up with a package that included real reforms, eliminated direct \npayments, included real reform in SNAP, streamlined conservation \nprograms, and basically offered $25 billion of debt relief to the \ncountry. It was a great package.\n  We sent it over to the House and waited for the House to pass their \nfarm bill. They initially couldn't pass a farm bill. Then they decided \nto divide the farm bill, pass part of the farm bill, pass the other \npart of the farm bill with nutrition, now have a vote to bring them \nback together, and we are patiently awaiting the appointment of a \nconference committee.\n  The passage of the farm bill has never been a partisan issue. In \nfact, it is a regional issue. Things that are good for North Dakota may \nnot be good for the Presiding Officer's State of Delaware, but we all \nwork together, we all compromise, and we all come together.\n  This past weekend South Dakota and southwestern North Dakota were hit \nwith a terrible snowstorm. Over 2 days that region was blanketed with \nanywhere from 2 feet to 7 feet of snow and contained winds over 70 \nmiles an hour. Because of the early storm, tens of thousands of cattle \ndied because they were suffocated, mired and drowned in stock dams or \ndropped in exhaustion. The pictures and the stories are devastating.\n  This image is one that is all too common after the recent blizzard in \nthe Dakotas. These cattle that died over the weekend near Hettinger, \nND, were owned by the Christman family. As is the case with many North \nDakota ranchers, this hard-working family lost many cows and calves \nduring this surprise fall storm.\n  What people may not understand about the cattle industry is they \nmight think one cow is like the next cow; people can just replace them. \nThese herds are the product of years and years of selective breeding, \nyears and years of working to improve the quality of their herd and to \nmeet different specifications in the market. They are more than cows. \nThey contain an intellectual property component that is not easily \nreplaced.\n  This is where the crisis of the dysfunction that is Washington, DC, \nmeets natural disaster. When livestock die from a natural disaster, \nfarmers report the number of cattle that died to the Farm Service \nAgency--the FSA. However, because the doors are closed on the Federal \nGovernment, North Dakota ranchers, South Dakota ranchers, anyone who is \nexperiencing livestock losses, have no place to report those losses. \nAnd even worse, they have no one at USDA to consult with about the \ninformation they need to collect to eventually report their claims. \nThis is critical information. If farmers aren't collecting the \ninformation they need to make disaster claims in the future, the safety \nnets put in place to provide some support to these hard-working \nranchers may be denied simply because of a paperwork error.\n  Unfortunately, this is an avoidable problem. As has been the case \nwith so many in recent years, it is the product of congressional \ndysfunction. Because we haven't passed a new farm bill, the livestock \nprogram that helps ranchers withstand losses to livestock herds due\n\n[[Page S7376]]\n\nto extreme weather events--the Livestock Indemnity Program--has \nexpired, and the emergency assistance for livestock and honeybee \nproducers program, which is in the stalled farm bill and which helps \nproducers stay in business after they experience significant losses \nbecause of natural disaster, isn't available to the ranchers and the \nbeekeepers who were hit the hardest by the storm. Until Congress passes \na farm bill, livestock producers are in danger of losing their \nbusiness, and they will not be eligible for support.\n  These ranchers and the farm bill are more collateral damage of the \ngovernment shutdown. Because we are debating whether to fund the \nFederal Government, Congress isn't able to work on a farm bill. We have \nbeen waiting and waiting and waiting for the appointment of conferees. \nThe chairwoman, I think, intends to make a floor speech about the farm \nbill yet today. She has been working very hard to encourage the \ncollection of information and to encourage the appointment of conferees \nto the conference committee and get focused on this issue. \nUnfortunately, it is not happening until next week, if it even happens \nthen.\n  In addition, the lack of assistance for ranchers in the aftermath of \nthis devastating storm as a result of the shutdown is hurting farmers \nand agricultural industries, which is a key piece of North Dakota's \neconomy.\n  Here are some additional examples of where the shutdown is hurting \nour farmers. Frequently, because farmers who use FSA loans have a joint \nobligation with FSA, when they receive their checks after they sell \ntheir products, the checks are frequently made out to both the Farm \nService Agency and the farmer. Consequently, the farmer cannot cash the \ncheck unless he can get an endorsement from the Farm Service Agency. \nGuess what. They go, knock on the door, and no one is there to cosign \ntheir check. So that money in their hand that they need to make the \ninvestments for next year, that they need to pay the person who maybe \nsupplies the feed, that they need to pay the fuel bill--that money is \nnot available to them, even though they have earned it and they have \nsold their products. So the government shutdown prevents FSA from \ncashing these checks and from signing these checks. This is money the \nfarmers have earned and they deserve, and denying them their income is \noutrageous.\n  What is worse, farmers and ranchers enrolled in the loan programs are \nnew and beginning farmers, farmers who are just starting. It is a great \nthing that is happening in the Dakotas and all across farm country as \nwe look at the increasing commodity prices and we look at a farm \nprogram that for the last 5 years has been stable and provided risk \nmanagement. As a result, our farmers are getting younger and younger. \nThe people who are going to feed the world and continue to develop our \nrural areas are younger and younger. They cannot withstand cashflow \nproblems. They cannot withstand this loss.\n  Another impact of the shutdown: Agricultural reports from the \nNational Agriculture Statistics Service aren't available to farmers. \nThese reports are crucial resources that farmers need to make decisions \nsuch as how to price crops, which commodities to grow, and when to sell \nthose commodities, and the reports enable farmers to track cattle \nauction prices. Not only has NASS stopped putting out new reports about \ndemand and supply, exports, and prices, but all Web sites with past \ninformation have been taken down because of the government shutdown.\n  Farmers aren't receiving assistance from farm programs. The \nDepartment of Agriculture's local farm services offices have been shut \ndown because of the shutdown and, as a result, farmers can't apply for \nnew loans, sign up acreages for farm programs, or receive government \nchecks for the programs they are already enrolled in. Devastating to so \nmany of our people living on fixed incomes in North Dakota, who have \nengaged in and basically put their land into the conservation reserve \nprogram, is conservation reserve checks are not being issued. That has \na huge impact, particularly on those ranchers and those landowners who \nuse CRP payments to supplement their Social Security.\n  The list goes on and on. As time continues, this list will only get \nlonger and longer.\n  I understand the strategy, perhaps, in the House is to--whatever is \nthe headline of the day, whatever becomes the issue of the day, we will \nsimply write a little mini CR to take care of that, and say, see, we \nare dealing with that issue. But we know it is only a slice. It doesn't \ntake care of those small businesses that have applied for small \nbusiness loans and maybe got this close to being able to realize their \ndream and now have it delayed. It doesn't deal with the critical \nfunctions of government in its entirety. Instead, it picks and chooses \nthe winners and losers. Let me tell my colleagues, these ranchers who \nhave experienced this loss are the losers under this system.\n  It is time for this Congress to begin to do the responsible thing, \nwhich is open government, fund all of government, and start telling the \nAmerican people that their interests are paramount. Start telling \nfarmers and ranchers in the Dakotas who have experienced this \ntremendous loss that we care about their loss, that these programs have \nto work for them, and we have to do everything we can to make sure \nAmerica is working again.\n  I wish to close with one thought. In the great recession, one place \nwhere we have experienced a tremendous amount of opportunity and \nsupport has been in agriculture. Those States that had a good \nagricultural base had some of the lowest unemployment numbers in the \ncountry. Sixteen million jobs depend on agriculture in this country, \nand all they ask for in return is a little bit of help, a little bit of \na safety net for guaranteeing a food supply in this country. But we \ncan't seem to even deliver that obligation. We can't seem to deliver \nthat promise. We have to tell the American people that their interests \nare ahead of any petty or partisan interest in this body and in this \nCongress. We have to get the Congress back working for the American \npeople, particularly for the hard-hit ranchers and farmers of \nsoutheastern North Dakota and West River, SD.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Here we are again at the same crossroads. We know the \nlandmarks. We know the signs. We have been here before. We negotiated \nin good faith to avert the last shutdown, the last default threat. We \nopposed the sequester, but that wasn't enough. So here we are, once \nagain, and here we will be again in a week, a month, 6 months, a year, \nbeing asked for more concessions to a minority of extreme Republicans \nwho seem to have forgotten that we operate under the rule of law. They \nsimply have chosen to ignore it.\n\n  The fact is we passed the Affordable Care Act. It went through the \nlegislative process, was signed by the President, tested in the Supreme \nCourt, but so what, they say. It does not count. Similar to the \nschoolyard bully, they want a do-over or they will take over your lunch \nmoney.\n  The rightwing Republican minority claims to love the Constitution, \nadheres to the strictest interpretation of its tenets but apparently is \nnot interested in living by it or by the rule of law that this Nation \nstands for and lives by.\n  They say Democrats have failed to negotiate in good faith and voted \nagainst trying to reach a compromise. The fact is for 6 months Senate \nRepublicans have stood in the way of budget negotiations--what they \nwant, negotiations--by blocking requests for Budget Committee members \nto conference with the House of Representatives. They have objected \nover 20 times to those budget negotiations.\n  The Senate followed regular order and passed a budget resolution for \nfiscal year 2014 on March 23 of this year. Our budget resolution \nprovides just over $1 trillion by replacing the irresponsible \nsequestration cuts while following the spending limit imposed by the \nBudget Control Act. The House wants to keep sequestration cuts by \nfunding the government at $976 billion or about $80 billion less than \nthe Senate. The fact is we have already compromised with the House by \nagreeing\n\n[[Page S7377]]\n\nto a continuing resolution at a level of $986 billion--much closer to \ntheir numbers than to ours. If you ask me, that is more than $70 \nbillion in compromising. But they simply will not take yes for an \nanswer.\n  What the past weeks have shown us is that this is not even about \nbudget numbers. They just want to make a political point, and they are \nholding the country hostage in order to make it. They simply do not \nwant either the Affordable Care Act or, for that fact, this President \nto succeed. But that train has left the station. The President is \nalready turning the economy around from the massive deficits he \ninherited when he took office, and the Affordable Care Act is the law \nof the land.\n  Make no mistake, it is not a coincidence that we are here again doing \nthe same thing much like ``Groundhog Day.'' Mark my words, we will be \nhere again tomorrow and in the future if the Republican shutdown \nstrategy continues.\n  We are being asked to capitulate yet again at the threat that \nRepublicans will keep the government shut down, that they will force \nAmerica to default on its obligations and risk a global consequence and \nAmerica's leadership role in the world.\n  It is a deliberate, if fatally flawed, Republican strategy. One might \ngo so far as to call it a conspiracy--adopted to achieve through \nbullying what they cannot achieve at the ballot box.\n  We know it is a deliberate effort hatched many months ago. In fact, \nit goes back to 2010 when the House Republicans threatened to push the \nNation into defaulting on its obligations and shut down the government \nunless we agreed to aggressive and deep structural cuts that met their \npolitical objectives in the midst of one of the deepest recessions in \nour history, a recession President Obama inherited when he took office.\n  Then, in November of 2010, the antitax, antigovernment, antispending, \nantiprogress side of the Republican Party exercised their newfound \npower and hamstrung their leadership into rejecting any kind of \ncompromise, forcing the House Speaker and majority leader to reject any \ngrand bargain proposed by the Democrats. They did it gleefully. It was \npart of their strategy to block any successful effort to actually \ngovern. They chose instead to fuel the rightwing flames, burn down the \nhouse, and bring government to a halt until they achieved their \nobjectives.\n  From December 2 to December 21, 2010, we enacted four separate \ncontinuing resolutions to keep the government open--four of them--to \nkeep the government functioning until March 4. Let's not forget that \nthese appropriations actually cut the Congressional Budget Office's \nprojection of discretionary spending from 2013 through 2022 by $400 \nbillion. But that was not enough. They wanted more.\n  On March 2, 2011, as the new deadline approached, we passed another \nshort-term CR, taking us to March 18--just 16 days--that cut spending \nby yet another $4 billion. Still not enough.\n  On March 16, the deadline approaching once again, we passed another \ncontinuing resolution, taking us to April 8, with another $6 billion in \nspending cuts. Was it enough? Of course not.\n  On April 4, House Republicans applauded the Speaker's announcement to \nbegin preparations, for what, yes, a shutdown of the government. \nClearly, nothing is enough.\n  On April 14, just before midnight, the Speaker agreed to the seventh \nshort-term extension with more cuts that analysts said would amount to \nan additional $350 million in that year alone.\n  All in all, we agreed to $40 billion in total cuts, and we have cut \neven more since then, including the current Senate-passed clean funding \nbill that would reopen the government today if the House would just \npass it.\n  They say we have not taken votes. We have taken a bunch of votes on \nwhat they have sent us. They have not taken one vote on the one \nresolution we have sent them.\n  It is a clear pattern, a clear strategy. They will not stop. They \nwill not take yes for an answer, and they clearly will not govern until \nthey achieve their political and ideological goal to end government as \nwe know it. That has been their plan all along.\n  In fact, last Sunday the New York Times reported that after the \nPresident was sworn in to his second term, a coalition of top \nconservative activists, including former Attorney General Ed Meese, \nalong with the Koch brothers, devised a take-no-prisoners legislative \nstrategy to derail health care by shutting down the Federal Government. \nNow we are being blackmailed again. As further proof of this take-no-\nprisoners strategy, Jonathan Chait of New York magazine recently \nreported on something called the Williamsburg Accord. Mr. Chait wrote:\n\n       In January, [this year], demoralized House Republicans \n     retreated to Williamsburg, Virginia, to plot out their \n     legislative strategy for President Obama's second term. . . .\n\n  They called it the Williamsburg Accord. He said:\n\n       If you want to grasp why Republicans are careening toward a \n     potential federal government shutdown, and possibly toward \n     provoking a sovereign debt crisis after that, you need to \n     understand that this is the inevitable product of a \n     conscious party strategy. . . .\n\n  His article goes on to say:\n\n       The way to make sense of it is that Republicans have \n     planned since January to force Obama to accede to large \n     chunks of the Republican agenda, without Republicans having \n     to offer any policy concessions of their own.\n\n  That is not negotiation. We saw the implementation of that strategy \nbeginning early in the spring when we did exactly what Republicans \nwanted. We passed a budget in the Senate, and the House passed a \nbudget, and we attempted to go to conference to work out the difference \nbetween the two. Actually, we have attempted to do that more than 20 \ntimes now, and every single time Republicans have blocked action.\n  For 6 months they have refused to talk, they have refused to \nnegotiate, they have refused to have a conversation. As we now know, \nthis all was planned out from the beginning, going back to their \nJanuary Williamsburg Accord.\n  They have intentionally driven us to the edge of the cliff to serve \ntheir own political interests at the expense of the Nation's economy, \nthe jobs of working families, and the retirement savings of our \nseniors.\n  Now the GOP's solution to get us out of this Republican shutdown is \nthe equivalent of Whac-A-Mole. It is their form of governing. Whatever \nissue pops up that they see a problem with as a result of their \nshutdown, they draft a bill to address a single issue. Last week it was \nnational parks. This week it was death benefits for soldiers. What will \nit be next? Anyone who has ever been on the boardwalk and has played \nthat arcade game of Whac-A-Mole knows you can never quite get ahead of \nthose pesky moles that keep popping up. How long do they plan to govern \nin this way?\n  Bill Moyers recently wrote in an essay:\n\n       Despite what they say, Obamacare is only one of their \n     targets. Before they will allow the government to reopen, \n     they demand employers be enabled to deny birth control \n     coverage to female employees; they demand Obama cave on the \n     Keystone pipeline . . . they demand the watchdogs over \n     corporate pollution be muzzled and the big bad regulators of \n     Wall Street sent home. Their ransom list goes on and on. The \n     debt ceiling is next. . . .\n\n  At least let's name this for what it is: sabotage of the democratic \nprocess.\n  Kevin Drum of Mother Jones wrote:\n\n       How do you get across how insurrectionary this is? Raising \n     the debt ceiling isn't a concession from Republicans that \n     deserves a corresponding concession from Democrats. It's the \n     financial equivalent of a new nuclear bomb.\n\n  Warren Buffett used equally stark terms when he said in Fortune \nmagazine:\n\n       It ought to be banned----\n\n  Referring to defaulting on the Nation's obligations----\n\n       It ought to be banned as a weapon. . . . It should be like \n     nuclear bombs, basically too horrible to use.\n\n  Clearly, in the name of some misguided allegiance to an extreme \nideology, a handful of ultraconservative extremists in the Republican \nParty are putting at risk the rule of law. They are putting at risk the \nfull faith and credit of the United States, America's influence--as \nwell as our obligations--around the world, and our national security, \nembassy security, intelligence collection apparatus, and American \ndiplomats, Foreign Service officers, and contractors serving in posts \naround the world.\n\n[[Page S7378]]\n\n  This is not a game. Real people are already being hurt by these \ntactics. I find it pathetic that some Republicans are willing to risk \nthe full faith and credit of this Nation and inflict unnecessary harm \non hard-working families and put the very principles of this democracy \non the line all just to show how ideologically pure they are.\n  It is one thing to come to Washington wanting to destroy your \ngovernment. It is quite another to destroy our economy in the process.\n  If you want to negotiate, let's negotiate. Let's do it \nconstructively, in good faith, and without threats. Let's try, as we \nhave tried over 20 times, to get to that moment. Let's reopen the \ngovernment, let's pay our bills, and then we will negotiate.\n  It is time to reject the schoolyard bully political strategy that \nRepublicans hatched months ago, ratchet down the rhetoric, and do the \nhard work of solving problems together.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I heard the previous speaker plead for a \nsolution. I think we are all pleading for that. We are now in our 10th \nday of a government shutdown--quite frankly, one that did not have to \nhappen.\n  To some extent, it seems that this administration--meaning President \nObama's administration--is going to great efforts to inflict as much \npain through this shutdown as possible.\n  Mr. President, the administration went to great lengths to try to \nkeep World War II veterans from viewing the memorial dedicated to their \nservice, the World War II Memorial. It is an open-air memorial. It \nlikely took more effort and personnel to close and barricade the \nmemorial than it does to keep it open. It is one of those memorials \nwhere 24/7/365 you can go there. There is no reason it could not have \nbeen the same way during this recent period.\n  The government could be open and fully operating today but for the \nmajority and its unwillingness to engage in legitimate debate over \nproposals to amend ObamaCare or any other legitimate issue of dispute. \nWith regard to ObamaCare, not to defund or delay it is something that \nis not right in a body that is a deliberative body. You ought to \nconsider all issues.\n  Instead of wasting a lot of time being in quorum calls or days of not \nvoting, there could be legitimate discussions of pieces of legislation, \nand in the process maybe reach some sort of conclusion through what we \ncall ``regular order.''\n  The House has passed and the Senate has defeated three different \ncontinuing resolutions. Each one of those would have kept the \ngovernment open and prevented a shutdown. That looks like that is \nsomething that was debated here and decided here. But it was decided in \na manner that was not debatable, a motion to table the House \namendments. These three offers from the House of Representatives were \nrejected by the Senate majority. We are in this position because the \nSenate majority refused to give the American people relief from the \nindividual mandate and treat President Obama and his political \nappointees the same as all other Americans when it comes to Federal \nemployees and officials being covered by health insurance.\n  In addition to negotiating an end to the government shutdown, \nCongress now needs to deal with the approaching debt limit. This will \nbe the sixth debt limit increase in President Obama's 5 years in \noffice. During President Obama's term in office thus far, the United \nStates has added $6 trillion to our national debt.\n  We had 4 consecutive years with annual deficits above $1 trillion. \nFederal debt held by the public is now 73 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct. The historical average has been about 40 percent of GDP. This \nunsustainable debt path is threatening our economic growth and our \nstability.\n  This administration is quick to point out that the deficits have \nfallen faster than at any point since World War II. They fail to \nmention, however, that the deficit remains over $600 billion this very \nyear from highs near $1.4 trillion. Remember to compare the $600 \nbillion for this year with the largest annual deficit under President \nBush of $458 billion.\n  Much of the recently improved deficit picture is also due to the \nspending cuts imposed by the Budget Control Act of August 2, 2011, that \nwas enacted as part of the last debt ceiling increase. There is no \nbetter time to negotiate policies to address our fiscal problems than \nwhen debating debt ceilings.\n  But the President and the Secretary of the Treasury maintain that \nthey will not negotiate on the debt limit. There happen to be families \nall over this country which, because of the slow economy and \nunemployment, are being forced to make tough decisions to make ends \nmeet.\n  A lot of those families are looking at their budgets, looking right \nnow trying to determine which expenses can be cut. Maybe they will try \nto reduce their cell phone bill or perhaps they will cancel a newspaper \nor a magazine subscription or perhaps eat at home instead of eating at \nrestaurants.\n  The point is, when families face tight budgets and increasing debt, \nthey look for ways to cut spending and get their fiscal house in order. \nThat is the prudent thing to do. When bills come due, families make \ntough decisions on where to trim the budget. That is a family example \nof the Federal Government's legitimacy for looking at our spending.\n  At the very same time we are trying to increase the debt limit, we \nneed to consider possibilities and make compromises to get our budget \ndeficit down. Why can't the Federal Government then do the same? Why \ncan't we use this opportunity to put our Nation on a sound fiscal \ncourse? Why can't we work right now to enact policies that will \nhopefully then negate the need to take on more debt.\n  This seems to be a reasonable proposition, to do this when you are \ntalking about increasing the federal debt. Treasury Secretary Lew and \nhis boss, President Obama, have repeated the talking points that \nnegotiating deficit reduction policies on a debt ceiling increase is \nunprecedented. They claim that now is not the time to negotiate our \nbudget and fiscal problems.\n  The President stated last month:\n\n       You have never seen in the history of the United States the \n     debt ceiling or the threat of not raising the debt being used \n     to extort a President or a governing party and trying to \n     force issues that have nothing to do with the budget and \n     nothing to do with the debt.\n\n  The President just does not understand history or even recent history \nwhen he makes such a statement. President Obama and Secretary Lew can \nmake this claim as much as they want, but it does not make sense. It is \nnot true. The Washington Post fact checker gave this exact quote from \nPresident Obama four Pinocchio's, which rates the statement as a \n``whopper.''\n  The Post indicated that since 1953, Congress at times has used the \ndebt limit as a way to force concessions by the executive branch on \nspending. It also states that the Congress has used the debt limit on \nmany occasions to force changes in unrelated laws.\n  At least four major pieces of deficit reduction policies were enacted \nas part of a debt limit increase: Gramm-Rudman, 1985; the Budget \nEnforcement Act, 1990; the Balanced Budget Act, 1997; the Budget \nControl Act, 2011. So the facts are very clear. The debt limit has been \nused in the past as a means to enact different deficit reduction \npolicies and other reforms. Surely the President knew these facts when \nhe made that statement that the Washington Post fact checker rated as a \n``whopper'' with 4 Pinocchio's.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, since 1978, Congress \nhas voted to raise the debt ceiling 53 times: 27 of those times or 51 \npercent of the time the debt limit increase was tied to reforms. I \nquestioned Secretary Lew on this point this morning during our \nFinance Committee hearing. Unfortunately, I got the same tired talking \npoints that have been proven time and again to be wrong.\n\n  It is difficult to understand how an administration can expect us to \ntake them seriously on the offer of future negotiations when they \nmisrepresent such simple facts. The President and Congress must come to \nthe table and negotiate policies to get our fiscal\n\n[[Page S7379]]\n\nhouse in order. Does that put everything on the shoulders of the \nPresident of the United States? Absolutely not. It is just a fact that \nin this town, with our form of government, for over 225 years \nPresidential leadership is a very important part of the legislative \nprocess.\n  We have taken steps to address discretionary spending. We did that in \n2011 with the Budget Control Act. Now it is time to tackle \nentitlements. Without reform, entitlement spending will continue to \nconsume our budget. They will begin to squeeze out spending on \ndiscretionary spending, such as defense, education, and infrastructure. \nAccording to the CBO, spending on entitlements will double as a \npercentage of GDP from the historic average of 6.9 percent to 14.2 \npercent by 2038.\n  What does this mean for our economy? It means we will need to borrow \nmore and more to fulfill our obligations. That will crowd out money \nthat would otherwise be loaned in the private sector. This will lead to \nslower growth, less prosperity. It means that future generations may be \nless well-off than previous generations. The longer we kick the \nentitlement can down the road, the bigger the fiscal problems become \nand the harder the solutions will be.\n  It is time to make tough decisions and once and for all strengthen \nand secure these programs for future generations. These reforms will \nnot take place without presidential leadership. The President must now \ndemonstrate courage and the political will to put our Nation on a sound \nfiscal course.\n  That is not just the President's responsibility. That is a shared \nlegislative responsibility between that end of Pennsylvania Avenue and \nthis end. But it requires leadership that will bring people together. \nIt requires compromise. It requires concession. Most of all, we need to \nget back to basics. We have to be sitting at a table across from each \nother negotiating. We will not be able to address those looming fiscal \nproblems if President Obama is refusing even to sit across the table \nfrom Members of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats.\n  So I hope he will reconsider his ``no negotiation'' strategy so that \nwe can reopen the government, deal with the debt ceiling and begin to \naddress our unsustainable long-term fiscal challenges.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until \n7 p.m be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees, \nwith Senators on the majority side limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I have heard a number of speeches from my \ncolleagues on the floor today, both while presiding and in the last few \nmoments, that call on President Obama for Presidential leadership to \nhelp us reopen the government, address our serious long-term fiscal \nissues, and move us forward.\n  I want to note for the folks who might be watching that the President \nis at this very moment sitting with the leadership of the Republican \ncaucus in the House of Representatives. Tomorrow morning, I believe, he \nhas invited the Republican Members of this body to the White House for \nconversation.\n  I think we agree. One of the core challenges we face as this Federal \nshutdown goes into, I believe, its 10th day is discerning exactly why \nthe Federal Government is still shut down. When initially taken over \nthe cliff into the shutdown, it was to prevent the implementation of \nthe Affordable Care Act. That is what a number of Senators said on this \nfloor was their purpose. Now, many days and many unintended and \nunexpected harmful consequences later, we are told what this was really \nall about was to force the President to negotiate.\n  I serve on the Budget Committee. We passed, more than 200 days ago, \nmore than 6 months ago, a budget on this floor, and we have tried to go \nto conference on that budget now 21 times.\n  Yet each time it was blocked, objected to by a small number of \nSenators from the other party.\n  Frankly, my expectation, my hope is that we will return to a rational \nrules-following process here, reopen the government, not default on our \nnational debt, and begin those serious negotiations, those Budget \nCommittee negotiations that are long overdue to deal with the very real \nchallenges that are facing our country.\n  I wanted to speak today about one of the consequences of shutting \ndown our Federal Government. We see new ones every day, and we hear \nabout them on the Senate floor. As the days drag on, we hear more and \nmore about the impacts of the shutdown, sometimes with surprise, \nsometimes with regret, sometimes with outrage.\n  There is a lot on the line, and we have heard a lot about what the \nshutdown means for the various functions of the executive branch and of \nthe legislative branch. I have heard colleagues come and speak about \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission, about the FDA, about its impact on \nhigher education, its impact on families, and its impact on small \nbusinesses. I have heard many folks come to this floor and comment on \nhow the executive branch and its functions that affect communities and \nfamilies all over this country are affected by the shutdown.\n  We have heard from our constituents who are trying to reach Senators \nand are trying to seek our help with a variety of Federal services. \nThey are frustrated that the legislative branch is largely shut down, \nbut there is another branch to our three-branch coordinate government. \nAbsent from this debate and discussion is how the shutdown is affecting \nthe judicial branch of our government.\n  When the Federal Government shut down 10 years ago, the Federal court \nsystem was initially seemingly largely unaffected because they had \nenough funds in reserve to remain open for 10 business days--a period \nthat will come to an end early next week.\n  On Tuesday the Federal judiciary of the United States will run out of \nthe reserve funds it has been using to stay open. The big question is, \nWhat happens then?\n  The chief judge of the bankruptcy court for the District of Delaware, \nmy home State, told me:\n\n       We are really in an uncertain situation, particularly when \n     it comes to employees. I am fearful for them and how they are \n     going to be able to pay for rent and mortgages, and provide \n     food and day-care for their families.\n\n  This is uncharted territory for our Federal judiciary. When the money \nruns out, Federal, circuit, and district courts will each be on their \nown, much like each Senator who has to choose which of his employees or \nher employees are essential, deemed vital, and need to stay, and which \nshould be furloughed and stay home, uncertain whether they will be \npaid. Each district court and circuit court will figure out on its own \nhow to keep the lights and which employees will keep working without a \nsalary.\n  As the chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Bankruptcy and \nthe Courts, I have heard from a number of Federal judges this week who \nare frustrated by the amount of time they are spending trying to figure \nout what the shutdown means for their courts and their employees rather \nthan doing the job for which they were confirmed, which is to judge \ncases.\n  This is an enormous distraction, a profound waste of time. This is \nnot advancing our core objective, which should be growing our economy, \nstrengthening our country, confronting the fiscal challenges in front \nof us, and working together to achieve some principled compromises in \nthe Congress of the United States. In my view, Federal judges should be \ndeciding cases, not deciding how to keep their courthouses running \nduring this Federal Government shutdown. This needs to end. It could \nend literally today in a matter of minutes if Speaker Boehner would \nbring to the floor and allow a vote on a bill sent over from this \nSenate more than 10 days ago that would allow the Federal Government to \nreopen.\n  The judicial branch is not another Federal agency. It is not a \nprogram that can be suspended or a benefit that can be delayed. It is a \nbranch. The Federal court system was created in our Constitution as the \nthird pillar of our democracy. It is an independent branch of \ngovernment whose fundamental mission is being undermined by folks, some \nof whom claim to love and to rigidly interpret the Constitution. Yet \nthe consequences for our constitutional order of this senseless \nshutdown, I am\n\n[[Page S7380]]\n\nafraid, will soon become clear in the days ahead.\n  The subcommittee has heard from a number of Federal judges and clerks \nthis week. I must warn you there are a lot of unanswered questions \nthere. The path forward is murky. The central question in the courts--\nas it was here in Congress and in the executive branch--is who is \nconsidered ``essential.'' Is it the people directly involved in the \nresolution of cases or are the staff who support that process also \nexpected to work without pay?\n  Here is the type of question our judiciary was dealing with today \ninstead of resolving disputes or working on long-term cost-saving \nmeasures. Evidence in our Federal courts these days is typically \npresented electronically to jurors rather than handing out photocopies, \nwhich is great as long as the technology is working in the courtroom. \nCase files are processed electronically these days as well. But what if \nthere is a problem? What if the technology doesn't work and a trial is \ndisrupted? At what point does a technological glitch become a \nlegitimate due process issue? If the courtroom technology can't get an \nupgrade to fix a bug, will it result in a costly mistrial? The \nConstitution and the Sixth Amendment guarantee criminal defendants a \nright to a speedy trial. What happens when our courts can't live up to \nthat Sixth Amendment guarantee because of this ongoing Federal \nshutdown?\n  The problem is equally severe in civil and bankruptcy matters. With \nthe DOJ's Office of the U.S. Trustee in shutdown status, the number of \ntrustee attorneys in Delaware has been cut from seven to two. This can \ndramatically slow the bankruptcy process and leave real jobs and real \nlives hanging in the balance as cases are unresolved and as resolutions \ndon't move forward.\n  This raises another fundamental question. At what point in this \nongoing senseless shutdown does our civil justice system fail to live \nup to America's promise as a free market economy grounded in the rule \nof law?\n  When an investor anywhere in the world looks to make a bet on a new \ncompany, a new idea, that investor will obtain certain rights in \nexchange. Those rights may include a share of equity or a priority \nright in the event of liquidation. What gives those rights meaning is \nultimately a highly functioning, impartial, and reliable court system. \nThat historically has been one of our great advantages competitively in \nthe world economy. Our courts, even while plagued by persistent \nvacancies, lack of new authorized judgeships, and the sequester, \ncontinue to perform this vital function. Without these courts, these \nrights mean nothing. Without the reliable enforcement of these rights, \nthere is no more new investment, no more new job creation, and no more \nnew ideas successfully brought to market. We are not the only country \nin the world competing for investment capital and for ideas. When we \nundermine our civil courts, we are being hostile to those very \ninvestors who could help get our economy back on track.\n\n  The Federal shutdown is already slowing the resolution of civil cases \ninvolving the Federal Government. Clerks at district courts around the \ncountry have confirmed to my subcommittee that the Department of \nJustice is requesting continuances broadly and across-the-board and \ntrying to juggle the demands of their caseloads with the constraints of \nthis reckless shutdown. Think about it. Social Security appeals, civil \nforfeiture cases, business disputes, consumer protection cases, \nMedicare fraud cases, incidents of employment discrimination--they are \nall being pushed to the background. This shutdown is bringing new \nmeaning to Dr. King's famous words: ``Justice too long delayed is \njustice denied.''\n  Only this morning I heard from the head of Delaware's district court, \nchief judge Gregory Sleet. He said, in essence--no insult intended, but \nhis observation was that Congress is letting our country down. The \nsubcommittee also spoke with a district court clerk yesterday who \nsaid--and I thought this was particularly striking--he was glad he was \nnearing retirement so he could escape the dysfunction of the Federal \nGovernment and our ongoing, seemingly routine manufactured crises.\n  This shutdown is exacerbating what is a more profound problem--a \ndisregard for the upkeep of our Federal judiciary. More than 90 Federal \njudgeships are vacant. There are 39 vacancies that are deemed \n``judicial emergencies.'' We need to do more to support and sustain the \nstaffing, quality, and future investment that is required to make our \nFederal courts work as well as they possibly can.\n  I wish to make a point or two in conclusion. First, one of the \nessential questions every district court and circuit court will face is \nwhich of its employees are essential. After all of the cuts of the \nsequester and all of the burdens and challenges facing our Federal \nGovernment, aren't all the employees of our Federal judicial system, \nthis separate branch, essential? The chief judge for the Third Judicial \nCircuit of the United States believes so, and I agree with him. This \nmorning he announced that nearly ``all functions, with few limited \nexceptions, are essential . . . .'' I join the chief judge of the Third \nJudicial Circuit and urge other circuits to follow suit and to \nrecognize that this independent third branch of our constitutional \norder is essential.\n  Last, this shutdown has dragged morale in our courts and our court \nsystem to a new low. We in Congress are blessed with a record number of \nattorneys who serve in Congress. It is my hope that this body \nrecognizes the unique value of our Federal court system. Our democracy \ncannot afford to furlough justice. We cannot shut the doors to our \ncourthouses. It is my hope that Speaker Boehner, following the \nconversation unfolding at the White House, will come back and put to \nthe vote an action that will allow the courts and this country to get \nback to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I understand that the order of the day is that time is \ndivided equally until 7 o'clock, with the majority setting a limitation \nof 10 minutes but no limitation on the minority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COBURN. I rise to speak about the issue in front of us. I want to \nspend a few minutes putting things in context. I won't repeat things I \nhave said routinely on the floor, but I think it is important for the \nAmerican people to understand where we are in our country.\n  Using generally accepted accounting principles--these aren't my \nnumbers--we have almost $126 trillion in unfunded liabilities and we \nhave $17 trillion worth of debt. We have a lot of obligations in front \nof us. If we add up every asset in the United States--all the bank \naccounts, all the lands, all the possessions, everything we own, plus \nwhat we own outside of the United States--it comes to $94 trillion. In \nessence, we are almost $50 trillion in the hole. That is called a \nnegative net worth.\n  I appreciate the comments of my colleague from Delaware. I have the \ngreatest admiration for him. I am not one of those who think we should \nbe in shutdown. I also am not one of those who think we should just, \nwithout any solution to our problem, raise the debt limit.\n  I would also note that we don't have to have a budget right now in \nthe Senate because we agreed to the Budget Control Act, which sets the \ndiscretionary spending levels for the next 10 years in this country. \nThey are set by law. What is important is that appropriations bills \ncome through the committees--the House first and the Senate second--so \nthat we can address the issues. We didn't do that in the Senate. They \ndid about half of them in the House. We wouldn't have a continuing \nresolution--which, by the way, I think all of us agree is very \ndifficult for our Federal employees to operate under.\n  But I wanted to make a couple of points. One is that in July of 2011, \nafter 7 years of oversight, I put out $9 trillion of what I think are \ncommonsense eliminations and changes we could make that today would put \nus at a $200 billion surplus instead of a $750 billion deficit. Those \nsavings were $3 trillion total in discretionary spending, $1 trillion \nin defense spending, $2.7 trillion in terms of modernization of our \nhealth entitlement programs, and $1 trillion from the Tax Code. We \nactually have earmarks in the Tax Code for those who are well-heeled \nand well-connected--a benefit--and the average American gets nothing. \nThere are interest payment savings of $1.3 trillion\n\n[[Page S7381]]\n\nand a 75-year solvency for the Social Security. That was put out 2\\1/2\\ \nyears ago. Very little of it has been used. As a matter of fact, most \npeople haven't read it. It was put out in a binder. We didn't print \nmany binders because I am so tight, I don't want to print that many \nbinders, but this is what it looks like. It is online. People may read \nit and see if it makes common sense. Most people won't.\n  I am going to spend some time outlining some of the things that came \nfrom that and some of the excesses of the Federal Government.\n  Most Americans know we are not efficient. They understand that we are \nnot doing a good job spending their money, but they have no idea how \nbad it really is. I have actually spent the last 9 years in oversight \nof almost every segment of the Federal Government. None of us can be \nproud of the way we spend the money. Most of it is very well \nintentioned, honorably intentioned, with minimal oversight, minimal \ncontrol, with over $150 billion of fraud every year, and I am talking \npure fraud, and with $250 billion of real duplication--programs that do \nexactly the same thing, run by different agencies, with no \nconsideration to streamline those. None of those things have been \nconsidered.\n\n  We won't even do tax reform to get rid of unemployment for \nmillionaires. What people don't realize is we paid $60 million out over \nthe last 2 years to people who were making $1 million a year. We are \npaying them unemployment. They hardly need the unemployment check. Yet \nwe won't even regulate those kinds of things.\n  I think we have failed to do our job, and that is a Republican and \nDemocratic thing. That is us. That is not a partisan statement.\n  The last time the President signed an individual spending bill into \nlaw--an individual appropriations bill--was 4 years ago. Four years ago \nwas the last time he signed an independent appropriations bill into \nlaw. That tells you Congress hasn't done its job. We haven't passed \nthem.\n  According to studies, if you poll the American people in terms of the \nsequester, less than one in four felt any impact at all from the \nsequester. And I think the sequester is a terrible way to determine \nspending. I voted against the Budget Control Act for that very reason, \nbecause we are not responsible enough to do the management and the \noversight. But most Americans see no impact from it, and that is \nbecause in what we do there is so much waste and mismanagement. There \nis so much duplication, there is so much error that we could easily \ntake that out and most people wouldn't notice it. They haven't noticed \nit.\n  Some of our Federal employees have noticed it, but the average \nAmerican, 76 percent of them have never felt any impact from it \nwhatsoever. They do not even know it happened. There has been no impact \non their daily life. Increasing the debt limit and passing another CR \nisn't going to do a thing to eliminate government waste, fraud, or \nduplication.\n  It is time we kind of reassess where we are. One of the reasons I am \nagainst a debt limit increase is because it takes the pressure off \nMembers of Congress to make the hard choices. If we raise the debt \nlimit, that means we don't have to make the hard choices and we will \nrun a deficit again and again. Toward the end of this decade, just 7 \nyears from now, the deficits start climbing well above $1 trillion \nagain--$1 trillion a year. Our deficit is growing twice as fast as our \neconomy is--our debt is. It is growing twice as fast as our economy is. \nSo we are going down in a hole.\n  We ought to be about--Democrats and Republicans--holding hands and \nsaying let's stop this nonsense. Let's put some brakes on ourselves. \nLet's put in some limitations so we don't continue to fall prey to \nducking the very difficult decisions facing this country. Households do \nthat, businesses do it all the time. They assess where they are, they \nassess how deep the hole is, because nobody gives them the ability to \nsay: You don't have to make those hard choices, we will give you more \nborrowing power. What they do is make those hard choices. We refuse to \ndo so.\n  Another example. We just finished year end and there is this syndrome \nin Washington called ``use it or lose it.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article from the Washington Post with the lead-in ``As Congress \nfights over the budget, agencies go on their `use it or lose it' \nshopping sprees.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 28, 2013]\n\n As Congress Fights Over the Budget, Agencies Go on Their ``Use It or \n                       Lose It'' Shopping Sprees\n\n                       (By David A. Fahrenthold)\n\n       This past week, the Department of Veterans Affairs bought \n     $562,000 worth of artwork.\n       In a single day, the Agriculture Department spent $144,000 \n     on toner cartridges.\n       And, in a single purchase, the Coast Guard spent $178,000 \n     on ``Cubicle Furniture Rehab.''\n       This string of big-ticket purchases was an unmistakable \n     sign: It was ``use it or lose it'' season again in \n     Washington.\n       All week, while Congress fought over next year's budget, \n     federal workers were immersed in a separate frantic drama. \n     They were trying to spend the rest of this year's budget \n     before it is too late.\n       The reason for their haste is a system set up by Congress \n     that, in many cases, requires agencies to spend all their \n     allotted funds by Sept. 30.\n       If they don't, the money becomes worthless to them on Oct. \n     1. And--even worse--if they fail to spend the money now, \n     Congress could dock their funding in future years. The \n     incentive, as always, is to spend.\n       So they spent. It was the return of one of Washington's \n     oldest bad habits: a blitz of expensive decisions, made by \n     agencies with little incentive to save.\n       Private contractors--worried that sequestration would \n     result in a smaller spending rush this year--brought in food \n     to keep salespeople at their desks. Federal workers quizzed \n     harried colleagues in the hallways, asking if they had spent \n     it all yet.\n       ``The way we budget [money] sets it up,'' said Sen. Tom \n     Coburn (R-Okla.). ``Because instead of being praised for not \n     spending all your money, you get cut for not spending all \n     your money. And so we've got a perverse incentive in there.'' \n     But, Coburn said, ``nobody's talking about it but me and \n     you.''\n       Coburn said he had meant to mention it in his floor speech \n     Wednesday. Then, when he got to the podium, he forgot.\n       ``Use it or lose it'' season is not marked on any official \n     government calendars. But in Washington, it is as real as \n     Christmas. And as lucrative.\n       And--it appears--about as permanent. ``We cannot expect our \n     employees to believe that cost reduction efforts are serious \n     if they see evidence of opportunistic spending in the last \n     days of the Fiscal Year,'' President Lyndon B. Johnson wrote \n     to underlings in May 1965. Even then, Johnson said an end-of-\n     year binge was ``an ancient practice--but that does not \n     justify it or excuse it.''\n       Today, government spending on contracts still spikes at the \n     end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.\n       In 2012, for instance, the government spent $45 billion on \n     contracts in the last week of September, according to \n     calculations by the fiscal-conservative group Public Notice. \n     That was more than any other week--9 percent of the year's \n     contract spending money, spent in 2 percent of the year.\n       Much of it is spent smartly, on projects that had already \n     gone through an extensive review.\n       But not all of it.\n       In 2010, for instance, the Internal Revenue Service had \n     millions left over in an account to hire new personnel. The \n     money would expire at year's end. Its solution was not a \n     smart one.\n       The IRS spent the money on a lavish conference. Which \n     included a ``Star Trek'' parody video starring IRS managers. \n     Which was filmed on a ``Star Trek'' set that the IRS paid to \n     build. (Sample dialogue: ``We've received a distress call \n     from the planet NoTax.'')\n       ``That is a major problem,'' acting IRS commissioner Daniel \n     I. Werfel told Congress in June, explaining the role of ``use \n     it or lose it'' in that debacle.\n       Other end-of-year mistakes are less spectacular--but they \n     still cause problems. One recent study, for instance, found \n     that information technology contracts signed at year's end \n     often produced noticeably worse results than those signed in \n     calmer times.\n       And late-September waste also weighs on its witnesses, \n     federal workers. After President Obama set up an online \n     suggestion box for federal workers, many asked to get rid of \n     the ``use it or lose it'' system. They suggested ``rolling \n     over'' money for use in the next year. And they listed dumb \n     things they had seen bought: three years' worth of staples. \n     Portable generators that never got used. One said the \n     National Guard bought so much ammunition that firing it all \n     became a chore.\n       ``When you get BORED from shooting MACHINE GUNS, there is a \n     problem,'' an anonymous employee wrote.\n       ``People want to do the right thing,'' said Dean Sinclair, \n     a former State Department employee who is crusading to change \n     the system. ``It's not that the federal workforce is filled \n     with bad people. The system sort of forces them to make bad \n     decisions.''\n       He suggests giving bonuses to managers who return leftover \n     money to the Treasury at year's end. ``It takes time and \n     effort to waste money,'' Sinclair said. ``Remember that.''\n\n[[Page S7382]]\n\n       Obama, like presidents before him, has exhorted agencies to \n     plan better and avoid rushed decisions at year's end. But the \n     White House says Congress is making that job harder.\n       ``Twenty-five percent of my business, right, will happen in \n     this month. Twenty-five percent of my year,'' said Art \n     Richer, the president of ImmixGroup, a contractor in Tysons \n     Corner that helps software and computing companies seeking \n     government business.\n       September in Washington used to be a time for selling face \n     to face. Contractors visited the Pentagon. Small-town mayors \n     queued up in the hallways at the Commerce Department, waiting \n     to make a late-night pitch for grants.\n       But those buildings are off-limits now. So you sell from \n     your desk. You sell with your voice. You sell with empathy, \n     for the poor harried bureaucrat on the other end of the line. \n     ``Answer the phone smiling,'' Richer tells his people.\n       Of course, the feds were stressed.\n       ``We see them in the hallway, and you go, `How much money \n     are we going to lose?' '' one Army officer said this past \n     week. That officer was involved in setting budgets for future \n     years, and the meaning was clear: How much money are you not \n     going to spend? Whatever that number was, it would be taken \n     out of budgets for fiscal 2015, too.\n       This is not normal math. But this was not a normal time in \n     Washington: You didn't save money to spend it later. You \n     spent now, to spend later. ``They know they're under the \n     gun,'' the officer said, who spoke anonymously to talk about \n     internal budgeting discussions.\n       On Monday, Immix began bringing its sales team three \n     catered meals a day. If workers walked to Subway, they might \n     lose a sale. On that day, Immix handled $16 million in \n     business. A normal Monday is about $2 million.\n       Across the government, agencies were making big-ticket \n     purchases--buying things with this year's money that could be \n     used next year.\n       On Monday, VA paid $27,000 for an order of photographs \n     showing sunsets, mountain peaks and country roads. They would \n     go into a new center serving homeless veterans in Los \n     Angeles; a spokeswoman described the art as ``motivational \n     and calming, professionally designed to enhance clinical \n     operations.''\n       On Tuesday, the USDA bought $127,000 worth of toner \n     cartridges (``end of year,'' the order explained). VA spent \n     another $220,000 on artwork for its hospitals.\n       On Wednesday, the Coast Guard paid $178,000 for cubicle \n     furniture, replacing high-walled cubes with low-walled ones \n     to improve the air flow in a large office area.\n       ``Other higher-priority projects were not able to be \n     executed, so they moved [money] to this lower-priority \n     project'' before the year's end, said Coast Guard spokesman \n     Carlos Diaz. ``The money was going to be spent anyway.''\n       On Thursday, VA was buying art again. It spent $216,000 on \n     artwork for a facility in Florida. In all, preliminary data \n     showed that the agency made at least 18 percent of all its \n     art purchases for the year in this one week. One-sixth of the \n     buying in one-52nd of the year.\n       On Friday, the end was in sight.\n       ``I feel good. Four days, right?'' said Corey Forshee, a \n     contracting officer at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. \n     Forshee was part of a team at Andrews that had done its best \n     to beat the September rush.\n       The commander, trying to avoid a last-week rush, set his \n     own deadline of Sept. 20. The pizza came early. The \n     chaplain's office visited early (``use it or lose it'' season \n     is traditionally stressful enough to get the chaplain \n     involved). The buying was nearly done.\n       Now, they had to wait for the last act of the last act: the \n     ``fall-out money.''\n       This was cash that other parts of the Air Force had not \n     been able to spend. It would be redistributed to this office \n     at the last minute.\n       ``We're waiting for money for that,'' Forshee said, going \n     down a list of unfunded projects. A roof for the workout \n     area. A bathroom renovation. ``Just waiting for money,'' he \n     repeated.\n       Across Washington, everybody had to wait.\n       ``It's going to come down to Monday,'' said Richer, at \n     ImmixGroup. On Friday, he said his sales had been about equal \n     to last year's, despite worries about sequestration.\n       On Monday, Richer's people will sell until midnight. Then \n     they will keep selling. ``Money rolls across the continent,'' \n     the feds say. Cash not spent in Washington might be spent by \n     federal offices in California in the three hours before it is \n     midnight there.\n       When it is midnight in California--3 a.m. in Washington--\n     they will keep on. There are federal offices in Hawaii, after \n     all. And it will still be three hours until midnight there.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me give the American people a little taste of what we \nspent in the last week.\n  In the last week, the State Department spent $5 million on new \nglassware for all our embassies. Was that something we needed to do? \nNo. Was it an absolute requirement that we couldn't operate our \nembassies without another $5 million worth of glassware? No. The State \nDepartment had $5 million, and if they didn't spend it, they would be \naccused of not needing all their money. So they spent $5 million on \nsomething that was not absolutely necessary.\n  In the last week, VA spent more than $560,000 on artwork. As a matter \nof fact, in the last 2 days. I mean, we are bankrupt. We are running \nthree-quarters of a trillion dollar deficit and we are going to buy a \nhalf million dollars worth of artwork because if we don't spend it on \nsomething we won't get it next year? Where does that fit in with any \ncommon sense? Where does that fit with the integrity or the honor that \nwill preserve the future of our country? It doesn't. We have to change \nthat.\n  We have not done things that incentivize Federal employees not to \nspend it and we will give you part of it next year for your budget and \nthe rest of it against the debt our kids will have.\n  The Coast Guard, in the last day, spent $178,000 on cubicle furniture \nrehab. They signed a contract on the last day and sent the check out \nthe door. It may be it needed to be rehabbed, but they made sure they \ngot it in this year to consume the money.\n  The Agriculture Department, in 1 day, spent $144,000 on toner \ncartridges. Think about it--$144,000. These are all small amounts \nrelative to Washington numbers, but the principle is exactly the same.\n  On the night before the government closed, the last day of the fiscal \nyear, the Pentagon awarded 94 contracts right before midnight. I can't \nget the information on what they were yet, but I will. I will find out \nif they were necessary, if it is something that we needed to have in \nlight of our debt and our dysfunction.\n  They also spent $5 billion on everything from robot submarines, \nFinnish hand grenades only hours before the closing of the fiscal year. \nSo they spent the money, not saying it was a priority, other than it \nwas a priority to spend all the money we have because we are afraid we \nmight not get enough money next year.\n  The Defense Logistics Agency spent $65 million for military helmets \non the last day, $24 million for traveling wave tubes to amplify radio \nsignals.\n  How do we think the hundreds of thousands of people who are \nfurloughed right now feel about us spending money that way when that \ncould be paying them and they could be working?\n  We are sick. We need a wakeup call.\n  Let me cite a couple others from the Department of Defense just to \nshow you how parochialism plays into this. Twelve brandnew--brandnew--\nairplanes, C-27J Spartans, were delivered right before the end of the \nyear. Guess where they are. They are in mothballs in Arizona in the \ndesert because we don't need them. But we spent $567 million for \nsomething we didn't need. So what do we do? We store them in the desert \nbecause the humidity is so low. So we take them right off the \nmanufacturing line and fly them right to storage. They are not needed.\n  We have the same problem on the C-27As in Afghanistan. We spent $596 \nmillion for those. We finally canceled the contracts because the \nsupplier couldn't supply the spare parts. And you know what the \nmilitary is getting ready to do, rather than bringing them home or \ngiving them to somebody else? They are getting ready to cut them into \npieces in Afghanistan--$\\1/2\\ billion worth of airplanes.\n  Where is common sense in this country? Why wouldn't we think about \nmaybe selling them to somebody else and getting some of our value back? \nBut we are thinking about cutting them up.\n  Then there is the M1A1 Abrams tank. We had testimony from Secretary \nof the Army John McHugh saying this is the most modern piece of \nequipment the military has. Its average age is less than 2\\1/2\\ years \nold. We don't need any more M1A1 Abrams tanks, but they are still being \nproduced this year to the tune of $3 billion so we can keep people \nemployed in a factory making something we don't need.\n  Isn't that wonderful? Isn't that a great way to steal the future of \nyour kids? But I am sure the politicians where they are made are very \nhappy we are continuing to buy something we don't need because it helps \nthe economy in their area.\n  Despite the sequester, the National Science Foundation is still \nfunding\n\n[[Page S7383]]\n\nhundreds of products and studies that do not fit with common sense or a \npriority. Even if they fit with common sense, they do not fit the \npriority of where we find ourselves financially.\n  The Department of Agriculture grants that were announced in the last \nweek before we shut down, before we went to the next fiscal year and \ndon't have a continuing CR--let me read this and see if you think this \nis how we should be spending our money: 35 wine-tasting projects, wine \ntrail smart phone apps. We are going to supply the money for these. The \nFederal Government is going to supply the money for these so you can \nhave a good time when you go to whatever vineyard it is. We are going \nto take Federal taxpayer money.\n  Those are private businesses. Yet we are spending our grandchildren's \nmoney on that?\n  Four Christmas tree initiatives: Virginia Christmas trees, Michigan \nChristmas trees; training seminars on how you sell Christmas trees.\n  You know, Christmas trees are in pretty good demand around Christmas. \nI am not sure you are going to markedly increase the demand for \nChristmas trees by learning how to sell them better.\n  The USA pear road show to China; social media for apples, radio \nadvertisements--paid for by the Federal Government--for blueberries \nfrom New Jersey, strawberries, organizing a maple weekend in the state \nof our Presiding Officer--Massachusetts.\n  We are spending our grandkids' money, money we are borrowing, to do \nthings that are not a priority. They may be a priority to those folks \nwho get the money, but in terms of our national priorities, they are \nnot anywhere close.\n  Other examples of ongoing government waste and duplication not \neliminated but instead funded by the CR: $30 billion for 47 job \ntraining programs that aren't working. They are not working. The GAO \nsays they are not working, we know they are not working, and all of \nthem duplicate one another except for three. But we are continuing to \nspend $30 billion a year on them.\n  The House has passed a skills act which consolidated all of them. We \nwon't even take it up over here. We won't even look at it. It would \nsave us about $7 billion or $8 billion a year. They read the GAO \nreport, they acted on it, but we won't.\n  We have 20 Federal programs across 12 different Federal agencies and \noffices for the study of invasive species. I think we ought to study \ninvasive species, but I don't think we need 12 different Federal \nagencies involved in it. And I don't think we need 20 programs on it.\n  I mentioned the unemployment for millionaires. That is in the CR. We \ndidn't do anything to fix that.\n  There is $30 million for 15 different financial literacy programs at \n15 different agencies. We just created a new one at the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau. Rather than eliminate the ones that are \nnot working, we are creating more of them.\n  There is $947,000 in the NASA budget to talk about foods that can be \neaten on Mars. We are 30 years away from going to Mars. Yet we are \ngoing to spend $1 million of taxpayer money we don't have to think \nabout foods we might eat 30 years from now on Mars? I don't think that \nis a priority for us right now.\n  There is $3 billion on 209 science, technology, engineering, and math \nprograms at 13 different agencies. Think about that. We all know we \nneed to get it together when it comes to education in our technical and \nscientific areas. But why would we have this many--209--programs, with \n209 different sets of administrators and 209 sets of reporting?\n  There is billions of dollars in bonuses and Federal payments to \ncontractors who fail to pay their own taxes. We have tried to pass in \nhere multiple times that if you are a contractor with the Federal \nGovernment and you are not paying your taxes, you are either going to \nlose your contract or that tax debt is going to be reduced from what we \npay you. But we can't get that through. So people who aren't carrying \ntheir fair share are still reaping the benefits of contracting with the \nFederal Government even though they are tax cheats.\n  Here is one small one, but this one really gets me. It is bigger than \nyou would think. We have an agency that spends $66 million a year. It \nis the NTIS. I asked GAO to study them. They studied them. In their \nreport this year, GAO explained there is an office in the Department of \nCommerce, which is this office, that sells reports to other agencies.\n  When we had GAO study this, we found 74 percent of the reports they \nsell to other agencies you can get from this one Web site for free. \nTheir budget hasn't gone down, it has expanded. But the need for the \nagency is going away. So why are we continuing to spend $66 million--\nwhich is what we directly spend and doesn't count what they collect \nfrom all the other agencies--for only 26 percent of the information \nthat is not available other than at Google? It makes no sense. It is \ncalled the National Technical Information Service, and it was \nestablished in 1950, tasked with collecting and distributing certain \nreports.\n  GAO noticed this 10 years ago; they noticed it again now. Congress \nhas done nothing. What GAO estimates is 621,917 of the 841,000 reports \nthis agency puts out are available for free on the Internet. Go to \nGoogle and every American can find it for free. All the agencies that \nare paying can find it for free. But we haven't eliminated this agency.\n  I will stop with that, and I will make a couple points.\n  It is wonderful that we have a difference of opinion in the Congress, \nbut we can't have a difference of opinion about where this country is \nheaded. We are bankrupt. People don't like to say that word. This is \nAmerica; we couldn't be bankrupt. But from a balance sheet standpoint \nand from an income sheet standpoint, we are bankrupt.\n  So what are the American people to do about this? Are we to continue \nto spend money every year to the tune of $500 billion to $1 trillion \nand not make the tough choices or should we do something about it? \nShould there be a resolution to this addiction of spending money we \ndon't have on things we don't need?\n  As a physician, for every person I have ever encountered who had an \naddiction, the first step in confronting that addiction is to recognize \nthe reality of the addiction. Quite frankly, Members of Congress \nhaven't done that. The American people have. They are figuring it out.\n  The reason I know we haven't recognized the addiction and we are not \nworried--we can say our debt can be such a percentage of GDP. We don't \nhave to live within our means. We can handle it as long as we don't get \nabove a certain percentage. That is the rationalization of an enabler \nin a family who allows somebody to continue to be addicted.\n  Every addiction needs a 12-step program, and the first step is \nrecognizing that we are addicted. And we are. So one of the things the \nAmerican people are starting to ask about us, given that we can't even \npass a CR--and we are going to pass a debt limit increase and not make \nany of the hard choices. They won't be made this year. They won't be \nmade next year. The only time we are going to make the hard choices is \nwhen the international financial community forces us to make those.\n  But what Americans are asking now, the confidence is so low, is who \ndecides? Do we really represent their thoughts about spending, about \npriorities, about waste?\n  If we recognize that all this is there--these trillions and trillions \nof dollars over 10 years that could be changed without any marked \nimpact on America, and we don't do anything about it--what they are \nasking is who is deciding? Who decides? Do I represent my constituents \nif I won't try to change these things?\n  The confidence level in us, as reflected in the polls, and when you \ntalk to anybody, is they don't have any confidence in us because we \nwon't admit to our addiction, come together, get on the wagon and solve \nthe addiction.\n  A long time ago in this body I said there was a rumble out in \nAmerica. It wasn't long after that the tea party came along. I know \nthey are thought about with some disdain. They are not crazy. What they \nhave done is lost confidence and they want something changed. But it is \nnot just the tea party anymore. It doesn't matter your\n\n[[Page S7384]]\n\npolitical persuasion. They think we don't get it, that we are not \nwilling to make the sacrifices of our own political careers to solve \nthe problems. What we need to be doing, in my opinion--and my \nprescription for us is, American people, don't let us get out of the \nbox by letting us raise again the shackles that are going to be \nincreased by increasing the debt in this country. Because if we do--and \nwe will--what will happen is we won't perform. We won't make the tough \ndecisions. We won't make the sacrifices. There will be no sacrificial \nleadership on the part of Members of Congress. Their sacrifice will be, \nHow do I get reelected, rather than I don't care if I lose; our country \nneeds to be fixed, and we need to be about addressing that even if it \ncosts me a political position.\n  When it is all said and done and America has blown through and we see \nthe real results of our profligate spending and the hyperinflation and \nthe marked decrease in the standard of living in this country, what \nthey are going to remember about us is there was a challenge and we \ndidn't rise to it. We didn't rise to the occasion. We saw short term \nand we forgot and ignored the long-term consequences of our actions.\n  My hope is that will change on both sides of the aisle; that we would \ntruly embrace a long-term picture and recognize the tremendous \ndifficulty. We have heard all this talk about how we have to raise the \ndebt limit; otherwise, we are going to default. We are not going to \ndefault on our bonds, ever. It requires less than 7 percent of our \ntotal cashflow that comes into this country. We use that as a scare \ntactic.\n  I am not saying we should necessarily not increase the debt ceiling, \nbut we sure shouldn't increase it until we have made a commitment that \nwe are going to solve the problem, because we will be back here in 1\\1/\n2\\ years doing exactly the same thing with exactly the same excuses \nthat say why we can't.\n  What America is wanting to hear from us is why we can. They are not \nwanting to hear about division. They are wanting to hear about unity. \nThey are wanting to hear about what pulls our country together rather \nthan tear it down. The best way to show them is that we are serious \nabout solving this problem. I hope that is so.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, this past weekend I was with a group of \nheroes from the ``greatest generation.'' These men and women faced some \nof the biggest challenges our Nation has seen. They put aside their own \nneeds to make the country and the world a better place.\n  These World War II veterans from Arkansas were flown in on an Honor \nFlight to see their memorial. They didn't have much to say to me \npersonally about the shutdown. We talked about it, but talked more \nabout the branch of the service they were in, what they did during the \nwar, and the various things that happened to them during that period--\nand, of course, about Razorback football. We didn't have to spend and \ntake time to visit a great deal about the shutdown for me to know their \nthoughts. Their presence alone was enough of a reminder that we need to \nsolve this issue.\n  As the shutdown drags on, it spills into the debt ceiling discussion. \nThese are two major issues with very serious impacts if left \nunresolved.\n  To everyone outside of the Beltway, it seems both sides are digging \ntheir heels in deeper, both sides are ratcheting up the rhetoric, and \nnothing is getting done. The American people are tired of this. \nDismissing the other side's offers without consideration and trading \nbarbs do not help out one bit. No one is being asked to abandon their \nprinciples. What needs to happen, however, is both sides must respect \nthe will of the American people.\n  We must find a way to do what the public demands--reopen the \ngovernment and get our spending under control. The President and the \nSenate majority want to say that their health care law is an entirely \nseparate issue from this debate. That is simply untrue. It is not the \nway Americans see it. One major reason the American people are \nrejecting it is because of its budget-busting pricetag. We have a \nbudget that can't be strained any further. Our debt stands at almost \n$17 trillion, and $6 trillion of that has been added on President \nObama's watch. You can't take on that much debt and pretend it is not a \nproblem. Americans do not have the luxury of telling their credit card \ncompany to stop calling because they do not want to pay the debt that \nthey racked up.\n  This mess could be avoided if we simply followed regular order here \nin Washington, but we have not done that in 10 years. What I mean by \nthat is during my time in the Senate we have passed one individual \nappropriations bill prior to the end of the previous fiscal year. We \ndidn't consider a single appropriations bill on the Senate floor last \nyear. Let's return to regular order by passing an annual budget and the \naccompanying spending bills, not one large bill.\n  The good news is that many Members on both sides believe we simply \nneed to get that done. But that doesn't get us out of our current mess. \nWe have to get the government operating again, and we have to avoid a \ndefault.\n  Impassioned debates on major decisions like raising the debt ceiling \nin the past have resulted in positive policy changes. In fact, half of \nthe 53 times Congress has agreed to raise the debt ceiling since 1978, \nthey have attached conditions to it. The Gramm-Rudman act is a perfect \nexample. We talked a lot about the need to cap spending in Washington. \nGramm-Rudman actually did that, and it lead to a balanced budget. Even \nthe situation we are currently in with the Budget Control Act was born \nout of this type of constraint. Some in the Chamber still are not happy \nwith that, but the Budget Control Act is the first time in a long time \nthat we have managed to curb the growth in Washington spending.\n  Anyone who has ever bought a house or a car can tell you that it \ntakes some time to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. There is lots \nof haggling involved. The owner says here is what it costs. The \nconsumer makes an offer in return. This brings a counteroffer and so \non. This continues until both parties reach an agreement where everyone \nis satisfied.\n  But the key to this process is that both parties have to engage in \nthe discussion. Everybody needs to come to the table. It is simply not \nenough to say this is where I stand and I will not take any other \noptions into consideration. I am fairly certain you will never buy a \nhouse with that approach.\n  The good news is it seems we are heading in a positive direction. I \nbelieve there is movement toward a consensus. At the very least, both \nsides seem to be coming out of their respective corners and discussing \ntheir options. We need everyone to come to the table, to develop a way \nforward that puts us on the path to fiscal responsibility. These \ndiscussions serve as a starting point for how to rein in reckless \nspending so we can eliminate the blank check, the philosophy that has \nbecome so pervasive in this town.\n  If we need inspiration to solve this problem, the men and the women I \nvisited with at the World War II Memorial this past weekend are a \nperfect place to look. They have accurately been named the ``greatest \ngeneration'' in part for their willingness to take on enormous \nchallenges because it was the right thing to do.\n  We have an enormous challenge in front of us now. Let's follow the \ninspiration of the ``greatest generation.'' Let's put our country \nbefore ourselves and solve this problem.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on October 13, 1775, Congress enacted \nlegislation providing for the outfitting of America's first two \nwarships, manned by crews of 80, to be sent out on a 3-month cruise. \nTheir mission was to intercept transports carrying munitions and \nsupplies to the British army in America. Navy missions have evolved \nsignificantly over the last 238 years; however, the essential role \nAmerica's maritime forces play in defending our Nation and allowing \nprosperity to flourish is unchanged. The United States Navy has the \nfinest men and women in uniform on, above, and below the high seas \nsafeguarding America's interests at home and around the globe.\n  This Sunday we celebrate the U.S. Navy's 238th birthday. We remember \nthe great sacrifices made by sailors who came before, we mourn those we \nlost along the way, we celebrate their successes and we applaud the new \ngeneration of sailors serving our great Nation today. The United States \nNavy is comprised of over 323,000 active duty sailors, over 109,000 on \nready reserve, and a civilian force around 201,000. The United States \nNavy cannot exist without the commitment of its active duty, reserve \nand civilian forces, in addition to the support of Navy families. The \nsacrifices made by over 630,000 proud men and women serving the Navy \nprovide the freedoms all Americans enjoy daily; freedoms paid for by \nthose in uniform, many who are aboard the 102 ships deployed around the \nworld as I speak right now, serving on the front lines in defense of \nfreedom.\n  There are no finer men and women in uniform anywhere in the world \nthan those who serve the United States Navy. Today, the value of having \na strong naval power cannot be underestimated; 70 percent of the \nEarth's surface is covered by water and 90 percent of international \ntrade travels by the sea, which means our sailors need to be 100 \npercent on watch. No other branch of the military conducts missions on \nall fronts like the Navy does. The seas are America's lifeline; our \nNavy protects vital shipping lanes ensuring prosperity and free trade \nfor our Nation and our friends abroad. The Navy is essential in \nprotecting our Nation's cyber security at a time when, according to \nformer Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead, 95 percent of \ndigital information is traveling on cables at the bottom of the seas. \nOur national security is ever-dependent on our Nation's sea power. For \neach of these reasons and more, the United States Navy deserves our \nthanks and admiration.\n  I must also pay tribute as today marks the 168th anniversary of the \nUnited States Naval Academy. When Secretary of the Navy George Bancroft \nfounded the Academy in Annapolis, MD, I think he could only dream that \nit would continue to inspire and help create the high caliber graduates \nit does today. I truly must commend those graduates and their brothers \nand sisters serving in arms. The incredible flexibility and can-do \nattitude of the Navy were instrumental to the withdrawal of military \nforces in Iraq and the drawdown of military forces in Afghanistan. From \nthe Seabees to the Navy Seals, the entirety of the Department of the \nNavy is integral to securing our national defense around the world.\n  Artfully inscribed above the chapel doors at the Naval Academy are \nthe Latin words ``non sibi sed patriae.'' Though the Navy has no \nofficial motto, these words, translated as ``not for self but \ncountry,'' encapsulate the sacrifice and dedication of our amazing Navy \nMen and Women serving across the globe today so that our society may be \nfree. The real strength of our Navy is not the ships or weapons or \ntechnology at our disposal, but the highly trained, motivated, and \nprofessional sailors who make our Navy the envy of the world. For 238 \nyears, the U.S. Navy has witnessed many changes in missions, in \ngeopolitics, and in technology. But in all that time, the one thing \nthat has not changed is the importance of quality people, for it is the \nsailors who make it all happen, and who make the real difference in a \nNavy's effectiveness. To all who serve: thank you for your continued \nvigilance.

CANNON\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to my \nconstituent MAJ Charles H. Cannon for his exemplary dedication to duty \nand his service to the U.S. Army and to the United States of America. \nMajor Cannon will depart from Active military duty in 2013 but will \ncontinue to serve in the National Guard in our great State of Georgia. \nHe has served for the last 2 years as a congressional budget liaison \nfor the Secretary of the Army.\n  A native of Moultrie, GA, Major Cannon left his family's 2,000-acre \nfarm to become a cadet at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in \n1997. While there, Chas played for the Army football team and earned a \nbachelor's degree in systems engineering. He was commissioned as a \nfield artillery officer in June of 2001, just 3 months before the \nhorrific attacks on September 11 that would shape the rest of his \nactive duty career.\n  Major Cannon's assignments have been diverse. While a lieutenant, he \nserved in C Battery, 1-10 Field Artillery Battalion as a fire direction \nofficer, platoon leader, and executive officer. His first deployment \nwas with them during the ground invasion of Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nAfter promotion to captain, he served in 2-69 Armor Battalion as a \nstaff officer during his second deployment to Diyala, Iraq. Eleven \nmonths later, as part of the surge, Chas returned to East Baghdad, Iraq \nfor a 15-month deployment as the commander of A Battery, 1-10 Field \nArtillery Battalion.\n  After returning from his third deployment, Major Cannon earned a \nmaster of professional studies in legislative affairs from The George \nWashington University. He was then assigned as a congressional fellow \nin my office with a subsequent assignment as a legislative strategist \nin the office of the Chief of Legislative liaison and then as a budget \nliaison officer in the office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army \nfor Financial Management and Comptroller, where he was tasked with \nmanaging the Army's wheeled and tracked vehicle portfolio.\n  Major Cannon's leadership throughout his career has positively \nimpacted his soldiers, peers, and superiors. As a budget liaison \nofficer he worked directly with the Senate and House Appropriations \nCommittees to educate and inform Senators, Representatives, and staff \nabout many diverse and important procurement initiatives of the U.S. \nArmy.\n  On behalf of a grateful nation, I join my colleagues today in \nrecognizing and commending MAJ Chas Cannon for over a decade of active \nservice to his country. We wish Chas, his wife Beth, and their two \nlittle girls, Allie and Catherine, all the best as they continue their \njourney of service in the Georgia National Guard.\n\n[[Page S7386]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/10/senate-section/article/S7386-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 6:26 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nof the House of Representatives has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.J.
