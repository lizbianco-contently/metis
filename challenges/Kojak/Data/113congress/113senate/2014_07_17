Any remaining time until 12 noon will be for general \ndebate on this legislation.\n  At 12 noon the Senate will proceed to a series of up to five rollcall \nvotes.

Senators will be notified when an agreement is reached.\n  (Mr. WALSH assumed the Chair.)\n\n\n                             Border Crisis\n\n  Mr. President, the distinguished President pro tempore of the Senate, \nwho just opened the Senate, has been for many, many years the chair of \nthe foreign operations subcommittee on appropriations. He is the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee. I wanted to note that while he is \non the floor.\n  Over the past 2 weeks poker players have flocked to Las Vegas because \nthere is an annual World Series of Poker there. It is on ESPN. I do not \nknow how athletic it is, but it is on ESPN, and it draws a lot of \nattention. Poker is a very important and popular game now--a game of \nchance, and this tournament--the World Series of Poker--is the most \nprestigious high-stakes tournament in the world, and 2,400 or 2,500 \nmiles away from Las Vegas, here in Washington, DC, some Senate \nRepublicans are playing a high-stakes game of their own with a \nhumanitarian crisis. But instead of poker chips, they are using kids, \nchildren.\n  Last night the junior Senator from Texas upped the ante and announced \nthat any legislation to address the humanitarian crisis in the Rio \nGrande Valley must also include a termination of President Obama's 2012 \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. In other words, before \nRepublicans help our Border Patrol agents and all the other personnel \nwho are trying to do something to handle this humanitarian crisis, they \nwant President Obama to deport the DREAMers who are already here. They \nare legitimately here. These are children. But instead of considering a \nthoughtful, compassionate solution to a real-life crisis on our border, \nradical Republicans are trying to hold these kids ransom.\n  I have heard Senator Durbin speak here on the floor. He visited one \nof these centers in Chicago on Monday. There are mothers with little \nbabies there who have been brought, as the law requires, to Chicago to \ntry to unite them with their families.\n  We have, as we learned last night in a Senators briefing, more than \n50,000 of these children who have arrived at the border, and we have to \ndo something to address that. The people who are required by law to \ntake care of these children--some of whom are babies--do not have the \nresources to do it.\n  These are not children sneaking over the border. They come to the \npeople in uniform and say: Here we are. We have an obligation by law to \ndo something about it. But it takes a lot of money to take care of \nthis. We cannot do it unless we get added resources, and what the \njunior Senator from Texas said is that we are not going to do this \nunless we deport all these children who came here before--the so-called \nDREAMers.\n\n  Once again, we see there are no substantive solutions being offered \nby today's Republican Party. Instead of\n\n[[Page S4572]]\n\ndoing something about these children who are at the border, they want \nto deport hundreds of thousands of these people who are already here.\n  President Obama's deferred action plan, which is widely popular in \nthe country because it is the right thing to do--and, obviously, \nRepublicans want to get rid of it--what this is all about, his deferred \naction plan, is about keeping families together in America. It grants \nimmigration officials discretion in considering the cases of children \nwho have lived most of their lives as Americans, even though they were \nbrought here illegally.\n  Let me give you an example of a young woman from Las Vegas. Her name \nis Astrid Silva. Astrid came to the United States as a little, tiny \ngirl in a boat across the Rio Grande. Her mother was with her. She was \nin her--I want to get this right--she was in her dress, confirmation \ndress or whatever it was. She was just a tiny, little girl. She had her \nrosary beads and a little doll, and she floated across the river.\n  She knows no other country than the United States of America. Now, \nbecause of what happened, because of the President's action, she can \nnow fly in an airplane. She has done that. She is working on getting \nher education completed--a wonderful, wonderful, involved woman in what \nis going on in Nevada. And the junior Senator from Texas wants to send \nher back to a place she does not know--Mexico? Mr. President, Astrid \nSilva is an American. It is the only country she knows. It would be \ncruel and unusual to do what the junior Senator from Texas wants done.\n  The deferred action plan is a positive step forward, and we should \nnot go back, especially not as a ransom for helping our border \npersonnel to care for desperate children.\n  I would hope my friend, the Republican leader, can rein in these \nextreme elements of his caucus so we can achieve a real solution, one \nworthy of the ideals upon which this Nation was founded.\n  These children are real--they are little kids--real human beings. \nThey should not be used as pawns in the Republicans' high-stakes game \nof chicken with President Obama.\n\n\n                       Ambassadorial Nominations\n\n  Mr. President, when I first came to the House of Representatives, I \nhad the good fortune of serving on the Foreign Affairs Committee. It \nwas wonderful. I served under Chairman Zablocki from Wisconsin, \nChairman Fascell from Florida. It was a wonderful experience to get a \nview of what was going on in the world, and I enjoyed it very, very \nmuch.\n  But I learned there--and I think we all know; maybe I should have \nlearned it sooner--our national security depends on the qualified men \nand women who serve as our ambassadors throughout the world.\n  When I travel overseas, I always make sure I get the staff at these \nembassies together and tell them how much I appreciate what they do for \nour country. They are not all ambassadors, of course. There is one per \ncountry--we hope.\n  To apply to be a Foreign Service officer is hard. You have to have \nreally, really good grades. You have to pass a written examination \nafter having graduated from college and maybe with graduate work. Some \nof them are Ph.D.s. And then, after you pass a written test, you have \nto pass an oral test. It is very, very difficult.\n  These are some of the best and brightest in the world, and their \nultimate goal--as we had the All-Star Game on Tuesday--is to be an all-\nstar, to be able to play--as they did on Tuesday in Major League \nBaseball--in the ``all-star game.'' Well, that is what ambassadors are; \nthey are the all stars of the diplomatic corps of this country. Right \nnow, these ambassadors are on the front lines. They are fighting to \ndefend our interests abroad--our security interests, our national \ninterests, and our economic interests. Right now there are gaping holes \nin our Nation's front lines.\n  Let's look at who ambassadors really are. Here in the Senate, I had \nthe good fortune to serve with one of the really distinguished \nambassadors, Daniel Patrick Moynihan from New York. Prior to coming to \nthe Senate, he was our Ambassador to India. He left his mark on that \ncountry. He did a remarkably good job as Ambassador from the United \nStates to India.\n  The Republican leader and I attended a funeral a week or so ago in \nTennessee. The funeral was for Howard Baker, who had been the majority \nleader in the Senate--a fine man. He married another Senator from \nKansas, Nancy Kassebaum. He became, after retiring from the Senate, our \nAmbassador to Japan. He distinguished himself there again with the \nremarkably good job he did.\n\n  We can go back and look at the beginning of the history of this \ncountry. What do we always learn about Thomas Jefferson? We know how \nsmart he was, how he wrote brilliantly. But we also learned in every \nhistory lesson about Thomas Jefferson, that he was our Ambassador to \nFrance. John Adams was our Ambassador to England. They have set the \nstandard for how important ambassadors are.\n  Here in the Senate Republicans are stalling ambassadors. Twenty-five \npercent of all the ambassadorships to the continent of Africa--\nunfilled. There are gaping holes in our Nation's front lines. \nApproximately 30 ambassadors are waiting to be confirmed--and waiting \nand waiting and waiting.\n  Senate Republicans, who have been so quick to accuse this \nadministration of poor leadership on world issues, are obstructing the \nconfirmation of ambassadors who are desperately needed at embassies all \naround the world. Republicans are abdicating the Senate's \nconstitutional role to confirm ambassadors.\n  In previous years ambassadors were just approved so quickly. Once in \na while something controversial would come up, but it was once in a \ngreat while. As I said, a quarter of U.S. Embassies in Africa do not \nhave an ambassador. We do not have an ambassador in Bosnia. We do not \nhave an ambassador in Vietnam--on and on. Can't we all agree that it is \nimportant that American interests be represented in these places? The \nanswer: We cannot agree. The Republicans do not want these \nambassadorships filled.\n  When can these people who want to play in the ``all-star game'' be \nable to play in the ``all-star game'' and represent the interests of \nthis country? They work in careers that are very difficult. They do not \nstart out as ambassadors. Rarely does that happen.\n  Each day that goes by more ambassadorships are unfilled. All the \nambassador nominees were passed out of committee unanimously. With rare \nexception they are noncontroversial. I am talking about career \nambassadors. These are not political appointees. I am talking about \ncareer ambassadors.\n  What does that mean when I say career ambassadors, career diplomats? \nThese are good men and women who have worked for decades for the U.S. \nState Department. In most cases these diplomats started working at the \nlowest levels, processing visa applications, asylum requests, and then \nbecame an economic officer, a political officer. By working hard and \nrequiring the necessary expertise, these career diplomats have readied \nthemselves to be ambassadors. It is hard.\n  Career diplomats do not represent political parties, they represent \nour country. These long-time professionals have worked for both \nDemocrats and Republicans. They worked for several different \nadministrations. It does not matter, if someone is a Foreign Service \nofficer, whether the President is a Democrat or Republican, they do \ntheir job for the country.\n  Now these professionals are needed to fill vital ambassadorial posts \nin some of the most volatile regions in the world. Republicans have \nslammed the brakes on these nominations. At the very least the Senate \nshould confirm these noncontroversial career diplomats. If they want to \nplay games with the political appointees, they can do that, but these \ncareer diplomats are not political appointees. They are qualified \ndiplomats who have performed admirably for the State Department for a \nlong time. We need their experience, we need their expertise at \nembassies all over the world.\n  Some Senate observers say Republicans are stalling these nominations \nas a payback for rules changes instituted by the Senate. Let's see if I \ncan try to figure this one out. Republicans are stalling Executive \nnominees vital to our national interests to get back at Democrats, to \nget back at me. How is\n\n[[Page S4573]]\n\nthat? Stalling these nominees is jeopardizing America's interests \nabroad. It is damaging our Nation's role in global affairs. It is \ndamaging our national security. Is this conjured-up political \nretribution worth harming the United States? Of course not.\n  There was a New York Times article within the last 48 hours where \nSecretary of State John Kerry said: I have 52 important State \nDepartment officials who are waiting to be confirmed in the Senate--52. \nI was stunned to read in that same article a quote from the ranking \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee over here, the junior Senator \nfrom Tennessee.\n  Here is what he said: ``Rather than filling vacant embassies to \nalleviate the national security concerns raised by Secretary Kerry and \nothers, the majority leader-- Listen to this one.\n\n       --who controls the Senate floor--has chosen to spend this \n     week on a sportsman's bill and previous weeks confirming \n     judges.\n\n  Why criticize me for bringing up the sportsmen's bill? This bill was \nsponsored by a majority of the Republicans. Twenty-six Republicans \ncosponsored that legislation. The junior Senator from Tennessee is \ncomplaining that I brought that up. I guess he is also complaining that \nI brought up raising the minimum wage, which the Republicans \nfilibustered. Maybe he is also complaining that we have student debt in \nthis country--about $1.3 trillion--and we brought that up to alleviate \nthe pain to families in America with student debt.\n  Maybe he is complaining because we brought up on the Senate floor \nsomething extremely important; that is, that if a woman does the same \nwork as a man, she should get paid the same amount of money--not \ndifferent work, the same work. She should get the same money. I guess \nhe is complaining because we brought up something that addresses the \nneeds that Americans have; that is, the Hobby Lobby decision from the \nSupreme Court. We think that is wrong. Women in America, families in \nAmerica, with some exception, believe that is wrong.\n  So I agree with the junior Senator from Tennessee. There is an urgent \nneed to fill these diplomatic posts as soon as possible, but for \nheaven's sake, how could he complain about the substantive legislation \nwhich is so important to America that I have just run through?\n  Then he complains about judges, we are confirming judges. I have been \nhere a while in the Senate. Until Obama became President, with some \nexception, these nominations went through on unanimous consent. We were \nnot holding up ambassadors. There would be a spat on a judge here and \nthere but not holding up all of the judges. The reason it is taking so \nlong is we have, under the rules of the Senate, what we call \npostcloture time. That time was originally set up so after we got on a \npiece of legislation or on a nomination, we could think about it for a \nlittle bit. They think about it a lot and do nothing.\n\n  Thirty hours on a lot of nominations postcloture, 8 hours on others, \njudges only 2 hours. We have been able to go through a lot of judges \nbecause of that rule change that we made. I thought it was an urgent \nneed 4 months ago when I came to the Senate floor to talk about the \ngrowing logjam of our ambassadorial corps around the country. But \nSenator Corker's reasoning that these ambassadorial confirmations were \ndelayed unnecessarily by legislation and judicial confirmations is a \nlittle weird, a little strange. It is strange and weird for a number of \nreasons.\n  I take issue with the notion that the Senate somehow wasted time by \nlegislating and confirming judicial nominees. These are our \nconstitutional duties. We are going to confirm, in the next few days, a \npost in Georgia. We have two to be filled there. One of them has been \nwaiting for more than 1,000 days. So I think it is important we do \nthis. Why? Because it is our constitutional duty.\n  We only have so much time to confirm judges, because as I indicated, \nfilibustering nominees, they do it to everybody. We are working through \nthe judges quickly because we changed the rules. Thank goodness we did. \nThe Senate did consider Senator Hagan's sportsmen's legislation last \nweek. I repeat. That important bill affects--the one that the junior \nSenator from Tennessee said we should not have brought up--affects 40 \nmillion Americans who hunt and fish.\n  Somebody I used to practice law with has a place in Montana. He took \nhis grandson there and had a wonderful time fishing--no hunting but \nfishing. This place he has, a little stream goes by there. He said it \nwas the best time he ever had with his grandchild. That is what 40 \nmillion people do. That is what we brought up. That is what the junior \nSenator from Tennessee said was such a bad idea. Twenty-six Republicans \ncosponsored that legislation. It contributes $200 billion annually to \nour Nation's economy.\n  My friend from Tennessee thinks it is a waste of time; we should not \nhave done that. The junior Senator from Tennessee was a cosponsor of \nthe legislation. He is going to go back and tell the people in \nTennessee that he made a mistake, he should not have been a cosponsor.\n  Earlier, he voted to proceed so we could work on the legislation. \nThen he voted to filibuster it. This is the same tactic we have seen so \nmuch over the past 6 years. Republicans obstruct. When asked why they \nare not accomplishing anything, they blame Democrats. They blame me. \nThe truth is Senate Democrats have continued to press for more and more \nambassadorial confirmations while also introducing legislation that \nhelps working families.\n  As I came to the floor in March to highlight the backlog of \nambassadorial confirmations, the Senate has considered an increase in \nthe minimum wage, equal pay for women, student loan refinancing, \nextension of tax cuts, cost-cutting energy legislation, and a number of \nother items. These are all important bills to give working Americans a \nfair shot at a measure of prosperity. Republican filibusters blocked \nevery one of them.\n  Another issue I have with the Senator from Tennessee is that \nundoubtedly he knows the Senate traditionally does much of its business \nthrough unanimous consent--in fact most of our business. If Republicans \nagree there is an urgent need to get these nominations done and give \ntheir consent, we could confirm all of these ambassadors in a single \nafternoon. It would only take a few hours in the afternoon. We could do \nit today.\n  But it is clearly not a priority for Republicans; otherwise, they \nwould expedite these confirmations. Their behavior on these \nambassadorial nominations reminds me of a quote by Gandhi: ``Action \nexpresses priorities.'' Republicans' lack of action on this matter \nillustrates that they have no priorities in this regard.\n  So enough with the stalling and enough with retribution. The Senate \nstandoff is not good for this body, and it is hurting American \ninterests abroad. Let's get these ambassador posts filled. Our national \nsecurity depends on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/17/senate-section/article/S4573-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4573-S4574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n[[Page S4574]]\n\n                           Citizen Victories\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday the American people actually \nscored a victory in the ongoing battle against government overreach. \nThey literally rose, spoke out, and they forced the Obama \nadministration to withdraw the latest gem from the ``department of \nterrible ideas'' over at the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  They showed two things in the process; first, the need for constant \nvigilance when it comes to protecting our liberties, especially with \nthe current crowd down at the White House; and, second, the impact \nordinary citizens can actually have.\n  The proposal in question was a uniquely awful idea. The goal was for \nthe EPA to grant itself the authority to garnish the wages of private \ncitizens without even giving them a day in court. Imagine. You received \na letter from the government accusing you of violating some obscure \nregulation, a regulation most likely you never heard of and did not \neven know you were violating. The government then hits you with massive \nfines, sometimes on the order of tens of thousands of dollars a day, as \nyou weigh your legal options and whether to fight it in court.\n  If you cannot or will not pay these fines in the meantime, too bad. \nBureaucrats in Washington will take them out of your paycheck anyway--\nout of our paycheck anyway--without even the option of contesting the \ngovernment's actions in court for it. This is certainly government \noverreach at its very worst. That is why I joined Senators Thune, \nVitter, and Barrasso in speaking out against it. That is why we \ndeveloped a resolution of disapproval to block it.\n  But the real key to our success was the action of the American people \nthemselves. They got our help, but they did not sit back and wait. They \nlet their outrage be known. They fought back against this brazen power \ngrab. Thanks to all of those efforts, the administration finally \nliterally threw in the towel yesterday. Certainly we were glad to see \nit.\n  But look, the fact that the Obama administration's EPA even \nintroduced this rule in the first place should concern all of us. It \nwas truly outrageous, but it is also not surprising because this is the \nsame administration that just proposed a so-called waters of the U.S. \nregulation that would expand the government's authority so broadly that \nthe Agency could regulate and fine almost every pothole and ditch in \nour backyards.\n  This is the same administration that has been waging a costly war on \ncoal jobs in my State through similarly onerous and arbitrary \nregulations aimed at pleasing hard-core activists in Washington without \nany regard for real-world consequences.\n  It is as though these distant elites in Washington view their mission \nas ideological warfare. They do not seem the least bit concerned about \nthe casualties they leave behind in the process. I have tried to get \nsome of these bureaucratic foot soldiers down to Kentucky to see the \nimpact of their efforts firsthand, but of course they are not \ninterested. They are not interested in people such as the 32-year-old \nunemployed miner who walked into a Pikeville pregnancy center to ask \nfor baby clothes. An employee at the center wrote to tell me what this \nminer had to say.\n  Here is what he said:\n\n       I don't come from a family that has ever had to ask for \n     help. I feel humiliated, but my baby is suffering.\n\n  That pregnancy center employee wrote that the look on his face broke \nher heart. She wrote: ``[But] this is the plight of many of our \nfamilies in Eastern Kentucky, their livelihood is being taken away by \nthe War on Coal.''\n  These are the people whom distant bureaucrats in Washington should be \nforced to meet before they draft their rules. This guy just wants to \nput food on the table, to keep the lights on, and to give his kids a \nbetter life. But the war on coal jobs is taking away more than just his \nlivelihood and that of so many others. It is taking away his dignity as \nwell. Maybe that is why the administration doesn't want to meet \nKentuckians like him. Maybe that is why they don't want to look my \nconstituents in the eye. It is a big problem, and that is why I am so \nproud of the people who stood up to this latest ominous regulation.\n  Yesterday the EPA confirmed that it won't hold a single hearing \nwithin hours of my State as it works to finalize national energy tax \nregulations that could devastate the lives of tens of thousands of \nKentuckians. They don't care, and they are not listening.\n  Well, I care. I see these folks when I go home. I hear their stories. \nMy heart breaks for them. I am going to keep fighting. I am going to \nkeep fighting against the Obama administration's various power grabs \nand its regulatory overreach. I am going to keep fighting against the \nnational energy tax. I am going to keep fighting for practical ideas \nthat aim to help struggling families for once--a marked departure from \nthe administration's constant attacks against them--ideas such as the \nCoal Country Protection Act and the Saving Coal Jobs Act.\n  These proposals are common sense.

I call up amendment No. .  .  ..\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Tester] for himself, Ms. \n     Klobuchar and Mr. Pryor, proposes an amendment numbered 3552.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. TESTER. I thank Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo and \nSenators Schumer and Heller for their hard work on helping me on the \nTRIA bill and for helping me on this amendment, as well as Senator \nSchumer and Senator Heller for their hard work not only on the TRIA \nlegislation but also on the NARAB amendment, which I am going to talk \nabout in a moment. I also wish to give a special thank-you to Senator \nJohanns, who is a cosponsor on this amendment and somebody with whom I \nhave worked very closely to get this amendment to the point it is \ntoday.\n  The Tester-Johanns amendment is the National Association of \nRegistered Agents and Brokers Act, otherwise known as NARAB. NARAB is a \nbill Senator Johanns and I introduced last year. It was reported out of \nthe Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee on a voice vote.\n  Our amendment creates a nonprofit association to provide one-stop \nlicensing for insurance agents and brokers operating outside of their \nhome State. This arrangement would fully preserve the authority of \nState insurance regulators to supervise these markets.\n  Currently, an insurance agent or broker seeking to operate in \nmultiple States must meet different State-specific licensing \nrequirements and seek approval from each State's insurance \ncommissioner. This process is time consuming, it is costly, it is \nredundant, and it is sometimes contradictory--without providing any \ngreater consumer protection. That is a big disincentive for smaller \nagents and brokers to grow their businesses.\n  This is not a new issue for the insurance industry. Congress \nrecognized the need for a forum to reform the insurance licensing \nsystem in 1999 when it incorporated the National Association of \nRegistered Agents and Brokers Act subtitle into the Gramm-Leach-Bliley \nAct. Unfortunately, at that time Congress did not immediately establish \nNARAB. As a result, Gramm-Leach-Bliley did not achieve the level of \nreciprocity and uniformity Congress expected and these efforts to \nstreamline cross-state insurance licensing never took hold. That is why \nthis important amendment is before the Senate today.\n  Senator Johanns' and my amendment would provide insurance agents and \nbrokers with the option of becoming a member of NARAB provided that \nthey meet the professional standards set by the association and undergo \na criminal background check.\n  NARAB will streamline the licensing process for agents and brokers, \nenabling them to be licensed under one single, strong national \nlicensing standard rather than following different State standards, \nthereby saving time and money.\n  In addition to setting rigorous professional standards, the \nassociation will let agents and brokers renew their licenses all at \nonce and fully preserve the abilities of regulators to protect \nconsumers and supervise and discipline agents and brokers.\n  Currently, on average, insurance agents sell their products in eight \nStates, with many serving even more. A one-stop licensing compliance \nmechanism will benefit all agents and brokers but particularly the \nsmaller folks who must spend time and money dealing with different \nstandards in different States.\n  A one-stop shop for insurance licensing will help smaller players \ncompete against the bigger competitors. That is good for business, and \nit is good for consumers.\n  NARAB represents a decade of effort, and I am pleased we will finally \nachieve the goals laid out in Gramm-Leach-Bliley. Some feared NARAB \nwould diminish States rights. As a former State legislator, when folks \nstart talking about States rights issues, I pay attention, but in this \ncase I believe they are wrong.\n  I wish to take a minute and talk about how this amendment protects \nStates rights. Under this amendment, States would retain all authority \nto license their own resident agents and brokers. The association would \nbe required to notify States when agents and brokers apply for \nmembership, letting the States notify NARAB of any reason membership \nshould not be granted to the producer.\n\n  States will also have significant control over NARAB. The nonprofit \nassociation would be governed by a board of directors dominated by \nState insurance regulators and chaired by a State insurance regulator. \nMost importantly, NARAB deals only with marketplace entry and would not \nimpact the day-to-day regulation of insurance. States will maintain \nexclusive control of the regulation of marketplace activities, consumer \nprotection requirements, unfair trade practices, and other important \nareas.\n  Under this bill, under this amendment, we will preserve the authority \nof States to supervise insurance producers. Any agent or broker who \nobtains the authority to operate in a jurisdiction through NARAB is \nstill subject to the full regulatory authority of that State and must \ncomply with all marketplace requirements. Under our amendment, States \nwill continue to receive insurance licensing fees, which will be \ncollected by NARAB and remitted to the States.\n  This legislation is supported by the National Association of \nInsurance and Financial Advisers, the Council of Insurance Agents and \nBrokers, and the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America. \nIt is also supported by the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners, which has expressed its full support for this bill and \nthe final TRIA bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Tester-Johanns amendment. It is \ntruly a commonsense amendment that helps not only the industry but also \nthe consumers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I will begin today by acknowledging the \ngood work of the good Senator from Montana. This bill has been around \nfor a long time, and it is our hope that we will get to a point today \nwhere we can say that finally we have solved the problems.\n  The Senator from Montana has done an excellent job of laying out what \nthis bill is all about and what it is not about, and I don't feel a \nneed today to repeat what he has said, but let me just make a couple of \npoints.\n  First, the partnership we had in working on this bill was excellent, \nand that is why it is this far along. It was a bipartisan effort.\n  This legislation is long overdue, and it does benefit consumers and \nbusinesses all across this great country. It is exactly what we look \nfor. It reduces redtape, it encourages competition and protects State \nlaw, and it promotes consumer choice. For these reasons, it is my hope \nthe entire Senate unanimously supports the amendment.\n\n  I might mention that we passed this legislation out of the banking \ncommittee about a year ago. That was after working on this for about 10\n\n[[Page S4577]]\n\nyears. The House passed this bill last year by an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote, 397 to 6. So I am pleased we can advance this \nlegislation today as part of the terrorism risk insurance bill, which I \nalso support and will vote yes on.\n  Frankly, it is refreshing to finally be allowed to vote on amendments \non the Senate floor. I hope this is a sign of things to come. I thank \nSenator Schumer and Senator Crapo for their work in bringing us to this \npoint. Without their work, TRIA would not be where it is today.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment. I hope we can move the \nlegislation to the President's desk as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Montana and \nNebraska for their hard work on not only this legislation but their \nvery important amendment--long overdue. I certainly thank Senators \nJohnson and Crapo, without whose leadership we couldn't be here to pass \nthis bill. I thank my original cosponsors, Senator Kirk from Illinois \nwho is here, Senator Jack Reed, Senator Heller, Senator Murphy, Senator \nJohanns, Senator Warner, Senator Blunt, and Senator Menendez, all of \nwhom recognized the importance of having this incredibly important \nprogram reauthorized.\n  As author of the original TRIA legislation, I have watched this \nevolution closely. I could not be more convinced of the necessity to \nreauthorize the program for the long haul.\n  I remember the dark days right after 9/11. I was there. The worst \nthing was the loss of life--people we had all known. I know people who \nwere lost--a guy I played basketball with in high school, a businessman \nwho helped me on the way up, a firefighter with whom I did blood \ndrives. But there was also the economic worry. People thought southern \nManhattan would not come back. People thought businesses would flee New \nYork--that New York's greatest days were behind us. And of course the \npeople of New York, with their resiliency, backed up by everyone in \nthis country--including President Bush, very strongly--did come back. \nBut the uncertainty we faced in the immediate aftermath was that there \nwould be no building in southern Manhattan or Manhattan at all. And we \nhave some history.\n  One of the things that greatly stood in the way was the private \nsector did not offer any sufficient coverage to protect against the \nthreat of terrorism. No one knew when there might be another terrorist \nincident. Insurance companies, knowing how large the losses were, \nfigured it was better not to underwrite insurance than write it for \nsuch an astronomical sum that the building would not be even \neconomically feasible.\n  We have some colleagues who said this should be a private sector \nendeavor. Well, we have history. The private sector was unable, because \nof the potential economic losses if, God forbid, there was another \nterrorist attack, whether it be conventional, nuclear, or chemical, to \nprovide terrorism insurance. When that occurs, banks would not finance \nbuildings, knowing there was no insurance backup, and we would have \nbeen in huge trouble. That is why we devised the terrorism insurance \nbill.\n  For those who say let the private sector do it, we have an \nexperiment. We have what the scientists would call a controlled \nexperiment. When there was no terrorism insurance after 9/11, the \nprivate sector would not offer insurance. We even find to this day, as \nthe existing bill expires, fewer people underwrite terrorism insurance \nand fewer buildings are financed.\n  So we can do one of two things: We can sit back and let the market \nhandle this on its own and lose millions--literally millions--of jobs, \nlose economic stability, safety, prosperity, and growth or we can renew \nthis legislation. We can come up with a smart, responsible, risk-\nsharing system where the private sector is paying upfront. But if, God \nforbid, there is another serious incident beyond the capability of the \nprivate sector to shoulder, the Federal Government can step in and \nprovide a backstop. That is what we have done.\n  The TRIA Program is a shining example of the government partnering \nwith the private sector to solve problems that neither can solve on its \nown.\n  Let me underline, first, the importance to my city of New York. The \nredevelopment of downtown Manhattan is booming there. People are \nflocking to live there and work there. It is the hot area of New York \nagain--not just with financial services but with law and advertising \nand high-tech. It serves as a reminder of the role the Federal \nGovernment can and should play in helping facilitate the stability and \ngrowth of cities across the country.\n  This bill will not lessen the impact of a terrorist attack but will \nhelp ensure that our cities throughout the country are less vulnerable \nto the economic devastation that would follow such a horrific event.\n  But this bill is hardly just focused on New York City. It not only \naffects every large city--my good friend from Nebraska spoke--it \naffects the football stadium and any renovations that might occur there \nin Lincoln. I have been there for a Nebraska-Oklahoma game. It was an \namazing experience. It affects any city that has large gatherings of \npeople and buildings--shopping centers, athletic facilities, colleges. \nSo it affects almost every State. That is one of the reasons we have \ncome together and gotten such broad bipartisan support.\n  We must make sure that every reauthorization of the program provides \nthe certainty lenders and developers need to make the kind of long-term \ninvestment our country and large projects need to stimulate job growth \nand economic growth, and this bill does just that. That is why it was \npassed out of the banking committee unanimously.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues, particularly on the other side of the \naisle. As Senator Johanns said--and we say it on each bill where there \nis some bipartisan support--this one has overwhelming support. Maybe \nthis bill can be a model that at least on many issues we can work \ntogether.\n  Time is of the essence. Insurance policies for 2015 are already being \nwritten. Each day that goes by without a TRIA Program causes great \nuncertainty in the market and holds back the potential for more \ndevelopment, more construction, more jobs, and more economic growth.\n  I will talk about the amendments later, but I urge my colleagues, \nboth here in the Senate and in the House, to move as quickly as \npossible because our economy is greatly affected by it. It is one of \nthose that ``runs quiet, runs deep.'' It is a quiet policy but a policy \nthat greatly affects lots of things that go on.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues, Senator Crapo for his good and hard \nwork, as well as Senator Johnson and my cosponsors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am appreciative of Senator Schumer and \nthe work we have been able to do together to move this legislation \nforward.\n  I rise today to speak in favor of S. 2244, the Terrorism Risk \nInsurance Act, or TRIA, program. As a cosponsor of this bill, I \nrecognize Senator Schumer, Senator Kirk, Senator Heller, Senator Reed, \nand others for helping to put this bipartisan piece of legislation \ntogether.\n  Chairman Johnson and his staff also deserve a great amount of thanks \nfor their strong efforts in moving this bill forward.\n  Working together, we developed a balanced bipartisan product that was \nliterally unanimously supported in the banking committee 22 to 0. This \nbill we have put together allows the private insurance industry to \nabsorb and cover the losses of all but the largest acts of terror--ones \nin which the Federal Government would likely be forced to step in, in \nany event, if the program were not there. Taxpayer protections have \nbeen increased in this reauthorization by moving more of the \nresponsibility for losses on to private insurers.\n  For those who are not familiar with the program, TRIA was initially \npassed as a response to the unavailability of terrorism insurance in \nthe wake of 9/11. The private market had already retreated in response \nto those terrorist attacks. It was then thought that a temporary \nprogram would allow the market time to develop products that would \nallow policyholders to protect themselves from terrorism losses.\n  More than a decade after the tragic events of 9/11, the temporary \ninability\n\n[[Page S4578]]\n\nto insure against terrorism has abated, and private capital is better \npositioned to take on more exposure to terrorism.\n  When the banking committee held its first hearing on TRIA's \nreauthorization last year, we discussed the ability of the private \ninsurance market to step in to provide terrorism insurance if the TRIA \nProgram expired. In that hearing, and in subsequent meetings with \nproviders, policyholders, and stakeholders, we recognized on a \nbipartisan basis the continued difficulties associated with providing \nterrorism insurance required that we look again at extending the act.\n  Terrorism is difficult to predict. Therefore, the ability to develop \nproducts to insure against terrorism is very difficult to do. The size, \nseverity, and frequency of attacks are hard to model. Also, attacks may \nbe highly correlated, making it difficult for private insurers to \ndiversify their risks.\n  Having TRIA in place was determined to be important. But if the \nmarket is too heavily reliant on Federal support, we may deter private \ncompanies from coming up with cost-effective solutions. That is why, \ninstead of a straight reauthorization, I and others pushed for reforms \nto maintain the program and increase protections for taxpayers.\n  In order to do that, we examined each of the policy levers in the \nprogram. The bill marked up by the banking committee would increase the \ninsurance industry's aggregate retention level and the company \ncoinsurance levels. As the program stands today, the Federal Government \nwould recoup any TRIA payments it makes up to $27.5 billion through \npost-event payments. This industry retention level allows the taxpayer \nto recover TRIA payments through an industrywide assessment on \nproperty-casualty policies. This aspect of the bill was last changed in \nthe 2005 reauthorization. The bill before us today increases that \nrecoupment level by $2 billion a year, to an overall level of $37.5 \nbillion--an additional $10 billion. This is a significant reduction in \nthe potential exposure and cost to taxpayers.\n  In addition, the bill increases the company coinsurance level from 15 \npercent to 20 percent over 5 years. This means that before the backstop \nis reached, each company will take on a greater portion of the losses \nabove their deductible.\n  In order to get more private capital in the marketplace, Senator \nFlake has an amendment to create an advisory committee to promote the \ncreation and development of private sector risk-sharing mechanisms. I \nsupport the addition of the Flake amendment and believe the advisory \ncommittee will find private sector solutions that will allow us to \nfurther decrease the program in future reauthorizations.\n  Before I conclude, I have a handful of letters in my possession here \nfrom groups across the country strongly supporting and encouraging that \nwe adopt this legislation.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has listed this as a key vote. The \nCoalition to Insure Against Terrorism, which represents dozens and \ndozens of the financial sector interests across this country, \nrecommends and encourages that we support this legislation, and the \nMortgage Bankers Association, the National Association of Insurance \nCompanies, the Property Casualty Insurers, the National Apartment \nAssociation, the National Multifamily Housing Council, and the American \nBuilders Conference.\n  These are just a sampling of letters we have received from interests \nacross the Nation that support this legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Associated Builders\n\n\n                                        and Contractors, Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 17, 2014.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: on behalf of Associated Builders and \n     Contractors (ABC), a national construction industry \n     association with 70 chapters representing nearly 21,000 \n     members, I am writing to express our support for S. 2244, the \n     Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2014. \n     The bill, introduced by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), would \n     extend the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) for seven \n     years beyond the current expiration date of December 14, \n     2014, ensuring the construction industry will be able to \n     secure sufficient terrorism insurance.\n       Following the tragic attacks on our country on September \n     11, 2001, terrorism insurance rates skyrocketed and many \n     contractors were unable to secure insurance, forcing projects \n     to be put on hold, costing jobs and hindering economic \n     development. The attacks had a particularly devastating \n     impact on the construction industry: more than one million \n     jobs were lost and $15 billion in real estate transactions \n     were canceled.\n       In 2002, President Bush signed TRIA into law, immediately \n     providing much needed assurance to builders and lenders. TRIA \n     acted as a spark to help our economy recover in the face of \n     continued terrorist threats by allowing contractors across \n     the country to secure this commercially necessary product.\n       Since 2002, TRIA has been reauthorized twice in \n     overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion and has continued to act as \n     a public-private partnership to ensure the stability of the \n     terrorism insurance marketplace. The seven year extension \n     contained in S. 2244 would provide a long term backstop that \n     is necessary to ensure the construction industry's future \n     success. Without the extension, banks will be less inclined \n     to lend necessary funds to new construction projects and \n     companies may be forced out of the industry because of \n     financial risks, costing jobs and putting a roadblock in our \n     nation's drive to economic recovery.\n       In the wake of a recession in which our industry faced a \n     27.2 percent unemployment rate, the construction economy \n     cannot sustain the uncertainty and disruption that the \n     expiration of TRIA would trigger.\n       ABC and its members fully support the extension of TRIA, \n     and urges all Senators to support S. 2244.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Geoffrey Burr,\n     Vice President, Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Multifamily Housing Council, National Apartment \n           Association,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2014.\n       Dear Senator: This week the U.S. Senate is scheduled to \n     consider a bill to reauthorize the Terrorism Risk Insurance \n     Act (TRIA). We commend Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member \n     Crapo for their good work on S. 2244, the Terrorism Risk \n     Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2014. It represents a \n     bipartisan, balanced approach to maintaining the necessary \n     program elements of TRIA while enhancing taxpayer \n     protections. TRIA was first enacted after the events of 9-11 \n     creating a federal backstop so that affordable terrorism \n     coverage would be available and affordable for commercial \n     policyholders across the country, including apartment \n     property owners, developers and managers. The program has \n     been a successful public/private partnership and is fiscally \n     sound.\n       On behalf of the National Multifamily Housing Council \n     (NMHC) and the National Apartment Association (NAA), we urge \n     your support of S. 2244. As policyholders, our members are \n     anxious to advance legislation in a swift manner to eliminate \n     the uncertainty associated with the year-end program \n     expiration.\n       NMHC/NAA represent the nation's leading firms participating \n     in the multifamily rental housing industry. Our combined \n     memberships engage in all aspects of the apartment industry, \n     including ownership, development, management and finance. \n     NMHC represents the principal officers of the apartment \n     industry's largest and most prominent firms. NAA is a \n     federation of 170 state and local apartment associations \n     comprised of approximately 64,000 multifamily housing \n     companies representing nearly 7.5 million apartment homes \n     throughout the United States and Canada.\n       TRIA and subsequent extensions of the program have been the \n     mechanism that provides ready access to affordable insurance \n     coverage. Terrorism risk does not resemble other commercial \n     risks. Unlike natural disasters in which insurers have had \n     significant experiences and data to project the risk of \n     damage, terrorism remains unpredictable and therefore largely \n     uninsurable. The impact of an event can be enormous, and \n     insurance modeling for such risks is still not reliable, thus \n     underscoring the importance of continued federal involvement.\n       In 2012 data collected from our members relative to their \n     cost of insurance, take up rates for terrorism coverage was \n     91%. This is not insignificant and demonstrates that \n     certainty offered by TRIA in costs and coverage limits are \n     critical components in a multifamily property owner's \n     continued ability to offer safe and affordable housing.\n       We thank you for your support of this measure and \n     appreciate your taking steps to move this important \n     legislation one step closer to enactment before the December \n     2014 expiration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Douglas M. Bibby, President,\n       National Multi Housing Council.\n     Douglas S. Culkin, CAE, President,\n       National Apartment Association.\n\n[[Page S4579]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                        Property Casualty Insurers\n\n\n                                       Association of America,\n\n                                                    July 16, 2014.\n     Contact: Eileen Gilligan\n     Phone: 202-639-0497\n     Email: Eileen.Gilligan@pciaa.net\n\n PCI Urges the Senate To Support the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program \n                      Reauthorization Act of 2014\n\n       Washington--Nat Wienecke, senior vice president, federal \n     government relations of the Property Casualty Insurers \n     Association of America (PCI) issued the following statement \n     in regards to the Senate's upcoming consideration of S. 2244, \n     the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of \n     2014.\n       ``PCI strongly supports passage of S. 2244, the Terrorism \n     Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2014, and \n     commends the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs for unanimously passing this legislation and sending \n     it to the full Senate for a vote,'' said Wienecke. ``TRIA is \n     a critical part of the fabric of our national response plan \n     for terrorist attacks. Ensuring America's economic resiliency \n     to terrorist attacks is a solemn responsibility and we call \n     on the members of the Senate to vote aye and move this \n     legislation one step closer to the president's desk.''\n       PCI is composed of more than 1,000 member companies, \n     representing the broadest cross-section of insurers of any \n     national trade association.

A long-term \n     reauthorization of the TRIA program ensures a vital piece of \n     the nation's economic national security infrastructure will \n     continue to encourage private sector involvement in the \n     terrorism insurance marketplace--thereby protecting and \n     promoting our nation's finances, security, and economic \n     strength.\n       NAMIC is the largest and most diverse property/casualty \n     trade association in the country, with 1,400 regional and \n     local mutual insurance member companies on main streets \n     across America joining many of the country's largest national \n     insurers who also call NAMIC their home. Member companies \n     serve more than 135 million auto, home and business \n     policyholders, writing in excess of $196 billion in annual \n     premiums that account for 50 percent of the automobile/ \n     homeowners market and 31 percent of the business insurance \n     market. More than 200,000 people are employed by NAMIC member \n     companies.\n       NAMIC appreciates the bipartisan leadership of the Senate \n     Banking Committee in reporting legislation by a unanimous \n     vote which both increases taxpayer protections and which will \n     maintain a robust terrorism insurance market for consumers \n     and companies of all sizes. In particular, we applaud the \n     crafters of S. 2244 for recognizing that raising the \n     ``trigger level'' could make it impossible for many small to \n     medium-sized insurers to continue to write terrorism and \n     other business coverages without ultimately doing anything to \n     reduce taxpayer exposure.\n       As it is, we are encouraging you to pass this compromise \n     legislation to reauthorize a program that has protected the \n     economic security of the United States since its creation \n     following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.\n           Sincerely,\n     James D.

Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid and Leader McConnell: On behalf of the \n     Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), I am writing to urge the \n     Senate to pass S. 2244, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program \n     Reauthorization Act of 2014, which was unanimously approved \n     by the Senate Banking Committee last month. With the year-end \n     expiration of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) looming \n     closer, it is critical that Congress take action to pass a \n     long-term extension of the terrorism risk insurance program.\n       MBA's paramount objective for TRIA reauthorization is for \n     terrorism risk insurance to remain both available and \n     affordable, in the long-term, for commercial real estate and \n     multifamily properties. The clearest path to this objective \n     is a long-term TRIA extension without modifications. If \n     changes to the program are inevitable, our perspective on \n     TRIA reauthorization legislation is then guided by its \n     potential impact on the availability and affordability of \n     terrorism risk insurance. By introducing a limited number of \n     incremental programmatic modifications, S. 2244 is consistent \n     with past reauthorization efforts that MBA has supported.\n       A long-term extension of TRIA is essential to the health \n     and vitality of the $2.5 trillion commercial and multifamily \n     real estate finance sector and the nation as a whole. The \n     absence of available and affordable terrorism risk insurance \n     would not only impact the commercial real estate finance \n     center, but would ripple through the economy as buildings \n     became more difficult and costly to finance and purchase.\n       Any changes to TRIA should be incremental, at most, and \n     implemented over the course of a long-term reauthorization \n     period in order to avoid unintended consequences. Past \n     reauthorization efforts for the program have introduced \n     gradual changes that did not negatively impact the \n     availability and affordability of terrorism risk insurance. A \n     departure from this approach could result in price and \n     availability shocks for terrorism risk insurance. We are \n     pleased the Senate is placing a high priority on TRIA \n     reauthorization.\n       Regarding S. 2244, MBA offers the following observations:\n       Long-Term Extension--MBA strongly supports the seven-year \n     extension period because it will allow for extended market \n     certainty that a terrorism risk insurance program will be in \n     place.\n       Increased Recoupment--The federal government's potential \n     recoupment is increased from $27.5 billion to $37.5 billion \n     over a five-year period. The five-year adjustment period ($2 \n     billion per year) represents an incremental approach to an \n     important element of the program.\n       Increased Insurance Company Co-Pay--After the initial \n     deductible, the insurance company co-pay will be increased by \n     one percent a year for five years until the co-pay increases \n     from 15 percent to 20 percent. This also represents an \n     incremental change to another important element of the \n     program. TRIA reauthorization should take into consideration \n     the potential impacts on small property insurance companies.\n       MBA urges all members of the Senate to vote in favor of S. \n     2244 and to oppose amendments that would weaken the TRIA \n     program. We look forward to working with Congress, other \n     policymakers, and engaged stakeholders to ensure the long-\n     term reauthorization of the TRIA program as quickly as \n     possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 David H. Stevens,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Coalition To Insure\n\n\n                                            Against Terrorism,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2014.\n       Dear Senator: The Coalition to Insure Against Terrorism \n     (CIAT) strongly urges you to support S. 2244, the Terrorism \n     Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2014. S. 2244 \n     would extend the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) for \n     seven years.\n       CIAT represents a wide range of businesses and \n     organizations throughout the transportation, real estate, \n     manufacturing, construction, energy, education, entertainment \n     and retail sectors that regularly must obtain insurance \n     against terrorism. We know firsthand that, as part of its \n     economic national security, America needs a stable, reliable \n     terrorism competitive insurance market so employers can \n     invest in assets and create jobs without assuming the risk \n     and liabilities of a terrorist attack.\n       Again, we urge you to support S. 2244 and we thank you for \n     your consideration of CIAT's concerns on this vital issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     The Coalition To Insure Against Terrorism.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Association of Realtors,\n\n                                                    July 16, 2014.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the over one-million members of \n     the National Association of REALTORS (NAR), I urge you to \n     support S. 2244, the ``Terrorism Risk Insurance Program \n     Reauthorization Act of 2014,'' when the Senate votes on it on \n     Thursday, July 17th. This bipartisan legislation, unanimously \n     approved by the Senate Banking Committee in June, extends the \n     Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) for seven years and makes \n     minimal changes to a program that has worked since its \n     inception in 2002 at virtually no cost to taxpayers.\n       NAR's membership includes commercial practitioners and \n     brokers who work with clients that would be adversely \n     affected if TRIA is allowed to expire at the end of 2014, or \n     if it is renewed in a manner that constricts the ability of \n     private insurers to make terrorism coverage available and \n     affordable throughout the country. The current TRIA program \n     continues to be a success, keeping private terrorism \n     insurance coverage available and affordable while protecting \n     taxpayers and limiting the federal government's exposure to \n     only the most extreme events. Though we do have concerns that \n     provisions in S. 2244 to increase the mandatory recoupment \n     amount (from $27.5 billion to $37.5 billion) could adversely \n     impact the economy in the wake of a terrorist attack, overall \n     we are pleased that the bill received unanimous bipartisan \n     support from the Banking Committee. NAR urges the full Senate \n     to approve it today.\n       Please give your support to S. 2244 when it reaches the \n     Senate floor. TRIA provides a crucial framework for economic \n     recovery in\n\n[[Page S4580]]\n\n     the wake of a catastrophic terrorist attack, and allows the \n     United States to maintain a stable terrorism insurance market \n     so employers can invest in properties and create jobs without \n     assuming the risk and liabilities of a terrorist attack. Your \n     support of this extension bill will aid in preventing market \n     uncertainty for years to come.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Steve Brown,\n\n                                                   2014 President,\n     National Association of REALTORS'.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, \n           Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, U.S. \n           Chamber of Commerce, Commercial Real Estate Finance \n           Council,\n                                                     July 8, 2014.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: \n     The undersigned organizations respectfully request quick \n     action on S. 2244, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program \n     Reauthorization Act of 2014. This bipartisan legislation was \n     reported last month with a unanimous vote by the Senate \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and is \n     essential to retain the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program that \n     has protected U.S. national and economic security since its \n     creation following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. \n     To date, a quarter of the Senators have cosponsored S. 2244.\n       The TRIA program is a vital piece of the nation's economic \n     national security infrastructure. The federal government \n     plays an important and appropriate role in encouraging \n     private sector involvement in the terrorism insurance \n     marketplace--thereby protecting and promoting our nation's \n     finances, security, and economic strength. The Terrorism Risk \n     Insurance Program has been a remarkable success in achieving \n     its primary mission to ``protect consumers by addressing \n     market disruptions and ensure the continued widespread \n     availability and affordability of property and casualty \n     insurance for terrorism risk.''\n       The undersigned parties are very appreciative of the \n     bipartisan leadership of the Senate Banking Committee in \n     reporting legislation that increases taxpayer protections \n     while retaining broad support of consumer groups and the \n     marketplace. Working together, Sens. Johnson and Crapo and \n     members of the Committee achieved consensus agreement on a \n     bipartisan piece of legislation. The bill reauthorizes the \n     TRIA program for seven years, a period of time that will \n     bring longer-term certainty to the market and facilitate \n     economic development, and increases the ultimate private \n     sector share of the responsibility for insured losses, \n     thereby reducing any potential burden on the taxpayer.\n       We are particularly appreciative that the Senate consensus \n     bill largely maintains the current thresholds that facilitate \n     broad private participation in the terrorism insurance \n     market. For example, the bill maintains the current $100 \n     million ``trigger''--the minimum size of a terrorist event \n     required to trigger any Federal involvement. An excessive \n     trigger could make it impossible for many small to medium-\n     sized insurers to continue to write terrorism and other \n     business coverages. If insurers are forced out of the market, \n     the result is expected to be less availability of coverage \n     and less competition. That would be antithetical to TRIA's \n     stated purposes. Small and medium-sized insurers represent \n     almost 98 percent of all insurers writing TRIA coverage and \n     almost half of all TRIA-related premiums. Small and medium-\n     sized insurers are a critical source of terrorism coverage as \n     well as other lines of insurance meeting all of needs of \n     American businesses large and small. The primary impact of \n     raising the trigger would be on smaller, regional, and niche \n     insurers whose deductible--and even total exposure--is less \n     than the amount of an elevated trigger level that has been \n     set too high. We applaud the crafters of S. 2244 for \n     recognizing this important fact.\n       We urge the Senate to take up S. 2244 as quickly as \n     possible. Consumers are already having to purchase terrorism \n     insurance coverage that extends beyond TRIA's current \n     December 31, 2014 expiration without any certainty regarding \n     the levels of protection TRIA will provide. Many newly issued \n     policies contain conditional terrorism exclusions, which \n     could result in no protection for consumers if Congress fails \n     to act in a timely manner. While most stakeholders prefer a \n     straight extension of TRIA with no changes, we recognize and \n     appreciate the bipartisan leadership of the committee in \n     moving S.2224 forward and hope that you can reach agreement \n     to bring this legislation to the Senate floor as soon as \n     possible where we believe it will have overwhelming support.\n       Given the broad support this bill has already attracted, we \n     would encourage the full Senate to consider this legislation \n     as soon as possible with minimal revisions, and in \n     particular, no amendments to raise the trigger from its \n     current $100 million level. We believe that the current \n     version of the legislation will help maintain a vital program \n     that has succeeded in fostering a robust terrorism insurance \n     market for consumers and companies of all sizes, at virtually \n     no cost to the federal government.\n           Sincerely,\n         National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, \n           Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, U.S. \n           Chamber of Commerce, Commercial Real Estate Finance \n           Council.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2014.\n       To the Members of the United States Senate: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing the interests of more than three million \n     businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as well as \n     state and local chambers and industry associations, and \n     dedicated to promoting, protecting, and defending America's \n     free enterprise system, strongly supports S. 2244, the \n     ``Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of \n     2014,'' and applauds the Senate Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs for reporting out this important \n     bill with unanimous support.\n       In the months following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the \n     inability for insurance policyholders to secure terrorism \n     risk insurance contributed to a paralysis in the economy, \n     especially in the construction, travel and tourism, and real \n     estate finance sectors. Since its initial enactment in 2002, \n     the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) has served as a vital \n     public-private risk sharing mechanism, ensuring that private \n     terrorism risk insurance coverage remains commercially \n     available and that the U.S. economy could more swiftly \n     recover in the event of a terrorist attack.\n       Catastrophic terrorism remains an uninsurable risk because \n     its frequency and location cannot be accurately predicted, \n     and its potential scale could be economically devastating. \n     TRIA continues to promote long-term availability of terrorism \n     risk insurance for catastrophic terror events and provides a \n     standard of stability for financial markets and recovery \n     after such an attack.\n       The Chamber strongly urges you to support S. 2244, the \n     ``Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of \n     2014,'' and may consider votes on, or in relation to, this \n     bill in our annual How They Voted scorecard.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Getting terrorism risk insurance right is important in \norder to protect taxpayers and to limit economic and physical impacts \nof any future terrorist attacks on the United States. This bill will \nhelp us maintain a properly balanced terrorism risk insurance program \nthat increases the Nation's economic resilience to terrorism. Again, I \nthank Chairman Johnson and Senators Schumer, Kirk, Reed, and Heller for \ntheir partnership in bringing this bill forward and encourage its \nadoption.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I haven't spoken that much in this Chamber \nsince I suffered that stroke. I so strongly believe in this legislation \nto make it happen.\n  Behind me is a representation of the world's tallest buildings, the \n10 tallest buildings in the world. Only one is in the U.S.A. Look over \nat that tallest one. That still distresses me, the Burj Khalifa, which \nis right now the tallest building in the world. I believe as the \nSenator representing Chicagoland, the city that invented the \nskyscraper, that Chicagoland citizens have a right to grow up in the \nshadow of the world's tallest buildings. Unless we quantify the risk \nfor building one of these buildings through the TRIA legislation, we \nwill not return skyscrapers to the country that invented skyscrapers.\n  With that I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Senator Crapo listed some letters and asked that they be \nput in the Record for some groups supporting our legislation.\n  We have a very long list, and I ask unanimous consent that list be \nadded to the Record, the supporters of the legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Support S. 2244, the Bipartisan Terrorism Risk Insurance Program \n                      Reauthorization Act of 2014\n\n       On April 10th, following two Banking Committee hearings on \n     the need for Congress to reauthorize TRIA, Senators Schumer \n     (D-NY), Kirk (R-IL), Reed (D-RI), Heller (R-NV), Murphy (D-\n     CT), Johanns (R-NE), Warner (D-VA), Blunt (R-MO) and Menendez \n     (D-NJ) introduced the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program \n     Reauthorization Act of 2014. The sponsors, working with \n     Banking Committee Chairman Johnson and Crapo, crafted a \n     bipartisan compromise with the following key features:\n\n[[Page S4581]]\n\n     Long-term extension that will promote national security, \n         economic growth and market certainty\n       7 year extension of TRIA until December 31, 2021.\n     Improve existing taxpayer protections\n       Gradually raise the insurer co-payment from 15% to 20% over \n     5 years.\n       Gradually raise the mandatory recoupment threshold from \n     $27.5 billion to $37.5 billion over 5 years.\n       When considering S. 2244, the Banking Committee made \n     several improvements to the bill offered by both Republican \n     and Democratic Committee Members, including requiring a study \n     and rulemaking by the Treasury Department to improve the TRIA \n     certification process to provide better guidance and \n     certainty following events that may qualify to be certified \n     as ``acts of terror'' under the program.\n     Broad support for S. 2244 and extending TRIA\n       Unanimous, Bipartisan Support in Committee: By a unanimous \n     and bipartisan vote of 22-0, the

SCHUMER. Now I would like to discuss the amendment process to \npreview it for my colleagues a little bit.\n  I would also ask unanimous consent that quorum calls be counted \nequally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. As was mentioned, I believe by some of my colleagues, \nthe give-and-take on this bill was ideally how things should work. \nFirst, a bipartisan group of Senators got together and crafted the \nlegislation. As Senator Crapo noted, there was some push and pull, what \nshould be the balance between government and the private sector, and we \ndid move a little bit more in giving greater responsibility to the \nprivate sector. People should note that at the end of the day the \nprivate sector will pay back all the money the government would lay out \nif, God forbid, there is a terrorist incident, but it would be over a \nperiod of time of course.\n  But we had Democrats and Republicans come together and we came up \nwith a bill. The chairman and ranking member agreed that the bill was a \ngood idea, held hearings, and then we moved forward with the \nlegislation.\n  Then always comes the even greater morass. We do get some bills \npassed out of this place with bipartisan support and many of them are \nsignificant bills, but then we go to the floor and we wonder what is \ngoing to happen now. We have the age-old dispute about how many \namendments, what type of amendments, should they be relevant. In this \ncase we asked colleagues on both sides of the aisle who would want \namendments.\n  The amendments that came back were reasonable. Most--not all--were \nrelated to terrorism insurance. Those that weren't, such as by Senator \nTester and Senator Vitter, were in the jurisdiction of the Banking \nCommittee, so they at least had some relationship. We did not get a \nflurry of amendments from all over the place on issues that naturally \ndivide the parties.\n  Then we had to do some negotiating, but we allowed--Senator Crapo and \nSenator Johnson allowed every amendment, that any author who wanted to \noffer an amendment could. We worked out some compromises on the Tester \namendment. Senator Coburn had objections, and a compromise was worked \nout there. Some were withdrawn, but at the end of the day anyone who \nwanted an amendment got it. Both sides showed restraint, and I think \nthat is what brought us to this position.\n  So the good news for my colleagues, we have a very limited number of \namendments, and we intend to dispose of the entire bill before lunch \nthis morning.\n  Let me briefly go over the amendments.\n  Senator Coburn will offer an amendment on recoupment timing. The \nCoburn amendment would give the Treasury Secretary the ability to \nextend the recoupment period of up to 10 years following an attack. The \nproblem is the way Senator Coburn had drafted his amendment, it would \ncreate a significant score. He offered in it the Banking Committee and \nit failed on a bipartisan vote, the majority of both parties, I \nbelieve, voting against it. But he wanted to offer it on the floor, and \nso he will.\n  There is a point of order, a pay-go point of order that will be \nraised against the Coburn amendment, and I will raise that because it \ndoes break the budget. It doesn't have a pay-for in exchange for it. So \nChairman Johnson and I believe the sponsors of the legislation \nrecommend a ``no'' vote on waiving pay-go against the Coburn amendment.\n  The Tester amendment, as modified by Senator Coburn, I believe will \nbe voice-voted. Senator Tester and Senator Johanns described that \nadequately, but it is something long overdue that would create a \nNational Association of Registered Agents and Brokers and make the \nwhole brokerage business work more smoothly. It has very broad support \nin this body.\n  Senator Vitter will offer an amendment that would require the \nPresident to nominate at least one individual with primary experience \nworking in or supervising community banks on the Federal Reserve Board \nof Governors. I am sure he will come to the floor to explain his \namendment. We expect this amendment, which we will all agree to, will \nbe approved by voice vote, and Chairman Johnson has recommended a voice \nvote to the Members on our side.\n  Finally, there is a Flake amendment that would create an advisory \ncommittee on risk-sharing mechanisms. Again, I think Senator Flake will \ncome down at some point and explain his amendment. There will be a \nrecorded vote on this at least as planned now, and I will be supportive \nand I know Chairman Johnson again has recommended a ``yes'' vote on the \nFlake amendment.\n\n[[Page S4582]]\n\n  With that, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Flake] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3551.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To establish the Advisory Committee on Risk-Sharing \n                              Mechanisms)\n\n       On page 13, after line 22, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 8. ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON RISK-SHARING MECHANISMS.\n\n       (a) Finding; Rule of Construction.--\n       (1) Finding.--Congress finds that it is desirable to \n     encourage the growth of nongovernmental, private market \n     reinsurance capacity for protection against losses arising \n     from acts of terrorism.\n       (2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this Act, any \n     amendment made by this Act, or the Terrorism Risk Insurance \n     Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 6701 note) shall prohibit insurers \n     from developing risk-sharing mechanisms to voluntarily \n     reinsure terrorism losses between and among themselves.\n       (b) Advisory Committee on Risk-Sharing Mechanisms.--\n       (1) Establishment.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     establish and appoint an advisory committee to be known as \n     the ``Advisory Committee on Risk-Sharing Mechanisms'' \n     (referred to in this subsection as the ``Advisory \n     Committee'').\n       (2) Duties.--The Advisory Committee shall provide advice, \n     recommendations, and encouragement with respect to the \n     creation and development of the nongovernmental risk-sharing \n     mechanisms described under subsection (a).\n       (3) Membership.--The Advisory Committee shall be composed \n     of 9 members who are directors, officers, or other employees \n     of insurers, reinsurers, or capital market participants that \n     are participating or that desire to participate in the \n     nongovernmental risk-sharing mechanisms described under \n     subsection (a), and who are representative of the affected \n     sectors of the insurance industry, including commercial \n     property insurance, commercial casualty insurance, \n     reinsurance, and alternative risk transfer industries.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The provisions of this section shall \n     take effect on January 1, 2015.\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to \noffer this amendment. I thank my colleagues, the ranking member of the \nBanking Committee, and the senior Senator from New York for working \nwith my office to make this possible.\n  The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act before us \nextends for 7 years the Federal loss sharing program developed in \nresponse to the market destructions that were caused by 9/11. Created \nin 2002, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program was intended to be just a \n3-year program. This program has since been extended twice, and the \nbill before us would extend its life through December 31, 2021.\n  Given the longevity of the program, I think it would be prudent for \nus to focus some attention on the growing private market reinsurance \ncapability and capacity.\n  My amendment simply establishes an advisory committee composed of \nmembers of the insurance industry to provide recommendations to \naccelerate the creation and development of private nongovernmental \nrisk-sharing mechanisms for terrorism losses. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in taking this modest step toward developing a functioning \nprivate-run market for terrorism risk insurance, thereby reducing \ndependency on the Federal Government in this regard.\n  I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to make \ncomments on a couple of the amendments that have been or will be \npresented to the bill.\n  First, with regard to the amendment presented by Senator Flake. As I \nmentioned in my opening remarks, I support this amendment. One of the \nissues we deal with in the reauthorization of TRIA each time we face it \nis the correct balance and the level of government protection and \nsupport that needs to be in place to help the market deal with major \ncatastrophic events in the United States and the level of requirement \nwe insist there be from the private sector and how they will step in \nand deal with these risks on an insurance basis rather than requiring \nthe taxpayers to be the ultimate backstop.\n  Ultimately our objective should be and must be that the taxpayer be \nrelieved of this kind of burden and that the private sector step in and \ncover the risks through our private sector insurance markets. I think \nwe have a pretty broad consensus that we are not at the level yet where \nwe can get there, but each time we have reauthorized TRIA, we have \nmoved it closer to that objective, and this legislation itself moves it \ncloser.\n  As I said in my introductory remarks, we have increased the retention \nlevel--in other words, the amount of money the private sector must pay \nback to the Treasury if the taxpayer is ultimately required to step in \nand backstop a catastrophic terrorist attack. This legislation will \nincrease that amount by another $10 billion--from $27.5 billion to \n$37.5 billion. We are also increasing the amount of money which the \nprivate sector insurance industry must put up upfront before the \ngovernment steps in and provides a backstop. We are increasing that \nfrom a 15-percent copay to 20-percent copay.\n  We are taking significant steps in this legislation to get to the \nultimate objective of having the private sector fully handle the \ninsurance risk due to a catastrophic terrorist attack.\n  Senator Flake has provided an amendment, which I support, that would \nhelp us create an advisory committee that will focus on this specific \nissue and help us to find private sector solutions to allow us to \nfurther decrease the program in the future reauthorizations. I think \nthis is an incredibly important amendment, and I believe there is \nstrong bipartisan support for it. It allows us to have advice and \nsupport from this advisory committee that would be created under his \namendment to take further and more important steps toward achieving the \nultimate objective of having to be able to eliminate the need for \ntaxpayer involvement in dealing with catastrophic events such as a \nterrorist attack.\n  I strongly support the addition of the Flake amendment. I believe the \nadvisory committee he proposes will find private sector solutions which \nwill allow us to further decrease and ultimately eliminate the program \nin future reauthorizations.\n  Another amendment that has been discussed on the floor today by \nSenator Tester of Montana and Senator Johanns of Nebraska is the NARAB \namendment, which is an amendment that will be added to this \nlegislation. This is also an important piece of legislation from the \nbanking committee and it is called the National Association of \nRegistered Agents and Brokers, or NARAB. Again, it is a bipartisan \npiece of legislation that has strong support across the United States \nin various industries to try to allow our registered agents and brokers \nto have a more efficient and effective system in which to obtain \nnecessary authorization to conduct their business nationwide.\n  I am an original cosponsor of this language because it simplifies the \nprocess of agent licensing across State lines while preserving the \nauthority of State insurance regulators. This bill has broad support \nfrom the insurance community, including the National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners, the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers \nof America, the National Association of Insurance and Financial \nAdvisers, and the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers.\n  The creation of NARAB will allow agents and brokers to focus on their \nresponsibilities to their clients and spend\n\n[[Page S4583]]\n\nless time dealing with redtape. By reducing costs and increasing \ncompetition among insurance producers, we will generate lower costs and \nbetter service for consumers. Importantly, NARAB II deals specifically \nwith marketplace entry and would not impact the States' jurisdiction \nover day-to-day authority in the insurance marketplace. This is a very \ncritical point because I believe one of the biggest issues relating to \nthis legislation is preserving and protecting States rights and State \njurisdiction with regard to regulation of the insurance marketplace.\n  Insurance commissioners of the States will be able to better catch \nbad actors who, after losing a license in one State, move quickly to \nenter into another State. State regulators will serve on the board of \nNARAB with the same objectives they have as insurance commissioners--to \nprotect the public interest by promoting the fair and equitable \ntreatment of insurance consumers.\n  The idea for NARAB is now 14 years old. We have literally been \nworking on it for that long, and I am hoping we can get this \nlegislation across the finish line today.\n  These are two important amendments that will come forward today with \nregard to the TRIA legislation, and there are several more. As we move \nforward today I am hopeful we will make the kind of progress on these \nimportant and critical issues that will enable us to not only pass this \nlegislation but to do so with a strong vote here in the Senate and then \nget us into a conference with the House so we can put this important \nlegislation, which has been developed on a bipartisan basis, on the \nPresident's desk.\n  Far too often we are seeing gridlock in this Chamber. We have two \npieces of legislation today where we have a bipartisan agreement and \nbipartisan support, and I think it is a good day for the Senate to see \nthis kind of legislation moving forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me join my friend Senator \nCrapo in congratulating the leadership on both the Republican and \nDemocratic side and the leadership on the banking committee for \nbringing this bill before us this morning. It is, unfortunately, all \ntoo rare when we can bring a piece of legislation to the floor that has \nbeen worked on by both sides of the aisle and has broad agreement on \nboth sides of the aisle. Of course, as the Senator from Idaho knows, \nthere is nothing partisan about the effects of not reauthorizing TRIA. \nThis is going to affect every part of the country. Republicans and \nDemocrats, people of liberal and conservative persuasions, will \nultimately be paying a lot more and losing a lot more because of our \nfailure to get this bill done. So let me again thank Senator Crapo and \nSenator Johnson for all the work they have done. I was one of the \noriginal cointroducers of this bill, along with Senator Schumer and \nSenator Reid, as well as Senators Menendez, Warner, Kirk, Heller, \nJohanns, and Blunt.\n  Ultimately, we were educated by what happened in the weeks and months \nfollowing September 11. In that period of time, the real estate market \nin large parts of this country--certainly in my part of the country \nsurrounding New York City--collapsed. As a result, $15 billion worth of \nprojects stalled overnight, and we lost about 300,000 construction jobs \nthat were planned to come online--all because the insurance industry \ndecided, with justification, that they could no longer insure for the \nrisk of terrorism. Prior to September 11 we got coverage for terrorism \nessentially at no cost. But after September 11, again, for good reason, \nfor good cause, insurers, without knowing what their exposure was going \nto be should there be another attack, decided they could no longer \ninsure for that risk. So, in this sense, it logically fell to the \nFederal Government to provide that assurance that no matter where one \nis--whether in Idaho or Nebraska or Connecticut or New Jersey--if a \nperson is building a project and they were the subject of terrorism, \nthey would get a backstop of protection for those losses.\n  Some said at the time: Why don't we treat insurance, when it comes to \nprotecting for terrorism, the same as we protect against other \ndisasters? Of course, we see these threats as fundamentally different. \nWe can make a decision as to whether we want to live in a part of the \ncountry that may be subject to greater risk from floods or hurricanes. \nSo we have grown to accept the fact that we are going to pay a little \nbit more if we are going to have a house or a business right on the \nwater. And we have a program here by which we mitigate that risk so \nthat it is not extraordinarily different, understanding there is still \ngood reason why people have to congregate in those spaces. But a \nterrorist attack, frankly, whether it happens in New York City right on \nthe precipice of Connecticut, or in Los Angeles or in a rural \nenvironment in the Midwest, is an attack on the United States of \nAmerica. That is an attack on all of us, no matter what specific \ngeography in which it happens to be located. So that is why we made the \ndecision as a Nation to help backstop those localities that may feel \nthe initial burden of having to reconstruct after a terrorism attack, \nbecause we believe it is a national responsibility.\n  So for the practical reason that there was no longer an ability for \nthe insurance industry to calculate how on Earth they would assess a \npremium based on the enormous potential loss of a terrorist event, and \nbecause of the fact that as Americans we felt as though we should come \ntogether and insure against this risk, we passed TRIA initially. Over \ntime we have come together as Republicans and Democrats to reauthorize \nit.\n  Now, as time has gone on, we have had a conversation about how to \nbest share this responsibility between the public sector and the \nprivate sector, because we expect that private insurers still should, \nas is their business, pick up some of this cost. So this version of the \nbill continues along the line of transferring some of this \nresponsibility from the Federal Government and the Federal taxpayers to \nprivate insurers. For instance, the underlying legislation continues to \nhave a 20-percent deductible. But after that 20-percent deductible is \nmet, under the previous version of the bill the insurer was responsible \nfor picking up 15 percent of the cost. Under this bill they are going \nto pick up 20 percent of the cost. So there is a little bit more \nresponsibility built in for the cost of paying out claims after a \nterrorist attack is picked up by insurers.\n  There is a provision in the bill which says the Federal Treasury will \nrecoup the costs from insurers of any claims it pays out. It can do \nthat over a long period of time. Previously, it was mandatory to recoup \nall of that money for claims under $27 billion. Now that number is $37 \nbillion. So we now have a mandatory return to the Treasury of any \nclaims under $37 billion, which is an additional protection for \ntaxpayers as well as an additional responsibility for insurers now \nbecause we will collect from the insurers for losses up to a higher \namount than the previous law. I think all of this is pretty reasonable.\n  I wish there were more days such as this and weeks such as this--\nalthough maybe TRIA isn't infused with the same kind of politics that \nother issues such as immigration reform and energy reform and criminal \njustice reform can be--but this was made possible by some really hard \nwork by a number of people who knew this was right to do for the \ncountry. Speaking as a Senator from a State that has a big stake in the \nreauthorization of TRIA, I say thank you to all of the people who made \nthis possible and give an advanced shout-out to the House of \nRepresentatives which we hope will pass this bipartisan bill in an \nexpeditious manner. Connecticut cares about this because we were, as I \nsaid, on the edge of the attack of September 11. We lost dozens and \ndozens of Connecticut residents in that attack. Our economy was \neffectively shut down because of the inability to assess this risk \nthroughout the real estate sector surrounding New York City. But we \nalso are home to some of the biggest and, frankly, most responsible \nproperty and casualty insurers. The Hartford and Travelers, in \nparticular, have been a big part of trying to figure out a public-\nprivate partnership to solve this problem, and this certainly helps \nthem to be able to provide more of a very important product to the rest \nof the country.\n\n  So, again, my thanks to all of those who made this piece of \nlegislation possible. My hope is we get a big vote later today across \nthe aisle, sending a message to the House of Representatives\n\n[[Page S4584]]\n\nthat they can take this bipartisan piece of legislation, pass it, and \nthen get it to the President's desk. Then we can, once again, give some \nsense of surety to our insurance markets and our real estate market \nthat the United States of America is, once again, going to step up and \ndecide that terrorism, no matter where it happens--whether it is in New \nYork City or in Topeka--is not going to get this country back.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3550\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set \naside the pending amendment so that I may call up my amendment No. \n3550, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3550.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To reaffirm the importance of community banking and community \n     banking regulatory experience on the Federal Reserve Board of \n   Governors, to ensure the Federal Reserve Board of Governors has a \n member who has previous experience in community banking or community \n                          banking supervision)\n\n       On page 13, after line 22, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 8. MEMBERSHIP OF BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL \n                   RESERVE SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) In General.--The first undesignated paragraph of \n     section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 241) is \n     amended by inserting after the second sentence the following: \n     ``In selecting members of the Board, the President shall \n     appoint at least 1 member with demonstrated primary \n     experience working in or supervising community banks having \n     less than $10,000,000,000 in total assets.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act and \n     apply to appointments made on and after that effective date, \n     excluding any nomination pending in the Senate on that date.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to talk about this amendment which \nI look forward to being adopted on this important terrorism risk \ninsurance reauthorization bill. It is a commonsense amendment. It is \nabout the Federal Reserve Board, and it says at least one member of \nthat important Board should have significant experience as a community \nbanker or a community bank supervisor.\n  This used to be commonplace because community banks--smaller \ninstitutions--were and are an important part of our financial system. \nIn fact, these days it is one part of our financial system that sets us \napart from many others, such as Canada and Europe, which are far more \ndominated by mega-institutions. Of course, the United States has some \nvery big institutions, and they serve an important role and they have \nan important place, but smaller institutions, so-called community \nbanks, serve a vital role as well and particularly in smaller \ncommunities and in more rural areas they serve those communities in a \nway megabanks simply do not.\n  I have been looking at this trend on the Federal Reserve, and \nunfortunately there is an unmistakable trend away from having adequate \nrepresentation from folks with community bank experience; that same \ntrend has been toward having the Federal Reserve Board completely \ndominated by academics and folks with megabank and academic economist \nexperience.\n  This chart I have in the Chamber shows that trend. From 1936 until \nthe present, it goes decade by decade. The chart is a little busy, and \nwe have this color coding here, but basically we can see this huge \ngrowth in the domination of this red category: folks with pure academic \neconomic experience. Folks with community bank experience, which used \nto actually dominate the Federal Reserve Board several decades ago, are \nnow very limited.\n  Look, there is nothing wrong with folks with academic experience, but \nit should not be so dominant on the Federal Reserve and we should have \nregular representation from community banks or community bank \nsupervisors because that is a vital part of our banking system.\n  My amendment is therefore very simple. It would mandate that at least \none member of the Federal Reserve Board have that experience, have \ndirect community bank experience or have direct experience as a \ncommunity bank supervisor. Specifically, we are talking about \ninstitutions with less than $10 billion in total assets.\n  This bill follows a letter several of my colleagues joined me in \nsending to President Obama. We were asking him to nominate an \nindividual with that sort of experience, and I thank the cosigners on \nthat letter: Senators Tester, Moran, Merkley, Coburn, and Johanns on \nthe committee; and noncommittee Members Senators Hirono, King, Franken, \nBaldwin, Begich, Landrieu, Heinrich, and Udall.\n  We seem to be making progress in that regard. There is widespread \nreporting that the White House is considering a list of candidates for \nthe Federal Reserve with community banking experience. But this \nspecific mandate--just one member, a very modest mandate--would help \nensure that happens and would help ensure that regularly happens into \nthe future to reverse this trend, to get more balance on the Federal \nReserve Board.\n  This is very important in the context of the too-big-to-fail debate. \nToo big to fail helped lead to the crisis several years ago in the \nbanking industry. It helped lead to the massive bailouts of mega-\ninstitutions, and unfortunately I am one who believes--and there are \nmany others--that too big to fail is alive and well today, and in some \nways Dodd-Frank institutionalized too big to fail. It did not end too \nbig to fail in any way.\n  We need to do a number of things to even the playing field, to make \nit fairer for smaller institutions, community banks that serve our \nsmaller communities in rural areas, particularly on the Federal Reserve \nBoard, which is such a significant governing and supervisory board in \nour banking industry.\n  I specifically thank the ranking member of the committee, Senator \nCrapo, for his support of this concept, his support in negotiations of \nthis amendment, and his very active involvement in getting this \namendment accepted on to the TRIA bill.\n  I think the ranking member may have a few words about this and other \nmatters. I will relinquish the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I will just take a moment to speak about \nSenator Vitter's amendment, which I strongly support.\n  During Dr. Yellen's nomination hearing, I noted the need to fill \nadditional vacancies at the Federal Reserve Board with individuals \nbringing balanced viewpoints. The President should nominate someone \nwith community bank experience to the Board to fill at least one of the \nremaining vacancies.\n  Community banks play an important role in their local economies and \nface a disproportionate burden from our existing regulations. We should \nensure that the perspective of these banks is represented in \npolicymaking. That is what this amendment does, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, just one final wrapup issue. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter of support for \nthis amendment from ICBA, the Independent Community Bankers of America.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Independent Community\n\n\n                                           Bankers of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 17, 2014.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Independent Community \n     Bankers of America and the more than 6,500 community banks \n     nationwide, I write to urge you to vote YES on Amendment \n     3550, offered by Senator David Vitter, to the Terrorism Risk \n     Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2014 (S. 2244). This \n     amendment would ensure at least one member of the Board of \n     Governors of the Federal Reserve (the Board) has experience \n     as a community banker or as a supervisor of community banks. \n     The Board not only plays\n\n[[Page S4585]]\n\n     a key role in our economy by promoting employment and stable \n     prices, but is also an important regulatory body for the U.S. \n     and global financial system. A broad range of representation \n     on the Board is critical to its effectiveness.\n       Community banks are vitally important to the nation's \n     economy, particularly with respect to small business lending \n     and providing banking services in small and rural \n     communities. These banks and the communities they serve have \n     vital interests at stake in the economic, banking, and \n     payment system issues that come before the Board. The Board \n     must consider how best to tier regulation to meet regulatory \n     objectives without disproportionately impacting community \n     banks. Expertise is also required to ensure that regulations \n     intended for the largest banks do not unintentionally sweep \n     in community banks. The unexpected compliance problems \n     associated with the December 2013 Volcker Rule vividly \n     illustrate this risk.\n       By requiring community bank representation on the Board, \n     Senator Vitter's amendment will help secure the future of the \n     community banking industry and the customers and communities \n     that depend on it. Again, ICBA urges you to vote YES on this \n     important amendment.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Camden R. Fine,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3549\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and my amendment No. 3549 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an amendment numbered \n3549.\n  Mr. COBURN.

Mr. President, we have before us a bill where \nunfortunately we do not believe in markets. We are told markets will \nnot work, so we have a terrorism risk insurance bill. That means the \nFederal Government is going to be the insurer of last resort. There \nhave been some improvements over what we have put forward in the past, \nand I agree with those improvements if in fact we have to do this. I am \nnot convinced we have to do it, but we are going to do it, and I \nunderstand that. I think the work of the committee, of which I am a \nmember, has been very good.\n  But there is one real problem with this bill, and it is about smoke \nand mirrors, it is about not being honest with the American people. \nThis bill was designed so it would have no score. It was not designed \nto do the best we can for America should we have a tragedy, and it was \nnot designed to create the flexibility that would be necessary if we do \nhave a tragedy.\n  Let me outline this for you. The way this bill is set up is that we \ncould have a significant tragedy, God forbid, in this country from a \nterrorist attack, and the bill will mandate spikes in casualty and \nproperty insurance far above what will need to happen because we passed \nthe bill to pass a CBO score. So what could happen is we would have to \ncollect billions of dollars over an 18-month period through premium \nincreases on everybody in the country, not just where we had the \nproblem--everybody in the country--because we have designed a bill that \nwill in fact mandate that or at least could mandate that.\n  I have been around this place for 10 years. I know exactly what is \ngoing to happen if that comes about through this TRIA bill. The first \nthing that will happen is the Senate and the House will pass an \nelimination of this requirement. So what will happen is the American \ntaxpayer will get stuck with all this. They all know that. Everybody \nagrees they designed the bill to meet CBO. So what I put in was an \namendment that would give flexibility to the Treasury so we do not, \nafter one tragedy, create another tragedy with markedly elevated \ncasualty and property rates. We still recoup the money, but we do it \nover a longer period of time, if it is necessary, and we give the \nSecretary of the Treasury the ability to do that.\n  My friend from New York says there is a budget point of order that \nlies against it. It does according to CBO. I agree, it does. But the \ndifference between this and most budget points of order is my amendment \nwill not increase the deficit one penny--not one penny.\n  I would also note that my colleague from New York has voted to \noverride budget points of order every time they have been offered this \nyear. So it is going to be curious to me to all of a sudden have a \nbudget point of order raised by someone who has voted to override the \nbudget point of order every time it has been offered in the Senate this \nsession, and it goes to why we should not pass this bill without common \nsense in terms of how we collect the recoupment.\n  I understand the constraints of CBO, but I also understand common \nsense. So we are going to play the game on the constraints, and we are \nultimately going to pass on--rather than recoup--we are ultimately \ngoing to pass it on to the American taxpayer, which hollows out the \nwhole purpose of the bill.\n  So this has a billion-dollar score, on which we are going to have a \npoint of order, which I am sure I will lose. But when you vote for this \nbill, know you are not voting for what the bill says it is going to do \nbecause it is going to do something completely different than what it \nsays, if we were to have one of these catastrophies.\n  The political pressure to not have these massive increases in \nproperty and casualty insurance--this place will fall, and so will the \nHouse, and we will change this, and we will have the score then. We \nwill have the score then, and ultimately your children will pay for the \ncost of this terrorism risk insurance, not the people who are owning \nthe property today, not the insurance company. We will just kick the \ncan down the road, just as we have on everything else.\n  It would seem to me that we would want to do something that works \nalong\n\n[[Page S4586]]\n\nthe parameters of this bill, and we ought to build in flexibility to \nthis bill so that--it may be 10 years that we get on one of these \nbecause the bill is divided up to meet the score so it does not score \nin any one period. So over an 18-month period we could have to recoup \nit all and people could not tolerate those kinds of rate increases in \ntheir businesses or their homes. They would not be able to tolerate it \nand we would change it. Just as I am asking for us to change it now and \nbe honest with the American people, we are going to change it if that \nhappens.\n  We will change this, and we will delay the onset of the collection of \nthis recoupment. Everybody knows that will happen. So why not be honest \nabout it and put it in the bill now and waive the budget point of order \nbecause it does not change the deficit one penny. It changes when we \ncollect it, but we still collect it against the risk of not collecting \nit at all.\n  That is what I ask my colleagues. I do not expect to win the \namendment, but it is another confirmation to the American people that \nwe are not about truth, we are not about doing commonsense things; we \nare about playing games and we are about satisfying the demands of the \nindustry over which this applies.\n  Nobody knows what could happen in this country in terms of terrorism, \nbut everybody knows I am right about this issue.\n  All I am saying is: Fess up. Be honest, colleagues. Let's build the \nflexibility in this so we do not have to address it, and the Treasury \nSecretary, no matter whether it is a Democrat or Republican \nadministration, can use common sense to guide about how fast this \nrecoupment will come; otherwise, you have not done anything to improve \nthis bill if, in fact, this is not accepted.\n  I will be leaving here at the end of the year. Hopefully, we never \nsee another terrorism event in this country. But if we do, it will be a \nsweet irony when you all say: Oops, time out. We are not going to do \nwhat we said we were going to do in that bill because the country \ncannot take it. What you will do is put one tragic event on top of \nanother. You will not do that. So what will happen? You will change \nthis bill. You will get that score. You will call it an emergency. You \nwill do it anyway.\n  All I am asking is, be honest about what is going to ultimately \nhappen on this should we have an event and it fall within one of these \nclose parameters, based on what we said in the bill, because we are \nrunning the bill according to what CBO says, not as to what common \nsense is.\n  I look forward to having a vote on this amendment. I understand my \nlikelihood of being successful. But I also understand the lack of \nhonesty in dealing with the American people if we do not accept this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Terrorist Attacks\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues to speak about S. \n2244, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2014, \nTRIA, which I have cosponsored.\n  First, I commend Banking Committee Chairman Johnson and Ranking \nMember Crapo for their leadership on this important issue. Their \nefforts, along with those of the sponsors and cosponsors of the bill, \nled to a unanimous committee vote of 22 to 0 to report the legislation \nfavorably to the full Senate. It is heartening to see legislation like \nthis come together on such a strong bipartisan basis.\n  Reauthorizing TRIA is vital and not just from a Banking Committee \nperspective. I also have the privilege of serving on the Armed Services \nCommittee. It is through this dual lens, and from what we know of the \nsignificant terrorist threats our Nation still faces, that compels me \nto believe that we need to reauthorize TRIA as soon as possible.\n  We must keep markets effectively and efficiently operating in light \nof these threats. We must continue to have policies in place to make \nsure our economy stays on track in the event of another attack on our \nNation.\n  In short, reauthorizing TRIA is not only a matter of economic \nsecurity; it is also a matter of national security. And so, I again \nthank the chairman for his leadership on this vital issue.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. I thank Senator Reed for his valuable \ncontributions to the work of the Banking Committee. I also thank him \nfor working with me on this matter and for his continued efforts to \nbolster our national security.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the chairman. I would like to clarify one point. \nWhile TRIA is silent on whether a nuclear, chemical, biological, or \nradiological related terrorist attack or any kind of cyber-related \nattack are covered, I believe our intent with S. 2244 is that these \nattacks would continue to fall within the scope of TRIA's covered \nlines, as they do today, provided that statutory prerequisites are met. \nDoes the chairman agree with this assessment?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Yes. The Committee makes this point \nclear in the Committee Report for S. 2244, and I thank the Senator \nagain for his work on this issue.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the chairman again, and I look forward to swift \npassage of this legislation here in the Senate, and hopefully in the \nHouse as well.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, today I commend my colleagues for a strong \nbipartisan vote in favor of S. 2244, the Terrorism Risk Insurance \nProgram Reauthorization Act.\n  After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the Terrorism Risk Insurance \nAct, or TRIA, helped stabilize the commercial property market. This has \nallowed for continued commercial property development and real estate \nlending for office buildings, hotels, malls, and tourist attractions \nacross the United States. In Florida, TRIA has been particularly \nimportant for continued development in the tourism sector--which is a \ncritical part of the economy.\n  The passage of S. 2244 today illustrates the widespread, continued \nsupport for TRIA and the need for a backstop to guarantee sufficient \ncapacity for businesses to insure against catastrophic terrorist \nevents, including coverage for events involving a nuclear, biological, \nchemical or radiological element. At the same time, S. 2244 also \nensures that taxpayers are a top priority and includes a recoupment \nmechanism to guarantee that taxpayers are made whole if the backstop is \ntriggered.\n  I now hope that the House of Representatives will take quick action \non S. 2244 so that the President can sign this legislation and assure \ncontinued stability in the commercial property and insurance market.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today to support \nS. 2244, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. \nCongress first enacted TRIA into law in 2002 after the commercial \nproperty sector saw major disruptions in the ability to obtain \nfinancing and terrorism risk insurance following the September 11 \nterrorist attacks.\n  TRIA stabilized the markets and provided a government backstop to \nthese unique markets, allowing commercial property development and real \nestate lending to continue for everything from hotels, stadiums, malls, \nto tourist attractions across the country. Experts and stakeholders \ntestified at several banking committee hearings that there remains a \nclear and longstanding need for the kind of government backstop TRIA \nprovides.\n  We also learned the private insurance market for terrorism risk \nexists because of TRIA, not in spite of it.\n  The long-term 7-year extension this bipartisan bill provides will \npromote national security, economic growth, and market certainty. While \nmany Members in this Chamber would be fine with extending TRIA in its \ncurrent form, this tough compromise has two additional changes that \nwill further protect taxpayers: gradually raising both the insurer \ncopayment from 15 percent to 20 percent, and the mandatory recoupment \nthreshold from $27.5 billion to $37.5 billion.\n  We were careful, however, in reaching this compromise not to raise \nthe trigger, which would drive small insurers out of the market and \nreduce the availability and affordability of coverage for businesses \nnationwide. This bipartisan bill also does not pick what modes of \nterrorist attacks should get preferential treatment over other forms of \nattacks.\n  The entire Senate banking committee voted to report the bill to the \nfloor by a unanimous and bipartisan 22-to-0 vote. Stakeholders across \nthe board strongly support the Senate's bipartisan approach to \nextending TRIA,\n\n[[Page S4587]]\n\nincluding the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Hotel and Lodging \nAssociation, the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, \nand the Real Estate Roundtable, to name just a few.\n  Let me commend Senators Schumer, Crapo, Kirk, Reed, Heller, and \nothers from both sides of the aisle for their leadership on this issue. \nI thank them as well as their staffs for working with Ranking Member \nCrapo and me and our staffs to craft this bipartisan compromise to \nextend TRIA for another 7 years. We would not be here today without all \nof their efforts.\n  TRIA must be renewed soon, given the program expires at the end of \nthe year, and policyholders have increasingly reported challenges in \nrenewing contracts for 2015. To that end, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport S. 2244.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on S. 2244, the Terrorism \nRisk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. This is a bill I have \nworked on closely with my colleagues Senators Schumer, Kirk, and Reed \nfrom Rhode Island. I also want to thank Chairman Johnson and Ranking \nMember Crapo, who have been instrumental in getting this bill to this \npoint. Without their leadership, we would not be here today.\n  The terrorist attacks on September 11 caused a sudden and dramatic \nshock in the domestic market for terrorism insurance. After the attack \nthere was a tremendous amount of uncertainty about the frequency and \npotential size of future attacks. Insurers quickly withdrew from the \nterrorist coverage market, and a new threat to our economy emerged.\n\n  In response, Congress passed TRIA, to provide a Federal insurance \nbackstop for terrorism coverage. Since the passage in 2002, TRIA has \nhelped ensure the widespread availability of affordable insurance \nagainst terrorism. This helped spur new development and protected \nexisting real estate throughout our country.\n  TRIA was reauthorized in 2005 and reauthorized again in 2007. It is \ncurrently set to expire at the end of this year unless Congress acts. \nUnfortunately, the tragic bombing in Boston last year has shown that \neven years after September 11, the threat of terrorism still exists and \nwe must continue our efforts to prevent, respond, and recover from any \npossible attacks in the future.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues that terrorism is not only an issue \nfor big cities in New Jersey, on the east coast, in the Midwest, \nChicago, terrorism is a real threat in both rural and urban areas, \nnorth, south, east, and west. That is why I have been so involved in \ntrying to get TRIA extended.\n  In my home State, Las Vegas is considered one of the leading \ninternational business and tourism destination cities in the world. \nSouthern Nevada welcomes almost 40 million tourists annually and has a \npopulation of nearly 2 million people. We have 35 major hotels along \nthe Las Vegas strip. Many of them could have up to 15,000 occupants at \nany given time. According to the Las Vegas Metro Chamber of Commerce, \nin 2013, the total economic impact of tourism was $45.2 billion, \nsupporting 47 percent of the region's gross product, and 383,000 jobs, \nnearly half of the total workforce in southern Nevada.\n  My point in citing these statistics is if a terrorist attack were to \noccur in Las Vegas, our entire State economy would be devastated \nwithout TRIA.\n  It is not just about Las Vegas. In northern Nevada, our tourism and \ngaming industry is the largest private employer in Washoe County, which \nalso includes Reno. They know that unless they have access to \naffordable terrorism coverage, they will have difficulty starting new \ncapital projects and creating new jobs.\n  You will find similar stories across our Nation in every State. \nCurrently, there is no evidence that the terrorism risk insurance \nmarket is prepared to provide coverage without TRIA. Without TRIA, most \ndevelopments would halt because businesses would not be able to access \nand afford the necessary insurance that is often required to secure a \nloan.\n  TRIA has helped many hotels, hospitals, office complexes, shopping \ncenters, colleges, and universities have access to terrorism insurance \ncoverage.\n  The bill before us today is truly a bipartisan bill. It received a \nunanimous 22-to-0 vote in the banking committee. Such a strong vote \nonly reinforces the bipartisan work that went into crafting this \nlegislation.\n  I, along with my colleagues on the Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs Committee, agreed to several key reforms that would increase \nthe insurance industry's aggregate retention level and coinsurance \nlevels, which will significantly reduce the potential cost to \ntaxpayers.\n  It is my hope that we can easily pass this important legislation with \na strong bipartisan vote and send this bill to the House as soon as \npossible. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and let's not wait \nuntil the end of the year to extend this critical program.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, as we near the votes on this bill, I wish \nto take one more opportunity to speak in favor of the TRIA \nreauthorization legislation.\n  Again, I thank Senators Schumer, Heller, and Kirk and their staffs \nand Senator Reed for all their hard work in bringing forward this \nlegislation.\n  I also thank Chairman Johnson and his staff for moving forward so \nquickly and aggressively on this legislation. Together, we were able to \nput together a bill that allows the program to continue to function \nwhile increasing the movement toward ultimate taxpayer protection.\n  As I mentioned before, we were able to approve this bill out of \ncommittee with a 22-to-0 unanimous vote. The agreement of all the \nmembers of the banking committee that we should move this bill forward \nspeaks to the importance of this critical legislation and to the level \nof the added taxpayer protections we were able to build into it.\n  Our bill increases the level of losses that the private sector will \nabsorb before reaching the Federal backstop. We do that by increasing \nthe coinsurance level of any company participating in TRIA so that each \ncompany will shoulder a greater percentage of the losses. We also \nincrease by $10 billion the level of mandatory post-event recoupments \nto $37.5 billion, which means that the taxpayer will ultimately recover \nall TRIA losses except in the most extreme events.\n  This bill will continue a program that reduces our economic \nvulnerability to terrorism, and I encourage my colleagues to support \nit.\n  One last time, I thank Senator Johnson and Senator Schumer for their \nstrong support and for our ability to work together and break the mold, \nif you will, by having a bipartisan movement forward on this important \nand critical legislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Once again I thank the chair and the ranking member of \nthe banking committee, Tim Johnson and Mike Crapo, for their great \nwork.\n  I say to my colleagues, this is a very good example of much \ncooperation--bipartisan cooperation, Democrat and Republican--a 22-to-0 \nunanimous vote out of the committee. It is also cooperation between \nprivate industry and the government. Industry, insurance, and others \nknew they had to shoulder a greater share of the load as we move on \nafter 9/11 but that only government could be the backstop at the end of \nthe day.\n  Again, this is an economic development issue above anything else. It \nis not out of whose pocket what money comes. If the greatest problem \nAmerica faces is good-paying jobs--well, if we were not to renew \nterrorism insurance, we would lose many good-paying jobs.\n  This amendment will allow those jobs to continue and grow. People \nwill\n\n[[Page S4588]]\n\nnot build major edifices, major complexes--whether they be skyscrapers \nin Chicago or New York, whether they be football stadiums in Idaho or \nSouth Carolina or major shopping centers in South Dakota--unless they \nknow there is a backstop, because insurers will not insure if they \nthink terrorism could just totally wipe them out. And that means we \nwouldn't get financing for these projects.\n  It is an outstanding piece of legislation. My hope, in conclusion, is \nthat the House would pass our bill. We know there are some concerns in \nthe House, but there is a bipartisan coalition of Democrats and \nRepublicans who really favor the approach we have taken. I know there \nare some in the House who don't believe government should be involved \nhere, but that is, with all due respect, a purist view.\n  We have cut back on some of the government's obligations. Mike Crapo \nand many of our colleagues from the other side of the aisle made that \nhappen. But at the same time, without the government backstop, we would \ndo real harm to our economy.\n  I hope we can get a very large vote in the Senate--bipartisan--\nbecause if we do, it should importune the House to perhaps pass our \nlegislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple points on the \nCoburn amendment, and then I will raise a point of order.\n  The current bill, S. 2244, is budget neutral, as the past TRIA bills \nhave been. On the other hand, CBO has said Senator Coburn's amendment \nis not fully paid for, violating the Senate's PAYGO rule.\n  Basically, the amendment--even though I know the sponsor does not \nintend it that way--is a killer amendment. CBO has said the amendment \nwould cause S. 2244 to increase the Federal deficit in both the 5-year \nand 10-year budget windows.\n  Senator Coburn offered this amendment in committee. It was roundly \ndefeated by a bipartisan vote of 16 to 6 against it.\n  I appreciate Senator Coburn's effort to provide more flexibility to \nthe timeframe for recoupment by the government in case of a terrorist \nattack, but in fact the banking committee, led by Senator Johnson, and \nmy office have worked with CBO for a number of months to determine \nwhether there could be more flexibility in the recoupment process. \nUnfortunately, CBO has yet to identify a way to provide more \nflexibility in the recoupment period while still ensuring the program \nremains budget neutral as it is now.\n  It is also important to note that if recoupment by the government \nposes any unforeseen challenge after a future attack, nothing would \nstop the Treasury Secretary from asking the Congress then to provide \nthat flexibility.\n  The bottom line is that TRIA is too important to allow this amendment \nand nonreauthorization of the program because it is not budget neutral. \nWe don't want to give anybody an excuse.\n  I am hopeful Senator Coburn will support TRIA's final passage, even \nif his amendment isn't agreed to, as he did in committee. But for those \nof us whose priority is to reauthorize this program, I urge my \ncolleagues to vote to sustain the budget point of order and oppose the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment \nviolates section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the concurrent resolution on \nthe budget for the fiscal year 2008.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of \napplicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections \nof that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the \npending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  All debate time is expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            The Middle East\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, it is my understanding later today we \nare going to have an opportunity to approve a resolution that was voted \nout of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday that deals with \nthe tragic events in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas. I just \nwant to read part of that resolution, the action part of the \nresolution, because I hope it expresses the views of each Member of the \nSenate.\n  It reaffirms the Senate's support for Israel's right to defend its \ncitizens and ensure the survival of the State of Israel. It condemns \nthe unprovoked rocket fire at Israel. It calls on Hamas to immediately \ncease all rocket and other attacks against Israel. It calls upon the \nPalestinian Authority of President Abbas to dissolve the unity \ngoverning arrangement with Hamas and condemn the attacks on Israel.\n  We all are very concerned about the tragic consequences of the \nconflict between Israel and Hamas. Our strongest desire is that we can \nend the attacks and the missiles and that we can get Israel and the \nPalestinians to negotiate a peace agreement, a lasting agreement for \ntwo states living side-by-side, the Jewish State of Israel and a \nPalestinian State.\n  But the recent military action taken by the Israel Defense Forces in \nGaza is a direct response to Hamas's barrage of rockets and mortar \nattacks against civilian targets in Israel. Labeled as a terrorist \norganization, Hamas is directly responsible for the innocent loss of \nlife of both Israelis and Palestinians. It is very tragic what Israel \nis doing it is doing so to defend its civilian population from the \nincoming rockets.\n  What Hamas is doing is indiscriminately sending missiles into Israel, \ntargeting innocent populations. Hamas's actions to extend its reach \ndeeper into Israel and its failure to end continuing attacks undermine \nefforts to attain peace and security in the region.\n  The Israel Defense Forces began Operation Protective Edge Tuesday, \nJuly 8, with one goal, one goal in mind; that is, to stop Hamas's \ncontinued rocket attacks against Israel's civilians. Since the start of \nthe operation, there have been over 1,000 rockets that have been \nlaunched into Israel. Most of those rockets hit targets. Fortunately, \nthey were not major population centers because of Iron Dome. I thank \nthe policy of this country, the United States, in providing Israel the \nIron Dome missile defense system, which has been responsible for \nbringing down approximately 200 of the rockets that otherwise would \nhave hit population centers in Israel.\n  Earlier this week, Egypt proposed an immediate cease-fire, followed \nby a series of meetings in Cairo with high-level delegations from both \nsides. Israel accepted that cease-fire immediately. They said: Fine. \nLet's do it. We want to stop the attacks of rockets into our country. \nWe want to have a discussion for peace. They did it immediately. For 6 \nhours the IDF suspended operations against Hamas, but during this time \nHamas fired 50 rockets into Israel. So the Israel Defense Forces were \nordered to resume attacks against terrorist targets following continued \ninbound rockets and Hamas's official statement that it rejected the \ncease-fire.\n  I think what Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on CBS's \n``Face the Nation'' on Sunday sums it up best. I am quoting from the \nPrime Minister: The difference between us is that we are using missiles \nto protect our civilians and they are using their civilians to protect \ntheir missiles.\n  In other words, what Hamas is doing is putting its missile locations \nin population centers, in schools, in hospitals, in mosques, in a \ndirect way to use human shields. What a difference. Israel is trying to \nprotect its civilian population. Hamas is putting their civilian \npopulation at great risk.\n  Hamas must end its rocket and mortar attacks, recognize Israel's \nright to exist, renounce violence, and honor all past agreements to \npeacefully move toward a two-state solution. That is what we want to \nsee. I strongly support Israel's right to defend its citizens against \nthreats to its security and existence. Hamas must end. It must be \nmarginalized. It cannot be allowed to continue its terrorist \nactivities. We must find a way to advance a stable and lasting peace \nbetween Israel and the Palestinian people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I would like to concur with the comments \nof my friend, the Senator from Maryland, on the tragedy in Israel and \nthe Middle East. I also want to say a special thanks to my friend, the \nSenator from Tennessee, for allowing me to jump in line for a moment.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2265\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I rise to say that I think it is abhorrent \nand I think most American people would be greatly distressed to know \nthat some of their money could be sent to terrorist organizations, that \nsome of their money could be sent to Hamas.\n  Hamas has now joined a unity government with the Palestinian \nAuthority. We give several hundred million dollars a year to the \nPalestinian Authority. I am appalled to think we could be somehow \nindirectly paying for missiles that Hamas is launching on Israel. I \nsupport the resolution that will shortly come forward condemning \nHamas's activities.\n  I want more teeth in this. I would like to see legislation that says: \nYou know what. If Hamas wants to come out of the cold, they want to \nrecognize Israel and renounce terror, maybe. But if they are going to \ncontinue to say, as one of their leaders said recently, that our path \nis resistance and a rifle, our choice is jihad, if Hamas is going to \ncontinue to laugh and to cheer with glee with the killing of three \nteenage Israeli citizens, one of whom was an American citizen, Hamas \nshould not--and we should guarantee that Hamas should not--get any of \nour money. So I will ask for unanimous consent to pass a bill to \nguarantee that Hamas will not receive any of our foreign aid.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Foreign Relations be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. 2265 and that the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration. I further ask unanimous consent \nthat the bill be read a third time and passed,\n\n[[Page S4596]]\n\nthe motion to reconsider be made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I know the Senator from Kentucky tried \nto have this bill heard this week in a business meeting. I know the \nSenator knows I supported that effort to cause this bill to be marked \nup in the Foreign Relations Committee, which is where it should be \ndealt with.\n  I thank him for his concern about foreign aid. I think he has brought \na voice to the Senate which has raised many concerns about how we are \nspending taxpayer money. I thank him for raising some of the issues he \nhas brought forth. As it relates to the bill itself, I have spoken to \nofficials from Israel. I know one of the goals is to do something that \ncomplements Israel and helps Israel.\n  I know they have some concerns with the way it is constructed and \nactually, in many ways if this bill were to become law, it would create \na heightened security problem for Israel. So we have had a constructive \nconversation I think on the floor. I would like to talk with the \nSenator a little bit further about some potential changes to the \nlegislation. I think that would be more appropriate than passing it by \nunanimous consent. I thank him again for his nature, the way he works \nwith all of us. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I know the Senator is supposed to be chairing a hearing \nhere in a moment. But the Senator is the ranking member on Foreign \nRelations. I wish to compliment the Senator from Tennessee and Senator \nMenendez. The Senators have been a very effective team. The subject \nmatter is Iran. July 20 will be here shortly.\n  I ask Senator Corker, what is his view of where we stand with the \nIranian nuclear program and what are his concerns?\n  Mr. CORKER. First of all, no one has taken a more important role in \nour foreign policy and security issues than the Senator from South \nCarolina. I thank him for that. I know on my last trip to Afghanistan, \nhe was there serving his Reserve duty. I thank the Senator for the many \ncontributions to all of these debates. I want to say that I think, \nsimilar to many in this body, when the initial agreement was put forth \nand it had a 6-month extension on it, there was a lot of concern. What \nI am concerned about, and the Senator from South Carolina I think may \nshare some of this, is that what we are going to end up with are a \nseries of rolling interim agreements.\n  What we have is Iran doing everything they can to evade sanctions \nthat have been put in place. We have countries that see the opportunity \npossibly for Iran to come out from under being a rogue state. I am \nworried we are putting ourselves in a situation where we are losing all \nof the leverage Congress, working with the administration, but Congress \nled on in putting these sanctions in place.\n  We are coming up on July 20. I was very disappointed that, in essence \nin March, the administration agreed to the fact that Iran would be able \nto have centrifuges to enrich uranium. It was something that, to me, at \nthe beginning of a negotiation, to give one of the biggest things one \ncan possibly give to a country such as Iran on the front end, put us in \na very bad position.\n  But here is my concern: It is July 17. This agreement ends on July \n20. I believe we are losing the leverage that all of us worked so hard \nto put in place. I am worried the coalition we have is dissipating. It \nfeels to me as though Iran is rope-a-doping us on this agreement.\n  What I hope is going to happen--I know the Senator and I are going to \nbe in a briefing later today. I hope the administration is going to \nshare with us, very clearly, what the gaps are between where they are \nand where Iran is.\n  It is my hope that gap is going to be very narrow. I do not think \nthat is going to be the case. My sense is the administration is going \nto ask for an extension over the next few days. That concerns me. Here \nis what I hope Congress will do: I hope Congress somehow will have the \nability, through the majority leader's efforts and all of us on the \nfloor, to weigh in on any final agreement that is put in place. I think \nthat is very important. I know the Senator tried to produce legislation \nto make that happen. I have done the same thing.\n  Secondly, I hope the administration will agree there will be no more \nextensions, period. I am pretty sure they are going to be asking for \none. It is unfortunate. When you put in place an agreement on the front \nend that you have that ability, it then creates the essence that it \ndoes not create the focus, if you will, that is necessary to bring this \nto a conclusion.\n  Again, what I hope will happen is that Congress will have a final say \non any removal of sanctions--any removal of sanctions. But my hope is \nthat before any type of sanctions relief takes place, Congress will \nhave the opportunity to weigh in. I had a long conversation yesterday \nwith our lead negotiator. I shared these same concerns, that I just \nfeel the moment slipping away from us. I think all of us want to see a \ndiplomatic solution. I do not think there is anybody on this floor that \nwants to see anything less than a great result diplomatically.\n  But I think many of us are concerned we are losing our leverage, time \nis slipping away, the coalition is dissipating. Some of the parties, as \nthe Senator knows, have differing interests now. We have had some \nconflicts arise over the course of time where we are at significant \nodds with some of our partners in these negotiations.\n  With Russia we have the issue in Ukraine and Crimea. With China we \nhave issues in the South and East China Sea. So all of this is making \nme very concerned about our ability to reach a diplomatic solution, \neven though I want more than anything--on this issue, more than \nanything, I want us to have a solid diplomatic solution that allows us \nto go forward and know that Iran does not have the ability to break out \nand become a nuclear threat to the region, to the world, and certainly \ncreate instability.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his leadership. We \nare working together. We hope to make this bipartisan. If there is an \nagreement reached with the Iranians--and I agree, I hope there will be, \nthat Congress can have a say about that agreement.\n  President Obama felt as though he needed to come to Congress to get \napproval to enter into Syria. The Senator led the effort to pass the \nresolution in the Foreign Relations Committee, the Senator and Senator \nMenendez working together. The Senator from Tennessee delivered \nRepublican votes to try to help the President. He drew a red line and \nnothing happened.\n  So if he believes he needs input from the Congress about going to \nSyria, I hope the President will understand that the Congress wants \ninput when it comes to the Iranian nuclear program. As a matter of \nfact, I hope we will demand it, because of all the decisions President \nObama will make in his two terms as President, on the foreign policy \nfront this is the most consequential.\n  Why do I say this? The Iranian regime with a nuclear capability is a \nnightmare for the world.\n  Does Senator Corker agree with me, based on his travels in the \nregion, that if we allowed the Iranians to have a robust enrichment \ncapability--and what am I talking about is taking uranium and enriching \nit to the point where they can use it for commercial fuel to run a \nnuclear power reactor. The problem with enrichment is you can go beyond \nmaking commercial grade fuel. You can actually use that process to make \na bomb. Without enrichment capability you can't make the bomb.\n  So they are demanding the right to enrich and it was given away in \nMarch. It was a huge mistake.\n  If you made a list of countries you would not trust to enrich \nuranium--based on their behavior and disruptive nature--I would put \nIran on the top of the list. My fear is that we are about to do with \nthe Iranians what we did with the North Koreans--that you have a deal \non paper that gives them an enrichment capability to be contained by\n\n[[Page S4597]]\n\nU.N. inspection. And in North Korea the rest is history.\n  When it comes to the Iranians, I am not going to turn our fate over, \nas a nation, to a bunch of U.N. inspectors trying to contain their \nuranium enrichment program. I know Israel will not.\n  But this is the ripple effect. Does the Senator agree with me that \nany right to enrich we give to the Shia Persians in Iran, the Sunni \nArabs are going to insist on an equivalent right?\n  Mr. CORKER. The Senator is exactly right. I was in the region this \nyear, and there is tremendous concern about, obviously, Iran breaking \nout in this regard. Candidly, there are many conversations about ways \nfor them to compensate for that because they obviously want a counter \nto Iran's being a nuclear-armed country.\n  As you know, with some of the proliferation that takes place, there \nare ways of buying those capabilities without even developing them \nyourself. So, yes, that is a major concern.\n  Our friend, Senator Menendez, on the other side of the aisle--with \nwhom you work so closely--I certainly don't want to speak for him, but \nI use a frame of reference that he has used on so many occasions; that \nis, it is one thing to dismantle their ability to enrich and produce a \nnuclear weapon and it is a whole different thing to just mothball.\n  What I fear is that we are creating a situation where, again, we have \nthese countries that come together, we have the sanctions that are in \nplace, and we let those sanctions dissipate. Then all of a sudden--and \nI think the Senator knows already--the economy in Iran is picking up \nand inflation has dropped if you allow those to dissipate.\n  It took a lot of effort to put these sanctions in place. Again, there \nare a lot of differing interests today that didn't exist when these \nwere put in place. Then all of a sudden we have a situation where they \nbreak out again because they have those capabilities. They have \nmothballed; they have not been dismantled. Not to speak of the fact \nthat we don't know what is going on in Parchin--we don't know what may \nhappen with the Arak facility.\n  Again, I hope the administration will be very clear about the gaps \nthat exist today. My sense is they are going to extend and, again, I \nhave grave concerns about what that is going to mean relative to \ngetting to a good end.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Along those lines, Senator Menendez has been one of the \nleading voices in the Senate and in the Nation about having a cautious \neye toward Iran.\n  They have an enrichment capability. Over the last decade it has grown \nmoderately.\n  This idea of moderate voices in Iran--the President of Iran was \nelected as a moderate. I don't believe that dichotomy really exists. \nThis whole game of good cop/bad cop is going on in front of our eyes--\nin this case good president/bad ayatollah.\n  The ayatollah, the Supreme Leader of Iran, weighed in a few days ago \ntalking about centrifuges 10 times greater than they have today. I am \nsure what he is trying to do is become the bad guy. When he puts out \nthe number 190,000 and you wind up with 15 or 20, it is like a good \ndeal.\n  I can promise you one centrifuge in the hands of the Iranians is a \nrisk. Thousands of centrifuges in the hands of Iranians is stupid. We \nwould be crazy to let that happen.\n  If they want a nuclear power program for peaceful purposes, sign me \nup.\n  As a matter of fact, as far as any deal, I would put in the deal the \nability for the international community--Russia, the United States, and \nChina working together or separately--to build a powerplant inside of \nIran to give them nuclear power as long as we control the fuel cycle.\n  Fifteen nations have nuclear power programs that do not enrich. \nCanada and Mexico have nuclear power programs, but they don't enrich \nuranium.\n  As a matter of fact, we are telling our friends in South Korea: Don't \nbegin to enrich. We are telling our friends in the United Arab \nEmirates: You can have nuclear power, but don't enrich.\n  I would find it incredible for us to tell allies that we trust them \nnot to enrich because it could set off unintended consequences, but we \nare agreeing to let one of the enemies of mankind have that capability \nbecause they are demanding it.\n  I hope and I pray a deal can come about that will neuter the nuclear \nambitions of the Iranians and give them what they claim to want--a \npeaceful nuclear power program. But I don't believe that is what they \nwant. I don't think they would be doing all the things they have been \ndoing--lying, cheating, and building plants under a mountain--if all \nthey wanted was a peaceful nuclear power program.\n  As a matter of fact, our intelligence community tells us the program \nthey have today has been put to military use. They denied that, but we \ncan't get to the bottom of it.\n  What is the Senator's view about the likelihood of the Iranians lying \nabout the fact that they have tried to militarize their program?\n  Mr. CORKER. I think, based on past behavior, that would be one's \nexpectation. Again, we know there are facilities that are operating, \nand we haven't been able to get into those facilities.\n  When you look at the facts, one of the things that is not even being \naddressed is the whole delivery system--their ability to deliver the \nweaponry. None of this discussion thus far, to my knowledge, has \nanything to do with their developing capabilities to actually deliver a \nnuclear weapon.\n  What I am concerned about--the Senator focused on the centrifuges and \nit is the central issue--no question. I think the Senator has wisely \npointed out how the Supreme Leader has tried to move the goalpost so \nfar down the field that just getting to the 30- or 40-yard line looks \ngood to us. But we also did the same on the front end of the deal by \nacknowledging in the preamble or the four-page agreement that \nenrichment certainly could occur.\n  But here is what is happening, I fear. On every other single \nportion--not just the centrifuge--the goal posts are being moved. In \nother words, the things that we thought were going to take place on the \nfront end--whether it was the Arak facility and what was going to occur \nthere or what was going to happen in other pieces of the deal--all of \nthat adds up to very important elements or a final deal. I am afraid \nwhat is happening is the goalpost is moving on all of those as time \ngoes on.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I couldn't agree more. As a matter of fact, dismantling \nhas become something new. They have a big stockpile of highly enriched \nuranium. We are talking about diluting it, but the U.N. resolution \ncalled for its removal, so this deal is to the left of the U.N. \nresolution. As a matter of fact, this whole agreement is getting to the \nleft of what the United Nations has been.\n  What about this scenario? It is one thing to have fissile material in \nthe hands of the ayatollah and they could make a bomb, but they still \nhave a lot of highly enriched uranium still inside of Iran. What is the \npossibility of a dirty bomb, where they turn that highly enriched \nuranium over to a terrorist organization and it makes its way here \nwithout their fingerprints being on it?\n  Mr. CORKER. One of the ways that Iran has destabilized the region has \nbeen through proxies that it funds.\n  Let's face it. Until they became involved in Syria--as the Senator \nhas talked about on the floor--through their proxy, Hezbollah, actually \nthe moderate in the opposition was gaining ground. So their utilization \nof terrorist groups to achieve their end, obviously, is their normal \nmode of operation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, continue.\n  Mr. CORKER. So when you think about the possibilities of their being \nable to create, as the Senator mentioned, a dirty bomb--which would \ncreate tremendous terror wherever it might have been implemented--that \nis something I think is frightening--more than frightening.\n  It would be something that would be not quite as destabilizing as, \nobviously, having a full-blown nuclear weapon, but something that would \nbe very damaging to world security.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I know we are going to have a vote in a second, but we \nwill end our thoughts.\n  The reason 3,000 Americans were killed on 9/11 and not 3 million is \nthat the terrorist groups that wish us harm could not find capabilities \nbeyond the airplanes. They are trying. They are trying to get weapons \nof mass destruction, chemical weapons, highly enriched uranium, fissile \nmaterial.\n  My fear is that if a regime such as Iran is given the capability to \nenrich,\n\n[[Page S4598]]\n\nit will become a North Korea where they break out.\n  I will not turn the fate of the United States over, with my vote, to \na bunch of U.N. inspectors--where the only hope of a breakout is a \nbunch of U.N. inspectors.\n  The whole real goal for me is to have a capability that is very \nsmall, face-saving in nature, that can't lead to a breakout. Don't have \nsomething robust that can lead to a breakout and expect the U.N. to \nprotect us because they can't. They didn't do it in North Korea.\n  At the end of the day I think the decision we are going to make as a \nnation--through our President--hopefully with direction and input, will \nbe the biggest decision we have made as a nation on the foreign policy \nfront in decades, because, if we get this wrong, if we allow the \nIranian ayatollah to achieve a new nuclear capability, every Sunni Arab \nis going to want like capability, and we are on the road to Armageddon.\n  Look at the Middle East and ask yourselves: Is this a good place to \ngive people nuclear capability? Would they use it?\n  Hamas is firing every rocket in its inventory, and they could care \nless where it lands; they hate Israel that much.\n  The Sunni Arabs feel more threatened by the Shia Persians than they \ndo by the Israelis.\n  It is commonly believed that Israelis have a nuclear capability. Not \none Sunni nation has tried to procure a weapon of their own to counter \nthat presumed capability. Every Sunni Arab state has told me, you, and \neverybody else who will listen, that if the Shia Persians get a \ncapability they are going to match that capability because they see \nthat threat as existential.\n  Israel sees the threat in Iran--with a nuclear capability in Iranian \nhands--as existential.\n  I see it as existential to the United States. We have an opportunity \nhere for negotiations to end this well. But what I hope we will not do \nis, through negotiations, create a scenario where they break out like \nthe North Koreans.\n  If I have the choice between a bad deal through negotiations that \nwill lead to a nuclear Iran over time and military force--as \ndistasteful as that might be--I am going to pick military force because \nwe have to stop their ambitions to become a nuclear nation.\n  If we don't stop them, it would be similar, in my view, to have let \nHitler have the bomb when we could have done something about it.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Senator again for his tremendous \ncontributions to this body and every foreign policy debate that we \nhave.\n  The President did seek congressional approval on the authorization of \nthe use of military force in Syria. It was not something he had to do, \nbut he sought it, and I am pleased that he did.\n  I was proud to be a part of writing that agreement with our chairman \nand other members of the committee to give him the power to do that. \nAnd actually, to be candid, I regret that things took the course they \ntook, but the President elected to do that.\n  As the Senator mentioned, a nuclear-armed Iran is a whole different \nscale. What I hope will happen is that the President will agree there \nwill be no more extensions if they ask for one in the next few days, \nand I am almost certain that is what is going to happen.\n  No. 2, I hope you will commit to letting Congress weigh in on the \nfinal decision. I actually think that will be useful for them in the \nnegotiation. I really do think that having a backstop would be useful \nto them, but if the President doesn't agree to that, I hope we, on our \nown, will pass legislation which ensures that is the case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I concur, and I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/17/senate-section/article/S4598-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4598-S4599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CARING FOR REFUGEES\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, in the last year I have been to Jordan, \nTurkey, and Lebanon to visit Syrian refugees and the organizations that \nwork with them. I have seen the effects of refugees fleeing violence on \nthese nations. Lebanon has 4 million people. They are having to care \nfor 1 million refugees from Syria--one in four members of their \npopulation.\n  These countries, especially Jordan and Lebanon, are small--much \nsmaller than the United States. They are much poorer than the United \nStates. Jordan has very little water for their own citizens, much less \nrefugees, but they have shown a real sense of compassion and \nhospitality in treating these Syrian refugees who are fleeing violence \nand coming over their border. Lebanese citizens even run double school \nshifts--their own kids in the morning and Syrian refugees in the \nafternoon.\n  When I have been in the Middle East in these countries, I have \nwondered what would happen if refugees fleeing violence in other \ncountries came to the United States. I wonder if we would show the same \ncompassion to refugees that is being shown by these poorer nations.\n  I wish to say a few words about the crisis at the border now because \nwe are now faced with that question--refugees fleeing violence and \ncoming to the United States.\n  Who are the children coming to the United States? They are \noverwhelmingly refugees from three Central American countries--52,000 \njust this year. They are not just coming to the United States; they are \nalso flooding into Costa Rica and Nicaragua.\n  Senator Menendez held a hearing this morning, and we had testimony. \nWhat is the reason they are coming? And the testimony was this: The \nreason they are coming is overwhelmingly the violence in the \nneighborhoods where they live that forces their parents to decide that \nto keep them safe, they should leave.\n  What is the source of the violence? Again, overwhelmingly, the \ntestimony is that the source of the violence is the drug trade that has \ncorrupted the neighborhoods and made them dangerous. The kids are \nfleeing violence driven by the drug trade.\n  Here is the sort of sad punch line: Where does the drug trade \noriginate? The drug trade is originating because of the significant \ndemand in the United States for illegal drugs, especially cocaine.\n  So these kids are fleeing to the United States because Americans are \nbuying illegal drugs in such numbers and the dollars being shipped \nsouth are creating conditions for gang warfare and cartels, turning \nthese nations into transit points for drugs.\n  I know these children, and I know their neighborhoods. I lived in El \nProgreso, Honduras, in 1980 and 1981. Six hundred kids from El Progreso \nhave already come to the United States as unaccompanied refugees this \nyear.\n  Honduras, a beautiful country with beautiful people, a longtime ally \nof the United States, is now the murder capital of the world. There are \nmore people murdered in Honduras than in any other country. El Salvador \nis No. 4 in the world, and Guatemala is No. 5 in the world.\n  I recently met with President Hernandez of Honduras to talk about \nwhat we can do. So what should we do? Let's get to the prescription. \nWhat should we do?\n  First, we have to stop blaming the kids or assuming they are bad \npeople. They are not. We need to show the same compassion for refugees \nfleeing violence and coming to the United States as nations such as \nLebanon, Turkey, and Jordan show to refugees fleeing violence and \ncoming to their nations.\n  Secondly, we need to work on our legal process and the resources the \nPresident asked for. I have some criticisms of exactly how those \ndollars will be spent and the particular protections these refugees \nneed when they arrive. Remember, it is a 2008 law we are dealing with \nthat was passed unanimously by Congress and signed by President Bush.\n  We need to do immigration reform. The fact that we haven't done it \nfor so long creates a sense of confusion. If we can clearly elaborate \nwhat our immigration policy is, it will dispel myths.\n  More support for security in Central America is critical. We need to \ninterdict more drugs. General Kelly, the head of SOUTHCOM, says we let \n75 percent of the drugs that come into the United States go by us. We \nknow where they are, but we haven't put the military resources in place \nto interdict them.\n\n[[Page S4599]]\n\n  Finally, we have to tackle the U.S. demand for drugs because that is \nwhat is driving the violence in the neighborhoods which is causing kids \nto flee.\n  In conclusion, this year is the 75th anniversary of a very shameful \nevent--the voyage of the St. Louis. The St. Louis was a ship that left \nGermany in 1939 with hundreds of Jews onboard. These Jews were fleeing \nviolence and antisemitism to come to the new world. They were not \nallowed to disembark in Cuba, they were not allowed to disembark in the \nUnited States, and they were not allowed to disembark in Canada. \nEventually, the ship had to be routed back to Europe, where, research \nshows, hundreds of those Jews who had to get back off in Europe died in \nthe Holocaust.\n  The testimony this morning was that if we, without due process, send \nthese children home, many will die as a result.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KAINE. That lesson of the St. Louis should stick with us, and \nthere are many things we can do to avert this crisis and to show our \ngood hearts as Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/17/senate-section/article/S4599-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I come to the floor today to reiterate \nmy opposition to legislation that would impose new tax burdens on \nbusinesses in New Hampshire and I believe would have a serious impact \non our economy.\n  Earlier this week Majority Leader Reid started a fast-track process \nto bring a bill to the floor that includes the so-called Marketplace \nFairness Act. This is legislation that would for the first time allow \nStates to collect sales taxes from businesses in New Hampshire. As a \nresult, this bill would impose significant new tax compliance burdens \non entrepreneurs in New Hampshire--the same entrepreneurs who are \ntrying to grow their businesses and create jobs on the Internet.\n  In New Hampshire we don't have a sales tax, so our businesses are not \nused to collecting one. That is why New Hampshire businesses are so \nconcerned that if this bill passes, they will\n\n[[Page S4600]]\n\nbe forced to collect sales taxes from not just 1 State but 46 other \nStates and 9,600 taxing jurisdictions across the country. The redtape \nwould be a nightmare for small companies with only a few employees.\n  I heard from one small business owner in Hudson, NH. His business is \nabout to reach $1 million in revenue, but his company has only six \nemployees. Under the legislation, the so-called Marketplace Fairness \nAct, his company might be considered a large business. The company has \nplans to grow, but it would be forced to reconsider as it approaches \nthis arbitrary threshold and then is covered under the so-called \nMarketplace Fairness Act.\n  E-commerce has been a real boon to small businesses in New Hampshire \nand across the country. It has helped companies find new markets for \ntheir products and new revenues. But for companies looking to grow \nthrough online sales, this legislation represents an artificial ceiling \nfor creating jobs and expanding jobs through e-commerce.\n  I will raise a few concerns about what this legislation would mean \nfor small business. First, each State has different sales and use \ntaxes, so businesses would need new software to figure out how to \ncollect and remit those taxes. Small businesses would also need to \ncollect personal information from each buyer to make sure they are \ncomplying with all State and local sales taxes. These small businesses \nmight then have to deal with audit and enforcement actions from other \nStates, and the same businesses might have to answer to taxing \nauthorities in places where they have no representation whatsoever. As \nStates and localities consider new taxes, these small businesses would \nhave no voice in that process because they have no representation in \nthose jurisdictions.\n  These are just a few examples of the many unintended consequences \nthis legislation would create. These burdens on small businesses will \nstifle e-commerce. That is why it was so disappointing to learn that \nthe sponsors of the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act have attached it \nto another measure that is meant to encourage e-commerce, the Internet \nTax Freedom Act. That legislation bans taxes on Internet access.\n  The Internet Tax Freedom Act has broad bipartisan support. I am proud \nto be an original cosponsor of this legislation. Since 1998 the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act has kept the Internet free of new taxation, \nwhich has helped the Internet flourish and become the driver of \neconomic activity it is today.\n  Unfortunately, this ban on new Internet access taxes expires this \nNovember, and Congress must take action to keep the Internet tax-free. \nI strongly support keeping the Internet tax-free, and the vast majority \nof Congress supports it. In fact, just this week the House voted to \nmake this ban on Internet taxation permanent. The Internet Tax Freedom \nAct could pass the Senate and the House today with strong bipartisan \nsupport. Yet based on the action earlier this week, the Senate may be \nasked to consider a bill that includes new tax burdens on small \nbusinesses. That is right. It doesn't make sense, but on a bill that is \nmeant to keep the Internet free from taxation, there is now an effort \nto impose new tax collection burdens on Internet retailers, and that \nnot only doesn't make sense, I think it is just wrong.\n  Just yesterday I sent a letter with a bipartisan group of our \ncolleagues urging leadership to bring a clean Internet Tax Freedom Act \nbill to the floor. I was joined by Senators Cruz, Ayotte, Tester, \nMerkley, and Paul. We believe the Internet should be tax-free and that \nwe should pass this noncontroversial legislation as soon as possible.\n\n  We also think it is wrong to use a critical, must-pass extension of \nthis law to keep the Internet tax-free as a vehicle to pass a \nfundamental shift in how e-commerce operates. Combining these two very \ndifferent issues into one bill does nothing to protect New Hampshire's \nsmall businesses from the flawed so-called Marketplace Fairness Act.\n  We should keep this Internet sales tax legislation from moving \nforward, the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act. We should do that \nbecause it is bad for New Hampshire and the other States that have no \nsales taxes that are in the same position as New Hampshire. It is bad \nfor small businesses and it is bad for our economy.\n  Thank you very much, Madam President. I yield the floor and note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I wish to recognize my colleague from \nNew Hampshire, Senator Ayotte, who I think has come to the floor to \nalso express her concerns about the commingling of the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act with the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act. She will be \nspeaking from her perspective about the concerns it places on New \nHampshire's small businesses. I am very pleased to see my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire here to also express her concern about what is \nhappening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I certainly wish to thank my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire, Senator Shaheen.\n  As she has stated, New Hampshire doesn't have a sales tax. There is \nabsolutely nothing fair about the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act, \nespecially for a State such as New Hampshire. It should be more \nappropriately named the Internet sales tax collection act, because that \nis what it is--the Internet sales tax collection act. I certainly \nappreciate the work I have done with my colleague, both of us fighting \nthe Marketplace Fairness Act, because there is nothing fair about it \nfor New Hampshire and, frankly, nothing fair about it for online \nbusinesses across this country.\n  This act would ask our online businesses that have been thriving and \ngrowing--many people have started these businesses from their homes and \nwe have seen those businesses flourish in our home State of New \nHampshire--to become tax collectors for States that are greedy for \nrevenue, and it would trample on the decision of a State such as New \nHampshire not to have a sales tax. What it would mean for online \nbusinesses is they would have to become the tax collector not just for \nthe 50 States, but they would actually have to become a tax collector \nfor over 9,000 taxed jurisdictions in this country. Talk about a \nbureaucratic nightmare for an online business. Talk about an act that \nis going to put onerous burdens on an area of commerce that we have \nseen such great growth in. Talk about an act that is totally misnamed \nbecause there is nothing fair about it; it really is an Internet sales \ntax collection act.\n  In my home State of New Hampshire I have had so many online \nbusinesses write me about how this act--this MFA act--is going to hurt \ntheir business and is going to place onerous requirements on our \nbusinesses. Not only would they be forced to collect taxes for these \nother jurisdictions--over 9,000--but can we imagine what will happen \nonce one of those jurisdictions--a municipality that is allowed to \ntax--changes their tax amount? Then, suddenly, they have to update \ntheir collection method. Guess what. If they get it wrong, they are \nsubject to being sued in some other State, some other jurisdiction.\n  This is going to hurt the development of more online businesses \nbecause it creates a big bureaucracy. It is totally inappropriate. Why \nare we asking these thriving online businesses to become the tax \ncollectors for States? The reason we have over 9,000 jurisdictions they \nhave to collect for is because it is not just States; in some States \neven the municipal level has its own sales tax that can be collected. \nWhat a mess.\n  Then we see what is happening in Washington. The majority leader rule \nXIV'd a bill, and what he did is he attached the Marketplace Fairness \nAct, which I prefer to call the Internet sales tax collection act, to \nwhat was just passed in the House of Representatives: the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act. Talk about ironic. The Internet Tax Freedom Act is \nlegislation I strongly support. This legislation is going to prevent \ntaxes over the Internet, taxing the Internet that could hit all of us \nin some way, so that we can protect the freedom of the Internet and the \ngrowth\n\n[[Page S4601]]\n\nwe have seen on the Internet. It is widely supported on both sides of \nthe aisle, as my colleague from New Hampshire said.\n\n  So the irony is that here we have an act that is so widely \nsupported--the Internet Tax Freedom Act--providing a tax-free \nInternet--and the majority leader decides to attach to it the so-called \nMarketplace Fairness Act, which is really the Internet sales tax \ncollection act. That legislation creates new onerous burdens on online \nbusinesses to become the tax collectors for over 9,000 tax \njurisdictions. We can see the irony of it. Here we have bipartisan \nsupport for freedom from taxes on the Internet that should be extended \nto allow the Internet to thrive and grow and continue to grow, and the \nmajority leader, without a hearing--because when he rule XIV's it, \nthere is no committee hearing. It doesn't go through the committee \nprocess where we can have hearings on the burdens this will place on \nonline commerce and on online businesses not only in my home State of \nNew Hampshire but in other businesses across the country. There was no \nhearing for this. It is an issue both sides of the aisle agree with: \nLet's keep the Internet tax-free. Then the majority leader attaches \nonto it with no hearing, under rule XIV, this onerous requirement which \nI like to call the Internet sales tax collection act. Of course, in \nWashington, they always name these acts to make us think it sounds \ngood, so they call it the Marketplace Fairness Act. That is the irony. \nOnly in Washington would we have rammed this through this process, \nwithout a committee hearing--legislation that protects Internet \nfreedom, that has strong bipartisan support, attached with it new \nonerous burdens on Internet businesses to become the sales tax \ncollectors for the Nation.\n  I join in what my colleague from New Hampshire just said. I think it \nis wrong that this bill is being pushed forward with the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act that has such strong support, that should be brought to \nthis body as a stand-alone bill, not with these new burdensome \nrequirements that are set forth in the so-called Marketplace Fairness \nAct, otherwise known as the Internet sales tax collection act. The \npeople of this country deserve to have a free, tax-free Internet. The \nonline businesses of this country that are thriving and growing \nshouldn't become the tax collectors for States and municipalities that \nare greedy for more revenue. It is their job to collect their taxes. It \nshouldn't be an online business's job to collect taxes for over 9,000 \njurisdictions, because we can only imagine how many changes will happen \nand what kind of paperwork nightmare that will create for those \nbusinesses. I have heard it from our businesses firsthand.\n  I hope this body will oppose any effort to vote for a bill that \nconnects Internet tax freedom with Internet sales tax collection, \nbecause the two are antithetical. One works against the other. One \nensures the freedom of the Internet to be tax-free and the other one \ncreates new burdensome requirements on online businesses and actually \nworks against, in my view, the thriving commerce we see over the \nInternet and has resulted in more choice for all of us as consumers in \nthis country.\n\n\n                        Malaysian Airlines Crash\n\n  Madam President, we all learned today, very shockingly, that there \nwas a Malaysian Airlines flight shot down over Eastern Ukraine and \nthat, reportedly, 295 people lost their lives in that incident. \nReportedly, 23 Americans were listed on the manifest. I wish to offer \nmy thoughts and prayers to the families of the victims of that plane \nthat went down over Eastern Ukraine, and I want them to know they are \nin our thoughts and in our prayers.\n  I wish to raise the issue as following: There is an investigation \ngoing on. We don't know yet who is responsible or if anyone is \nresponsible. The facts will come forward as to why this plane went \ndown. But it has been widely reported that the plane was, in fact, shot \ndown. Some of the reports have said it was done by a medium-range \nsurface-to-air missile system.\n  We know that most recently there has been tremendous violence in \nEastern Ukraine. If the investigation of this plane going down reveals \nthat either Russia or Russian agents are responsible or indirectly \nresponsible for shooting down this civilian airliner, there should be \nserious consequences.\n  What we know is that Vladimir Putin and the Russians have been \nresponsible in fomenting the situation that has occurred in Eastern \nUkraine where there has been violence, there has been recruiting, \ntraining, and funding of Russians and Russian agents, sending them to \nEastern Ukraine to fight the Ukrainian Government, interfering with the \nsovereignty of Ukraine. This was following the illegal invasion and \nannexation of Crimea, the territory of Ukraine, by the Russian \nGovernment, and the Russians have taken over that portion of Ukraine.\n  We will wait to see what the investigation reveals for the downing of \nthis plane. Our prayers are with the families who have lost loved ones. \nBut I believe there should be serious consequences if we find out it \nwas either Russian agents, Russian equipment, or Russia directly that \nwas responsible for this airliner going down.\n  Yesterday the administration announced it would impose and was \nimposing greater sanctions on Russia for their activities of fomenting \nviolence in Eastern Ukraine.\n  I want to thank the administration for finally coming forward and \nputting forth more serious sanctions against Vladimir Putin, against \nthe Russian Government, for what they have done to interfere with the \nsovereignty of Ukraine.\n  It is an important step forward, and I hope Vladimir Putin \nunderstands there are even greater sanctions that can be imposed if the \nsanctions that were announced yesterday by the administration that \ninvolve some sectoral sanctions against major industries in Russia and \nindividuals--if they do not heed the warning that is coming from those \nsanctions, I hope Vladimir Putin and the Russian Government understand \nthere are much tougher sanctions that can also be imposed if they do \nnot heed the sanctions that were put in place yesterday and stop \nfueling the violence in Eastern Ukraine.\n  We need to understand the context of what we have seen happen in \nEastern Ukraine. The separatists, the so-called separatists, in Eastern \nUkraine are funded, equipped, and supported by the Kremlin. Vladimir \nPutin could end the violence in Eastern Ukraine tomorrow if he chose \nto. He essentially has operational control of what these violent \nseparatists are doing to interfere with the sovereignty in Ukraine. He \nis responsible for the violence, and I would call on him to end that \nviolence, to stop funding these separatists, to stop providing them \nwith equipment that is being used against the Ukrainian people and the \nUkrainian military, and to allow the people of Ukraine to determine \ntheir future. That is what they want.\n  I had the privilege of going to Ukraine for their Presidential \nelection, and I was inspired by the people who went to the polls. I \nwill never forget being there at the first polling station that day in \nthe Presidential election and an older gentleman came to the polls and \ncast his ballot and said: For democracy.\n  The people of Ukraine want to determine their own future, just as we \ndetermine our future in this country. Vladimir Putin and Russia should \nallow the people of Ukraine to decide their future. They should stop \ninterfering with the sovereignty of Ukraine.\n  This is not a Ukrainian uprising of disenfranchised Russian-speaking \nUkrainians. What is happening in Eastern Ukraine is a Kremlin-\ninstigated, armed, funded, trained, and fueled aggression against the \npeople of Ukraine and their duly elected government.\n  This is cynical and blatant aggression by Putin against Ukraine, and \nPutin continues to undermine Ukrainian sovereignty and security by \narming these separatist rebels, massing Russian troops at the border of \nEastern Ukraine in a very threatening way, and also threatening to \nincrease further coercive measures against Ukraine.\n  The people of Ukraine need our help. The Ukrainian people are willing \nto risk their lives and have been risking their lives to defend the \nsovereignty of their country against President Putin's aggression, but \nthe Ukrainian Government desperately needs our assistance.\n  In particular, the prior administration of Ukraine that left--\nPresident Yanukovych was very aligned with Russia--gutted their \nmilitary and much of the equipment they need to be able to defend \nthemselves.\n\n[[Page S4602]]\n\n  Let me say, they have gone there and bravely defended themselves, \neven without having some of the equipment they need that was really \nlost by their military because of the prior administration and neglect \nof the Ukrainian military.\n  Ukrainians need assistance--and not only the sanctions the \nadministration has issued, which could get tougher but they need \nmilitary assistance from our country.\n  We have to keep in mind the Ukrainians gave up their nuclear weapons \nunder the Budapest Memorandum. In return--our country, the Russians, \nwere signatories to the Budapest Memorandum--in return for security \nassurances, the least we can do for them is give them the means to \ndefend themselves.\n  I know the Ukrainian Government has asked us for antitank weapons, \nantiaircraft weapons, small arms, the sharing of intelligence so they \ncan defend their own border. It is the least we can do for them, given \nthat they gave up their nuclear weapons.\n  What country is going to give up their nuclear weapons again if we \nwill not even give them some basic military assistance so they can \ndefend themselves? They are not asking us to send our troops in. They \nare not asking for things like that. They are willing to defend \nthemselves and they need our help to do so.\n  Finally, President Obama said in his June 4 speech in Poland: ``Our \nfree nations will stand united so that further Russian provocations \nwill only mean more isolation and costs for Russia.'' I call on the \nPresident to continue to take action and to stand by those words. Those \nwords meant a lot to the Ukrainian people, and it is important that we \nfollow through on those words because it is in the national security \ninterests of the United States to stand with the people of Ukraine and \ntheir legitimately elected government as they seek to protect their \nsovereignty.\n\n  If we are not willing in these circumstances to stand by giving them \nsome basic military support they have asked for, after having given up \ntheir nuclear weapons, then what lessons will other actors in the \nregion and around the world take from that?\n  I think lesson No. 1 is: Why would you ever give up your nuclear \nweapons? In a world where we are hoping to reduce proliferation, this \nis not a good message for us to send.\n  No. 2: What will our allies in the region think if we will not stand \nagainst Russian aggression under these circumstances?\n  You have already seen concerns, of course, by the countries in the \nregion that can be impacted by Russian aggression, whether it is \nGeorgia, Moldova--concerns we have seen for further support from \nPoland, important allies in the region.\n  To put it in perspective of why we need to give this military \nsupport--in addition, we do not know what happened, but we will find \nout, with the downing of this commercial passenger plane and the tragic \nloss of 295 individuals. Over the last month, we have seen that on June \n14 pro-Russian separatists shot down a Ukrainian military transport, \nkilling all 49 people on board; on June 16, Gazprom--Russia's giant \nstate-controlled gas company--announced they are cutting off gas \nsupplies to Ukraine.\n  Just this Monday, a Ukrainian cargo plane was shot down and Ukrainian \nofficials believe it was shot down by missiles fired from Russia.\n  Last night, a Ukrainian fighter jet was shot down. Ukrainians also \nbelieve the Russians were involved in shooting down that fighter jet.\n  We will find out what happened to this passenger plane but it was in \nairspace where there have been instances of Russian agents directly \ninvolved in shooting down Ukrainian planes.\n  So it is important that we give the Ukrainian people the capacity to \ndefend themselves under those circumstances. It is the least we can do, \ngiven that they are willing to stand up for their own sovereignty, that \nthey are strong friends of the United States of America. If our allies \nin the region think we will not stand with the sovereignty of Ukraine \nunder these situations, it is going to create a situation where our \nallies will not feel they can rely on the United States of America.\n  It also creates a situation where allies, friends, rivals, bullies, \npotential adversaries take the wrong message from it. For example, \nthinking about what is happening right now with the negotiations with \nIran, if we are a country not willing to follow through to assist our \nfriends--under circumstances where, for example, Ukraine gave up its \nnuclear weapons--with some basic military support, what kind of message \nwill that send to the negotiations going on with Iran right now as to \nwhy they should give up their nuclear program?\n  So this is a very important moment for the United States of America. \nI again want to say that the steps the administration took to impose \nadditional sanctions this week are a very important step. I support \nthose. I hope Vladimir Putin and Russia heed what those sanctions mean. \nThose sanctions will have an impact on the Russian economy, but we can \nimpose even stronger sanctions against Russia if they do not stop \nfunding and causing the violence in Eastern Ukraine and interfering \nwith the sovereignty of the Ukrainian people.\n  The people of Ukraine have our respect. They have stood for \nthemselves. They had a free and fair election that I was able to \nobserve. They elected their President, and now they want to determine \ntheir own future, and they want Russia to respect the sovereignty of \ntheir country--what any country in this world should be able to expect: \nthat another country will respect their sovereignty.\n  Unfortunately, Vladimir Putin has been a bully in all of this and has \nnot respected the sovereignty of Ukraine. He should understand the \nsanctions that were issued this week are a message to him to stop what \nhe is doing in Eastern Ukraine, and we can issue even tougher \nsanctions--and should issue tougher sanctions--if he continues to act \nlike a bully who thinks he can go into other countries, take their \nterritory, and push people around in those countries, as we have seen \nin Ukraine.\n  This matters to the world because we cannot have people like Putin \nthinking they can invade another country without consequences.\n  Finally, I would hope we would provide more support to the Ukrainian \nmilitary, given that they have been willing to stand for their own \ndefense, to secure their own border, to stand for their own \nsovereignty, but it is very difficult for them to do so when they are \nfacing Russian-supported separatists, Russian tanks, Russian \nantiaircraft equipment, and more sophisticated technology than they \nhave at the moment.\n  We can help them by ensuring that they have the equipment to protect \nthemselves, to protect their border, and to let Russia know there will \nbe consequences if they continue to interfere with the sovereignty of \nUkraine or any other country.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               STEM Jobs\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, three of our greatest `masters of the \nuniverse'--as I like to refer to them--have joined in an op-ed in the \nNew York Times just last week to share their wisdom from on high and to \ntell us in Congress how to do our business and to conduct immigration \nreform they think should be pleasing to them. I am sure other super \nbillionaires would be glad to join with these three super billionaires \nand could agree on legislation that would be acceptable to them.\n  Sheldon Adelson, Las Vegas casino magnet and Republican supporter; \nWarren Buffett, the master investor; and Bill Gates, the master founder \nof Microsoft computer systems, all super billionaires, apparently \naren't happy. They don't have much respect for Congress and, by \nindirection, the people who elect people to Congress, it appears from \nthe tone of their article--you know, American people, that great \nunwashed group; nativists, narrow-minded patriots, possessors of \nmiddle-class values. They just don't understand as we know, we great \nexecutives and entrepreneurs.\n\n[[Page S4603]]\n\n  So they declare we need to import more foreign workers in computer \nscience, technology, and engineering, because the country is ``badly in \nneed of their services.'' They say we are badly in need of importing \nlarge numbers of STEM graduates. That is something we have all heard \nand many of us have perhaps assumed is an accurate thing.\n  These three individuals, all generous men, have contributed to a lot \nof causes, and I am teasing them a lit bit. They didn't mind sticking \nit to Congress, so I just tease them and push back a little bit.\n  They particularly praised the Senate for its elimination of any \nlimits on the number of work visas that could be awarded to immigrants \nwho have a degree in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \nand have a job offer.\n  This is the op-ed in the New York Times last Thursday: ``Sheldon \nAdelson, Warren Buffett, and Bill Gates on Immigration Reform.''\n  What did we see in the newspaper today? News from Microsoft--was it \nthat they are having to raise wages to try to get enough good, quality \nengineers to do the work? Are they expanding or are they hiring? No, \nthat is not what the news was, unfortunately. Not at all.\n  This is the headline in USA Today: ``Microsoft to cut up to 18,000 \njobs over next year.''\n\n       Microsoft confirmed it will cut up to 18,000 jobs over the \n     next year, part of the tech titan's efforts to streamline its \n     business under a new CEO . . .\n\n  That is a significant action. Indeed, Microsoft employs about 125,000 \npeople, and they are laying off 18,000. The company laid off 5,000 in \n2009. Yet their founder and former leader, Mr. Gates, says we have to \nhave more and more people come into our country to take those kinds of \njobs.\n  It is pretty interesting, really. We need to be thinking about what \nit all means and ask ourselves: What is the situation today for \nAmerican graduates of STEM degrees and technology degrees? Do we have \nenough? And do we need to have people come to our country to take those \njobs? Or, indeed, do we not have a shortage of workers, and do we have \ndifficulty of people finding jobs?\n  These are some of the facts I think we should look at. President \nObama, Senate Democrats, and House Democrats have endorsed a proposal, \na bill that passed the Senate, that would double the H-1B foreign \nworkers that come into America for one reason--not to be a citizen, not \nto stay indefinitely, but to take a job, double the number, to come to \ntake a job for several years. The great majority of these guest workers \nare not farm workers. They take jobs throughout the economy.\n  So how should we think about this? The U.S. Census Bureau reports \nthat three-fourths of American with STEM degrees--science, technology, \nengineering, mathematics--don't have jobs in STEM fields. According to \na recent newspaper from the Economic Policy Institute:\n  ``Guestworkers may be filling as many as half of all new information \ntechnology jobs each year.''\n  It goes on. ``IT workers earn the same today as they did, generally, \n14 years ago.'' Wages aren't going up, and in many cases they are going \ndown. That is an absolute refutation, I think--if you believe in the \nfree market--of any contention that we have a shortage of engineering, \nscience, and STEM graduates.\n  The paper further says: ``Currently, only one of every two STEM \ncollege graduates is hired in a STEM job each year.'' So only half of \nthem find a job in the profession they trained for.\n  Another finding of the paper: ``Policies that expand the supply of \nguest workers will discourage U.S. students from going into STEM \nfields, and into IT in particular.''\n  Get that. Is that not common sense? If anybody would dispute that, I \nwould like to hear it. The policies that expand the supply of eligible \nworkers in any field will tend to discourage people, particularly in \nscience and engineering, if they feel like they are going to have a \ndifficult time finding a job. That is common sense, and that is what \nthe paper found.\n  Now, Mr. Hal Salzman--I am familiar with his work. He is a professor \nat Rutgers University and a labor specialist. He has done a good bit of \nwork in this area. And what do his findings show? He determined: ``For \nthe 180,000 or so openings annually, U.S. colleges and universities \nsupply 500,000 graduates.''\n  More than twice as many people graduate in STEM fields as jobs are \navailable in America for them to take.\n  Bob Charette, at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics \nEngineers, writes: ``Wages for U.S. workers in computer and math fields \nhave largely stagnated since 2000.''\n  That is 14 years ago.\n\n       Even as the Great Recession slowly recedes, STEM workers at \n     every stage of the career pipeline, from freshly minted grads \n     to mid- and late-career Ph.D.s, still struggle to find \n     employment.\n\n  In total, Charette reports that there are more than 11 million \nAmericans with STEM degrees who don't have STEM jobs.\n  Harvard Professor Michael Teitelbaum has recently written a book. He \nexplained:\n\n       Far from offering expanding attractive career \n     opportunities, it seems that many, but not all, science and \n     engineering careers are headed in the opposite direction: \n     unstable careers, slow-growing wages, and high risk of jobs \n     moving offshore or being filled by temporary workers from \n     abroad.\n\n  Michael Anft, with the Johns Hopkins Magazine, observed:\n\n       You're a biologist, chemist, electrical engineer, \n     manufacturing worker, mechanical engineer, or physicist, \n     you've most likely seen your paycheck remain flat at best. If \n     you're a recent grad in those fields looking for a job, good \n     luck. A National Academies report suggests a glut of life \n     scientists, lab workers, and physical scientists, owing in \n     part to over-recruitment of science-Ph.D. candidates by \n     universities. And postdocs, many of whom are waiting longer \n     for academic spots, are opting out of science careers at \n     higher rates, according to the National Science Foundation.\n\n  This is serious. There is a policy question, and he questions whether \nMembers of Congress who don't pass laws like he wants on immigration \nare honoring their duty to the 300 million Americans whom we \ncollectively represent.\n  I feel a deep duty to the millions of Alabamians I represent and the \nwhole country, and I do my best every day to ask what is in their \ninterests. As far as I am concerned, so far as I can see, those three \nbillionaires have three votes. An individual who works stocking the \nshelves at the grocery store, the barber, the doctor, the lawyer, the \ncleaners, the operator, and the person who picks up our garbage are \nevery bit as valuable as they are. I know who I represent. I represent \nthe citizens of the United States of America, and I am trying to do \nwhat is in their best interests. And just as it is not always true what \nis good for General Motors is good for America, likewise, what may be \ngood for Mr. Adelson and Mr. Microsoft and Mr. Buffett is not always in \naccord with what is good for the American people. I know that. They are \nfree to express their opinion, but I am going to push back.\n\n  How many people come into our country each year as guest workers? We \nhave discussed that. The Senate bill which Senator Reid maneuvered \nthrough the Senate not too many weeks ago would double the number of \nguest workers. How many is that? The Associated Press wrote:\n\n       Although no one tracks exactly how many H-1B guest workers \n     come to take jobs these are visas for jobs in fields like \n     computers and technology--how many of these are in the United \n     States? The AP says ``experts estimate there are at least \n     600,000 at any one time.''\n\n  That is a lot. These are individuals not on a citizenship path. They \nare in addition to the 1 million who come to America each year lawfully \nto become citizens of America. They simply come in at the behest of \nsome business to take a job for a limited period of time. That is \nimportant. There are other visas these businesses can get too, but H-1B \nis one of the largest. A paper for the Economic Policy Institute \nexplained the annual inflow of guest workers for the computer industry \nin particular is massive.\n\n       We estimate that during fiscal 2011, 372,516 high-skill \n     guest workers were issued visas to enter the U.S. labor \n     market, and, of these workers, between 134,000 and 228,000 \n     were available for IT employment.\n\n  That is information technology.\n\n       The supply of IT guest workers appears to be growing \n     dramatically despite stagnant or even declining wages.\n\n  But Microsoft and its allies want more.\n\n[[Page S4604]]\n\n  Here is an excerpt from a report issued by the Partnership for a New \nAmerican Economy. This is the front group for the pro-immigration \ncrowd. It is co-headed by Steve Ballmer, a recent Microsoft CEO. He \nleft Microsoft in February, but he is the co-head of this group and is \nlobbying for more H-1B guest workers to come to take jobs. They say: \n``In many STEM occupations, unemployment is virtually non-existent.''\n  This is not so. They declare it to be so. They say:\n\n       There is no evidence that foreign-born STEM workers \n     adversely affect the wages of American workers by providing a \n     less expensive alternative source of labor.\n\n  What planet are they on? Wages are declining. Median income in \nAmerica today--well, according to the Wall Street Journal, it was \napproximately $55,000 for a family in 2007. It is now closer to \n$50,000. It dropped roughly $5,000. Somebody needs to talk about that.\n  Is unemployment in these industries ``virtually non-existent''? That \nis what they are telling us. They are spending millions of dollars even \nrunning TV ads to promote bringing in more workers than the 600,000 we \nhave today. They want to double that number. I am not talking about the \n1 million who already come lawfully every year through immigration in \nAmerica. We have one of the most generous immigration policies in the \nworld. These guest workers are in addition to the 1 million we let in \neach year on a permanent basis.\n  Look at these recent headlines.\n  Today: ``Microsoft To Cut Workforce By 18,000 This Year, `Moving Now' \nTo Cut First 13,000.''\n  How about this headline: ``[Google-owned] Motorola To Cut 10% Of \nWorkforce After Laying Off 20% Last Year.''\n  ``Panasonic To Cut 10K More Workers In The Next 5 Months.''\n  ``[Online media and advertising company] CityGrid Lays Off 15% Of Its \nEmployees.''\n  ``Hewlett-Packard: 27,000 Job Cuts to Save Up To $3.5B By 2014.''\n  I would say things aren't going as well as some would suggest, and \nthe demand out there for workers ought to be met from our current \nsupply.\n  Byron York, an excellent writer at the Washington Examiner, wrote \nabout this late last year in the Washington Examiner. The headline is: \n``Companies lay off thousands, then demand immigration reform for new \nlabor.''\n\n       On Tuesday, the chief human resource officers of more than \n     100 large corporations sent a letter to House Speaker John \n     Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi urging quick passage \n     of a comprehensive immigration reform bill.\n\n  Don't read it, don't worry about it, just pass it. It gives us more \nworkers, and we need those workers, is essentially, what they have been \nsaying. ``The officials who signed the letter represent companies with \na vast array of business interests: General Electric, Marriott \nInternational, Hilton Worldwide, Hyatt Hotels Corporation, McDonald's, \nWendy's, The Cheesecake Factory, Johnson & Johnson, Hewlett-Packard, \nGeneral Mills, and many more.'' All of them ``want to see increases in \nimmigration levels for low-skill as well as high-skill workers in \naddition to a path to full citizenship for the millions of immigrants \nin the United States currently illegally.'' That is their agenda.\n  The article goes on to say: ``a new immigration law, the corporate \nofficers say, `would be a long overdue step toward aligning our \nnation's immigration policies with its workforce needs at all skill \nlevels . . . ' ''\n  I would say at a time of high unemployment we need to be careful. The \narticle goes on to say, ``at the . . . time the corporate officers seek \nhigher numbers of immigrants, both low-skill and high-skill, many of \ntheir companies are laying off thousands of workers.''\n  So he did a little research. All these companies in need of workers. \nWhat about Hewlett-Packard? They signed the letter demanding more \nworkers. I will quote from the article.\n\n       For example, Hewlett-Packard, whose Executive Vice \n     President for Human Resources Tracy Keogh signed the letter, \n     laid off 29,000 employees in 2012. In August of this year, \n     Cisco Systems, whose Senior Vice President and Chief Human \n     Resources Officer Kathleen Weslock signed the letter, \n     announced plans to lay off 4,000--in addition to 8,000 cut in \n     the last two years. United Technologies, whose Senior Vice \n     President for Human Resources and Organization Elizabeth \n     B. Amato signed the letter, announced layoffs of 3,000 \n     this year.\n       American Express, whose Chief Human Resources Officer L. \n     Kevin Cox signed the letter, cut 5,400 jobs this year. \n     Proctor & Gamble, whose Chief Human Resources Officer Mark F. \n     Biegger signed the letter, announced plans to cut 5,700 jobs \n     in 2012.\n\n  Those are a just few of the layoffs at companies, the article said, \nwhose officers signed the letter.\n\n       A few more: T-Mobile announced 2,250 layoffs in 2012. \n     Archer-Daniels-Midland laid off 1,200. Texas Instruments, \n     nearly 2,000. Cigna 1,300. Verizon sought to cut 1,700 jobs . \n     . . Marriott announced `hundreds' of layoffs this year. \n     International Paper has closed plants and laid off dozens.\n\n--including an old, big plant with 1,000 workers or so in north \nAlabama--\n\n       And General Mills, in what the Minneapolis Star-Tribune \n     called a `rare mass layoff,' laid off 850 people last year.\n\n  ``There are more still.'' I am quoting here from Mr. Byron York's \narticle:\n\n       In all, it's fair to say a large number of corporate \n     signers of the letter demanding more labor from abroad have \n     actually laid off workers at home in recent years. Together \n     their actions have a significant effect on the economy. \n     According to a recent Reuters report, U.S. employers \n     announced 50,462 layoffs in August, up 34 percent from the \n     previous month and up 57 percent from August 2012.\n\n  This is last August. I am quoting from the article:\n\n       ``It is difficult to understand how these companies can \n     feel justified in demanding the importation of cheap labor \n     with a straight face at a time when tens of millions of \n     Americans are unemployed,'' writes the Center for Immigration \n     Studies, which strongly opposes the Senate Gang of Eight \n     bill. . . . The companies claim the bill is an ``opportunity \n     to level the playing field for U.S. employers' but it is more \n     of an effort to level the wages of American citizens.''\n\n  Mr. York goes on to say this in his next article. The next month, he \nwrites another article on the subject.\n\n       This week, the pharmaceutical giant Merck announced it \n     would cut 8,500 jobs in an effort to remain competitive in a \n     rapidly changing drug industry. Earlier this year Merck \n     announced plans to cut 7,500 jobs, bringing the total of \n     workers let go to 16,000. In all, Merck intends to lay off \n     one out of every five of its employees.\n\n  Well, what is Merck, this great corporation, doing politically about \nthe situation?\n  I will quote from the article. This is what they are doing \npolitically:\n\n       At the same time, top Merck officials are urging Congress \n     to loosen the nation's immigration laws to allow more foreign \n     workers into the United States. In a Sept. 10 letter--\n\n--this is last September--\n\n     --to House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Nancy \n     Pelosi, Merck Executive Vice President for Human Resources \n     Mirian Graddick-Weir urged that the U.S. admit more high- and \n     low-skilled immigrants to ``address the reality that there is \n     a global war for talent'' and to ``align our nation's \n     immigration policies with its workforce needs at all skill \n     levels to ensure U.S. global competitiveness.''\n\n  Well, we have too many people unemployed. The number of people \nunemployed in our country is not accurately reflected by the simple \nunemployment data we get. When you look at the number of people in the \nactual workforce, you find we have the lowest workplace participation, \nthe lowest number of workers as a percentage of the population at any \ntime since the 1970s. It has been declining steadily. It is a fact. \nEverybody knows it. It is not disputed. If anybody wants to dispute \nthat, come to the floor and tell me where I am wrong. And they won't \nbecause it is well accepted and Democrats and Republicans are talking \nopenly about it, because it is a serious challenge for America. We \ndon't have enough people working. We have got too many people living \noff the government and relying on federal aid and assistance. We need \nto create jobs for Americans first before we bring in foreign workers \nto take those jobs. We are going to help our people sustain their life. \nWe make sure they have food and housing and aid if they are unable to \nwork and don't have enough to live on, and we provide health care for \nthem and education for their children. But we need to help them find \nwork first before we bring somebody else to the country.\n  I would say to my free market business friends, I don't think you can \nwin the argument that we have a shortage of labor, because wages are \ndown. I know you believe in free markets. I\n\n[[Page S4605]]\n\nknow you believe that things will balance out in a competitive world. \nIf wages are down, that indicates we have a loose labor market, not a \ntight labor market. Wages go up when there are not enough employees, \nand businesses have to pay more to get good employees. Family income \nhas gone down from 2007, as I said, from approximately $55,000 median \nhousehold income to $50,000, adjusted for inflation. This is a very \nunusual decline. I am not sure we have seen anything like quite this \nbefore, at least since the Great Depression. This is a matter we need \nto talk about. ``Watching firms fire American workers while appealing \nfor more immigration is a disheartening spectacle'', Mr. Byron York \nsays. And I think that is true.\n\n  This is another Associated Press article: ``Backlash Stirs in US \nAgainst Foreign Worker Visas.''\n\n       But amid calls for expanding the so-called H-1B visa \n     program, there is a growing pushback from Americans who argue \n     that the program has been hijacked by staffing companies that \n     import cheaper, lower-level workers to replace more expensive \n     U.S. workers--or keep them from being hired in the first \n     place.\n       ``It's getting pretty frustrating when you can't compete on \n     salary for a skilled job,'' said Rich Hajinlian, a veteran \n     computer programmer from the Boston area. ``You hear \n     references all the time that these big companies . . . can't \n     find skilled workers. I am a skilled worker.''\n\n  How about this? They say there is a STEM crisis--which is Science, \nTechnology, Engineering, and Mathematics. They say there are not enough \nSTEM graduates to fill vacant jobs.\n  This article says: ``The STEM Crisis Is a Myth.'' This is a paper by \nRobert Charette, contributing editor for the Industrial Institute of \nElectrical and Electronic Engineers magazine. He says:\n\n       Companies would rather not pay STEM professionals high \n     salaries with lavish benefits, offer them training on the \n     job, or guarantee them decades of stable employment. So \n     having an oversupply of workers, whether domestically \n     educated or imported, is to their benefit.\n       That is in part because it helps keep wages in check.\n       Viewed another way, about 15 million U.S. residents hold at \n     least a bachelor's degree in a STEM discipline, but three-\n     fourths of them--11.4 million--work outside of STEM.\n       If there is in fact a STEM worker shortage, wouldn't you \n     expect more workers with STEM degrees to be filling those \n     jobs?''\n\n  I think that is correct.\n  What about the people who immigrate to America? They can't get a job \nbecause somebody else was brought in to take that job from them. What \nare they going to do?\n  The economy can absorb a certain number, but in this low job-wage \nlow-job creation economy we are in today, and have been in for a number \nof years, you simply cannot justify these huge increases in the number \nof workers we have brought into the country, especially when wages are \nfalling.\n  Here is another article: ``The Myth of the Science and Engineering \nShortage.'' It is an op-ed by Michael Teitelbaum, a senior research \nassociate at Harvard Law School.\n\n       A compelling body of research is now available, from many \n     leading academic researchers and from respected research \n     organizations such as the National Bureau of Economic \n     Research, the RAND Corporation, and the Urban Institute.\n       No one has been able to find any evidence indicating \n     current widespread labor market shortages or hiring \n     difficulties in science and engineering occupations . . .\n\n  He goes on to write, as I read before:\n\n       From offering expanding attractive career opportunities, it \n     seems that many, but not all science and engineering careers \n     are headed in the opposite direction: unstable careers, slow-\n     growing wages, and high risk of jobs moving offshore or being \n     filled by temporary workers from abroad.\n\n  I am afraid that is the undisputed reality. I wish it were not so. I \nwish we had a growing economy that would create a lot of jobs and a lot \nmore high-tech workers and that wages were going up. But it is just not \nso.\n  Here is an article from July 11, in CNNMoney. The headline is: \n``Businesses Want Immigration Reform. Why? Because they can't find \nenough workers.'' That is what they say the answer is.\n\n  This article notes the complaints of various business lobbyists. For \ninstance:\n\n       The tech industry faces a backlog of working visas for high \n     skilled workers. The long wait for green cards at top \n     universities means the U.S. is losing [talent]. . . . \n     Microsoft founder Bill Gates and others CEOs like Yahoo's \n     Marissa Mayer and Facebook's Mark Zuckerburg, have all \n     pressed Washington leaders for an immigration [reform].\n\n  CNN also includes this statement from another group demanding \nCongress provide more workers:\n\n       Two-thirds of construction companies have reported labor \n     shortages according to the Associated General Contractors of \n     America, who is pushing for immigration reform.\n\n  So two-thirds of construction companies reported labor shortages. \nWell, what do we know about that?\n  Here is a May 5 article from Economic Policy Institute by Ross \nEisenbrey. They cite an in-depth study about the labor market.\n  The headline says: ``There are Seven Unemployed Construction Workers \nfor Every Job Opening.''\n  There is a chart showing the drop in wages. This isn't some promoter, \nsome lobbyist or some media consultant putting out a self-serving \nstatement claiming we have a shortage of workers. This is an academic \nstudy. Again, what does it say? ``No Sign of Labor Shortages in \nConstruction: There are Seven Unemployed Construction Workers for Every \nJob Opening.''\n  That is where we are. What we need, as a Nation, is to construct an \nimmigration policy that serves the interests of the American people.\n  Professor Borjas at Harvard is perhaps the most astute and renowned \nexpert on labor and immigration of anybody in the entire world and has \nwritten a number of books on this. He did an comprehensive study using \ncensus data and Department of Labor data and concluded that from 1980 \nto 2000, as a result of America's high immigration levels, the wages of \nlower-skilled US workers declined by 7.4 percent.\n  The impact of this large flow of immigration from 1980 to 2000 \nreduced wages. We already bring in a million people a year, plus \nhundreds thousands more guest workers. I am not against immigration. \nWhat I am opposed to, however, is an immigration policy that fails to \nserve the needs of the people living here today. The myth is we have \nthis great shortage of labor. It is just not so. If he allowed the \nlabor market to tighten, wages would increase, more Americans would \ntake some of these jobs and be able to raise a family, buy an \nautomobile, and maybe even buy a house and educate their children.\n  Today I am going to issue a challenge to Majority Leader Reid, and \nevery single one of our 55 Senate Democrats, who voted unanimously for \nthis Gang of 8 bill.\n  With Microsoft laying off 18,000 workers, come down to the Senate \nfloor and tell me there is a shortage of qualified Americans to fill \nSTEM jobs. Come down and tell us. Do you stand with Mr. Bill Gates or \ndo you stand with our American constituents?\n  It is long past time we had an immigration policy that truly served \nthe needs of the American people. That is the group to whom we owe our \nloyalty and duty and first responsibility. That is who elected us, and \nthat is in our constitutional system, which ultimately judges us on our \nperformance.\n  The United States let in 40 million new immigrants legal and \nillegal--since 1970. There are many wonderful people in that group. But \nWashington actually hurts both our immigrant workers and US-born \nworkers alike when we continue to bring in record numbers of new \nworkers to compete for jobs. The share of the population today that is \nforeign-born has quadrupled. It has gone up four-fold in forty years. \nAfter four decades of large-scale immigration, is it not time, \ncolleagues, that we slow down a bit, allowed wages to rise, \nassimilation to occur, and the middle class to be restored?\n  I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n\n             Celebrating Governor Phil Hoff's 90th Birthday\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we come to the floor oftentimes to discuss \nissues of portent to the Nation, but the\n\n[[Page S4606]]\n\ndistinguished Senator from Vermont and I wish to speak about one of the \nmost significant people Vermont has ever known.\n  I wish to yield to my distinguished colleague from Vermont and we \nwill go back and forth.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank Senator Leahy for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, every now and then there are figures who \ncome along who play a profound and transformative role in the period in \nwhich they are living. Phil Hoff is one of those people. We are here to \ncelebrate his 90th birthday and the work he has done in Vermont and \naround the country and the life he and his wife Joan have lived, both \nof whom have done so much for the people of the State of Vermont.\n  Phil Hoff was the 73rd Governor of the State of Vermont. He was in \nmany ways the founder of progressive politics in our State. It is now \nrecognized--and we say this proudly, although not everybody necessarily \nis as proud of it as we are--but Vermont is now one of the more \nprogressive States in the United States of America. We have been a \nleader for the rights of working people, for the environment, for \nwomen's rights, for gay rights, for kids, and we are proud of that, but \nnone of that would have happened--we would not be where we are today--\nif it had not been for the work of Phil Hoff, who has Governor of our \nState and was elected in 1962.\n  I am going to yield to my colleague Senator Leahy now. I have a lot \nmore I wish to say, but let me begin the discussion by saying that we \nin Vermont are extraordinarily fortunate that one of the great \nGovernors of his time is a real visionary, a man who led the beginning \nof making profound changes in the State of Vermont.\n  I yield back to the senior Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague from Vermont is \nabsolutely right. Vermont changed remarkably when Governor Phil Hoff \nwas elected. Prior to that time, the governorship of Vermont was \nbasically a part-time office--seen now and then when the legislature \nwas there but not so much otherwise--and things went along almost on \nautopilot. Governor Hoff changed that and brought Vermont into the 20th \ncentury. I think because the two are somewhat intertwined.\n  I was a volunteer for the Presidential campaign of then-Senator John \nF. Kennedy in 1960. I volunteered on his campaign, but I wasn't old \nenough to vote for him. But I remember the first election I was able to \nvote in was the Vermont Governor's race in 1962, and I cast my first \nvote for Philip Henderson Hoff. My family was thrilled when he won that \nelection. He became the first Democratic Governor elected in Vermont in \nover a century.\n  My parents and Marcelle's parents were so fond of Phil Hoff and his \nwife Joan. They thought the world of them. I was happy the other day in \nseeing both Phil and Joan at his birthday celebration. They talked \nabout my parents and Marcelle's parents, but I told them I wouldn't be \nwhere I am today without Governor Hoff.\n  I was a young lawyer in his office. There had been a real problem in \nthe State's attorney's office in Chittenden County, VT, which is about \none-quarter of our State's population. The State's attorney announced \nhe was leaving and Governor Hoff called me to his home on Friday \nafternoon and said: I want you to be State's attorney on Monday \nmorning.\n  I gulped, and I said: Yes, sir.\n  He said: Clean up the backlog of cases that have accumulated in the \noffice.\n  I said: Yes, sir.\n  He said: Do that for 1 year and then come on back to our firm.\n  And I said: Yes, sir.\n  The one thing I didn't do is I didn't come back to the firm; I \nenjoyed being there so much, I stayed there. I stayed there, though, \nwith admiration for Phil Hoff because he had changed the State of \nVermont. He made it exciting to be in government in Vermont. He made it \nexciting to be part of the fabric of Vermont. I have always appreciated \nthat. I have always appreciated my time with him but especially the \nmentoring he offered me. If it had not been for him, I can tell my \ncolleagues, I would not be standing here today as the President pro \ntempore of the U.S. Senate.\n  I yield back to my friend from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, way back in 1968 as a young man, I got a \njob at the Department of Taxation in a small building on State Street \nacross the street from the statehouse, working for the administration, \nthen-Governor Hoff, and that was a very important experience for me and \nhelped me shape some of my views which I carry today.\n  Phil Hoff's career of public service began during World War II when \nhe put his studies on hold and joined the Navy, eventually joining the \nsubmarine service. He served on the USS Sea Dog in the Pacific theater, \ngoing on a number of combat tours in the dangerous waters near the main \nislands of Japan.\n  While in naval training in New London, CT, a friend of his set up a \nblind date with a Connecticut college student. Her name was Joan \nBrower, and she and Phil would be married after the war--a marriage \nthat was to last for six rich decades.\n\n  I know Senator Leahy and his wife, as well as myself and my wife \nJane, know the Hoffs very well. We know Joan and know of her years of \ndedication to the people of the State of Vermont, especially in the \narea of education. So she in her own right has been a very important \nfigure in our State.\n  After Phil Hoff's graduation from Cornell Law School, he and Joan \nmoved to Burlington, VT, in 1951. Deeply committed to social justice, \nhe became involved in Democratic Party politics and did that despite \nthe fact that he grew up in a Republican family.\n  Senator Leahy will remember that way back then, there was a group of \nwhat they called the Young Turks--younger Democrats who came into a \nvery conservative Republican legislature. Most of them were under 40. \nMany of them were veterans of World War II. They moved forward to try \nto bring about some long needed change in the State.\n  Their experience in the legislature motivated Phil Hoff to run for \nGovernor in 1962. As Senator Leahy indicated, if my memory is correct, \nhe was the first Democrat elected Governor since the Civil War; is that \nright?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my colleague is absolutely correct. It was \na cataclysmic change in the political landscape of Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. For more than 100 years--I think many people don't know \nthis--the Republican Party dominated Vermont politics, controlling both \nHouses of the legislature and the Governor's office.\n  This is a funny story. Even in the landslide Presidential election of \n1936, when FDR--Franklin Delano Roosevelt--won a huge landslide \nvictory, Vermont joined Maine as the only State in the country to vote \nagainst Roosevelt and vote for Alfred Landon, and thus came the well-\nknown expression: ``As goes Maine, so goes Vermont.'' What Phil Hoff \nhelped do is lead Vermont out of a one-party State, badly in need of \nreforms, and brought that State in many significant ways into the \nsecond half of the 20th century.\n  I yield back to the senior Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Vermont. He and I \nshare so much affection for Phil and Joan Hoff, and I can tell hundreds \nof stories. He made a difference by enthusiastically bringing people \ntogether in our State, with the realization that we needed to catch up \nwith the rest of the country in so many ways--such as bringing high-\ntech industry into Vermont and working so hard to make sure everybody \nhad a good education no matter what part of the State they lived in.\n  Then there are the personal anecdotes. I was excited as a young \nState's attorney one day getting a call from the Governor's office that \none of the old-line politicians in Burlington had died--a wonderful man \nof French Canadian descent. They were going to have a mass for him at \nthe Cathedral, and the Governor wanted me to ride with him to the mass.\n\n[[Page S4607]]\n\n  I got into the car, and I said, Governor, you know I have only been \nState's attorney for a very short while and I can't tell you what an \nhonor it is to be with you. He said, An honor? Honor has nothing to do \nwith it. He said, I am an Episcopalian, you are a Catholic. They put me \nin the front row. I never know when I am supposed to stand or where I \nam supposed to sit, so you are going to make sure I do it right. I had \nbeen an altar boy for years, and I was in sheer panic when I walked in \nthe church that I might have the Governor do something wrong, but we \nmade it through.\n  More importantly, Vermont had issues, and they became very serious, \naffecting the reputation of our State. Phil Hoff and great people \ntogether across the political spectrum would sit in his office and he \nwould say, how do we make things better for Vermont--never for him, it \nwas for Vermont.\n  I think of the changes in our State, and I remember my parents and \nMarcelle's parents talking about the amount of changes--changes for the \nbetter--and every time they would go back to one name: Phil Hoff.\n  I was so glad to hear Senator Sanders speak of Joan Brower Hoff and \ntheir wonderful daughters. She truly was Vermont's First Lady. She was \nalmost as recognizable--in fact, in many places, more recognizable than \nher husband--highly respected. People--men and women--wanted to be able \nto model their careers and their nature after her. I am glad the two \nare still together. They are still healthy, they are still the best of \nVermont, and I feel honored to be able to speak of them here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, Senator Leahy talked about the influence \nGovernor Hoff had on the State. Let me give some examples of what he \ndid.\n  Senator Leahy will remember in the early 1960s we had the situation \nin Vermont where the Vermont State House of Representatives, people \nwere represented by every town. I lived for a while in the town of \nStannard, VT, which has maybe 100, 150 people, and they had the same \nvote in the legislature as Burlington, VT, the largest city in the \nState, which has 40,000 people. Under Phil Hoff, what we moved to in \nthe State--and with the Supreme Court ruling dealing with proper \napportionment--was person, one vote, so the house began to reflect the \npopulation locations of the State and not just every town.\n  In addition to that, when Phil Hoff was Governor of the State, he \nsuccessfully insisted on repealing Vermont's poll tax. Now we think \nthat is ancient history. What the poll tax said is that in order to \nvote, you have to pay a certain amount of money, which, obviously, is \ndiscriminatory to lower income people. That was repealed under Hoff's \nera as Governor.\n  He understood and his wife understood the importance of education. \nWhat Governor Hoff did was he quadrupled State aid to public schools \nand organized the three State teachers colleges into a new, revitalized \nState college system that better met the needs of Vermont's students. \nThat system endures to this day. We have a very strong system of State \ncolleges in Vermont, and that began under the Hoff era.\n  Under Governor Hoff's leadership, Vermont's judicial system was \nmodernized. Always a path breaker and an advocate for justice, Phil \nHoff led the way to Vermont becoming one of the first States in the \ncountry to abolish the death penalty.\n  No aspect of State government was beneath his notice, and he took \nVermont forward in many ways, including terminating the outdated \n``overseer of the poor'' system. That was something he changed as well. \nHe established the Vermont district court State court system, the \nJudicial Nominating Board, the Vermont State Housing Authority, and the \nVermont Student Assistance Corporation--a program which today plays a \nvery vital role in making sure young people in Vermont can get a \ncollege education.\n  What was also--and Senator Leahy knows this better than I--rather \nextraordinary about Phil Hoff is he understood that positive change \ncould not take place in Vermont unless change was taking place \nthroughout the country. In that area, being the Governor of one of the \nsmallest States in the country, this man showed extraordinary courage, \nand he said: Do you know what. That war in Vietnam is not good for \nVermont, it is not good for America.\n  He was one of the first public officials, as I recall, I say to \nSenator Leahy, to speak out. That took a whole lot of courage, to speak \nout against the war in Vietnam. He took it a step further. Here you had \nLyndon Johnson at that time--who I think will go down in history, \nexcept for that war in Vietnam, as one of our great Presidents--and \nPhil Hoff said: Do you know what. Maybe we need a change in the White \nHouse, and maybe we should be looking at somebody like Bobby Kennedy \nrather than Lyndon Johnson.\n  But, I say to Senator Leahy, I know he was involved in some of that \nas a young man.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I was. And I recall, when Phil Hoff came out against the \nwar in Vietnam--and he was in the minority on that--no member of the \nVermont congressional delegation had voted against the war in Vietnam. \nThey voted for all the increases in it. He was in some ways a lonely \nvoice, but he did come out against it. It angered Lyndon Johnson, who \nwas then President. But then he supported Robert Kennedy, as did I.\n  I remember the two of us meeting Senator Edward Kennedy--one of the \nPresiding Officer's predecessors--on the runway at the airport in \nBurlington, VT. He and Governor Hoff and myself and others were going \nto speak to a group on behalf of Robert Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy. I \nremember the look of sorrow on Governor Hoff's face as he stood as one \nof the honorary pallbearers at Robert Kennedy's funeral. But even after \nthat, he continued to push to make Vermont a better State.\n  I think--and I realize we have others waiting for the floor--but I \njust want to say again that Vermont is a wonderful State. It is a \nbeautiful State. It is a progressive State. As Senator Sanders and I \nhave both said, it would not be what it is today were it not for Phil \nHoff. We have all tried to follow in those footsteps, but he lit the \nway. That sometimes is an overused expression, but in this case I think \nevery historian would agree with us.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me concur with Senator Leahy. We take this \nopportunity to wish Governor Hoff a very happy 90th birthday. Jane and \nI see him quite often, and we just bumped into Phil and Joan recently. \nWe look forward to continuing that relationship.\n  The bottom line is, as Senator Leahy said, we are very proud that \nVermont is a leader in so many areas in terms of social justice, in \nterms of environmental sanity, in terms of protecting the needs of \nordinary people. That transformation and those efforts did not come \nabout by accident, and certainly one of the great leaders in moving us \nin that direction was the man we honor today; that is, Philip H. Hoff. \nWe wish him the very, very best in the years to come.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. We wish a happy birthday to a true giant of our State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANDERS. With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                        Protecting Our Children\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a bill I have \nintroduced. It is S. 1596. It is the Protecting Students from Sexual \nand Violent Predators Act.\n  I wish to thank my cosponsors on this legislation. It is a bipartisan \nbill. Senator Joe Manchin and I have introduced this together, and I am \ngrateful to Senators McConnell and Inhofe for their cosponsorship.\n  This bill was inspired by a terrible story. It is the story of Jeremy \nBell, and it begins at a school in Delaware County, PA. One of the \nschoolteachers molested several boys and raped one of them. Prosecutors \ndecided they did not have enough evidence to bring a case, but the \nschool was aware of what happened, so they dismissed the teacher for \nthis outrageous behavior. But then, amazingly, the school also decided \nthat they would help this teacher get another job at another school so \nthey could be rid of him. And they did exactly that, in fact, passing \nalong a letter of recommendation, helping this predator get a job at a \nschool in West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S4608]]\n\n  The story ends in 1997 when that teacher--by then a school \nprincipal--raped and murdered 12-year-old Jeremy Bell in West Virginia. \nJustice finally caught up with that teacher, and he is now in jail \nserving a life sentence for the murder, but for Jeremy Bell that \njustice came too late.\n  The very sad truth is that Jeremy Bell is not alone. Every day seems \nto bring a new report of a child robbed of his or her innocence by \nsomeone they should have been able to trust, someone their parents told \nthem they should obey. The numbers are absolutely terrifying, and, \nworse still, the numbers are growing.\n  On April 10 of this year, I came to this floor and spoke about the \nneed to pass this legislation to protect our kids from predators in the \nclassroom. I explained then that since January 1 of this year, at that \npoint, 130 teachers had been arrested across America for sexual \nmisconduct with children. Well, here we are just over 3 months later \nand that number has more than doubled. Since January 1 of this year, \n275 teachers have been arrested in America for sexual misconduct with \nchildren--275. These are teachers. That is more than one per day so far \nthis year.\n  Let's be honest. These are the ones whom we have caught. These are \nthe ones who have actually been arrested. These are the ones against \nwhom there is enough evidence that they have actually been arrested. \nHow many more are out there who have not been caught or for whom the \nevidence is not yet sufficiently clear?\n  The damage these predators are doing is enormous. It is far beyond \nwhat any numbers or my words can express. So I want to let some of the \nvictims speak for themselves.\n  I will tell you a brief story from Shannon. Shannon is from Nevada. \nShe was raped by a teacher. The teacher was later convicted of sexual \nassault and sentenced to life in prison. Nine years later, this is what \nShannon wrote:\n\n       When I was a senior in high school, Mr. Peterson approached \n     me and said I would need to go to night school if I wanted \n     enough credits to graduate on time. And, of course, he taught \n     one of those courses--a computer class. I was 17, and he \n     raped me 4 times over the course of a year. He said he would \n     fail me if I ever told. He also hit me and made threats \n     against me and my family. So I didn't. I held it in for a \n     year and a half.\n       In the end, 66 people offered to testify against Peterson. \n     His first victim dated back to the year I was born. Some of \n     those who spoke up were parents. Their daughters had \n     complained at the time, but nothing was done. That made me \n     very angry. It still does. I learned that a handful of \n     teachers, and two principals, knew about him. And his \n     teaching license had been revoked in Michigan years \n     before, and no one knew why.\n       I'm different [now] because of what happened. I have to \n     watch people all the time, analyze them. I can't be carefree. \n     Now I have a seven-year-old son and two daughters, ages three \n     and one. I will home-school my girls.\n\n  So when you see the number 275, remember Shannon, and remember that \nso far this year there are 275 others like her.\n  Gary of South Carolina is one of at least 29 boys abused by a teacher \nnamed Mr. Fisher over that teacher's 37-year career. Now the teacher is \nserving 20 years in prison. Two school principals were sued for \nallegedly covering up the abuse. Here is what Gary wrote about his \nexperience:\n\n       I was nine when it started. The abuse was frequent and \n     long-term--till I went to college. I knew there were others, \n     too, but until it all came out, I never knew how many.\n       You feel so guilty, so ashamed. It's frightening now to \n     look back and see how calculating Fisher was. I did \n     everything I could to get kicked out of school. I was in the \n     guidance counselor's office all the time. Finally, in tenth \n     grade, I got myself kicked out for cheating. By the time I \n     want to college, I was drinking all the time. I was terrified \n     to quit because then I'd have to feel. But I couldn't drink \n     and do school, so I entered rehab. I was 18. It took me a \n     year and a half, and I've been sober since.\n       My life is good now, for the first time. You can survive \n     it, but you have to deal with it. I always felt that what the \n     school did was far worse than what Fisher did. Fisher was \n     sick, an evil monster. But [the school] just calculated the \n     damage to its public relations. We kids were disposable, \n     which is a whole other category of evil.\n\n  So when you see the number 275, remember Gary, and remember that \nthere are 275 others like him that we know of already this year alone.\n  So what can we do? Well, my bill is a first step at addressing this \nproblem. It is called the Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent \nPredators Act. It is pretty simple, really. It requires a mandatory \nbackground check for existing and prospective employees, and it \nrequires that those checks be periodically repeated. There are five \nStates that do no background checks.\n  The second thing my bill would do is it would apply to all employees \nof a school--employees or contractors who have unsupervised access to \nchildren, not just teachers. So it would include bus drivers and \ncoaches. There are 12 States that currently do no checks at all on \ncontractors.\n  The legislation would also require more thorough background checks. \nIt would require that school districts check four major databases, both \nState and Federal. In my own State of Pennsylvania, for instance, if an \nemployee has been a resident of my State for 2 years or more, then only \nthe State database is checked. We just do not find out what this person \nmight have done in another State at a different time.\n  The legislation also would prohibit what has--tragically, it has \ndeveloped its own name; the name is ``passing the trash.'' This is the \nphenomenon of when a school knowingly recommends one of these predators \nto another school. As outrageous as that sounds, it actually happens. \nSome of these school and school districts so want to be rid of this \nproblem, this embarrassment, that they actually facilitate the person \nmoving on to some other place, where, of course, this predator just \nstrikes again against some other children. That would be banned under \nthis legislation.\n  In addition, there would be a prohibition against hiring these kinds \nof predators. Schools would not be able to hire a person who has ever \nbeen convicted of any violent or sexual crime against a child--if they \nwere convicted of a violent or sexual crime against a child. There are \na number of other felonies that would also preclude someone from being \nhired by a school if they are going to have access to children. Those \nwould include homicide, child abuse or neglect, crimes against \nchildren, including pornography, rape, or sexual assault, kidnapping.\n  In addition, a person who has been convicted within the past 5 years \nof a felony physical assault or battery or a felony drug-related \noffense--for 5 years from the time at which those crimes were \ncommitted, the person would be precluded from being hired in a \nposition, in a capacity where they would have supervisory \nresponsibility over children.\n  The enforcement for all of this is the only way the Federal \nGovernment can or should enforce policies such as this on school \ndistricts and schools; that is, if a State refuses to adopt these \nprovisions, then they would lose the funding they get from the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. That is one of many--but an \nimportant one--of the Federal Government funding streams for K-12 \neducation. No State wants to lose that source of funding, so I think \nStates would respond by adopting this very commonsense series of \nmeasures to protect their children.\n  I should say this is a bill with very broad support--so broad, in \nfact, that in the House the companion legislation passed unanimously. \nThere was not a single dissenting vote. They voted last year, and it \npassed unanimously.\n  We have bipartisan support here in the Senate, as I mentioned. I am \njoined by Senators Manchin, McConnell, and Inhofe.\n  It is supported by child advocacy groups. The National Children's \nAlliance, the Children's Defense Fund, and the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children all strongly support this legislation. I \nappreciate their support.\n  It is also supported by prosecutors--the Association of Prosecuting \nAttorneys, the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association. As a matter \nof fact, there were five district attorneys from southeastern \nPennsylvania alone, from different political parties, who wrote an op-\ned--a very persuasive op-ed--arguing why this bill is necessary based \non what they see every day in their jobs as prosecutors. I wish to \nthank those district attorneys. Risa Ferman from Montgomery County, \nSeth Williams from Philadelphia County, Tom Hogan from Chester County, \nDavid Heckler from Bucks County, and Jack Whelan from Delaware County \nall weighed in in favor of this legislation.\n\n[[Page S4609]]\n\n  Finally, there are teacher groups that support this as well. The \nAmerican Federation of Teachers supports this legislation. The \nPennsylvania School Boards Association does as well.\n  I do not think I would be going far out on a limb to suggest that \nprobably a huge majority of Americans support this legislation because \none thing I know for sure as a parent of three young kids--my kids are \n14, 12, and 4. There is one thing that is most important to most \nparents I know; that is, that our children be safe and secure. When you \nput your kid on a schoolbus, you expect that child will be in a safe \nenvironment all day long--on the ride to school, while they are in \nschool, and on the way back home. Frankly, we owe it to parents as well \nas to their children to do all we can to ensure that they do, in fact, \nhave a safe environment--as safe as we can make it--for their kids.\n  Two hundred seventy-five is the number. That is the number that \nshould give us all pause. It marks 275 tragedies that we know of \nalready this year--275 childhoods that are shattered, 275 families torn \nby grief, betrayal, self-blame. It marks a failure on our part. This \nkind of child abuse can be prevented. We have the tools to prevent it \nand to prevent so many children from harm.\n  Again, last year the House acted unanimously to protect children from \nthese sexual predators. This is something we could have done a long \ntime ago. We certainly should not be letting a new school year begin--\nreally in a matter of weeks--without doing something about this \nshameful number and without making sure this number does not continue \nto grow.\n  I hope we will be able to bring this bill to the Senate floor. I hope \nwe will have very broad bipartisan support for it here in the Senate, \nas we already have in the House.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Israeli Conflict\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to comment on the fact that I \nbelieve the body has come to agreement on my resolution, along with \nSenator Menendez, standing behind Israel in its conflict with Hamas.\n  As I speak, apparently there is a ground action going on by the \nIsraelis in Gaza. From my point of view, do what you have to do to \ndefend yourself.\n  I can't believe they have actually waited this long. I can't imagine \nwhat the American response would have been. If one rocket had come from \nour neighboring nations toward our country, we would not be so \nrestrained.\n  A two-state solution seems to be a very reasonable approach. The \nproblem is, as the Presiding Officer knows, Hamas doesn't recognize \nIsrael as an entity. It is pretty hard to negotiate with somebody who \ndoesn't recognize you exist and tells their schoolchildren you don't \nexist. The hatred that comes from Hamas in their schools toward Israel \nis not conducive to peace.\n  The resolution passed unanimously by the Senate the very night Israel \ndecided to use ground force I think is appropriate and very symbolic. \nThe Senate does not see a moral equivalency.\n  As Prime Minister Netanyahu said: Israel uses missiles, in \ncollaboration with the United States, to produce the technology called \nIron Dome to defend civilians. Hamas uses civilians to cover their \nmissile program, making human shields of their own people.\n  That says all we need to know.\n  So I am pleased that in a bipartisan fashion, unanimous in nature, \nthe U.S. Senate is on record supporting the State of Israel in this \nconflict, understanding their justification for defending themselves \nand that there is no moral equivalency here.\n  To my Israeli friends and allies, we wish you well. I expect that you \nwill continue to defend yourselves against a terrorist organization.\n  To the Palestinians who have formed a unity government, you need to \nbreak away from Hamas. There will never be peace until you marginalize \nthe terrorist organization called Hamas, until you reject what they \nstand for and the way they have behaved.\n  Finally, to those who wish for Israel to give up land and withdraw \nfrom territories, please remember, that is exactly what Israel did in \nGaza. They withdrew all their forces, and what have they gotten in \nreturn? Tens of thousands of rockets.\n  So to those who are pushing a peace plan in the Middle East between \nthe Palestinians and the Israelis, I hope you remember security for \nIsrael has to be the centerpiece of any peace deal. How can you obtain \npeace when one of the members of the Palestinian Government--Hamas--has \nfired thousands of rockets, caring less where they fall? They couldn't \ncare less if it falls on a kindergarten or a military base. They just \ncare to kill Israelis. Israelis have killed civilians, but they go the \nextra mile in time of war and conflict to minimize casualties. They \ntell them: We are going to bomb you. They pass out leaflets. They tell \npeople to leave. That says a lot about the Israelis.\n  So the Senate is in Israel's camp in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I wish to continue on this topic.\n  In the last few hours, we have now had word of the potential for \nground operations occurring in Gaza.\n  This is addressed to those who are watching Florida or will watch \nthis message in Florida about what has happened.\n  I know the world has become a messy place over the last few hours. We \nhave an incident that occurred over the skies of Ukraine with the \nMalaysian aircraft, and we don't know all the details of what had \noccurred there. We should reserve judgment until we do. Suffice it to \nsay, that may further complicate our view of the world in this Chamber \nover the next few weeks, but let me address for a moment what is \nhappening in the Middle East.\n  When I was elected to the Senate, a few days later, the first trip I \ntook was to Israel. It was a country I had long admired, with strong \nlinks to the United States and to Florida in particular. In fact, the \ncurrent Israeli Ambassador to the United States is from Florida. His \nbrother was the mayor of Miami Beach. So there are strong links between \nFlorida and Israel. I was amazed on that trip by how far that country \nhas come--a nation that doesn't have oil or the kind of massive \nresources from an energy perspective that other countries in the region \ndo, yet a country that is flourishing because of their investment in \ntechnology and innovation.\n  There is a book called ``Start-Up Nation,'' which chronicles the \namazing miracle of Israel and what they have achieved. The one thing \nthat strikes you about Israel as you fly over is how narrow it is. At \nits narrowest point, it is only 9 miles wide.\n  This is a country that was forged, by the way, in the aftermath of \nthe Holocaust, with the notion that never again will the Jewish people \nnot have a place to go in the world to call their own. That still \nremains the guiding principle behind the country and behind its defense \nforces, and we should view it within that context as we view what is \noccurring now in that region and part of the world.\n  Literally, Israel is surrounded by enemies. Certainly they have had \nthe stability in the last two decades of peace agreements with Jordan \nand Egypt. But look everywhere around Israel and you see them \nsurrounded by people who are intent on their destruction. We know that \nis the case in Gaza. We know that is the case in Samaria and Judea or \nwhat is commonly called the West Bank by some. We know that is the case \nwith Assad and Syria, and many of the elements fighting within Syria. \nWe know that is the case with Hezbollah and Lebanon. We know that is \nthe case with Iran and its weapons programs and its long-term \nambitions. This is a country surrounded by elements that want to \ndestroy it.\n  It is in that context, by the way, that this government in Israel was \ninvolved\n\n[[Page S4610]]\n\nin an intensive process of negotiation brokered and led by the United \nStates with the Palestinian President Abbas regarding a potential peace \ndeal, some way of forging a solution, an answer to the conundrum of \nwhat to do with Palestinian populations that would allow them to live \npeacefully, coexist side by side with a Jewish State. They entered into \nthis conversation despite the fact that it was never clear that Abbas \nwas able or had the power or the influence to make the sort of tough \ndecisions that were going to be required for peace.\n\n  In fact, they entered into the negotiation knowing they would not \neven speak for all Palestinians, given the fact that Hamas controlled \nthe Gaza Strip. They entered into this negotiation nonetheless. They \nentered into this negotiation despite the chaos surrounding them in \nLebanon and Syria. Despite the fact that Iran continues to pursue \nnuclear weapons to destroy Israel, potentially, they entered into these \nnegotiations. Because I say this to you unequivocally: I know of no \nnation on Earth that wants peace more than Israel. So they entered into \nthese negotiations.\n  And what happened? What happens is what always happens with these \nnegotiations. What happened is Abbas eventually withdrew. He once again \ntook himself out of the talks and he tried once again to seek \nmembership--Palestinian membership--into all these sorts of national \norganisms of the state, as a country of its own, knowing that was a \ndeal breaker and knowing if that occurred, there could be no peace \nnegotiation. That is the route he chose, nonetheless.\n  But then he did what I believe has triggered this latest round of \nviolence against Israel, and that is deciding to form a power-sharing \ngovernment with a terrorist group by the name of Hamas that to this day \ncontinues to deny Israel's right to even exist.\n  I want you to think about that for a moment. How could you possibly \never enter into a peace agreement with an organization with its very \npurpose being your destruction? And yet that is what Israel was being \nasked to do.\n  Tragically, within several weeks of that new government being formed, \nthree teenagers, including an American citizen, were kidnapped and they \nwere murdered. Then on July 7 Hamas once again started raining down \nrockets on Israel. Today more than 1,300 of them have been fired. The \ngood news is that Israel has invested heavily in an air defense system \nwhich I was able to see during my second visit to Israel in the early \npart of 2013. But 1,300 rockets is an extraordinary number, and that is \nwhat Israel has faced.\n  As American policymakers, you ask what is our interest there? And I \nthink it begins with the unique relationship that exists between the \nUnited States and Israel. It is the only vibrant democracy in that part \nof the world. Its alliance with the United States is unquestionable, \nnot just in international forums but all over this planet. Israel is \nconsistently on America's side time and again, in every one of our \nchallenges. The cooperation between our countries is extraordinary, not \nto mention that Israel as a nation stands for everything that we as a \nnation believe in: freedom, the ability to speak out. They have a \nvibrant democratic process. Anyone who is familiar with Israeli \npolitics knows how vibrant their democracy is and how much they engage \nin open and public debate in bringing their government together to \ngovern the country. So we have this extraordinary alliance with Israel \nof incredible importance, and that is why we care. That is the \npolitical reason.\n  There is a moral reason behind it, and that is the right of the \nJewish people to have a country they can live in peacefully; that truly \nnever again will we face a time when Jews have nowhere to go. This is \nthe commitment we have made to Israel and that we must keep.\n  I must say that I am and have been deeply troubled at the attitude \nthis administration has adopted toward Israel. Let me be clear. I don't \ncome here today to create this into a partisan issue. I don't want it \nto be a partisan issue. In fact, one of the great successes of American \nforeign policy with Israel has been the strong bipartisan support that \nIsrael enjoys in the House and the Senate from almost every American \nPresident since Israel's founding at the conclusion of World War II.\n  But I am concerned about the position this administration is taking. \nI was concerned about the amount of pressure the Secretary of State was \nplacing on the Israelis to enter into a negotiation with the \nPalestinian Authority which didn't have the authority or power to reach \na peace agreement they could possibly enforce much less deliver on. I \nwas concerned that pressure was being put on them at a time when Israel \nfaced so many other challenges, No. 1 being the ambitions that Iran has \nto acquire nuclear weapons and long-range rockets that could strike \nIsrael and eventually the mainland of the United States.\n  I think it is safe to say the relationship of the Israeli Government \nhas never been worse toward an American President for more than 2 \ndecades. And that has an impact on this region, and unfortunately it \nhas had an impact here.\n  I have also been concerned about some of this moral equivalence that \nis going on in the press and some of the email I have been getting and \nsome of the public statements I am hearing some make in some \ncorridors--not in the Senate but some other places. The idea that both \nsides are to blame is an interesting concept, but it isn't true.\n  It is tragic, unfortunately, that civilians are dying in Gaza, but \nthe reasons why civilians are dying is 100 percent Hamas's fault. This \nis an organization that puts rockets and military installations right \nnext to nurseries and hospitals and civilian population centers. Why \nwould they do that? Do you know why they do that? They do that because \nthey know when they launch a rocket Israel will respond by hitting that \nrocket launcher, and when that rocket launcher is destroyed, so are the \nareas around it. Then they can get the cameras to go in there and say: \n``Look what Israel did. They wiped out a nursery or apartment \nbuilding.''\n  They do that on purpose. They know exactly what they are doing. They \nare doing it so they can get the kind of coverage that unfortunately \neven some American press outlets are buying into now.\n  Here is the bottom line--and Senator Graham was alluding to this a \nmoment ago. Israel does extraordinary things with regard to this. They \ndrop leaflets into population centers warning: We are going to have to \nconduct a military operation in your region. Please evacuate. Please go \nelsewhere where you will be safe.\n  Hamas doesn't do that. In fact, Hamas deliberately targets population \ncenters to terrorize the people of Israel, and we should condemn it for \nwhat it is. There is no moral equivalency.\n  So now the situation has continued to spiral out of control and it \nhas reached a point where the news today now is that Israel has begun \nto conduct ground operations and these ground operations they are \nconducting as early as this morning have to do with a tunnel network in \nGaza which was used by Hamas to try to infiltrate terrorists through \nthose tunnels into Israel to conduct terrorist activity and kill \nIsraelis.\n\n  Put yourself in the position of this country, small and \ngeographically isolated, surrounded by terrorist groups and some \nunfriendly countries, threatened by the prospect of an Iranian nuclear \nweapon and being hit by 1,300 rockets in just the last week. They have \nno choice but to defend themselves using all the power at their \ndisposal. They have no choice. Not only should no one here be \ncriticizing that, but we should be supporting it and aligning ourselves \n100 percent on their side, because what they are fighting for here is \nnot some dispute over borders. This is not some geopolitical dispute \nabout who owns what territory. Israel is fighting for its very \nsurvival.\n  On the other side of this conflict is a terrorist organization bent \non their destruction. On the other side of this conflict is a terrorist \norganization in Hamas and, truth be told, the Palestinian Authority, \nwhose schools teach children not just to hate Israel but to hate Jews.\n  How could you possibly say you are for peace when your schools are \nactively teaching your children to hate another people? That is what is \non the other side of this conflict.\n  And so Israel has no choice. They are fighting for their very \nsurvival, and I\n\n[[Page S4611]]\n\nthink that now more than ever what they need from this country is a \nPresident and a U.S. Government that aligns itself squarely on their \nside--no doubletalk, no fancy diplomatic language that you could read \nbetween the lines on--a very clear statement: In this conflict we are \non Israel's side and we will support them with anything they need to \nensure their stability and their survival--very clear language that \nmakes it unequivocal.\n  Hamas is a terrorist organization, not a legitimate representative of \nthe aspirations of the Palestinian people, but a terrorist organization \ndesigned for the very purpose of destroying the Jewish state. We need \nto make these things abundantly clear, because otherwise we are going \nto see more of this in the years to come.\n  If there is any daylight between the United States and Israel, it \nemboldens Israel's enemies. I would say as bad as this situation is--\nand it is terrible--the biggest danger facing Israel today is not just \n1,300 rockets that have come over from Hamas, it is the threat of a \nnuclear Iran. It is interesting that while we are having this \nconversation here today about the attack Israel is under, this \nadministration is trying to get an extension of these talks with the \nIranian regime.\n  I hope you clearly understand. I said this before and I want to come \nhere and reiterate: If Iran is allowed to retain the ability of \nenriching uranium or reprocessing plutonium, they will build a nuclear \nweapon with that capacity. Let me put it in plain English. If you let \nthem keep the machines they use to reprocess and enrich, they may not \nreprocess and enrich to weapons grade right away, but the fact they \nhave the ability to do it I guarantee you eventually means they will.\n  Do you know how I know that? One reason is all you have to do is hear \nthe speeches they give. The second reason why we know that is the other \nissue no one is talking about: Iran isn't just spinning centrifuges, \nthey are not just enriching uranium and reprocessing plutonium. Iran is \nbuilding rockets--long-range rockets, intercontinental missiles. And \nthere is only one purpose for those missiles. The only purpose they \nhave is to put a warhead on them with a nuclear payload. That is the \nonly reason why you build missiles such as that. These types of \nmissiles are not built to deliver a conventional weapon; they are built \nfor purposes of a nuclear capability.\n  Additionally, these rockets they want to build aren't just rockets \nthat can reach Jerusalem or Tel Aviv. These are rockets that can reach \nWashington, DC, and my hometown of Miami, and New York City, and the \nmainland of the United States. So if they build these missiles with \nthat range and they develop the ability to enrich and reprocess, they \nare one step away, a half step away from becoming a nuclear power, able \nto hold our country hostage and to carry out their ambitions of \ndestroying Israel. That is the single greatest threat. As great as this \nthreat is with Hamas, and needs to be dealt with decisively, that is \nthe single greatest security threat facing Israel.\n  It is ironic to me that even as we are focused on this issue and what \nis happening, this administration is off in Geneva trying to cut a deal \nwith Iran that allows them to retain an acknowledged right to enrich \nand reprocess, and that is going to prove to be disastrous.\n  It is my opinion those negotiations will lead to nothing, because \nIran has entered into these negotiations believing they entered from a \nposition of strength. They believe this President so badly wants a deal \nthat they don't have to give on anything. By the way, I don't know how \nyou do a meaningful deal with Iran on nuclear weapons that doesn't \ninvolve a conversation about these long-range rockets. Yet that is \nexactly what they are doing with little to no consultation with the \nSenate or any other policymakers.\n\n  I came to the floor to reiterate my personal support for Israel but \nto also reiterate how strongly I believe virtually every Member of this \nbody supports the State of Israel, supports Israel's right to defend \nitself, supports the United States alliance with Israel, supports \neverything we must and can do to help Israel defend herself. I think \nthat is an important message to send out.\n  Finally, I would say this: I would ask those who have watched this \nspeech or who will hear these words later to take the time over the \nnext few days to pray for Israel. They need our support there as well, \nthat God will provide her the safety and security of her people, now \nand in the years to come.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner).

Mr. President, today I wish to honor Charlie Seemann. Mr. \nSeemann is a talented folklorist who is dedicated to sharing western \narts and culture with communities throughout Nevada. At the end of the \nmonth, he will be retiring from his position as executive director of \nthe Western Folklife Center in Elko, NV.\n  After serving as the deputy director of the Country Music Foundation \nin Nashville, TN, for 12 years, and later working as the program \ndirector at the Fund for Folk Culture in Santa Fe, NM, Nevada was \nfortunate to have Mr. Seemann dedicate his efforts to sharing the \ncultural heritage of the American West with communities throughout our \ngreat State.\n  In 1998, Mr. Seemann brought his masters of folklife studies, decades \nof experience, and his accomplished musical knowledge to the Western \nFolklife\n\n[[Page S4612]]\n\nCenter in Nevada. During his 16-year tenure, he has strengthened the \narts throughout his community by investing in literary and scholarship \nprograms that have helped foster artistic development and brought new \nartists to Western Folklife's most notable event, the National Cowboy \nPoetry Gathering. Since 1986, Mr. Seemann participated in the annual \nNational Cowboy Poetry Gathering, formerly the Elko Cowboy Poetry \nGathering. This event was renamed in 2000, after Mr. Seemann worked \nwith Members of Congress to pass a United States Senate Resolution \ndesignating the poetry gathering in Elko as a nationally recognized \nevent.\n  Mr. Seeman is not only a strong advocate for western arts and \nculture, but he is a nationally renowned folklorist. Prior to coming to \nthe Western Folklife Center, he received the Western Heritage Wrangler \nAward from the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum, as well as \na Grammy nomination for the New World Records anthology Back in the \nSaddle Again: American Cowboy Songs. Mr. Seemann also received a \nWrangler Award in 2003, for his production work on a joint project \nbetween the Western Folklife Center and Smithsonian Folkways \nRecordings, Buck Ramsey: Hittin' the Trail. In 2006, Mr. Seeman was \nappointed by Congress to the Board of Trustees for the American \nFolklife Center.

The administration sent several Cabinet Secretaries and \nhigh-ranking appointees to brief all Senators last evening on the \ncrisis of the children on the border, and it appears they are getting \ntheir arms around addressing the problem of the children and the \nhumanitarian crisis on the border. However, it is the opinion of this \nSenator that they do not recognize the root cause of the problem. If \nthe administration would listen to their four-star general, the head of \nthe United States Southern Command, General Kelly, and the testimony he \nhas already given to the Armed Services Committee of what is the \nproblem, then we could get to the root cause of the problem and stop \nthese future humanitarian crises.\n  The problem simply is that we are not devoting the time and the \nresources--the money--to the interdiction of the big drug shipments \ncoming out of South America into Central America. They come in big \nshipments from Colombia through Venezuela by air or sea on the eastern \nside, from Colombia through Ecuador or originating in Ecuador out on \nthe western side, coming into three Central American countries--\nHonduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. As a result, their drug lords \nhave completely taken over those countries. As a result, the violence \nis the highest. Honduras is now the murder capital of the world. As a \nresult of that drug violence--and there is very little law and order--\nthe whole system is corrupted. For parents with children, it is logical \nthat they would want to send their children to a safer environment.\n  The administration has to address this issue with regard to going \nback to what we did so successfully in Plan Colombia--interdict the \ndrug traffic before it gets to those Central American countries because \nonce it does in the big shipments, they then break it down into smaller \npackages and it goes north.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/17/senate-section/article/S4612-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 CYPRUS\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 40th anniversary \nof Turkey's invasion of the island of Cyprus. Today, Cyprus remains a \ndivided island, with a third of the territory still occupied by Turkish \nforces.\n  I am proud to stand with the people of Cyprus and call for an \nimmediate end to the Turkish occupation of their country. On numerous \noccasions, United Nations resolutions have called for the respect of \nthe sovereignty and independence of the Republic of Cyprus and for an \nimmediate end to the Turkish occupation. The Republic of Cyprus \ncontinues to demonstrate full commitment to a peaceful process that \nwill reunify the island in accordance with these resolutions.\n  Over the past year, the Republic of Cyprus has taken significant \nsteps to lay the groundwork for peaceful negotiations, including \nproposals that would bring the two sides together to build confidence, \nstrengthen ties, and integrate the Turkish-Cypriot community. It is \nclear that the government and people of Cyprus stand ready to make the \nhard decisions needed to achieve peace.\n  Continued unrest that threatens the security and stability of the \nregion further underscores the importance of supporting the Republic of \nCyprus. A peaceful agreement that reunifies Cyprus would signal that \njust and fair resolutions can be achieved to end decades long \nconfrontations. We must continue to stand with them to fight for a fair \nand responsible agreement--one that safeguards basic freedoms and human \nrights for all Cypriots. During his visit in May of this year, Vice \nPresident Biden reiterated the need for Cyprus to be reunited.\n  The Republic of Cyprus is a strong and trusted friend of the United \nStates. I am proud of the strategic partnership we have developed over \nthe years. The Government of Cyprus currently hosts the joint mission \nresponsible for carrying out the removal and destruction of Syria's \nchemical weapons as well as providing maritime cooperation to \nfacilitate the process. The role of Cyprus demonstrates the island's \nimportant strategic location and critical international engagement \nefforts.\n  I am encouraged by renewed efforts to reach a comprehensive and fair \nsolution to reunify Cyprus. I urge the government of Turkey to \ncooperate with negotiations and I applaud the people of Cyprus for \ntheir steadfast commitment to securing a peaceful and prosperous \nfuture.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 40th anniversary \nof the division of Cyprus, which began on July 20, 1974.\n  On July 20, 1974, Turkey began its brutal invasion of the island of \nCyprus. By August 25, 1974, Turkish forces controlled more than one-\nthird of the island. To this day, Cyprus remains divided.\n  Forty years later, it is long past time for a permanent solution that \nresults in a free and unified Cyprus.\n  For decades, numerous rounds of negotiations have attempted to \nachieve a settlement. For too long, these efforts have failed to yield \nmeaningful progress. However, a new round of talks began in February of \nthis year. I am deeply hopeful that these negotiations will result in a \nfair and durable solution for all Cypriots.\n  A secure and stable Republic of Cyprus will strengthen the friendship \nand alliance between the United States and Cyprus. This relationship is \nbased on our long history and our mutual goals and values, including a \ncommitment to democracy, opportunity for all, and human rights.\n  Lasting peace in Cyprus will also reinforce Cyprus's role as a force \nfor peace, prosperity, and stability in the region.\n  That is why we must continue to do everything possible to help Cyprus \nresolve the decades-long illegal occupation of Northern Cyprus by \nTurkey.\n  As Vice President Biden said in May during his historic visit to \nCyprus, ``For the sake of the boys and girls born on this island who \ndeserve the possibility that only peace can bring, let's finally make \nhope and history rhyme together.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/17/senate-section/article/S4612-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4612-S4613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Sergeant Andrew R. Looney\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to remember the life and sacrifice \nof Army SGT Andrew R. Looney who died on June 21, 2010 serving our \nNation in Lar Sholtan Village, Afghanistan. Sergeant Looney and Army \nPFC David T. Miller died of wounds sustained when a suicide bomber \nattacked their traffic control checkpoint.\n  Andrew was born June 26, 1987 and grew up in Owasso, OK where he \ngraduated from Owasso High School in 2005.\n\n[[Page S4613]]\n\nHis father, Richard, said as a teen his son developed an avid interest \nin the military, and he was further inspired by military movies, in \nparticular the HBO series ``Band of Brothers.'' He grew up respecting \nauthority, was ``very compliable'' and took things in stride which made \nmilitary life a good fit for him. Therefore, it was a natural for him \nto enlist in the Army immediately after high school.\n  While deployed to Iraq in August 2007, he was severely wounded from \nan improvised explosive device and lost part of his right foot. After \nnearly a year of grueling rehabilitation and receiving a prosthetic at \nBrooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, TX he felt a deep sense of \npatriotism and a burning desire to serve and get back to where he felt \nhe was needed. In 2009 he was assigned to 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry \nRegiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, Air \nAssault, Fort Campbell, KY where on April 24, 2010 he deployed to \nAfghanistan.\n  The last time the family saw him in April 2009 ``he was looking \nforward to his assignment in Afghanistan,'' his father said. He thought \nhe ``was making a difference in the war, and was much needed.''\n  On June 28, 2010, with hundreds of friends in attendance, the family \nremembered Andrew at Owasso Public School's Mary Glass Performing Arts \nCenter. Before and throughout the service, hundreds of people lined the \nstreets holding up flags in solemn tribute to Andrew.\n  In 2012, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin signed Senate Bill 1320 \ndesignating the section of highway from 96th Street North to 106th \nStreet North as ``Sergeant Andrew R. Looney Memorial Highway.''\n  Andrew was posthumously promoted to Sergeant and was buried in \nArlington National Cemetery in Arlington, VA.\n  SGT Looney is survived by his parents Martha and Cleo Looney, sister \nJoanna, and brother, Steven who completed a tour in the Navy in \nDecember 2009.\n  Today we remember Army SGT Andrew R. Looney, a young man who loved \nhis family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.\n\n\n                       Specialist Jared C. Plunk\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to remember a true American hero, Army SPC \nJared C. Plunk who died on June 25, 2010 serving our Nation in Konar, \nAfghanistan. SPC Plunk and Army SPC Blair D. Thompson died of wounds \nsustained when insurgents attacked their unit using rocket-propelled \ngrenades and small-arms fire.\n  Jared was born August 26, 1982 in Liberal, KS. He grew up in the \nOklahoma Panhandle town of Turpin where he played football and \ngraduated high school in 2001 before taking college classes at Seward \nCounty Community College.\n  After relocating to Stillwater, OK, Jared and his brother Justin \nenlisted in the Army in August 2006 where they were bunkmates once \nagain in basic military training. After graduation, he married his wife \nLindsay and was assigned to 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment, 1st \nBrigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, Air Assault, Fort \nCampbell, KY.\n  Jared's funeral was held July 4, 2010 at the Turpin High School \nauditorium. Reverend Stan Lehnart remembered him saying ``He was not \nthe valedictorian of Turpin. He was not the star of the football team. \nHe was not the boy the girls wanted to sit next to at assemblies in \nthis auditorium. He is the one who gave his life for us to sit here \ntoday. He is the one that served his country. He is a hero.''\n  Interment was in the Liberal City Cemetery in Liberal, KS.\n  Preceded in death by his father, Glen ``Tiny'' Plunk, Jared is \nsurvived by his wife Lindsay, and two sons, 5-year-old Noah and baby \nKason, mother Glenda Willard and her husband Gerald of Maryville, TN, \nbrother Justin Plunk and his wife Caitlin of Norman, Oklahoma, brother \nJordan Plunk of Maryville, TN, sister Ranee Massoni and her husband \nJordon and their son Gavin of Maryville, TN, and sister Michelle Plunk \nof Maryville, TN.\n  Today we remember Army SPC Jared C. Plunk, a young man who loved his \nfamily and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.\n\n\n                 Army Staff Sergeant Travis M. Tompkins\n\n  Mr. President, I would also like to pay tribute to Army SSG Travis M. \nTompkins. Travis tragically died on March 16, 2011 of wounds sustained \nwhen insurgents attacked his unit with a rocket propelled grenade in \nLogar Province, Afghanistan.\n  Travis was born November 26, 1979 at Fort Sill, OK to Leland and \nVickie Tompkins. An active Boy Scout, he graduated from MacArthur High \nSchool in 1999 and enlisted in the Army in January 2000.\n  He was carrying on a tradition of service in his family that dates \nback to World War I. His father, Leland Tompkins served for more than \ntwo decades in an Army career that began during the Vietnam war and \nended in the closing days of the Cold War. ``He was a working \nsoldier,'' Leland said. ``He was a working leader. He cared about his \nsoldiers. He volunteered for everything.''\n  Moving frequently, Travis' assignments included Fort Sill, OK, Fort \nLeonardwood, MO, Fort Carson, CO, and Allied Joint Force Command in \nBrunssum, the Netherlands. He married Candice Brown on March 1, 2001 at \nFort Carson, CO and was quickly deployed to Saudi Arabia from September \n2001 to March 2002.\n  He arrived at Fort Polk, LA in June 2009 and was assigned to Brigade \nSpecial Troops Battalion, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain \nDivision. In October 2011 he deployed to Afghanistan with his unit as a \nmilitary policeman with the Brigade Special Troops Battalion, 4th \nBrigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division.\n  The couple had recently renewed their vows on their 10th anniversary \nwhen he was home on leave. ``It was the most perfect day,'' Candy \nwrote. ``He was a wonderful man, an excellent soldier and above all the \nbest father and husband and son and brother. I don't know how I'll ever \nlive without him. He was our world.''\n  A loving husband, father and son, Travis is survived by his wife \nCandice, two children, Madison and Gianna, parents Leland and Vickie \nTompkins of Lawton, OK, sister Jenny Meek and her husband Troy of \nFletcher, OK, niece and nephew Megan Meek and Dillon Meek, and his \nmother and father-in-law Wendy and Tim Brown of Lawton, OK.\n  His mother Vickie said that the main thing she wanted people who \nnever met him to know is what a great son he was to her and what a \nwonderful husband he was to his wife Candy, and their children.\n  Private family funeral services and interment with full military \nhonors were conducted at the Fort Sill National Cemetery, Elgin, OK. \nTravis was posthumously promoted to Staff Sergeant.\n  Today we remember Army SSG Travis M. Tompkins, a young man who loved \nhis family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/17/senate-section/article/S4613-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4613-S4614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO TRAVIS MOLLOHAN\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I want to thank a longtime and dedicated \nmember of my staff, Travis Mollohan, and to wish him the best on his \nnext professional venture--as director of State, corporate and \ncommunity relations for West Virginia University.\n  Raised by caring parents, Todd and Brenda Mollohan, in the geographic \nheart of our State, Braxton County, Travis learned from a young age the \nvalue of being involved in his community and the importance of being a \nteam player. As a proud Braxton County Eagle, Travis was a member of \nthe high school's award-winning band, speech and debate team and \npresident of the National Honor Society. Travis even volunteered for me \nduring my unsuccessful 1996 gubernatorial run.\n  Travis graduated from Braxton County High School in 2000 and then \nattended college at West Virginia University. There, he was treasurer \nof the WVU Young Democrats, head of the Student Government \nAssociation's campus safety committee and studied abroad at Dublin City \nUniversity in Ireland. Travis volunteered during my successful campaign \nfor Governor in 2004 and began working for me in 2005 as deputy \nscheduler.\n  From my first days as the 34th Governor of the great State of West \nVirginia, my top priority was to deliver excellent customer service to \nour fellow West Virginians. Travis was ideally suited for my team--he \nwas hardworking, smart and always there to lend a helping hand to those \nin need.\n\n[[Page S4614]]\n\n  Travis served my gubernatorial administration in various capacities, \nand whether it was through tragedy or triumph, Travis represented my \noffice with the utmost distinction.\n  After winning the unexpired term for the U.S. Senate in 2010, I asked \nTravis to help me bring our commonsense West Virginia values to \nWashington. He served as my director of scheduling in 2011, before \nreturning to my State operations as director of outreach. He did an \namazing job visiting the beautiful communities of the Mountain State \nand listening to our citizens' ideas and concerns.\n  Recently, I asked Travis to serve as my director of constituent \nservices. I was confident yet again that he could do the job because \nTravis truly understands what West Virginians need--someone who is \ncompassionate, thoughtful and knowledgeable about our state and the \ncomplexities of government.\n  Not a day passes that Travis is not dedicated to making West Virginia \na better place to live, work and raise a family.\n  I am sad to see Travis leave my office, but I am so excited for his \nfuture. He has accepted a position with his alma mater, West Virginia \nUniversity--our State's flagship university. No one is better suited \nfor the task ahead of him than Travis.\n  WVU has made a significant and positive impact on the Mountain State. \nIt offers a first-class learning experience and its graduates are \nspread around the world making a difference. But it is more than just \nan incredible institution of higher learning. WVU's programs and \nservices improve the lives of our citizens and our communities. In our \ndaily lives, we can always do more, and I am so proud to know that \nTravis will be helping WVU reach the next level.\n  It is very difficult to imagine my office without Travis, but I know \nhe will bring the same level of excitement, energy, and dedication to \nhis new position as he brought to my office for more than 9 years. He \nis a responsive, critical thinker who truly cares about our State and \nfellow citizens. He is a West Virginian through and through and a proud \nMountaineer.\n  Travis has a bright future ahead of him, and I am pleased to say that \nvery soon he will be marrying the love of his life, Lindsey Bennett--\nfrom my hometown of Fairmont--who is a beautiful and intelligent young \nlady. I know that they will have a long and happy life together, and I \nam proud to say that they will always remain a part of the Manchin \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/17/senate-section/article/S4614-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4614-S4615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE FIGHT AGAINST ALS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, this Fourth of July marked the 75th \nanniversary of the muggy summer afternoon the great Henry Louis Gehrig \nbid farewell to baseball and introduced Americans to the illness that \nwould become known as Lou Gehrig's disease.\n  Lou Gehrig was the only surviving child of a sheet metal worker and a \nmaid--immigrants from Germany. Gehrig brought his family's humble work \nethic and steadfastness to his own job, playing first base for the New \nYork Yankees. His career was one that even a Red Sox fan can admire. On \nJune 1, 1925, 4 days before his 20th birthday, he pinch-hit for Pee Wee \nWanninger. On June 2, he broke into the starting lineup for good. He \nwould play every single regular and postseason Yankees game until May \n2, 1939--2,130 in a row.\n  ``The Iron Horse,'' as Gehrig was known, didn't just play a lot of \nbaseball, he played superb baseball. He racked up more than 2,700 hits, \nfor a lifetime batting average of .340 and close to 2,000 runs batted \nin. He had 493 career home runs. His No. 4 jersey, known as ``the Hard \nNumber'' by the American League pitchers who had to try to get the ball \npast him, was the first ever retired from Major League Baseball.\n  Despite his exceptional play, Gehrig was happy to leave the spotlight \nto teammate Babe Ruth, or later, Joe DiMaggio. ``I'm not a headline \nguy,'' he once said. ``As long as I was following Ruth to the plate, I \ncould have stood on my head and no one would have known the \ndifference.''\n  Lou Gehrig wasn't just great. He was always great. And his \ncompetitive spirit inspired Americans during the long years of the \nGreat Depression. But for some unknown reason, his numbers fell off \nsharply in the 1938 season. He had trouble gripping the bat, running, \neven walking and sitting. So on the first Tuesday of May 1939, eight \ngames into the season, the Yankee captain took his name off the lineup \ncard. ``I'm benching myself, Joe,'' he told manager Joe McCarthy, ``for \nthe good of the team.''\n  A series of tests at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, would reveal \nthat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a disease that causes nerve cells \nto stop working and die, was robbing Gehrig's swing of its fabled \npower.\n  ALS attacks neurons responsible for controlling voluntary muscles and \nprogresses rapidly. The brain and spinal cord lose the ability to send \nmessages to the muscles of the body, which weaken and atrophy. ALS can \nimpair speaking, swallowing, and breathing. As Gehrig biographer \nJonathan Eig explains, the progression of ALS is like ``shutting down \nthe body's functions one by one, like a night watchman switching off \nthe factory-floor lights.''\n  Yet on that humid 1939 Independence Day, between the legs of a \ndoubleheader against the Washington Senators, Lou Gehrig stood before a \ntangle of microphones at homeplate, bowed more by humility at the \nadulation of 62,000 Yankee fans, teammates, ball boys, and \ngroundskeepers than by his disease. Clenching his cap in two hands, the \nman sportswriter Jim Murray once described as a ``Gibraltar in cleats'' \nspoke 278 simple words that still echo in the ears of those of us not \neven born at the time they were uttered.\n  ``Fans,'' he began, ``for the past two weeks you have been reading \nabout a bad break I got. Yet today I consider myself the luckiest man \non the face of the earth.''\n  Although there is still much we have to learn about the causes of \nALS, we have made great strides in research and treatment since Lou \nGehrig took himself out of the game. With the help of Federal grants, \nadvances in genetic research have opened the door to insights about the \ndisease's hereditary nature, and drugs and assistive technology are \nimproving dramatically.\n  Kreg Palko of Barrington, RI, recently underwent a pioneering surgery \nto transplant millions of stem cells into his spinal cord, in hopes of \nundoing the paralyzing effects of his ALS. Until Kreg discovered he had \nALS just last year, he was always on the move--as a speedy defensive \nback at the Air Force Academy, Gulf War pilot--or active skier and \nsurfer. ALS has dampened his mobility but not his competitive spirit. \nKreg has volunteered for every clinical trial he can, and whether or \nnot these treatments heal Kreg, he and his wife Elizabeth know this \nresearch will benefit future patients.\n  The heart of the movement for a cure is the dedicated community of \nadvocates, researchers, physicians, and ALS patients. When members of \nthe Rhode Island chapter of the ALS Association visited my office this \nMay, they brought along baseball cards featuring Rhode Islanders living \nwith ALS. I saw in each face courage and dignity equal to Lou Gehrig's.\n  Senator Jacob Javits of New York, who worked for years after his 1979 \nALS diagnosis to improve long-term care and end-of-life policies, said:\n\n       Life does not stop with terminal illness. Only the patient \n     stops if he doesn't have the will to go forward with life.\n\n  Brian Dickinson refused to let ALS stop him. Editor of the Providence \nJournal's editorial page and a prize-winning columnist, he had an \nindomitable spirit. This was the man who once sang ``The Battle Hymn of \nthe Republic'' outside KGB headquarters on a tour of Soviet Moscow. And \nalthough ALS silenced his voice, Brian continued to tap out his column \nfor a number of years, with the help of a special computer in his home. \nHis profound, optimistic observations inspired his readers. ``I do \nbelieve,'' he once assured us, ``that the capacity for hope can help us \nmeet stiff challenges.''\n  Brian finally lost his battle with ALS in 2002. Last month, the ALS \nAssociation Rhode Island Chapter presented the Brian Dickinson Courage \nAward to Kreg Palko.\n  As we look back to the day Lou Gehrig reminded us he had ``an awful \nlot to live for,'' we should renew our\n\n[[Page S4615]]\n\nown will to go forward, with workmanlike determination, toward a cure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/17/senate-section/article/S4615-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              REMEMBERING HAROLD LEONARD ``LENNY'' KAUFER\n\n Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, today I recognize the life and \nlegacy of New Jerseyan Lenny Kaufer, who passed away on July 13 at the \nage of 92. Lenny was a dear friend and inspiration to me at the very \ndawn of my career in public service. He will be greatly missed by all \nwho knew him.\n  Harold Leonard Kaufer was born on August 25, 1921, in Newark, NJ, \nwhere he was raised with his 10 siblings in the Roseville neighborhood \nby his parents, Abraham and Gussie. As a son of Newark, a graduate of \nits schools, and a New Jersey small business owner, Lenny cared \npassionately about New Jersey and its future, cheering the revival of \nits largest city and keeping track of the news ``back home.'' He \nconsidered Newark and New Jersey to be at the very core of his \nidentity, and even though his retirement took him to California, he \nkept a book of historic photos of Newark on his bedside table until the \nday he died. Lenny never forgot where he came from.\n  I had the great fortune to get to know Lenny during my time on the \nNewark City Council and as mayor. I consider him to have been one of \nthe more gentle, kind souls I have ever met, and I appreciated his \nsound perspective and sage advice. I treasure the conversations we \nshared, as well as his undeterred love of Newark, and I will miss his \nwisdom.\n  Above all else, Lenny was devoted to his family. In 2012, he and his \nwife Shirley celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary, and they found \ngreat pleasure in the time spent with their daughter, three \ngrandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. Lenny always gave loved \nones a kiss for the road. As a man of faith, after moving to \nCalifornia, he maintained a membership at his temple in New Jersey, \njust so he could ensure that his family there would always have a home \nfor the High Holidays.\n  Lenny is mourned by his wife Shirley, his daughter Jacqueline, \nsisters Madeline and Helga, brother Irwin, three grandchildren, two \ngreat-grandchildren, a large extended family, and his many friends and \nneighbors. Lenny touched so many lives over his 92 years. He was an \nAmerican treasure. He demonstrated the truth that so often the biggest \nthing you can do in any day is a small act of kindness, decency, or \nlove.

M. OKRZESIK\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to honor and pay tribute to \nan exceptional leader, Col. Mariamne R. Okrzesik. After a lifetime of \nservice to our Nation, Colonel Okrzesik is retiring from the U.S. Air \nForce and her current position as Director of the Office of Legislative \nAffairs, United States Central Command, at MacDill Air Force Base in \nTampa, FL. On this occasion I believe it is fitting to recognize \nColonel Okrzesik's extraordinary dedication to duty and selfless \nservice to the United States of America.\n  Colonel Okrzesik has served at all levels in the Air Force. Her \ncareer began when she received her commission in 1986 through the \nReserve Officer Training Corps program at the University of Maryland. \nColonel Okrzesik's distinguished military service has taken her all \nover the world in defense of our Nation. Her career has included \nassignments and duties across a wide variety of command, intelligence, \nand staff positions throughout Europe, the Pacific, and the United \nStates. Colonel Okrzesik has served as an intelligence flight \ncommander; director of operations; executive officer; Major Command; \nHeadquarters Air Force and Secretary of the Air Force staff officer; \nsquadron commander; and Joint Combatant Command staff officer. Colonel \nOkrzesik has received numerous awards during her career, including the \nDefense Meritorious Service Medal, Air Force Meritorious Service Medal \nwith six oak leaf clusters, the Joint Commendation Medal, and Air Force \nCommendation Medal.\n  It is a pleasure to recognize Colonel Okrzesik's long and decorated \ncareer today and also the great benefit to the Nation she has provided \nas a senior leader for the U.S. Air Force and Department of Defense. \nColonel Okrzesik has always achieved excellence during her career. On \nbehalf of a grateful nation, I join my colleagues today in recognizing \nand commending Colonel Okrzesik for a lifetime of service to her \ncountry. For all she has given and continues to give to our country we \nare in her debt. As Colonel Okrzesik retires to Lothian, MD, we express \nour gratitude for her faithful and dedicated service and wish her our \nsincerest best wishes upon her retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/17/senate-section/article/S4615-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING JOHN V. EVANS\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I wish to honor the life of former \nIdaho Governor John Victor Evans. Governor Evans will be missed, but \nhis impact on Idaho and his legacy of dedicated service will endure.\n  Governor Evans and his family were Idaho pioneers. He was born and \nraised in Malad, ID. He attended Idaho State University, and like so \nmany of his generation, he went to serve as an infantryman in World War \nII. After returning from the war, he earned a degree in business and \neconomics from Stanford University.\n  John dedicated much of his life to public service. He served in the \nIdaho State Senate where he rose to the positions of majority leader \nand minority leader. He was mayor of Malad, the town he grew up in. In \n1974, he was elected Lieutenant Governor before his terms as Idaho's \n27th Governor from 1977 to 1987. He led Idaho through a number of \nchallenging times: the historic settlement of water rights, the closure \nof the Bunker Hill Mine, and the difficult economic times much of the \nNation saw in the 1980s. He also contributed to the national dialogue, \nhaving served in leadership positions in the Western Governors \nAssociation and National Governor's Association.\n  He was dedicated to community service and supported numerous efforts \nand organizations. He was a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nAmerican Legion, the Fraternal Order of Eagles, and the Rotary Club, \nand he was a Mason. He also held a number of leadership positions for \nthe Independent Community Bankers Association.\n  Following his retirement from public office in 1987, he became \npresident of D.L. Evans Bank in Burley, ID. During his tenure, the bank \ngrew from two banks to 21 banks, assisting thousands of Idaho residents \nand businesses.\n  Idahoans benefited greatly from his steady leadership in public \noffice and in business. He was known for his open-door policy, strong \nwork ethic and always taking the time to meet with fellow Idahoans. I \nextend my condolences to his wife Lola, brother Don, children, \ngrandchildren, great-grandchildren and many other family members and \nfriends. He will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/17/senate-section/article/S4615-4", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4615-S4616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WINNEBAGO COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and\n\n[[Page S4616]]\n\nresidents of Winnebago County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Winnebago County worth over $1.2 \nmillion and successfully acquired financial assistance from programs I \nhave fought hard to support, which have provided more than $28 million \nto the local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memory of working together has to be the \nsuccess that the county has had in securing over $9.4 million funds for \nthe Heartland Power Cooperative through programs I fought for at the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency and in past farm bills.\n  Among the highlights:\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Winnebago County has received $1,083,026 in Harkin grants.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency-\nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nWinnebago County has received over $8.2 million to remediate and \nprevent widespread destruction from natural disasters.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Winnebago County has received more than $19 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill loan and grant programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Winnebago \nCounty's fire departments have received over $623,971 for firefighter \nsafety and operations equipment.\n  Wellness and health care: Improving the health and wellness of all \nAmericans has been something I have been passionate about for decades. \nThat is why I fought to dramatically increase funding for disease \nprevention, innovative medical research, and a whole range of \ninitiatives to improve the health of individuals and families not only \nat the doctor's office but also in our communities, schools, and \nworkplaces. I am so proud that Americans have better access to clinical \npreventive services, nutritious food, smoke-free environments, safe \nplaces to engage in physical activity, and information to make healthy \ndecisions for themselves and their families. These efforts not only \nsave lives, they will also save money for generations to come thanks to \nthe prevention of costly chronic diseases, which account for a whopping \n75 percent of annual health care costs. I am pleased that Winnebago \nCounty has recognized this important issue by securing $120,000 for \ncommunity wellness activities.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, and the \nADA Amendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow \ncitizens with disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living and economic self-sufficiency. Nearly a quarter \ncentury since passage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in \ncommunities everywhere I go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed \ncaptioned television, but in the full participation of people with \ndisabilities in our society and economy, folks who at long last have \nthe opportunity to contribute their talents and to be fully included. \nThese changes have increased economic opportunities for all citizens of \nWinnebago County, both those with and without disabilities. And they \nmake us proud to be a part of a community and country that respects the \nworth and civil rights of all of our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Winnebago County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Winnebago \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa. I will always be profoundly grateful for the opportunity \nto serve the people of Iowa as their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/17/senate-section/article/S4616-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4616-S4617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ALLAMAKEE COUNTY, IOWA\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I wish to congratulate COL James \nWalker of Las Vegas, Nevada on his upcoming retirement from the Nevada \nArmy National Guard. I am proud to honor a Nevadan who has dedicated \nhis life to serving our country.\n  Born and raised in Las Vegas, NV, Colonel Walker's desire to serve \ncame when he was studying psychology in college. On scholarship for \nsoccer at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, he decided he wanted to \nenlist and become a combat medic. Upon joining the Army in 1979, \nColonel Walker rose through the ranks and eventually became the highest \nranking African-American Army National Guard officer in Nevada history. \nColonel Walker's career from private to colonel over the course of 35 \nyears is both commendable and admirable.\n  Throughout his career, Colonel Walker continued to pursue all of the \neducational training that the Army National Guard had to offer. With \nthe support of his wife Doris Colonel Walker decided to pursue three \nNCO professional development schools, earning him the prestigious NCO \nRibbon. Colonel Walker also participated in an Officer Candidate School \nat Clear Creek near Carson City and was a pioneering student in the \nNevada primary leadership development course, graduating at the top of \nhis class with honors. After his success there, he served as a training \nofficer for the next graduating class. His ability to give back to the \nNational Guard and his community was also exemplified during his 3 \nyears of teaching ROTC at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Upon his \nretirement from the National Guard, Colonel Walker plans to continue \nworking for National Security Technologies as the company's facility \nmanager at Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas.\n  I extend my deepest gratitude to Colonel Walker for his courageous \ncontributions to the United States of America and to freedom-loving \nnations around the world. His service to his country and his bravery \nand dedication earn him a place among the outstanding men and women who \nhave valiantly defended our Nation. As a member of the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I recognize that Congress has a responsibility not \nonly to honor these brave individuals who serve our Nation but also to \nensure they are cared for when they return home. I remain committed to \nupholding this promise for our veterans and servicemembers in Nevada \nand throughout the Nation.\n  Throughout his tenure, Colonel Walker has demonstrated \nprofessionalism, commitment to excellence, and dedication to the \nhighest standards of the Army National Guard. I am both humbled and \nhonored by his service and am proud to call him a fellow Nevadan. I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in recognizing COL James Walker for all of his \naccomplishments and wish him well in all of his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/17/senate-section/article/S4617-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4617-S4618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       USS ``NEVADA'' CENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 100th \nAnniversary of the commissioning of the USS Nevada Battleship. I am \nproud to be able to honor Nevada's namesake battleship today and all of \nthe Americans that served aboard her.\n  The anniversary of the battleship USS Nevada comes on the heels of \nNevada celebrating its 150th year of statehood. Through her years of \nservice, the Nevada suffered many blows and casualties, but remained \ndedicated to defending her country. The crew that served aboard her \nhave all earned a place among the outstanding men and women who have \nvaliantly defended our Nation. I, along with my fellow Nevadans, feel a \ngreat sense of pride that our State has been chosen as the namesake for \nthis ship that is arguably one of the greatest of our navy or of any \nNavy.\n  Launched on July 11, 1914, at the Fore River Shipbuilding Corporation \nin Quincy, MA, the USS Nevada was the most-advanced battleship in the \nU.S. Navy at the time. The USS Nevada saw both World Wars during her \ntime in active service. During the final months of World War I, she was \nbased in Bantry Bay, County Cork, Ireland, to ensure that the supply \nconvoys that were sailing to and from Great Britain were protected. In \nWorld War II, she was the\n\n[[Page S4618]]\n\nonly ship to get underway during the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor. \nAfter receiving one torpedo hit and several bomb hits, the USS Nevada \nhad to be beached, but after vigorous salvage work, repairs and \nimprovements, she was able to return to combat. Highly decorated for \nthe numerous battles that she was a part of, the USS Nevada was present \nat the Attu landings against the Japanese, fired against German \ndefenses during the Normandy landings, and supported operations in Iwo \nJima and Okinawa. After over 30 years of service, the USS Nevada was \ndeemed too old for retention and was assigned to serve as a target in \nthe atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll. The experience left her \nradioactive and badly damaged, leading to her being decommissioned and \neventually sunk during naval gunfire practice.\n  It is an honor to be able to commemorate this day on behalf of my \nfellow Nevadans as we remember those who have risked their lives to \ndefend freedom. Our Navy's commitment to this country, as well as their \ndedication to their families and communities, exemplified why the \nlegacy of all veterans must be preserved for generations to come. These \nheroes selflessly served not for recognition, but because it was the \nright thing to do. As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, I recognize that Congress has a responsibility not only to \nhonor these brave individuals, but to ensure they are cared for after \ntheir return home. I remain committed to upholding this promise for our \nveterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation.\n  I ask that we recognize the commissioning of the USS Nevada and honor \nall that sailed aboard her. I am both humbled and honored to \ncommemorate the brave men and women who dedicated their lives to \nserving our country and recognize them here today. May we never forget \nthe legacy of this great battleship and her gallant crew.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/17/senate-section/article/S4618-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING MATTIE STEPANEK\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the life \nof Matthew Joseph Thaddeus Stepanek, best known as Mattie, who passed \naway 10 years ago at the age of 13 from complications due to his rare \nform of muscular dystrophy. Though his death was a tragedy, his life \nwas a triumph. He was a gifted author and noted peacemaker. He took a \npersonal challenge and turned it into a tool of inspiration for all of \nus. Mattie once said, ``I want my message to live beyond me,'' and it \ndoes. His message of peace and hope has reached millions around the \nworld.\n  When Mattie was born in 1990 in Upper Marlboro, MD, doctors did not \nexpect him to live longer than 24 hours. Mattie suffered from the same \nrare form of muscular dystrophy as his mother, his two brothers, and \nsister. His siblings all died before the age of 4. Though the disease \neventually rendered him unable to walk and breathe on his own, Mattie \nwas a survivor. He began writing poetry at the age of 3. He wrote poems \nabout hope and peace. His philosophy was, ``Remember to play after \nevery storm,'' and he did.\n  Mattie believed that wishes can come true. He had three. The first \nwas to talk peace with Jimmy Carter. They spoke several times through \nemail correspondence. His second was to have his poems published in a \nbook. He wrote the most successful volumes of poetry in the last 30 \nyears and became a seven-time New York Times bestselling author. His \nlast was to see his poetry read on Oprah. He appeared on Oprah's show \nseveral times and became her good friend.\n  In September 2001, Mattie faced a setback. He was so sick that his \ndoctors warned a laugh could cause his damaged windpipe to collapse. \nBut that did not stop Mattie from a spectacular recovery. His doctors \ncould not explain his comeback from this brush with death, but Mattie \nknew what it was. It was hope, prayer, and just one in a series of \nmiracles in a miraculous life.\n  After the chaos and confusion of September 11 and the anthrax attacks \non the Capitol, I was very grief stricken. I saw a little boy on TV \nreading poetry, offering hope and healing. Mattie comforted me and \nlifted my spirits. I contacted him through his hospital and visited \nwith him and his mother in his home. In 2002, I presented Mattie with \nthe Children's Hope Medal of Honor. This medal is given to young heroes \nwho have shown valiant effort and courage in facing life's daily \nchallenges. No one was more deserving of that medal than Mattie \nStepanek.\n  Today we must also remember Mattie's mother Jeni Stepanek. Like \nMattie, she suffers physical challenges, but her heart, mind, and \nspirit remain strong. Without Jeni, Mattie would never have been able \nto share his beautiful, inspiring words with us. Mattie got his knack \nfor public speaking from his mom. She writes and talks about children \nwith disabilities. He also got his love of life from her. Jeni \ncontinues to inspire us all with her life, with Mattie's words, and \nmost importantly, a message of peace and hope.\n  In his poem entitled ``The Daily Gift,'' Mattie wrote:\n\n     You know what?\n     Tomorrow is a new day.\n     And today is a new day.\n     Actually, every day is a new day.\n     Thank you, God,\n     For all of these special and new days.\n\n  This is how Mattie Stepanek lived his life--with appreciation, \ninspiration, and energy. That is why I wish to say: Thank you, God, for \nblessing us with the gift of Mattie Stepanek and his heart of \nsongs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/17/senate-section/article/S4618-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/17/senate-section/article/S4618-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/17/senate-section/article/S4618-4", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:23 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 5016.

A bill to require breast density reporting to physicians and \npatients by facilities that perform mammograms, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, despite significant progress in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, this continues to be the \nsecond leading cause of cancer death for women, affecting one of every \n8 women in the United States.\n  Women with dense breast tissue may receive a normal mammogram report \neven if cancer is present. Dense breast tissue makes it harder to catch \ncancer early because it can obscure cancer in the mammogram image. This \nis why, for some women, additional screening is so important in \ncatching breast cancer early.\n  Despite this risk for cancer being missed, when women receive their \nmammogram report there is no Federal standard for them to be told if \nthey have dense tissue--even though this is already noted by the \nradiologist reading their mammogram.\n  This bill simply requires that women be informed if they have dense \ntissue, and that they may want to talk with their doctor if they have \nquestions and to find out if they might benefit from additional \nscreening. Early detection is the key to survival. Withholding this \nkind of information from women just doesn't make sense.\n  This bill sets a minimum Federal standard, so any state that wants to \nhave additional reporting requirements may do so. The bill also \nrequires the Department of Health and Human Services to focus on \nresearch regarding dense breast tissue, and better screening tools. \nEarly detection is the key to beating cancer and patients deserve \naccess to information that might just save their life.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Ayotte and me in supporting the \nBreast Density and Mammography Reporting Act. This commonsense bill \nincreases transparency in medicine by\n\n[[Page S4622]]\n\nimproving patients' access to their own health information and is \nsupported by organizations including the American Cancer Society Cancer \nAction Network, Are You Dense Advocacy, Breast Cancer Fund, and Susan \nG. Komen for the Cure.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOOKER (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Brown, Mr. \n        Franken, Mr. Whitehouse, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Tester, Mr. Wyden, \n        Ms. Warren, Ms. Baldwin, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Menendez, Mrs. \n        Gillibrand, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Kaine, \n        Mr. Markey, Mr. Begich, Mrs. Shaheen, and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 2625. A bill to establish certain duties for pharmacies to ensure \nprovision of Food and Drug Administration-approved contraception, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with nineteen of \nmy colleagues the Access to Birth Control Act of 2014, ABC Act, which \nprotects an individual's right to birth control by requiring pharmacies \nto fill a valid prescription for birth control in a timely manner.\n  Family planning is central to women's basic health care. Studies show \nthat 99 percent of women will use contraception at some point in their \nlives. Yet, despite the prevalence of contraceptive use, women in at \nleast 24 States across the country have reported incidents where \npharmacists have refused to fill prescriptions for birth control or \nprovide emergency contraception to individuals who do not require a \nprescription. Furthermore, 6 States permit refusals without patient \nprotections, such as requirements to refer or transfer prescriptions, \nand 7 States allow refusals but prohibit pharmacists from obstructing \npatient access to medication. It is Unbelievable to me that in 2014 we \nare still debating a woman's right to make responsible and personal \ndecisions about her own health.\n  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, insurance plans are required to \ncover preventive services, including birth control without a copay. \nCongress has an obligation to see that the intent of the Affordable \nCare Act to make preventive health care affordable and accessible comes \nto fruition and act to make sure that the pharmacy counter does not \ncome between women and timely access to contraception.\n  The ABC Act would ensure women's timely access to basic, preventative \nhealth care and ensures that women of age will not be denied birth \ncontrol or emergency contraception by their pharmacist. The bill \nrequires pharmacies to help a woman obtain medication by her preferred \nmethod if the requested product is not in stock and protects women from \nbeing intimidated when requesting contraception.\n  Denying contraception to women represents an erosion of a woman's \nright to access to contraception and a threat to women's access to \nbasic health care. Access is especially important for low-income women \nwho may lack the resources to find an alternative pharmacy in the \nappropriate time frame and women living in rural areas who may not have \nmultiple pharmacies near them. When women are seeking emergency \ncontraception, a pharmacist's denial can be an unsurmountable obstacle \nto access within the limited timeframe.\n  Under the ABC Act, if a requested product is not in stock, but the \npharmacy stocks other forms of contraception, the pharmacy must help \nthe woman obtain the medication without delay by the method of her \npreference: order, referral, or a transferred prescription. By placing \nthe burden on the pharmacy--not the individual pharmacist--the ABC Act \nstrikes a balance between the rights of individual pharmacists who \nmight have personal religious objections to contraception and the \nrights of women to receive their validly prescribed medication.\n  The idea that women would still have to fight for access to birth \ncontrol is astonishing. It should be clear: personal health care \ndecisions should be between women and their doctors. I'm proud to join \nwith my colleagues in putting forward this legislation that will \nprotect woman's right to access contraception throughout the country. A \nwoman's rights must not be dependent on her zip code or State.\n  I also want to acknowledge the late Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, who \nintroduced a version of this legislation 5 times in the past. I am \nproud to build on Senator Lautenberg's leadership in defending a \nwoman's right to make responsible and personal decisions about her own \nhealth.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to build support for \nthis bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Begich, and Ms. Hirono):\n  S. 2629. A bill to require employers to notify employees and \nprospective employees of exemptions from otherwise required coverage of \nhealth services under group health plans; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2629\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 507\n\n       Whereas August 7, 2014, marks the 225th anniversary of the \n     signing by President George Washington of the Act entitled \n     ``An Act for the establishment and support of lighthouses, \n     beacons, buoys, and public piers'', approved August 7, 1789 \n     (commonly known as the ``Lighthouse Act of 1789'') (1 Stat. \n     53, chapter 9);\n       Whereas in 1789, the ninth Act of the first Congress, \n     established a Federal role in the support, maintenance, and \n     repair of all lighthouses, beacon buoys, and public piers \n     necessary for safe navigation, commissioned the first Federal \n     lighthouse, and represented the first public works act in the \n     young United States;\n       Whereas the establishment of the United States system of \n     navigational aids set the United States on a path to the \n     forefront of international maritime prominence and \n     established lighthouses that played an integral role in the \n     rich maritime history of the United States, as that history \n     spread from the Atlantic coast through the Great Lakes and \n     the Gulf coast and Pacific States;\n       Whereas those iconic structures, standing at the margins of \n     land and water, sometimes for as long as 2 centuries, have \n     symbolized safety, security, heroism, duty, and faithfulness;\n       Whereas architects, designers, engineers, builders, and \n     keepers devoted, and in some cases jeopardized, their lives \n     for the safety of others during centuries of light tending by \n     the United States Lighthouse Service and the United States \n     Coast Guard;\n       Whereas the automation of the light system exposed the \n     historic lighthouse towers to the ravages of time and \n     vandalism and yet, at the same time, opened an opportunity \n     for citizen involvement in efforts to save and restore those \n     beacons that mark the evolving maritime history of the United \n     States and its coastal communities;\n       Whereas the national lighthouse preservation movement has \n     gained momentum over the past half century and is making \n     major contributions to the preservation of maritime history \n     and heritage and, through the development and enhancement of \n     cultural tourism, to the economies of coastal communities in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act \n     of 2000 (16 U.S.C. 470w-7 et seq.), enacted on October 24, \n     2000, with the aid of the lighthouse preservation community, \n     provides an effective process administered by the General \n     Services Administration and the National Park Service for \n     transferring lighthouses to the best possible stewardship \n     groups;\n       Whereas 2014 is the 200th anniversary of the \n     August 24, 1814, rescue of the original copies of the \n     Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, \n     the United States Constitution, and many irreplaceable \n     original government documents and books from destruction when \n     the British burned Washington, D.C. during the War of 1812 by \n     Stephen Pleasonton, who later served as General \n     Superintendent of Lighthouses for 32 years;\n       Whereas 2014 is also the 75th anniversary of \n     when Congress dissolved the United States Lighthouse Service \n     and turned all of its duties over to the United States Coast \n     Guard;\n       Whereas although the United States Coast Guard was created \n     in 1915 with the merger of the United States Life Saving \n     Service and the United States Revenue Marine Service, the \n     United States Coast Guard uses the United States Revenue \n     Marine founding date of 1790 as its anniversary year, and \n     thus, August 7, 2014, is also the 225th anniversary of the \n     United States Coast Guard;\n       Whereas 2014 also marks the 250th anniversary of the Sandy \n     Hook Lighthouse in New Jersey, the oldest standing lighthouse \n     tower in the United States, which was built before the United \n     States was a country and was still part of the British \n     colonies;\n       Whereas for the past several decades, regional and national \n     groups have formed within the lighthouse preservation \n     community to promote lighthouse heritage through research, \n     education, tourism, and publications;\n       Whereas despite progress, many lighthouses in the United \n     States remain threatened by erosion, neglect, vandalism, and \n     deterioration by the elements; and\n       Whereas the many completed, ongoing, or planned private and \n     public efforts to preserve lighthouses demonstrate the public \n     support for those historic structures: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates August 7, 2014, as ``National Lighthouse and \n     Lighthouse Preservation Day'';\n       (2) encourages lighthouse grounds to be opened to the \n     general public to the extent feasible;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 508.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 508) commemorating the centennial \n     anniversary of the establishment of the Congressional \n     Research Service.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this Wednesday--July 16, 2014--marks the \ncentennial of the Congressional Research Service, CRS. On this exact \ndate 100 years ago, our oldest legislative support agency was created. \nBut the idea for such an organization to provide objective information \nand analysis to legislators goes back to the start of our Republic. As \nThomas Jefferson said 200 years ago, ``There is, in fact, no subject to \nwhich a member of Congress may not have occasion to refer.'' \nJefferson's view gained adherents over time, especially at the State \nlevel first and then during the progressive era. Two Members of \nCongress during that early 1900s era--Senator Robert\n\n[[Page S4627]]\n\nLaFollette and Representative John Nelson, both of Wisconsin--both \nchampioned legislation that authorized the Librarian of Congress to \nestablish a legislative reference service composed of ``competent \npersons to prepare such indexes, digests and compilations of law as may \nbe required for Congress and other official use.'' President Woodrow \nWilson signed the legislation--the fiscal year 1915 appropriations bill \nfor the Library of Congress--into law on July 16, 1914. Librarian of \nCongress Herbert Putnam established the Legislative Reference Service, \nLRS, in the Library of Congress by administrative order on July 18, \n1914. The reference service's location in the Library of Congress--the \nlibrary both of Congress and the American people--provided researchers \nthen and now with a treasure trove of books, materials, and collections \nof various sorts to answer and address the questions and inquiries that \nemanate from the legislative branch. The LRS was renamed the CRS in \n1970.\n  Today, the responsibilities and roles of CRS have grown enormously. \nTo meet the hundreds of thousands of requests made annually by Members \nand staff of the legislative branch, CRS employs over 600 total staff. \nAmong the occupations represented at CRS are reference librarians, \nlawyers, political scientists, economists, budget analysts, scientists, \nengineers, and public administrators. The titles of its five \ninterdisciplinary research divisions underscore the wide range of \nexpertise housed in CRS: American Law; Domestic Social Policy; Foreign \nAffairs, Defense & Trade; Government & Finance; and Resources, Science \n& Industry. In addition, CRS has a Knowledge Services Group made up of \nresearch and information specialists who provide support services to \nCRS analysts and attorneys. In fiscal year 2013, Members and committees \nreceived information and analysis from CRS in more than 636,000 \nresponses that took the form of 67,000 requests for custom analysis and \nresearch, 9,000 congressional participations in 350 seminars, and over \nhalf a million instances of Web site services.\n  At the heart of CRS's charter is that it serves both the majority and \nminority parties and Members of Congress elected as Independents or \nwith a third-party affiliation. This bedrock nonpartisan principle \nsuffuses all of CRS's endeavors, which makes it unlike the many \npartisan interest groups and ``think tanks'' that populate the Nation's \ncapital. CRS's straightforward mission statement says it all: ``The \nCongressional Research Service serves the Congress throughout the \nlegislative process by providing comprehensive and reliable legislative \nresearch and analysis that are timely, objective, authoritative, and \nconfidential, thereby contributing to an informed national \nlegislature.''\n  Former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said: ``People are entitled to \ntheir own opinions, but not their own facts.'' CRS provides the facts. \nProviding unbiased, objective facts is an invaluable service not just \nto Congress but to the Nation. In my considered judgment, CRS has \nserved Congress exceptionally well during the past 100 years and I am \nconfident that it will continue to perform at the highest level in the \nyears and decades ahead. No one can fully predict the challenges we \nwill face. But I am confident that the in-depth knowledge and expertise \nhoused in CRS will enable Members of Congress and their staff to better \nunderstand and address an increasingly complex array of domestic and \nglobal issues. I congratulate CRS and its outstanding and dedicated \nstaff on the occasion of its 100th birthday.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I was honored today to join my colleague, \nSenator Cardin, in submitting a resolution to commemorate the 100th \nanniversary of the Congressional Research Service, CRS. This is a \nhistoric milestone for CRS and I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a \nletter I recently wrote to Dr. James Billington, the Librarian of \nCongress, and Dr. Mary Mazanec, the Director of the Congressional \nResearch Service, be printed the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 16, 2014.\n     Hon. James H. Billington,\n     Librarian of Congress,\n     Dr. Mary B. Mazanec,\n     Director of the Congressional Research Service.\n       Dear Drs. Billington and Mazanec: On behalf of the Joint \n     Committee on the Library and a grateful Congress, I'd like to \n     congratulate you, the dedicated public servants of the \n     Congressional Research Service (CRS), and the entire extended \n     CRS family on this historic 100th Anniversary. You have a \n     great deal to celebrate today at your ``The First Branch: \n     Challenges of Governance in a Global Era'' symposium.\n       For a century now, CRS professionals have made enormous \n     contributions to our public discourse and provided invaluable \n     expertise to lawmakers challenged with developing legislation \n     and policies to guide our nation in times of increasing \n     complexity and rapid change.\n       We owe a profound debt of gratitude to all of you and to \n     those legislators, led by Senator Robert M. La Follette and \n     Representative John M. Nelson, who foresaw a need for your \n     skills at the beginning of the 20th Century. As a New Yorker, \n     I'm also proud that the legislation to create CRS was partly \n     inspired by efforts in the Empire State undertaken by the New \n     York State Library in addition to reforms carried out in \n     Wisconsin, the home of Senator La Follette and Representative \n     Nelson.\n       In 1914, no one could have envisioned the breadth of the \n     challenges that would confront Congress over the following \n     100 years--issues of war and peace, profound social change \n     and challenge, and revolutionary scientific and technological \n     advancement. Yet through it all, CRS helped Congress make \n     more informed decisions to the benefit of the American people \n     and libraries all over the world.\n       We may have little idea today what Congress will be facing \n     in the decades to come, but we know beyond any doubt that the \n     Congressional Research Service will be there, providing \n     Congress with the very best information possible on \n     legislative, policy, and oversight matters, every step of the \n     way.\n       Congratulations on this historic milestone, and we're \n     looking forward to the next 100 years.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Charles E. Schumer.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Committee on \nRules and Administration with oversight of the Congressional Research \nService, I offer my congratulations on the occasion of its centennial.\n  While it began in 1914 as a modest reference service, today it is an \norganization of nearly 600 analysts, attorneys, information \nprofessionals, and support staff with the core mission of providing \ntimely and authoritative research and analysis on legislative issues of \ninterest to Congress.\n  These highly trained and professional experts are dedicated to \nsupporting the work of the Congress in an objective, unbiased, and \nnonpartisan manner.\n  Congratulations to the Congressional Research Service for 100 years \nof excellent service to the Congress.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.
