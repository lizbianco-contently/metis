Yesterday's vote to advance a measure which is so vitally \nimportant to our country--to extend the lifeline to Americans who lost \ntheir jobs during this great recession--was a very positive \ndevelopment, but we are a long way from restoring benefits to 1.3 \nmillion people who have been looking for work for months, some of them \nfor years.\n  The few Republicans willing to even debate this measure have already \nthreatened to vote against even a short-term extension unless it is \nfully paid for.\n  Let me start by saying I am opposed to offsetting the cost of \nemergency unemployment benefits--I repeat, emergency unemployment \nbenefits. I don't understand why my Republican colleagues can't read \nthe script from the administration of their President, our President, \nPresident Bush. Five times during his time in office--the second \nPresident Bush--we extended emergency unemployment insurance benefits \nby declaring an emergency, as we should now. We should realize that \ntoday there is only one job available for every three people seeking a \njob. Think about it.\n  This legislation calls for a 3-month extension. That is all. Let's \nextend this now and give those people their benefits, and then we will \nwork to see whether we can come up with a long-term solution to this \nissue. I have heard one of the leaders in the House, one of the \nRepublicans, say we need to do something about opportunities for jobs. \nWe agree. Let's see what we can come up with, but let's extend the \nbenefits for 3 months now.\n  Through the darkest days of the recession, these unemployment \nbenefits kept millions of Americans from descending into poverty.\n  I again urge my Republican colleagues in Congress to pass this 3-\nmonth extension. It is what the American people want by a vast majority \nof all political stripes. We need to do this so we can negotiate a \nlong-term solution to this issue. Any lapse or delay in benefits means \n1.3 million people will be wondering whether they need to go to borrow \nmoney again or to maybe see if they can figure out a way to buy baby \nformula or gas for their car to go to a job interview if they are \nfortunate to have a car or a bus ticket.\n  If Republicans are so interested in paying for this measure, they \nshould propose a reasonable way to do so that doesn't attack the \nAffordable Care Act or punish American children, as the two proposals \nthey presented yesterday do--go after American children or the \nAffordable Care Act. They should propose an offset that might actually \npass. Instead, they propose a string of political amendments, each more \ndoomed to failure than the last one they offered.\n  They should also stop masking their reluctance to extend these \nbenefits behind complaints about how many\n\n[[Page S88]]\n\namendments they have been allowed to offer on this and other \nlegislation. Everyone within the sound of my voice should understand \nthat is hollow. It has become a common refrain for the minority to \nblame their own frequent obstruction on me. Two Republican Senators \nheld up progress on virtually everything we tried to do under the first \nterm of this Congress. They wouldn't let any other amendments come up \nunless they got a vote on their amendment.\n  The fact remains that if my Republican colleagues have complaints \nabout my leadership style, they should also have complaints about \nSenator Frist, my predecessor. He is a fine man, a Republican leader. \nWe still stay in touch, as I do with the other Republican leader, \nSenator Lott, whom I worked with very closely. I hear no complaints \nabout their leadership style when they were leading the Senate. During \nmy time as leader, Republicans have offered 7 out of 10 amendments on \nwhich the Senate has voted. Seventy percent of the amendments we have \nvoted on in the Senate have been Republican amendments. This has been a \ngreater share than either Senator Frist or Senator Lott offered. During \nmy leadership in the 111th Congress, minority amendments represented a \ngreater share of amendment votes than during any single Congress. Think \nabout it.\n  So Republicans should stop trying to justify their opposition to \nhelping Americans in need with false claims about what is going on in \nthis institution. Let's start talking about facts rather than fiction--\nand there is a lot of fiction going around. Republicans should, I \nrepeat, stop trying to justify their opposition to helping Americans in \nneed with false claims about my leadership.\n  It is quite interesting to note that House Republican leaders--and I \nam sure they sent a copy of it to the Senate--have instructed \ncolleagues in a written memo. It says: Show compassion for the \nunemployed.\n  I say to everyone that we don't need a memo for us to show compassion \nto the unemployed.\n  They also say: Treat them as individuals.\n  Oh yeah? That is not a bad idea, but it will be very difficult for \nSenate Republicans to seem sympathetic to the plight of the unemployed \nwhile still opposing a helping hand for 1.3 million job seekers. It \nshouldn't take a memo to realize that unemployed Americans--and \nparticularly those who have been out of work for months--deserve our \ncompassion. We don't need a memo for that, a memo saying: Show \ncompassion. No wonder Republicans in Congress are out of touch with \nRepublicans around the country. Republicans around the country support \nextending unemployment benefits because they have compassion for those \nAmericans who are in trouble.\n  Being out of work is not only financially devastating, it is \nheartbreaking. I recently received a letter from a single mother of two \nwho has lived in Nevada all of her life. She is afraid she will soon be \nhomeless--a single mother. She wrote: ``I have no desire to live off \nthe system.'' She is speaking for virtually everyone we are trying to \nhelp. This woman is the rule, not the exception.\n  To qualify for unemployment is not easy. Someone has to be laid off \nthrough no fault of their own, and they have to actively seek work.\n  These unemployed aren't gaming the system; there simply aren't enough \njobs to go around. For every job there are three people trying to get \nthat job. The longer a person is unemployed, the more difficult it \nbecomes to find work. This is not being made up; this is a fact. The \nlong-term unemployed are half as likely as their recently let-go \ncompetitors to be hired. But that doesn't stop them from trying. Rather \nthan encouraging these people who are desperate for help to keep \nlooking, cutting off unemployment benefits actually encourages the \nlong-term unemployed to actually drop out of the job market altogether. \nThat doesn't help them, our communities, our States, and our country. \nIt hurts families, it hurts communities, and it certainly hurts the \neconomy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/08/senate-section/article/S88-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S88]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Yesterday the majority leader rejected my offer for \nboth sides to offer amendments to the unemployment insurance bill--the \nway things used to work around here; we had a bill called up, and we \nhad amendments. This is, sadly, typical of the way things are these \ndays in this institution. If the majority leader just accepted my \noffer, we could actually be debating and amending this bill instead of \nwasting time. How does the majority leader expect to achieve consensus \nwhen one side doesn't have the chance to offer any input at all? That \nis the way the Senate used to operate.\n  Look. If the majority leader wants this bill to pass the Senate, then \nthere is a very good likelihood he is going to have to find a way to \npay for it. I will be offering one idea on that front; that is, paying \nfor a longer extension by dropping the mandate that forces Americans to \nbuy insurance they don't want. But if they don't like that idea, there \nare others. One is a bipartisan idea endorsed by the President that \nensures individuals can't draw both Social Security disability benefits \nand unemployment benefits at the same time. Senators Coburn and Portman \nboth have versions of that. There is another plan offered by Senator \nAyotte that would cut down on fraud in refundable tax credits. There \nare plans for job creation that will be offered by Senators Paul, \nThune, and Inhofe.\n  These plans take a different approach than the government-led one we \nsee from our Democratic friends. They rely on unlocking the potential \nof the private sector to actually increase employment. Why don't we \nhave a vote on them in the Senate? I am sure there are many Democratic \nideas out there as well, but we won't get the chance to debate any of \nthem as long as the majority leader keeps blocking us from offering \namendments.\n  This obstructionism by the Democratic majority is against the \ntraditions of this body, and it needs to end because if Democrats truly \nwant to get anything done this year, they are going to have to learn \nhow to work with us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/08/senate-section/article/S88-3", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S88]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1845, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 265, S. 1845, a bill to \n     provide for the extension of certain unemployment benefits, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, it has been 11 days since Federal \nunemployment insurance expired for 1.3 million Americans, and every day \nmore Americans lose their benefits as their 26 weeks of State benefits \nexpire.\n  I hope my colleagues join Senator Heller and me in our efforts to \nswiftly pass this 3-month extension. Many of my colleagues have talked \nabout issues with respect to a longer term piece of legislation, the \ncost of it, should we pay for it, and are there changes necessary in \nthe program to make it more effective and efficient. Those are \nthoughtful and worthy considerations, but they should not deprive 1.3 \nmillion Americans--and that number is growing each day--basic benefits. \nThese are modest benefits--about $300 a week--that allow them to just \nkeep their families together, keep trying to search for a job.\n  I would point out that the only way one qualifies for this benefit \nis, No. 1, if someone had a job and they lost it through no fault of \ntheir own, and they are constant in keeping up the search for work. \nThat is one of the requirements. It is all about work. In this economy, \nit is all about the fact that there are two or three job seekers for \nevery job. In some parts of the country--in Rhode Island, \nMassachusetts,\n\n[[Page S89]]\n\nNevada, Arizona, Tennessee, States that have high unemployment--it is \nnot just three to one, in some cases it is more.\n  I mentioned on the floor just 2 days ago an article that appeared in \nthe Washington Post that talked about a new dairy opening, or \nreopening, in Hagerstown, MD, with 36 jobs. They thought there would be \na large demand for the jobs, but there were basically 1,600 applicants \nfor 36 jobs. That is not unique to that town in Maryland. That is, \nunfortunately, something that is happening all across this country, and \nit reflects the need to extend these benefits immediately.\n  We have serious issues to work out, but we understand, or we should \nunderstand, that to do it carefully and thoughtfully requires time and \nrequires the attention of the experts in the relevant committees. In \nfact, I can recall coming down here before these benefits expired \nasking unanimous consent to extend them for 1 year, and one of the \nresponses, one of the objections from my colleagues on the Republican \nside was we have to do this through the committee. We have to do this \nthoughtfully and deliberately. We have an opportunity to help people \nwho desperately need help and start that deliberative process, and I \nhope we do that.\n  Yesterday, we took an important step forward. We procedurally moved \nforward to start consideration of this legislation. I wish to thank \nagain Senator Heller and all of my colleagues who joined in that vote. \nThat has given us a chance to finish the job, but it is going to be a \nvery difficult job to finish.\n  I think what we can do immediately--and this might be a two-step \nprocess--is quickly pass the Reed-Heller legislation--90 days, \nunfunded. It will immediately put money into the economy. It will \nimmediately help struggling Americans who are looking for work--they \nhave to in order to qualify for these funds--and it will help overall \nthe economy. As the CBO has projected, if we do not fund for the year \nunemployment insurance, we will lose 200,000 jobs; 200,000 jobs which \nwould be generated by this program will be lost.\n  So we will have a double whammy. We will still have people unemployed \nsearching for work without any assistance and some, in fact, will stop \nsearching. They will give up. Then we will not have the creation of \nadditional jobs because of this money going into the economy, \ngenerating further demand, and further demand generating a need to keep \npeople on and hire some more.\n  I hope we can finish the job we started yesterday. It was a very \nimportant step forward and a very important step forward not only to \nhelp individual families, as I suggested, but to bolster economic \ndemand throughout the economy and that is going to lead to growth.\n  I find it somewhat ironic when I hear some of my colleagues talking \nabout, oh, we truly need to create jobs. That is what we have to do. \nYes, we agree. But there have been so many proposals that have been \npresented both by the administration and by my colleagues that have not \nbeen given consideration--creating a national infrastructure bank which \nwill fund, through a quasi-public mechanism, highway construction, \nbridge renovations, sewer lines, and those things--that have been \nlanguishing for months and months and months and months. So we should \nget on with those things, I agree. But the immediate crisis is helping \nthese 1.3 million Americans, and that number is growing.\n  There is another reason why it is particularly critical to talk about \nthe extended unemployment benefits that are the subject of our debate. \nWe should not end this program now. As this chart indicates, long-term \nunemployment is much higher today than it has ever been when we \nterminated these benefits. In April of 1959, when they ended the \nextended benefits, it was .9 percent--long-term unemployment. In April \n1962, .9 percent; .4 percent in March of 1973; .9 percent in 1977; 1.2 \npercent long-term unemployment in 1985; 1.3 percent in 1994; 1.3 \npercent in 2003; and today, 2.6 percent of long-term unemployment.\n  We are in a new situation. These could be structural market changes \nwhich are making it harder and harder for some people to find \nemployment, even after searching desperately, and that is exactly who \nthis program is designed to help. The State program, the initial 26 \nweeks, covers people who lose their job and then relatively quickly--\nrelatively quickly--can find other employment. This program is the one \nthat is designed for those people who, for many reasons, are having \ndifficulty finding a job over many weeks and months. Today we are at \ntwice the level we have ever been when we considered cutting off these \nbenefits. Actually, we have cut off these benefits. It was December 28.\n  For that reason alone, this issue of extended benefits has to be \naddressed first, I would argue, on an emergency basis. Then let's think \nlong and hard about longer term efforts to address the problem. Many of \nmy colleagues have suggested issues with respect to job training, with \nrespect to incentives for education, and all of them are worthy, but \nthey can't be done in the context of dueling proposals on the floor. \nThey have to be done thoughtfully. If we can quickly adopt the Reed-\nHeller bill, it will give these long-term unemployed--this record \nnumber of long-term unemployed who have been cut off from benefits--it \nwill give them help and give us time.\n  We have heard from countless citizens all across the country, and \nthey come from all walks of life and from every aspect of unemployment. \nThe other day, Senator Klobuchar released a report from the Joint \nEconomic Committee which was extremely well done and which described in \ndetail the recipients. There is no one age group. It spans the gamut. \nThere is no one ethnic concentration. There are some geographic areas \nthat are doing quite well, but there are areas that are doing quite \nbadly that are scattered across the country. Rhode Island and Nevada \nare, unfortunately, leading the list of states with high unemployment. \nThey are very dissimilar States, thousands of miles apart, different \neconomies entirely, but they are caught up in this same problem of \nunemployment and particularly long-term unemployment.\n  The people who are unemployed are not sitting around passively. They \nare out looking every day. In Rhode Island I have met people who have \nworked for 30 years. They are in their fifties. They had good jobs. \nThey were bookkeepers. They were white-collar professionals. They are \ntrying to take care of an elderly parent, they have responsibilities to \nchildren, and they desperately want to work.\n  One constituent who wrote to my office has been out of work since \nDecember of 2012. He has applied to over 300 jobs. He has taken \nadditional classes at our local community college in the hopes of \nbecoming a more attractive candidate for employment. Yet he remains out \nof work.\n  Another constituent who has lost her benefits doesn't have enough \nmoney to pay her bills and they have to move in with a sister because \nshe can't pay the rent.\n  That is what is happening. This is not some academic exercise, some \nrhetorical ideological debate. This is about helping real people who \nwant to work and they can't find a job after desperately looking for \none.\n  A third constituent wrote me the following letter:\n\n       I never thought that I would be among the unemployed, but \n     here I am after over 30 years of experience in my field in \n     higher education administration. I used to make 60K a year \n     and now my unemployment benefits run out in mid March. I have \n     been searching for a job not only in my field, but also doing \n     anything possible using my transferable skills. I have not \n     received an invitation for any interviews at all. . . . So to \n     those who say that extending benefits causes people to stay \n     unemployed longer--they are wrong. When you lose your job, \n     you would do anything to gain employment and regain your \n     dignity. No one wants to subsist on unemployment \n     compensation. Please keep up the fight for extended benefits. \n     It has been a lifeline for me.\n\n  Thirty years of experience, retraining already undertaken, searching \nrelentlessly for a job. An important point here, too, is it is about \nthe economics, but it is also about an individual's dignity and their \nidentity. I don't care who you are. A job helps define who you are. It \ngives one a sense of esteem and accomplishment, whether one is mopping \nfloors or directing the operations of the hugest national corporation. \nFor my colleagues to suggest somehow, well, yes, if someone is a CEO of \na company, that is very valuable work and that gives them self-esteem, \nthey miss the point. A job well\n\n[[Page S90]]\n\ndone, whether it is cleaning floors or merging companies, gives the \nkind of satisfaction and the kind of self-respect that is critical. So \nthis is about money, yes, but it is also about giving people the \nopportunity as Americans to live out their full potential, to \ncontribute to their family and to the economy.\n  There are 1.3 million Americans and more each day who are facing this \nsame dilemma, and that is why Congress needs to create jobs today and \nhelp Americans compete for the jobs of tomorrow. It means taking a \nmultifaceted approach with things such as restoring our manufacturing \nmight by focusing on advanced technologies, ensuring local businesses \nhave access to the capital they need to grow and expand, improving our \nschools and workforce training programs to ensure we have a highly \neducated and skilled workforce, and investing in our infrastructure. \nAll of these things have to be done, but it is going to be very \ndifficult to do them in the context of this legislation. That is why \nagain I urge, let us move this bill forward. Let us help these people \nwho are struggling and working very hard and then let us put ourselves \non a very fast track to deal with these issues--manufacturing \nrenaissance, job training.\n  We have not reauthorized the Workforce Investment Act since 1998. \nThat is the basic sort of education program for those adults and for \npeople looking to move into the workforce, and the world has changed a \nlot since 1998. That is the result of some indifference. I would ask \nwhy in 1998, with a Republican Congress, and in the last few years of \nthe Clinton administration, from 2000 to 2006, a Republican President, \na Republican Congress, we couldn't do those things. It is not a time to \nassess blame, but it is a time to point out the situation that if we \nwant to get these issues done, let us start moving, but let us not \nleave these unemployed Americans behind indefinitely without hope.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REED. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask a question of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland through the Chair.\n  There has been a debate on the floor, and we have heard it off the \nfloor, about whether we should pay for unemployment benefits. \nHistorically, if I am not mistaken, most of the decisions to extend \nunemployment insurance benefits have been considered emergency measures \nand not paid for, and now there is a suggestion from many Republicans \nthat we need to cut spending in areas to compensate for this extension \nof unemployment benefits which, if I am not mistaken, are in the range \nof $25 billion or $26 billion a year.\n  One of the suggestions yesterday from Republican Senate leader Mitch \nMcConnell would, not surprisingly, address the Affordable Care Act, so-\ncalled ObamaCare, and would eliminate one of the basic protections in \nthat law. What Senator McConnell proposed yesterday was to eliminate \nthe responsibility of every individual to have health insurance, which \nwas put in the law so we could have a large pool of insured people and \nsay to anyone with a preexisting condition: You will not be \ndisqualified for health insurance.\n  So the Senator from Kentucky has given us this approach which the \nRepublicans support: If you will agree to eliminate protection from \nhealth insurance for people with preexisting conditions, then we will \nallow you to give unemployment benefits. In other words, if you will \neliminate this protection in health insurance for 300 million-plus \nAmericans, we will give you 1 year of unemployment benefits for 1.3 \nmillion Americans. I might add, for the record, there are 1.9 million \nindividuals with preexisting conditions in the State of Kentucky--the \nState of the Senator who made this proposal.\n  I would ask the Senator from Rhode Island, who has shown \nextraordinary leadership on this issue of extended unemployment \nbenefits: First, would he address the issue of paying for these \nbenefits? And, second, would he address the specific suggestion of the \nRepublican leader that the best way to pay for the benefits for 1.3 \nmillion unemployed people is to reduce protections in health insurance \nfor over 300 million Americans?\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  Let me first address the issue of paying for the benefits. The \nSenator from Illinois is correct, typically these benefits are \nconsidered emergency spending and they are not offset. In fact, the \nlegislation which was passed in the wee hours of January 1, 2013, as I \nrecall, had a 1-year extension of unemployment benefits, unpaid for. It \nreceived overwhelming votes--I believe 89 to 8--a huge majority of \nRepublicans and Democrats coming together. So a year ago, this issue of \npay-for was not even on the table. And, by the way, I think it probably \nled to the creation, given CBO's estimates going forward, of roughly \n200,000 jobs this year because it was enacted and it wasn't offset.\n  It goes to a second point about sort of the bang for the buck. This \nis one of the best commonsensical programs we have, because when we \ngive these benefits to individuals and don't take other benefits, other \nfunds out of the economy, it has a multiplier effect, some people \nestimate $1.50 for every $1 in terms of economic activity. And it makes \ncommon sense. These funds go directly from the recipient, not to their \nsavings account or to build up, but right out to buying gasoline, \nkeeping cell phone service on. By the way, if you don't have a car and \ndon't have a cell phone today, you can't find a job, you can't go to \nthe interview, you can't get the call for the interview, you can't \napply for the job. It is not 1955 anymore, where you take the bus and \nhand your clipboard across the barrier to the clerk. You have to have \nthis electronic connection to be in the workforce, as well as mobility.\n  So from the point of view of an economic national perspective: One, \nwe typically have done these as emergency spending; two, you get a big \nbang for the buck when you do it that way. There is a strong argument \nthat is probably the most sensible approach.\n  With respect to the pay-for the Republican leader suggested, I concur \nentirely with the Senator from Illinois in that it is robbing Peter to \npay Paul. I am sure, not only these folks who are struggling to find a \njob, but of the 1.3 million people who are currently receiving \nbenefits, I have to assume a significant number--at least some of \nthem--have preexisting conditions. For the first time many of them are \nable to qualify for health care benefits. And to take this protection \naway for millions of Americans--you say it is 1.9 million just in \nKentucky alone. It is a huge number across the country--would be bad \npolicy, and it would in fact for many families be a crushing blow. \nAgain, I don't think we have to rob Peter to pay Paul.\n  From an economic standpoint, we have typically done this without \noffsets because we want to have the economic stimulus and the demand \ncreation which comes. But from a basic fairness point of view, we are \ngoing to go ahead and give benefits of $300 a week to people who need \nthem. I want to do that. But we are going to pay for it by telling some \nfamilies: No, you don't get insurance. Or: You have to pay $25,000 a \nyear because your child has asthma. That is not fair. It is not good \ncommon sense and it is not good economics. So I concur.\n  To resume: We talked about some of the big issues here and paying for \nthis bill. This is all in the context of deficit reduction, which we \nhave made significant progress on.\n  The Bowles-Simpson report suggested that over 10 years we cut $4 \ntrillion from the deficit, and we achieved roughly about $2.5 trillion \nof that, most of it coming from cuts to programs--not revenue \nincreases, but cuts. So we have made significant progress on deficit \nreduction. We have to do more, but we have to do it sensibly and \nlogically. And we have proposals we have brought forward.\n  I must commend my colleagues in the Senate. This was on a bipartisan \nbasis. We passed an immigration reform bill in this body. It has \nlanguished in the House. But in that bill alone, scored by CBO, will \ncut nearly another $1 trillion in the deficit, which will get us to \nthat target or very close to that target. Yet it is languishing in the \nHouse. If we can pass it, then this issue of deficit--which has \ndominated and been very important over the last several years--is \nsomething we can practically resolve. And, by the way, as I suggested \nin my colloquy with Senator Durbin, if we pass this legislation,\n\n[[Page S91]]\n\nit will help too in terms of stimulating economic growth, et cetera.\n  There are many things we can do. But, again, I go back to this point. \nThese people are in a desperate situation. As my constituent wrote, 30 \nyears of work, middle-aged, getting retraining, 300 applications, no \ninterviews, looking for anything. It is not just about dollars and a \ncheck. It is about dignity. It is about who you are.\n  We have to respond and we have to respond quickly. And we have the \nopportunity to do this. As we look at a longer term effort, it doesn't \nforeclose and it shouldn't foreclose considering programmatic changes, \nconsidering if we would offset or not. In response to Senator Durbin, I \npointed out, typically we don't offset this program but we have at \ncertain times in the past. My preference would be, frankly, to get this \nbill done and then look at this issue over the longer term without \npreconditions. So we have to be clear. We can move this and we should \nmove it.\n  Again, this question of offsets seems to be coming up more and more, \nas was reflected in the comments of the Senator from Illinois. As we \ninitiated this program under President Bush back in 2008--and the \nunemployment rate was roughly 5.5 percent, much lower than it is \ntoday--we did not ask for offsets every time. In fact, it was the \nexception to the rule. I think now is not the time, particularly in \nthis 90-day proposal which Senator Heller and I have.\n  We have worked through some difficult issues, and I commend Senator \nMurray and Congressman Ryan particularly for the work on the budget, \nand I think we can work through this issue. So I again urge that we \nthoughtfully and very conscientiously and collaboratively work together \nlonger term, but not ignore the crisis today--not leave 1.3 million, \nand more, Americans dangling, uncertain, desperate, frustrated, losing \nnot only their income but in many respects their identity and their \ndignity. We can do better than that. Then we have the time--we have the \ntime to work constructively, collaboratively, and cooperatively to come \nup with principled proposals to extend these benefits for hopefully the \nwhole year.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                       Remembering Sonny Zetmeir\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to be here \non the Senate floor this morning since I am intruding on the discussion \nabout unemployment insurance extension. However, I wish to take a few \nminutes to highlight the life of a Kansan who passed in late 2013.\n  At the end of last year, I learned of the death of a resident of \nParsons, KS, in the southeast corner of our State. E.J. ``Sonny'' \nZetmeir was a person of such optimism and so engaged in improving the \nlives of other people, I wanted to highlight and pay my respects to him \nand his family.\n  The community of Parsons lost one of its greatest champions when \nSonny Zetmeir passed away. His humor and selflessness truly made an \nincredible impact upon that community.\n  Sonny had moved to Parsons, KS, from Grandview, MO, with his parents \nin 1965, along with a company his family owned that made cabinets. The \ncompany was called Grandview Products. He originally agreed with his \nfamily to stay in Parsons for a year to help get the business off the \nground in its new location, but his commitment to his family and to his \nfamily's business continued to grow and he never left. He went on to \npurchase the company from his parents when they retired in 1982, and he \nhelped build it into the outstanding cabinetmaking business it is \ntoday.\n  Under his leadership, Grandview Products grew from a local small \nbusiness with 24 employees to a $50 million company with 430 employees, \nshipping cabinets from coast to coast. Today, the company is the \nlargest employer in Parsons, and it also owns a facility in the \nneighboring community of Cherryvale.\n  Sonny's legacy as a businessman is rivaled only by his commitment to \nhis community and improving the lives of others around him. As \npresident and CEO of Grandview Products, he cared deeply about the \nhealth and well-being of his employees and their families. Through the \nrecession of 2008, he fought hard to keep the company's doors open and \nkeep as many employees as possible at work. When Grandview Products \nregained its footing, he worked to bring many of the former employees \nback to work.\n  Even when he received the devastating cancer diagnosis that would \nultimately take his life, just a few weeks later, Sonny's thoughts \nimmediately went to the well-being of his employees and their families. \nHis wife Sophia relayed this story about his final weeks. She says:\n\n       His number one concern was the company and his employees. \n     It wasn't just his employees, it was the families that he was \n     responsible for . . . Sonny was able to have a meeting with \n     216 employees. First, they all got a raise . . . so they \n     wouldn't be afraid for their futures. No raises had been \n     given in 5 years because of the recession. We're making money \n     now, so everyone got a raise. Then, he told them who was \n     going to be running what departments. Then, he told them how \n     sick he was.\n\n  But his concerns for others and selflessness extended well beyond his \nbusiness. He was passionate about Grandview Products being a locally \nowned company, and he felt a calling to serve the community through his \nservice.\n  Over the years, Sonny donated cabinets to community projects, \nchurches, and schools. He also encouraged his employees to be \ncharitable in whatever capacity they were able. In fact, Sonny was so \ndedicated to giving back to the local community that he would only buy \nGirl Scout cookies from Girl Scouts in his home counties of Labette and \nMontgomery.\n  His service, honors, and achievements are numerous, and they include \ntwo terms as a trustee of Labette Community College and chairman of its \ncapital fund campaign; 6 years as Labette County Republican chairman; \nboard member of Meadowlark Girl Scout Council; and many years as \npresident of the Parsons Area Community Foundation.\n  Sonny was named Parsons Chamber Business Person of the Year and the \nKansas State Chamber Employer of the Year in 2003. He received the \nKansas Manufacturers Association management appreciation award in 2007, \nand in 2008 he was chosen to receive the Cardinal Citation Award by \nLabette Community College. Since 1985 the Zetmeirs have cosponsored the \nFourth of July fireworks at Marvel Park in Parsons.\n\n  I have always believed what we do here in the Nation's Capital is \nimportant, but the reality is we change the world one person at a time. \nSo while what we do in the Senate matters, so much more is accomplished \nby a person like Sonny. Sonny Zetmeir lived that life. By investing his \ntime and talent and financial support into the community where he \nlived, he made a difference every day. His involvement in the community \nand his selflessness serves as an inspiration and should be a role \nmodel for every American.\n  He was married to his wife Sophia for 51 years and was a devoted \nfather to their 3 daughters: Ellen, Joan, and Amy. I ask the Senate to \njoin me today in extending our heartfelt sympathies to Sonny's wife and \nto his family as they begin this new year in the absence of their loved \none.\n  He was loved by them, and he will be greatly missed. If one's value \nin life is determined by whether or not you made a difference while you \nwere here on this Earth, Sonny's life was priceless. God bless him and \nlet him be a role model for all of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, 1.3 million people already have not had \na happy new year. That is because, when we tried to extend the \nemergency unemployment insurance before the holidays, the Republican \nleadership said no. The temperatures may be dropping to new lows, but \nwe should not freeze unemployment benefits.\n  When the economy was collapsing and AIG, the multinational insurance \ncompany, needed funds, we found that money for AIG. But when the \nAmericans who are still recovering from the very recession caused by \nthese institutions need more unemployment insurance, we just cannot \nseem to find a way to get it done.\n  These are not just numbers. These people, 1.3 million people across \nthe country and 60,000 in my home State of Massachusetts, now face the \nharsh reality in 2014 that their country no longer has their backs.\n  One of these people is named Vera Volk. She is from Lynn, MA, just \nnorth\n\n[[Page S92]]\n\nof Boston. She is a 20-year employee in the biotech/pharmaceutical \nindustry who was laid off in May of 2013. Her layoff was in part due to \nsequestration, cuts in the Federal funding of biotech last year.\n  Last month Vera lost her unemployment benefits when the emergency \nunemployment insurance program ended. Vera has suffered a double \ninjustice. First, her job was eliminated through sequestration, and \nthen she was denied the extension of her unemployment benefits. Without \nthe additional unemployment insurance, Vera and her family now need \nhelp to obtain food and medical assistance. In the near future, Vera's \nfamily faces the loss of their car and their home. Thousands of \nfamilies in Massachusetts are facing similar but equally difficult \ndecisions due to the termination of this critical program.\n  Published reports say that unemployment insurance kept 2.5 million \nAmericans, including 600,000 children, out of poverty last year alone. \nThat is why I am a cosponsor of the Emergency Unemployment Compensation \nExtension Act that Senators Reed and Heller have introduced, to \nreinstate and continue Federal support for the emergency unemployment \ninsurance program until the end of March. Under that legislation, \nunemployed residents of Massachusetts such as Vera Volt would be \neligible to receive up to 35 weeks of additional unemployment benefits.\n  Today, there are approximately 11.3 million Americans out of work and \nlooking for a job. In Massachusetts, the unemployment rate is 7.1 \npercent and approximately 245,000 are looking for work. Unfortunately, \nin too many cities such as Lawrence, New Bedford, and Springfield--all \nover Massachusetts there are cities with much higher unemployment \nrates. Those unemployed workers in Massachusetts and across this \ncountry are finding it extremely difficult to find a job in this \nmarket. According to the Economic Policy Institute, for every one job \nopening there are 3.1 unemployed workers. So 2 out of every 3 job \nseekers have no job that they can actually find. Yet we are going to \npretend that there is a job for them to be able to find.\n  There are many people who believe they are not working hard enough to \nfind a job. Let me tell you something. Back in 2000, the unemployment \nrate in the United States of America went down to 3.8 percent. Guess \nwhat happened. People who were unemployed took those jobs. When \nunemployment goes down to 3.8 percent, when the government and the \nprivate sector are doing their job, people come to work.\n  In Massachusetts in 2000, unemployment went down to 2.8 percent. \nPeople were not hiding under their beds. People were not pretending \nthey could not work. When the job was there, people took it. This is \nnot ancient history; this is 2000, 3.8 percent unemployment, 2.8 \npercent unemployment for the State of Massachusetts. People who are \noffered a job will take a job. The jobs are not there. It is not the \nfault of these families. It is not the fault of these job seekers. We \nshould not be punishing them. We should not be punishing their families \nbecause this capitalist system is not producing the jobs right now.\n  We have to reach out with a helping hand to these families so they \ncan make it through this difficult time when the system is failing \nthem. Instead, we are going to blame them for not finding jobs that do \nnot exist. It is a beautiful circular argument where you never have to \nhelp the people who are actually being victimized by a failure in the \neconomy. The truth is--and I restate this--when it went down to 3.8 \npercent unemployment in 2000, employers called these people back and \nsaid we want to put you to work, and the workers said, yes, we are \nready to do it.\n  Here we are, once again, back in this cycle where too many people are \npointing the finger at the worker when we know the worker will do the \njob. We have to be honest. The system, this capitalist system, this \ninteraction between the government and capitalism right now is not \nproducing the jobs for these workers. We have to work on that. That is \nour responsibility. We should be humble enough to say that it is the \ngovernment, it is the private sector, not working together smarter--not \nharder--in order to accomplish these goals for all of these workers \nacross our country.\n  If we did that, I think that ultimately we would have the very \ninteresting result, according to all economists, of actually injecting \nmore funding into the economy, creating more jobs, not destroying an \nadditional 200,000 or 300,000 additional jobs this year because we did \nnot inject the funding that would be provided to the unemployed that \nwould be spent on the economy that would keep it on the upward tick it \nis on right now.\n  Instead, paradoxically, we are going to wind up with Republicans, if \nthey are successful in cutting off this funding for long-term \nunemployment, seeing unemployment actually rise instead of being lower.\n  We have to work together in a bipartisan fashion in order to make \nsmart investments now that will create the jobs, continue our country's \neconomic recovery, and lower unemployment. I believe that our national \nstrategy for job growth must continue to emphasize the areas where we \nexcel as a nation. It is education, it is health care, it is biotech, \nit is clean tech, it is technology in general, and it is the investment \ninto these areas that continues to give us the opportunity to be an \nengine for job growth in the world.\n  But while we chase this dawn of a brighter economy, we must not leave \nbehind millions of Americans and their families. Let's not punish those \nwho are already the victims and who continue to be the victims of a \nWall Street collapse because we, as a nation, fail to understand and \nidentify these innocent victims who still sit up there with their \nfamilies.\n  I hope we can come together on a bipartisan basis to continue this \nprogram which is such a lifeline to the unemployed, their families and \nour economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, first of all, on the bill before us, we \nshould be sure to continue to remember, if you are an employee and do \nlose your job today or tomorrow or in coming weeks, in every State you \nimmediately qualify for 6 months of unemployment. In States that have \nhigh unemployment you immediately qualify for an additional 13 to 20 \nweeks.\n  There are really two different debates going on here today. One is, \nis this really a long-term plan or a long-term policy? I suggest if \nthis Congress and the administration spent the kind of effort and time \non what it takes to create private sector jobs or encourage the \nenvironment where that happens, we would be spending our time much more \nwisely than we are as we continue to perpetuate a program that the \nmajority would suggest should not even be paid for and many would \nsuggest is just not a program at all.\n  Other things that are affecting our economy is why I came to the \nfloor today. There are a number of things, from constantly talking \nabout more taxes to higher utility bills to more regulation to, \nobviously, this overwhelming discussion about health care. I noticed \nthe majority leader this weekend said that roughly a third of all the \npeople who have been added to the insured roles because of the \nAffordable Care Act were because of a bill I introduced in 2009 that \nwould allow dependents or children to stay on their family policies \nlonger. I was the only one who introduced that bill in the House. I \ndon't think it was introduced in the Senate. I thought it was a good \nidea then. I think it is a good idea now. Apparently, it is such a good \nidea that a third of all the people who have insurance that did not \nhave insurance before are just because of that bill.\n  I have the bill before me. It was H. Res. 3887. It is 3\\1/2\\ pages \nthat could have passed by itself--not 2,700 pages, 3\\1/2\\ pages that \nwould have added a third of all of the people the majority of the \nSenate said had been added because of the Affordable Care Act. No \ntaxpayer money involved; 3\\1/2\\ pages that would not have disrupted \nanybody else's insurance.\n  There were other solutions out there that would have made a lot more \nsense. I am tired of hearing from the administration that nobody else \nhad any other ideas. Apparently my idea was one-third of all the people \nwho have been added to insurance, according to the majority leader. \nApparently, I had a third of all of the ideas, and they were in 3\\1/2\\ \npages with no taxpayer cost.\n\n[[Page S93]]\n\n  Just as I suspect is the case with every Senator, I am getting \nletters, postings on our Facebook page, contacts through all of the \nsocial media every day, from Missourians who are seeing this is not \nworking out like they thought it was going to work out. At Ozark \nTechnical Community College in Springfield, MO, my hometown, the \nadjunct faculty there, as is the case in many community colleges, has \ntaught an awful lot of the courses. I think 58 percent of the courses \ntaught are taught not by full-time faculty members but by part-time \nmembers. The problem is those faculty members are now more part-time \nthan they were before. Many of them were teaching 30 credit hours per \nyear prior to this year. But largely because of the Affordable Care \nAct, they are now teaching 24 credit hours. They lost that percentage \nof their work, that percentage of their pay, that percentage of their \nability to work with and be dedicated to students.\n  According to the Springfield newspaper, the Affordable Care Act is \none of the reasons that for those faculty members, 58 percent of all \nthe credit hours taught are taught by people many of whom were teaching \n30 credit hours and are now are teaching 24 credit hours. There is only \none reason that they are working 24 hours a week instead of 30, and \nthat is because 30 is the point where benefits, according to the \nAffordable Care Act, have to be offered at a level that is defined by \nthe Affordable Care Act, not defined by the community college.\n  In fact, some community college in America, I am sure, gave some \nbenefits before for people who were part of the adjunct faculty, just \nnot the benefits the Federal Government appears to think are absolutely \nnecessary.\n  Let me go through a few emails from people who reached out to our \noffice in recent days.\n  Jeffrey, from Blue Springs, MO, is a small business owner who offers \nhealth care benefits to his employees. Jeffrey said:\n\n       It feels like a bait and switch. Get everyone to drop the \n     coverage they liked, then stick it to them once company \n     provided healthcare is no longer available.\n\n  When I was home--as I was for much of the break we just had--I asked \npeople: What are you doing with your health care? Employer after \nemployer who doesn't have 50 employees and is not impacted by this is \nsaying: I think the government is about to take this over, and before \nthey get in, I am getting out.\n  The 12 people at the dentist's office and the 36 people at the radio \nstation either lost their health care January 1 or already know they \nare going to lose it next January 1, and the only reason is the so-\ncalled Affordable Care Act.\n  Marsha, out of Auxvasse, MO, has three children who are all under the \nage of 5. Her husband's employer has been informed that because of \nObamaCare, they will have to absorb more than $1 million in order to \nkeep providing insurance for their employees. The employer is still \ntrying to do that, but the coverage is not what it was, the deductible \nis higher than it was, and one of the messages is ``We may not be able \nto do this much longer.''\n  Sabra and her husband, from Purdy, MO, were notified that they will \nlose health care--and did lose their health care--on December 31 \nbecause of the health care act. She said:\n\n       We live on less than $14,000. Now we are at a point where \n     we have to make a choice, food or medication, both of which I \n     can no longer afford. So I choose to go without the much \n     needed medication.\n\n  Theresa's husband--they are from Joplin, MO--lost his coverage on \nDecember 31. When she tried to sign up for health coverage at \nhealthcare.gov, she was told they were ineligible because they were \nincarcerated. It turns out neither of them has ever been arrested or \nincarcerated at all, but they were ineligible because they were \nincarcerated.\n  I guess the greater point there is that he lost his health care. She \nwould not have been on healthcare.gov and found out--much to her \nsurprise--that the government believes she is incarcerated if her \nhusband hadn't lost his health care at work.\n  Melanie, from St. Charles, MO, is a single mother of three. Her \nemployers cut her hours because of ObamaCare. She is no longer able to \nwork more than 28 hours a week and had to find two additional part-time \njobs to make up for the job she lost.\n  Here is what she said:\n\n       I feel like the government is working against me, and I am \n     the person they say they are trying to help.\n\n  Jean, from St. Louis, said her insurance was canceled because of the \nPresident's health care plan. The most similar plan she could find in \nthe exchange to the one she had before cost $775 per month, which is \nmore than double what she was paying before the Affordable Care Act.\n  She said:\n\n       Why did we break a healthcare system that allowed people to \n     find what they needed, instead of just government making \n     improvements to it?\n\n  Jefferson City Schools, which is in the same city as our State \ncapital, said the health care plan will cost their school district \n$150,000. They have to pay for health insurance for substitute \nteachers, which they didn't pay for in the past. There are people who \nare listening to this who will think: That is fine; they are paying for \nsubstitute teachers. Many of those substitute teachers are no longer \nallowed to work 30 hours a week in school districts all over America, \nand then there are others in districts, such as this one, where it \ncosts $150,000 more than it did.\n  The district officials in the article I read didn't go as far as to \nsay the Federal Government is hurting more than it is helping, but they \ndid point out that $150,000 is about three full-time teachers whom they \nwon't hire whom they might have been able to hire otherwise.\n  Barbara, from Novinger, MO, said:\n\n       For the first time in 50 years, my husband and I do not \n     have health care. My hours have been reduced from 40 to 28 \n     hours a week and they pulled out our insurance at work.\n\n  Interestingly, employers who provided insurance for years because \nthey thought it was the right thing to do and the competitive thing to \ndo are now taking a different view of this when the government begins \nto tell them what they have to do.\n  I think it is one of the most interesting applications of the health \ncare law. When the government begins to tell you what you have to do, \nthen suddenly it is OK not to do anything except what you have to do. \nHow do you meet that criteria? How do you draw that line? You have \npeople work less than 30 hours, you don't create new jobs, or you \noutsource your work.\n  Let me give three or four more examples as I finish with my time on \nthe floor.\n  Sandra, from Springfield, is upset that her health care plan will \nrequire them to have pediatric dentistry and maternity care.\n  She said:\n\n       I'm upset that my health care plan will require my husband \n     and I to have pediatric dentistry and maternity care that we \n     do not need to have.\n\n  I don't know how many letters like that all of us have received. The \nbenefits are supposed to be better than the insurance they had, but for \na whole lot of people, it turns out these are benefits they simply \ndon't need. Suddenly, they are paying for benefits they don't need, and \npeople who don't have insurance can have insurance once they get sick. \nHow is that supposed to make any kind of economic sense or health care \nsense?\n  Mark, from Chesterfield, MO, said that his plan was canceled because \nhis plan--back to my point, I suppose--didn't meet the requirements of \nthe President's health care plan.\n  Here is what he said:\n\n       My current plan will no longer be offered after December of \n     2014. This is a direct contradiction to President Obama's \n     promise that I could keep my plan.\n\n  Some people lost their insurance on December 31 of last year. Other \npeople have already been told they are going to lose their insurance \nDecember 31 of next year.\n  This letter is from somebody who works at the Ozarks Medical Center \nand lives in West Plains.\n\n       We are a sole community provider, with the closest hospital \n     providing the same level of care or above over 100 miles \n     away. The loss of this healthcare system will devastate the \n     economics of this community and surrounding communities.\n\n  What we are going to find is a system that is not designed to meet \nthe needs of the people of the country. What we could have done is we \ncould have given\n\n[[Page S94]]\n\nthem more choices to figure out what they need to meet their needs \ninstead of coming up with a system that simply is going to leave so \nmany people who had insurance 2 years ago without insurance 2 years \nfrom now. Surely that wasn't the goal, but people in this Chamber and \nWashington, DC, had better wake up and figure this out. Whether that \nwas the goal or not, it is going to be the result if we don't do \nsomething about it.\n  The best thing to do is to start over--now that we have learned all \nwe have learned over the last 4 years--and make changes to the best \nhealth care system in the world that will make it even better and work \nfor more people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, despite the differences between the \ndifferent sides of the aisle on the underlying legislation--\nparticularly on the refusal so far of the majority leader to actually \npay for the $6 billion cost of the 3-month extension of long-term \nunemployment benefits and adding that $6 billion to the $17.3 trillion \nnational debt--I am confident both parties would like to find a way to \ndeal with the problem of America's long-term unemployed.\n  There are people who don't necessarily want to collect unemployment \nbenefits because they want a job and they want to work. They want to \nprovide for their families.\n  Even as we stand here and debate yet another extension of Federal \nunemployment benefits, it is important that we keep the big picture in \nmind. Obviously, what we are talking about--just to remind everybody--\nis the basic unemployment program, which provides half a year or 26 \nweeks of unemployment benefits. Democrats want to extend that emergency \nmeasure, which was enacted after the fiscal crisis of 2008 and now \nappears to be permanent. We have spent $250 billion since 2008, and to \ncontinue to recklessly borrow money from our creditors, such as the \nChinese, and others, and leave it for our children to pay back--how \nresponsible is that?\n  The best way to help the unemployed and the best way to help \nAmericans and America is to increase economic growth and increase job \ncreation.\n  We had a grand experiment known as the stimulus, which was back in \n2009 when we had $1 trillion worth of borrowed money. Grand projections \nwere made at that time that if the Federal Government would just spend \nborrowed money rather than have the private sector do it, we would see \nunemployment rates plummet, and, of course, that has proven not to be \nthe case. In fact, this economic recovery after the great recession of \n2008 has been the slowest economic recovery we have seen since the \nGreat Depression back in the 1930s.\n  Congress and the Federal Government can't adopt policies that hamper \ngrowth and discourage job creation and expect the economy to grow and \njobs to be created. Let me say that again. You can't adopt policies \nthat actually discourage small businesses from starting a business or \ngrowing their business and creating jobs and expect jobs and economic \ngrowth to follow. What that means is that, notwithstanding the good \nintentions of those who embrace some of these policies, they are \nactually hurting the unemployed no matter how many times they want to \nextend unemployment benefits on a long-term basis. Unfortunately, that \nis exactly what the Obama administration has done time and time again.\n  Let me say that I am confident President Obama would like to help \npeople who can't find work. I am sure the President believes as well \nthat ObamaCare will improve the health care system for 300-plus million \nAmericans. The problem is that we have seen that this experiment in big \ngovernment and government takeovers--whether it is of the health care \nsystem or through a $1 trillion stimulus package--simply has not \nworked. At some point good intentions have to give way to reality and \nthe facts, especially when those good intentions are not translated \ninto good results.\n  Let me give one example. Recently, I was in Tyler, TX--which is over \nin northeast Texas near Louisiana--at a restaurant doing a roundtable \non the impact of the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, on employers, \nsuch as the owner of the small diner where we met. He told many tales, \nbut one story that stuck in my mind was of a single mother who, instead \nof working her normal 40 hours a week, was relegated to a part-time job \nof 30 hours a week, and that is in order for her employer to avoid the \npenalties and mandates of ObamaCare. So what this single mom has to do \nin order to compensate for her lost income is to find another part-time \njob. So instead of working 40 hours at one job, she works 60 hours at \ntwo jobs in order to make up for that lost income. Here again, if the \nPresident and his allies think we are going to make up for the lost \nwages this single mom is making by having her workweek cut from 40 \nhours to 30 hours, I think they need to think again. That is what I \nmean when I say the policies of this administration have actually hurt \nthe very people they now say they want to help by increasing long-term \nunemployment benefits.\n\n  It is true that facts are stubborn, and there is a mountain of \nevidence that says if we pay people too generously, it actually \ndiscourages some people from actively seeking employment. In fact, \nseveral years ago, President Obama's own former chief White House \neconomist said that ``job search is inversely related to the generosity \nof employment benefits.'' Translated, that means if we pay people too \nmuch not to work, some people are going to be persuaded not to look for \nwork.\n  Indeed, I know there are perhaps many explanations for the slow \neconomic recovery and the high rate of unemployment, which is up around \n7 percent, including the largest number of people who simply dropped \nout of the workforce in the last 30 years, known as the labor \nparticipation rate. There are a lot of reasons for why we find \nourselves where we are now. But adding benefits for people not to work \nand not dealing with the underlying problem of slow economic growth and \npeople being discouraged from creating new jobs or making full-time \nwork part-time work--we need to be looking at the root causes of the \nproblem as well as the problems and the policies of this administration \ntime and time again.\n  The majority leader and his allies want to extend benefits for 3 more \nmonths--3 more months. This is on top of the 26 weeks which are part of \nthe basic unemployment compensation package. But my question is, if we \nwant to extend it for 3 months, where will we find ourselves 3 months \nfrom now? Will we be met with yet another request for the extension of \nlong-term unemployment benefits that adds another $6 billion to the \ndeficit? What about 3 months later?\n  I hope I can be forgiven for saying this feels like a political \nexercise more than a sincere effort to deal with the underlying problem \nof joblessness in our country, particularly since we are $17.3 trillion \nin debt, something the President seems to not care one bit about. Also, \nas the Federal Reserve begins to wind down their bond-buying program, \nwe are going to see interest rates go up and we are going to end up \nspending more and more tax dollars just to pay our creditors for the \ndebt while we ought to be focused on dealing with some of the root \ncauses of unemployment.\n  Let me get back to my point. Some Republicans have offered to find \nways to pay for this 3-month extension. My impression is that if that \nwere done, it would probably happen--for 3 months. But we have also \nsuggested long-term reforms that would make our system of unemployment \ninsurance more effective. Senator Alexander, a former Secretary of \nEducation and former Governor of Tennessee, discussed yesterday at our \nconference lunch some ideas he has, including making Pell grants--I \nthink they are in excess of $5,000 per person--available so people can \nstudy job retraining at community colleges during that 26 weeks of \nunemployment. So if they can't find a job in their existing field, they \ncan learn new skills that will allow them to get well-paying jobs in \nanother field, using those Pell grants for job retraining.\n  There are a lot of good ideas about how we can improve the \nunemployment system if, in fact, the majority leader will just allow \nit. He remains agnostic, I would say, at this point about whether he is \neven going to allow us to offer amendments to pay for the 3-month \nextension or some of these good, solid ideas of dealing with the root \nproblems\n\n[[Page S95]]\n\nrather than just continuing to treat the symptom with the same lack of \nsuccess in terms of decreasing joblessness and getting the economy back \non track.\n  I know many of our colleagues on the other side share these same \ngoals. Yet the majority leader has made it clear this week that he is \nmore interested in rhetoric and political gamesmanship than in real \nreform. That is why I objected on Monday night when 17 Senators were \nmissing. The majority leader wanted to have a vote on cloture that was \ndoomed to fail. Why? Not because he was interested in a real solution \nbut because he wants a ``gotcha'' moment, to say, look, with 17 \nSenators missing, the 60-vote threshold for cloture was not going to be \nachieved. What possible purpose could be served by having that vote \nthen instead of doing it on Tuesday? The vote was moved to Tuesday, at \nwhich time that 60-vote threshold was met. The only conclusion I can \ndraw is the majority leader was interested in a ``gotcha'' moment \ninstead of a real solution. Fortunately, he reconsidered and moved it \nto Tuesday.\n  So far, the majority leader is refusing to pay for this extension of \nbenefits. They are refusing to change the program by modernizing it, \nmaking it more efficient, and helping people learn new skills so they \ncan get back to work, and they are refusing to consider any other ideas \nthan those cooked up in the majority leader's conference room behind \nclosed doors.\n  I have in my hand 11 Republican amendments, many of them are \nbipartisan or they enjoy bipartisan support. For example, Senator Paul \nfrom Kentucky has the Economic Freedom Zones Act. I saw the President \nannounce this morning--I think there were five and he calls them by \nanother name--basically, the same sort of concept, looking at blighted \nareas and trying to provide incentives for investment and job creation \nin those areas of high unemployment. So Senator Paul has a bill that \nwould deal with that.\n  Senator Portman from Ohio has a reform that would prohibit \nsimultaneous collection of disability benefits and unemployment. That \nis double-dipping, it seems to me, and something we ought to be dealing \nwith.\n  Senator Moran of Kansas has a bill he calls the Startup Act 2.0, \nwhich is a jobs bill.\n  Senator Coats of Indiana wants to offset the extension of \nunemployment insurance by delaying individual and employer mandates for \n1 year. The President has already done that unilaterally for employer \nmandates. Why not delay the individual mandate for 1 year and use that \nto offset this extension for 3 months of unemployment insurance?\n  So there are plenty of ideas out there. I mentioned some of them. \nBoth of the Senators from Oklahoma have amendments that would be good \namendments to offer on this legislation. The Senator from Louisiana has \none. The Senator from New Hampshire has one. So these are at least 11 \nideas. If the majority leader would allow us to actually have a real \ndebate as opposed to a political exercise, I believe we could come up \nwith a bipartisan consensus that would actually help deal with the \nunderlying problem and not just treat the symptoms in a way that \nignores those root causes.\n  Let me get back to what I think is cause No. 1 for the difficulties \nmany small businesses are having and the difficulties many people who \nwork for those small businesses are having; that is, ObamaCare. I \nrealize some people would like us to believe this is all about the Web \nsite and once the Web site gets fixed it is all going to be hunky-dory, \nregardless of the fact that more people have lost their current \ncoverage by cancellation than have been signed up on the ObamaCare \nexchanges.\n  The administration seems particularly proud of the fact that \nObamaCare has added hundreds of thousands of Americans to Medicaid. As \nwe all know, this is the safety net program designed to help low-income \npeople. The problem is Medicaid itself is a fundamentally broken \nprogram that is failing our neediest citizens. The problems with \nMedicaid are a stark reminder that access to coverage does not mean the \nsame thing; access to coverage is different from having access to care.\n  Here is what I mean by that. In Texas only about one-third of doctors \nwill see a new Medicaid patient. Someone might say that doesn't make \nmuch sense. It does if we consider the fact that Medicaid--this \ngovernment program--pays doctors about 50 cents on the dollar of what a \nprivate insurance coverage would pay, and because it reimburses at such \na low rate, some physicians have simply said: I can't continue to add \nnew patients to my practice and be compensated 50 cents on the dollar. \nSo they have limited their practice. That is what I mean when I say \nthere is a difference between access to coverage and access to care.\n  Medicaid is sorely in need of reform. All across the country, \nMedicaid patients have been forced to endure the humiliating experience \nof walking into a doctor's office and then getting turned away because \nthe office doesn't accept Medicaid for the reason I mentioned.\n  We have also seen lawsuits brought by providers and patients against \ntheir own State Medicaid Program, saying the reimbursement rates are so \nlow, doctors can't actually see patients at that price. In Texas, a \n2012 survey conducted by the Texas Medical Association shows that a \nlarge majority of Texas physicians agree that Medicaid is broken and \nshould not be used as a mechanism to reduce the uninsured. Despite all \nof that, there are those who say that ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion \nwill help hospitals cope with excessive emergency room visits. Again, \nthe problem is that flies in the face of the facts. In a recent study \nin Oregon, Medicaid recipients in Oregon went to the emergency room 40 \npercent more frequently than people without health insurance. One might \nask why in the world would they go to the emergency room for routine \ncare if they have Medicaid coverage? Because they can't find a doctor \nto see them at Medicaid prices. Again, ObamaCare is creating the \nillusion of access but with no real access to care but for through the \nemergency room.\n  There are much better ways to expand health coverage than simply \npushing Americans into a dysfunctional safety net program that is \nsupposed to help the most vulnerable in our society but which does not. \nOur side of the aisle made that argument consistently 4 years ago, but \nthe President and his allies chose not to listen and decided to go it \nthemselves on a purely party-line vote when ObamaCare was passed. Maybe \nafter voters render their verdict on ObamaCare in November, we will \nhave another chance to revisit this issue.\n  Rather than asking the States to expand their existing Medicaid \nPrograms, the Federal Government should give each State greater \nflexibility to design a program that meets those States' needs. What \nworks best in Texas may not work as well in New York and vice versa. \nWhat we ought to do is give the States a defined amount of Medicaid \nfunds with very few strings attached so they can create innovative \nprograms that provide quality care. One of the good things about doing \nthat is the States would actually be the laboratories of democracy we \nhave talked about from time to time, where we can actually learn from \nbest practices and innovations, and other States can then use that \nknowledge to improve access to quality health care at a more affordable \nprice.\n  I will tell my colleagues that despite all of our differences over \nObamaCare, Republicans and Democrats alike both want to find a way to \nmake health care more affordable and more accessible. Unfortunately, \nObamaCare has proven not to have worked out as the most ardent \nadvocates hoped or promised.\n  Republicans believe the best way to achieve these goals is to leave \nthe choices in the hands of patients. That is the fundamental \ndifference between ObamaCare and the alternatives. The President wants \nthe government to choose the plan, to choose the doctor, and to make \nthose decisions for patients. We think it is better to leave those \nchoices in the hands of patients, in consultation with their own \npersonal physicians--a doctor they have come to trust over the years--\nto help counsel them on what are wise health care choices for \nthemselves and their families. We can add to that by increasing \ntransparency and enlarging a real marketplace so people can shop, as \nconsumers do day in and day out. We know that kind of transparency in\n\n[[Page S96]]\n\nterms of price and competition, when it comes to people providing a \nservice, improves the quality, and it lowers costs. That is what our \nmarket economy teaches us. We know, I would hope by now, the answer is \nnot to place more people into a broken government program that takes \ntheir choices away.\n\n  As I said earlier, good intentions do not always produce good \nresults. But I would hope we would learn from our mistakes as \nindividuals, as a Congress. The results of the last 5 years include \nsome pretty miserable outcomes that I would hope would cause us to \nreconsider, as we go forward together, to try to address the problem of \nchronic joblessness in our society.\n  As I said, the last 5 years have given us the longest period of high \nunemployment since the Great Depression, a massive decline in labor \nworkforce participation. The percentage of people actually looking for \nwork has declined to a 30-year low. It has also given us growing income \ninequality--the thing the President says he cares the most about, but \nhe does not offer any proposals that deal with the underlying cause, \nmerely treating the symptoms by paying people extended unemployment \nbenefits.\n  We have seen an explosion of job-killing regulations. I am reminded \nwhen I see the Presiding Officer that I think the city with the lowest \nunemployment rate in America is Bismarck, ND, if I am not mistaken. \nClose behind that is Midland, TX. The two things they have in common \nare the shale gas renaissance and the jobs that have been created by \nunleashing this great American job-creating machine and particularly in \nthe energy sector. So what we need to do is look for ways to avoid some \nof the job-killing regulations, which make it harder, not easier, to \nproduce those jobs in places such as North Dakota and Texas.\n  We have also seen millions of canceled health care policies, millions \nof people with higher premiums, not lower premiums like the President \noffered and promised. We have seen an unprecedented increase in our \nnational debt and an incredible complacency when it comes to adding $6 \nbillion more to our national debt for a 3-month extension of long-term \nunemployment benefits.\n  We have seen, not surprisingly, associated with all of this a huge \nerosion in the public trust in the Federal Government. That is why this \nside of the aisle has been pushing, and will continue to push, a new \nset of policies that address the biggest concerns of the American \npeople and the biggest challenges facing the American dream.\n  The only question is this list of 11 bills that Senators on this side \nof the aisle would like to offer on this underlying legislation, not \njust to treat the symptoms of unemployment, but actually deal with the \nroot causes--whether the majority leader is going to allow those \namendments to be taken up, debated, and voted on, and to allow the \nSenate to work its will on a bipartisan basis. That remains to be seen. \nIf he does not--and recent history does not give me a lot of optimism \nthat he will--then I think it will become even more transparent that \nthis is not an exercise in trying to help people who are out of work. \nThis is an exercise in trying to politicize this in a way that \ndistracts attention from the epic failure of ObamaCare and its wet \nblanket effect on the American economy and job creation.\n  So I guess hope springs eternal. You cannot serve in this body and \nhope to make a difference in the lives of the American people without \nbeing an optimist by nature, but, unfortunately, in the case of the \nmajority leader and this, there is some doubt in my mind. I hope he \nproves me wrong. I hope he will open this up to an amendment process \nthat will allow us to deal with the root causes and will not just be \nanother exercise in gotcha Washington politics.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Madam President, family is important to Hoosiers. We \nwork hard every day to care and to provide for our loved ones and to \ngive our children and grandchildren the opportunity to live healthy and \nfulfilling lives.\n  We also recognize that strong families are often built on good jobs. \nGood jobs allow us to put food on the table, educate our children, and \nultimately retire in dignity, and good jobs are, of course, critical \nfor stronger communities and a vibrant economy. It all starts with \njobs. Without good jobs, nothing else works.\n  As I have said before, most Americans think Congress can do \nsomething--even if it is just not doing any harm--to help create jobs \nand strengthen our economy. Unfortunately, over the last year, the \npartisan gridlock that has too often defined Congress has been in full \nforce.\n  During the starkest example of the gridlock, the government shut \ndown. A poll found that Americans cited Congress as the single biggest \nthreat to our economy. That should have been a wake-up call for all of \nus, a clear signal to collectively focus on working together to give \nour families the opportunity to compete and succeed in the American \neconomy.\n  Opportunity means creating the conditions for businesses to expand \nand to hire more workers. It means an economic environment that \nencourages the private sector to invest and innovate in an ever-\nchanging global economy. It means providing American workers with the \ntraining they need to get the skills and education necessary to fill \nthe jobs available today and to adapt to fill the jobs and careers of \nthe future.\n  As we start a new year, I encourage us all to refocus our efforts and \nour attention on our responsibilities to the families we represent. To \nthat end, I am focused on my opportunity agenda--a blueprint of \ncommonsense policies designed to expand economic opportunities for \nHoosier workers and workers all across our country, for businesses, and \nfor their families in four critical areas where we can help create more \ngood jobs: No. 1, going all-in on American energy; No. 2, providing \nAmerican workers the training necessary to fill the jobs available \ntoday; No. 3, investing in our infrastructure; and, No. 4, keeping our \ncountry competitive through exports and innovation.\n  Why are these four areas important to families across our country? As \nthe Presiding Officer knows, a strong domestic energy economy is at the \nfoundation of our potential for economic success. Affordable, reliable \nenergy allows families to heat their homes and to travel to work and to \nschool. Affordable, reliable energy ensures businesses can manufacture \nproducts efficiently, on time, and can compete in our global economy. \nAffordable, reliable American energy ensures that we are investing our \nmoney here at home rather than each year sending hundreds of billions \nof dollars overseas to buy energy that is already here in the United \nStates. The production of affordable, reliable American energy here at \nhome creates jobs here at home, not overseas.\n  Our country is blessed with abundant energy resources. In fact, in my \nState of Indiana, we produce coal, biofuels, wind and solar energy, and \nnatural gas--and we can do more.\n  Going all-in on American energy also means establishing smart \nregulations that protect our environment while also allowing our \neconomy to grow. My home State of Indiana is a large producer of coal, \nas I know the Presiding Officer's home State of North Dakota is. We are \nannually in the top 10 of coal-producing States in the Nation. The coal \nindustry supports over 3,000 jobs in 10 southwestern Indiana counties \nand contributes over $750 million to our State's economy.\n  Hoosiers count on the affordable, reliable energy from our home State \ncoal. This is why efforts to regulate carbon dioxide emissions at coal \nplants should be realistic about the technology that exists now and not \nnegatively impact our economy. If we do not address these standards in \na commonsense way, the affordable, reliable energy that Hoosier \nfamilies and businesses depend on is in doubt. We should also continue \nfull speed ahead on technology efforts that will make coal a cleaner \nand cleaner energy source for all of our energy needs in the years \nahead.\n  Indiana is also a leader in biofuel production, where more than 600 \nHoosiers work at 13 ethanol plants and 5 biodiesel plants across our \nState. I have seen firsthand the good work being done at many of these \nplants. They use products grown here at home\n\n[[Page S97]]\n\nto produce fuel here at home, to power vehicles here at home.\n  With ethanol and other biofuels, we are not, again, sending our hard-\nearned money overseas. We are putting our neighbors to work. We are \nputting their hard work into creating more energy and more opportunity \nin our communities and across our country. This industry is another \nexample of American-made energy and American-made entrepreneurial \nleadership.\n  Second, it is very important we help our workforce hit the ground \nrunning by improving workforce development and training. The Department \nof Labor estimates there are 3.9 million job openings in the United \nStates right now, despite a national unemployment rate of 7 percent and \nmillions of Americans looking for work.\n  Estimates by the Manufacturing Institute indicate there are as many \nas 600,000 job openings in our country that remain unfilled because \nemployers cannot find workers who have the necessary skills to do that \njob. We must make a better effort to close this skills gap.\n  I often hear from Hoosier business owners, educators, and workers \nabout the pressing need to close the skills gap and have people trained \nin all of these opportunities and skills. Workers need to know that the \ntime they spend training is more likely to lead to employment in a \ngood-paying job, as employers are more likely to hire people they know \nhave the training that is needed to be productive on day one.\n  Third, it is important we invest in infrastructure. Indiana is called \nthe ``Crossroads of America.'' In order to live up to our name, we need \nthe best roads, the best rail, the best airports, the best waterways so \nwe can continue to expand our logistics and other transportation \nindustries. Today, 22 percent of our bridges are structurally deficient \nor functionally obsolete. Seventeen percent of Indiana's roads are in \npoor or mediocre condition.\n  A good way to create jobs in Indiana and across the country is to \nestablish the right conditions for investment in our country's \ninfrastructure. I have and will continue to support encouraging \ninvestment by requiring government agencies to work together to cut \nredtape, set deadlines, and increase transparency.\n  We should be building things in this country, and that means \nexpediting the transportation, energy, and other infrastructure \nprojects that strengthen our economy.\n  Finally, it is important we keep Hoosier and all American businesses \nand industries competitive through the promotion of exports and \ninnovation. We produce some of the best quality products in the world--\nfrom automobiles, to agricultural products, to medical devices--and we \nshould continue to look for opportunities to sell these products to the \nrest of the world.\n  Manufacturing accounts for a big portion of Indiana's exports, and \nmanufactured goods exports support nearly 23 percent of Indiana's \nmanufacturing jobs. That is much higher than the national average. \nSmall businesses account for nearly 17 percent of our exports. We need \nto do more to promote the good work of these Hoosier businesses.\n  American businesses are competing in an increasingly challenging \nglobal economy, and we must promote a global economy that is built on \nresponsible and fair trade policies. I am a longtime supporter of \ncracking down on currency manipulation, which results in an unfair \nplaying field for American manufacturers.\n  The Economic Policy Institute estimated that if we address global \ncurrency manipulation, we could reduce the U.S. goods trade deficit by \nup to $400 billion and create several million jobs right here at home, \nreducing our national unemployment rate. I have supported enhanced \noversight of currency exchange rates, including new requirements that \nthe Commerce Department investigate claims of undervalued foreign \ncurrency at the request of U.S. industry.\n  I also support using U.S. trade law to counter the economic harm to \nU.S. manufacturers caused by this currency manipulation, and tools to \naddress the impact of this misalignment of currency on U.S. industries. \nWe all know good trade policies create good jobs, fuel economic growth, \nand benefit consumers both at home and abroad. Yet we also must \nremember that trade only works when everyone is playing by the same \nrules.\n  That is why I testified before the U.S. International Trade \nCommission regarding the importance of maintaining existing antidumping \nand countervailing duty orders against unfairly traded imports of hot-\nrolled steel. The steel industry supports over 150,000 jobs in Indiana. \nThese trade orders help maintain a level playing field for an already \nvulnerable domestic steel industry. Given a level playing field, \nHoosier workers can compete with anyone in the world, which is why I \nwas pleased the ITC ruled that these trade orders would be maintained.\n  It is critically important that our intellectual property is also \nrespected and is also protected. We have a lot of work to do, but I am \nhopeful that Congress can learn from last year's dysfunction and start \nthis year in a bipartisan way. Senators from both parties can agree, \nthere is nothing more important to American families and American \ncommunities than good jobs. They want us to work for them and not worry \nabout politics.\n  I look forward to continuing these opportunities and these efforts \nunder my opportunity agenda. By working on commonsense, bipartisan \nideas to go all in on American energy, to give workers the tools they \nneed to hit the ground running, to invest in our infrastructure, and to \nkeep homegrown businesses competitive through exports and innovation, \nwe can help lower unemployment and build a stronger economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, 50 years ago today, in his first State \nof the Union Address, President Lyndon Johnson committed America to \nwhat he called a war on poverty. Over the next several years, America \nconducted the most ambitions, determined, and successful campaign in \nhistory to reduce poverty since the Great Depression.\n  Later today, my friend Senator Harkin, the chairman of the Senate \nHELP Committee, will speak in detail about the accomplishments of the \nwar on poverty. I hope my colleagues will listen closely. Senator \nHarkin himself has spent over four decades in Congress working to make \nsure these antipoverty programs continue to work.\n  We believe on our side of the aisle that we have to be careful in \nspending taxpayers' dollars. But we also believe in a safety net, a \nsafety net for those Americans who, because of circumstances beyond \ntheir control, need a helping hand. I once worked for a man who served \nin the Senate. He was my inspiration to enter public life. I am honored \ntoday to have his Senate seat. He was Paul Douglas of Illinois. He once \nsaid, ``To be a liberal one does not have to be a wastrel.'' He went on \nto say, ``We must, in fact, be thrifty if we are to be really humane.'' \nI think we can balance both. We can help people who need a helping \nhand, but we can do it without wasting taxpayers' dollars.\n  So what did this war on poverty of 50 years ago, that has been much \nmaligned, achieve? Medicare. Medicaid. The Head Start Program. The \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, which was the first time our \nNation committed the Federal Government to helping local school \ndistricts; special education legislation, the Higher Education Act, \nwhich increased grants, loans, and work-study opportunities.\n  My story is a story that many can repeat. I went to college and law \nschool borrowing money from the Federal Government. It was called the \nNational Defense Education Act. I borrowed money to get through college \nand law school; otherwise, I could not have done it. The deal was that \nstarting a year after graduation, you paid it back over 10 years at 3-\npercent interest. I like to think that loan from the government, which \nI paid back, was a good investment. It sure was in my life, for my \nfamily, and I hope some people in Illinois might think it was a good \ninvestment for the Nation. But it is an indication that a helping hand \nfrom the government can make a difference, a profound difference in a \nperson's life.\n  Before the Higher Education Act and the war on poverty, just over 9 \npercent of Americans had college degrees.\n\n[[Page S98]]\n\nToday almost one-third of Americans have at least a bachelor's degree. \nThere has been no act of Congress, since President Lincoln pushed \nthrough the land grant college system during the Civil War, that has \ndone more for higher education to democratize it and to give us the \nscientists, doctors, and other educated citizens we need.\n  Before the war on poverty, before the Higher Education Act, before \nFederal loans for students, take a look at the colleges and \nuniversities. It was the province of those who were well-off. It was \nthe province of great alumni who took care of their sons and daughters. \nIt was a very sophisticated group of people who went on to higher \neducation. It did not include a lot of folks like me, the son of an \nimmigrant woman who grew up in East Saint Louis, IL. But I got my \nchance, and millions like me got their chance, because of the war on \npoverty, because of the Higher Education Act, and because of the \nthoughtful programs of this Federal Government that gave me and many \nothers a helping hand.\n  What else was in the war on poverty? The Civil Rights Act of 1964, \none of the most transformative laws in our history; the Voting Rights \nAct of 1965, which some view as the most important civil rights \nlegislation in our history; the Fair Housing Act of 1968; we expanded \nefforts to feed families who were hungry; we created the food stamp \nprogram, now known as SNAP; and we created the School Breakfast \nProgram.\n  How important is the School Breakfast Program to America and to \neducation? Visit a school. Meet the kids. Talk to the teachers about \nwhat a well-fed child is as a student compared to one who has stomach \npains from lack of breakfast and lack of food.\n  A few years ago there was an interesting exchange, not surprisingly \non the Glenn Beck show on Fox. There was an actor on there who was \nreally upset about the growing role of the Federal Government. Here is \nwhat he said, this actor on Glenn Beck's Fox News show:\n\n       We are a capitalistic society. Okay. I go into business and \n     I don't make it, I go bankrupt. They, the government, aren't \n     going to bail me out.\n\n  And then he added:\n\n       I have been on food stamps and welfare. Anybody help me \n     out? No.\n\n  Wait a minute. He was on food stamps and welfare. That came from the \nsame government he was just maligning. Let me repeat that. This \nconservative actor said:\n\n       I have been on food stamps and welfare. Anybody help me \n     out? No.\n\n  That is an indication of how people get so far afield when they \ncriticize the government without pausing to reflect. Folks used to say \nto us during the course of this health care debate: Keep government out \nof my Medicare. My Medicare is important to me. Do not mess it up. Do \nnot let government--government created your Medicare. Government \ncreated Medicaid for the poor and disabled.\n  The idea or some variation on it seems to be the position of many of \nour friends across the aisle. When it comes to government efforts to \nreduce poverty and create opportunities for middle-income and poor \nfamilies, they seem to think these programs are just going to reward \nthe lazy.\n  We are in the middle of a debate right now on unemployment benefits. \nThe belief on the Republican side of the aisle is, if you give people \nenough money to pay their rent and their utility bills, to put gas in \ntheir cars, those lazy people will never go to work.\n  I do not believe that. Will there be people who cheat the system? Of \ncourse. There are wealthy people cheating our tax system. But the fact \nis, the vast majority of Americans given a helping hand want to get \nback to work.\n  The extension of unemployment benefits is the humane and right thing \nto do. It used to be the bipartisan thing to do. Right now, we are \ndivided. We could only get six Republicans to step up to extend \nunemployment benefits in America. Those benefits are now cut off at 27 \nweeks. The average person is out of work in our country for 38 weeks. I \nhave met them and I have talked to them. Perhaps people on both sides \nof the aisle should. These folks want to get back to work. They are \ndesperate to get back to work. But if you do not give them unemployment \nbenefits they cannot put gas in the car, they cannot pay for their cell \nphone. In this day and age, as Senator Reed of Rhode Island said on the \nfloor, that is how you go to work and find a job. You need to have your \ncell phone and your car to get up and go. It is not a matter of taking \na bus and filling out an application on a clipboard any more. We need \nto give those folks a helping hand. Government needs to do it, because \nat this point in their lives they desperately need it.\n  I say to my friends in the right conservative circles, put down those \nAyn Rand books for a minute and take a look at the real world and \nlisten to some real economists too. The nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office tells us that extending unemployment benefits for the \nlong-term unemployed will create 240,000 jobs in America.\n  How is that possible? How can spending $26 billion on unemployment \nbenefits create jobs? I thought these folks were out of work. What do \nthey do with the money they receive in unemployment benefits? Do they \nput it into the stock market, into their savings account? No. They \nspend it. They buy clothes for their kids. They pay the utility bills. \nThey fill up their cars with gas. They put it right back in the economy \nbecause they are living literally day-to-day. So 240,000 jobs will be \ncreated if we extend unemployment benefits. For those who say we should \nnot, sadly they are reducing the number of jobs available. That is the \nfundamental point that many on the far right do not seem to understand. \nHelping to reduce poverty and create opportunity in America is going to \nhelp us all. All of us. It creates a stronger economy.\n  I know Paul Ryan. He is my neighbor, being a Congressman from the \nneighboring State of Wisconsin. I like him. We served on the Simpson-\nBowles Commission together. He is thoughtful. We disagree on a lot of \nissues, but he is a thoughtful, conscientious person. But when he calls \nAmerica's social safety net a hammock that creates dependency and \nperpetrates poverty, he is just plain wrong.\n  Opponents of government action who look at the fact that there are \nstill poor people in America and conclude that therefore the war on \npoverty failed are just as wrong as he is. The official poverty level \nlooks only at cash income. It does not take into account noncash \nbenefits such as SNAP or housing assistance.\n  A recent analysis by the Center on Budget Policies and Priorities \nused a broader, more accurate measure of poverty called the \nsupplemental poverty measure. That measure looks not just at cash \nincome but noncash benefits. Using this more accurate measure, the \ncenter found that government benefits elevated 40 million Americans out \nof poverty in 2011.\n  We have these Republican critics of the food stamp program who say: \nIt is just plain wrong that so many people are drawing food stamps. \nThey ought to go out and meet these people. Who are these people? Out \nof the 43, 44 million Americans drawing food stamps, over half of them \nare children, dependent children who are receiving enough money through \nthe food stamp program for their parents to put food on the table. \nThere is also a large portion of them who are elderly and disabled, and \na large portion, 1 million, who are veterans. Those are the recipients. \nMany of those who qualify for food stamps are working. They are not \ngetting a very good paycheck. They are earning the current minimum \nwage, which is not enough to get by. Food stamps give them a little \nextra help each month to keep food for their family. That is the \nreality of low-income, hard-working Americans, a reality which sadly \nthis Chamber is removed from many times. This Chamber does not realize \nwhat people are up against.\n  Social Security has had the largest impact of any program. But means-\ntested programs, such as SNAP, the earned income child credit and the \nchild tax credit, lifted 20 million Americans, including 8\\1/2\\ million \nchildren, out of poverty. When the Republicans in the House \nparticularly want to cut back on these programs, they are going to push \nthese hard-working, low-income families deeper into debt and further \naway from the basics they need in life.\n  The poverty rate in America is already too high. Growing income \ninequality should be an embarrassment\n\n[[Page S99]]\n\nto all of us. Lifting 40 million Americans out of poverty through the \nwar on poverty programs and government assistance is an undeniable \nsuccess. Without the public social safety net, the poverty rate in \nAmerica would be nearly twice what it is today.\n  Joe Califano served as the Secretary of Health, Education, and \nWelfare under President Johnson. Here is what he said 15 years ago:\n\n       If there is a prize for the political scam of the 20th \n     century, it should go to the conservatives for propagating as \n     conventional wisdom that the Great Society programs of the \n     1960s were misguided and failed social experiments that \n     wasted taxpayers' money.\n       Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, from 1963 \n     when Lyndon Johnson took office until 1970 as the impact of \n     his Great Society programs were felt, the portion of \n     Americans living below poverty dropped from 22.2 percent to \n     12.6 percent, the most dramatic decline over such a brief \n     period in this century.\n\n  Califano went on to say:\n\n       This reduction in poverty did not just happen, it was the \n     result of a focused, tenacious effort to revolutionize the \n     role of the Federal Government in a series of interventions \n     that literally enriched the lives of millions of Americans.\n\n  Some of the critics say that it is the job of churches and charities, \nnot government, to help those who have hit a rough patch in life.\n  One of my ``sheroes'' in life is a woman named Sister Simone \nCampbell. She is the director of NETWORK, a Catholic social justice \norganization, and she is probably better known as the ringleader of the \n``Nuns on the Bus.''\n  Sister Simone Campbell testified last summer at a House hearing \nchaired by Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. She said that Bread for \nthe World has calculated how much money religious institutions and \ncharities would have to raise just to make up for food stamp cuts \nproposed by last year's House Republican budget.\n  Sister Campbell said: Every church, synagogue, mosque, and house of \nworship in the United States--every one of them--would need to raise \n$50,000 each year for 10 years to make up for proposed cuts that the \nRepublicans wanted to make in the food stamp program in the House of \nRepresentatives. That is only one cut that they have proposed.\n  To say that the charities of America, which are legendary and well \ndeserved in terms of their praise--to say that they can take care of \nthis problem ignores the reality.\n  Denigrating and decimating anti-poverty programs won't reduce poverty \nor create jobs or strengthen America's struggling and shrinking middle \nclass. As President Johnson said nearly 50 years ago: ``Our time is \nnecessarily short and our agenda is already long.''\n  So we ask our friends on the other side of the aisle to work with us \nto help Americans. Please start off by extending unemployment benefits \nfor 1.3 million Americans. For goodness sake, at this time of year when \nmost of this country is facing bone-chilling cold in Wisconsin and \nIllinois--we just went through it this week. I have never seen \nconditions such as this that I can ever remember--and to think that it \nmight be part of an unemployed worker's family, wondering if they might \nbe able to pay that utility bill, keep the kids warm, put some food on \nthe table, while they look for a job--and we pick this moment in time \nto cut unemployment benefits.\n  We are a caring and compassionate nation. If we can't stand behind \nthose who are struggling at this point in life, who are we? What are \nwe? There are all kinds of excuses that could be made, but at the \nbottom line it gets down to something very basic.\n  John Kasich is the Governor of Ohio. He and I came to know one \nanother when we were both elected to the House of Representatives some \nyears ago. He is a Republican. He is one of the few who won in 1982 and \nwent on to become Governor of the State.\n  He had a moment of reflection the other day, which I will paraphrase. \nHe said: I would like to say to my Republican friends, when you die and \nget to the pearly gates, St. Peter is not going to ask you how much you \ninvested in your life in making government smaller, you are going to be \nasked what did you do to help the poor while you were on Earth?\n  That is a legitimate question Governor Kasich raised, not only for \nRepublicans but for all of us. What have we done to help those people \nwho are struggling to get by--those who would be very interested in a \nlong-term debate about growing our economy but are more interested in \nputting food on the table today. That is what it is all about.\n  The war on poverty successfully raised Americans out of poverty. The \ngovernment stepped in when there was no place else to turn. That is \ntruly the role of government, to be there when there is no place else \nto turn.\n  The American family, through its government, stood by those who were \nless fortunate. We have to do the same thing.\n  I will close by saying the proposal Senator McConnell made yesterday \ntroubles me greatly. He said: We will pay for the extension of \nunemployment benefits, $26 billion, but the way we will pay for it--the \nRepublicans suggested--was to eliminate that section of the Affordable \nCare Act which guarantees that you can't discriminate against people \nbecause of preexisting medical conditions.\n  What the situation was before this law passed was, of course, if \nsomeone had a child with diabetes, if their wife was recovering from \ncancer, they might not be able to buy health insurance or if they did, \nit would be too expensive. We changed that. We said they can't \ndiscriminate against people with preexisting conditions.\n  Senator McConnell came to the floor yesterday and said: We want to \neliminate the personal responsibility section when it comes to the \nAffordable Care Act, we want to eliminate the so-called individual \nmandate, and that is how we will pay for 1 year of unemployment \nbenefits.\n  What Senator McConnell was suggesting was reintroducing into health \ninsurance this discrimination against people with preexisting \nconditions for 300 million Americans as a way to pay for 3 months or 1 \nyear of unemployment benefits. That is a terrible trade-off.\n  I know how much the other side hates and loathes the Affordable Care \nAct. A Senator from Arkansas, Dale Bumpers, used a phrase often: They \nhate the Affordable Care Act like the devil hates holy water.\n  But the fact is to turn on 300 million Americans and to remove their \nprotection under the Affordable Care Act against discrimination based \non preexisting medical conditions to pay for unemployment benefits--\nwhat a Faustian bargain.\n  Is that the best the other side can come up with? It isn't.\n  The best they can come up with is to stand by these people, the less \nfortunate people among us struggling to find work and give them the \nbasics of life, give them the necessities they need to get by. I am \nconfident they will find a job, get back to work, and they will be \ntaxpayers again someday. Let's stand by them, their spouses, and their \nchildren in this time of need.\n  That is what happened 50 years ago with President LBJ's State of the \nUnion address. That is what should happen today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. As we begin a new year, the Senate returns with many \nsignificant challenges before us. One such challenge is the security of \nour citizens' private information.\n  Just before Christmas, news broke out that Target, a popular retail \nstore in Nebraska and all across this Nation, had experienced an \nenormous data breach involving nearly 40 million debit and credit \naccount numbers. That is nearly 1 in 10 Americans who had their \nsensitive personal information put in jeopardy.\n  Between November 27 and December 15, scammers silently stole massive \namounts of consumer information from Target. The timing of this breach \nis significant, not only because it happened during the peak of the \nholiday shopping season, but also because this data is reportedly being \nsold on black markets around the world.\n  On December 20, Target announced: ``The information involved in this \nincident included customer name, credit or debit card number, and the \ncard's expiration date and CVV.''\n  It was further determined on December 27 that encrypted PIN \ninformation, or encrypted personal identification numbers, associated \nwith that data was also stolen.\n\n[[Page S100]]\n\n  This wasn't only an attack on Target, which has 14 stores in my home \nState of Nebraska, it was a crime against millions of hardworking \ncitizens. Let me be clear. It is also much more than just a mere \ninconvenience for consumers.\n  Yes, such thefts complicate the daily routines of Americans, but it \ncan also potentially damage their credit ratings, and it is an \nincredible tax on people's time. It also leaves many feeling \nvulnerable, including, unfortunately, the most vulnerable among us, the \nelderly.\n  As a Member of the Senate Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction \nover this issue, I urge the chairman and our ranking member to begin \nlooking into this matter further. Our Nation's entire data security \nsystem is in desperate need of revamping, and that is going to require \ncongressional action.\n  What happened with that Target breach was not an isolated incident.\n  TJX Companies, which owns national retail chains TJ Maxx and \nMarshalls, was breached in 2007. Sony and Epsilon were also attacked in \n2011.\n  We learned on New Year's Eve that the popular social communication \nplatform Snapchat was also hacked, a breach of about 4.6 million user \nnames with their corresponding phone numbers. These are only the latest \nexamples, but we all know the problems run much, much deeper.\n  Identity theft has been the No. 1 consumer complaint at the Federal \nTrade Commission for the last 13 years in a row. The average financial \nloss for each instance of identity theft is $4,930, and it has been \nestimated that identity theft resulted in a $24.7 billion loss for our \ncountry in 2012.\n  Given these realities, we need to dedicate more time and energy to \nsolutions that substantially improve the safety of our online \nactivities. While the Target breach is important and deserves our \nattention, so too should the security risks posed by healthcare.gov, as \nwell as the Federal and State insurance exchanges set up under \nObamaCare.\n  Experian, a major U.S. credit reporting bureau, recently released its \n``2014 Data Breach Industry Forecast,'' which states: ``The healthcare \nindustry, by far, will be the most susceptible to publicly disclosed \nand widely scrutinized data breaches in 2014.''\n  As those who found out the hard way can tell us, healthcare.gov takes \nand holds a lot of sensitive information, including our social security \nnumbers, names, and other information that can be transmitted. It has \nalso been reported that hackers have attempted to break into the Web \nsite at least 16 different times. Several experts say those numbers are \nvery conservative estimates of known attempts.\n  Health and Human Services contractors also identified security \nvulnerabilities, which HHS ignored, before the site went public on \nOctober 1.\n  The protections and breach notifications standards for ObamaCare, \nwhich people were forced into, don't even meet the minimum standards \nput in place for the private sector. Every Nebraskan, and every \nAmerican, has the right to know if their private information has been \ncompromised because of ObamaCare.\n  Fortunately, data security appears to be an area where Republicans \nand Democrats can come together and do something positive for the \nAmerican people.\n  We must take great care, however, not to make the problem worse. \nSmart policy results from an open, collaborative process, with input \nfrom businesses, consumers, and security experts. That is going to be \nthe answer, not more red tape.\n  We should seek to streamline our data security laws to provide \nclarity and consistency. I look forward to working with my colleagues \non the commerce committee to address these data breaches and to protect \nthe integrity of Nebraskans' and Americans' personal information.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. While the distinguished Senator from Nebraska is still on \nthe floor, I found much to agree with in her comments.\n  I hope that after we introduce the Personal Data Privacy and Security \nAct she may wish to become a cosponsor. This would better protect \nAmericans from the growing threat of data breaches and identity theft.\n  Last year, according to Verizon's report, there were more than 600 \npublicly disclosed data breaches all over the country.\n  The recent breach of Target involved debit and credit card data of as \nmany as 14 million customers. That is a reminder that developing a \ncomprehensive national strategy to protect data privacy and cyber \nsecurity remains one of the most challenging and important issues \nfacing our Nation.\n  The Personal Data Privacy and Security Act will help meet this \nchallenge, by better protecting Americans from the growing threat of \ndata breaches and identity theft. I thank Senators Franken, Schumer, \nand Blumenthal for cosponsoring it.\n  When I first introduced this bill 9 years ago, I thought we very \nurgently needed privacy reforms for the American people. At that time, \nthe threat to the American people was nowhere near as extensive as it \nis today.\n  The Judiciary Committee has favorably reported this bill in the \npast--Republicans and Democrats have joined together numerous times--\nbut it has languished on the Senate calendar.\n  I wish to point out some of the dangers to Americans' privacy and our \nnational security posed by data breaches that have not gone away. \nAccording to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, more than 662 million \nrecords have been involved in data security breaches since 2005. In \nVerizon's ``2013 Data Breach Investigations Report,'' there were more \nthan 600 publicly disclosed data breaches.\n  These are just the ones that are publicly disclosed.\n  The Personal Data Privacy and Security Act requires companies that \nhave databases with sensitive personal information on Americans to \nestablish and implement data privacy and security programs. The bill \nwould also establish a single nationwide standard for data breach \nnotification and require notice to consumers when their sensitive \npersonal information has been compromised. It provides for tough \ncriminal penalties for anyone who would intentionally and willfully \nconceal the fact that a data breach has occurred when the breach causes \neconomic damage to consumers. The requirement for companies to publicly \ndisclose a breach will also encourage them to implement far better \nsecurity than many have today.\n  Protecting privacy rights is of critical importance to all of us, \nregardless of party or ideology. I hope all Senators will join with \nthis.\n\n\n                       Retirement of Barry Meyer\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I would like to speak for a few minutes \non a personal matter. It is about a dear friend of mine, Barry Meyer. I \nwould like to recognize his remarkable career. He is retiring this \nmonth from Warner Brothers after 42 years with the company.\n  We know that Warner Brothers is one of America's most legendary \nentertainment companies. It is a household name for families around the \nNation. I think of the times I have walked through the company's \ngrounds with Barry Meyer. We would talk about his coming there as a \nyoung lawyer and about the history of the company that he eventually \ncame to lead. He showed an impressive sense of history, and it is \ngratifying to see somebody who takes such pride in his work.\n  We have all heard of Warner Brothers, but far fewer Americans have \nheard about the man behind the magic for the past 14 years. It is a \ntestament to his leadership as chairman and CEO that he allowed the \ncompany and its properties to shine in the spotlight.\n  Despite his quiet style, Barry stood at the forefront of pop culture \nduring his tenure at Warner Brothers. Think of movies and television \nshows such as ``Harry Potter,'' ``The Big Bang Theory,'' ``The Blind \nSide,'' and ``The Dark Knight'' trilogy. They made people laugh, cry, \nor simply marvel at the memorable productions that have sprung from his \ntenure at this company.\n  I would also note as a lifelong Batman fan that I have had the \nopportunity to see two of Barry's productions from the inside while \nthey were filming. I can speak firsthand to the culture he fostered at \nWarner Brothers that brought people together and allowed creativity to \nflourish.\n\n[[Page S101]]\n\n  Barry first joined Warner Brothers in 1971--before I was in the \nSenate, I might add--as director of business affairs for the television \ndivision. In 1999 he became chairman and CEO. His steady leadership of \nthe company came at a time when the entertainment industry was \nbeginning to face new challenges. The industry was facing the rise of \nthe Internet as well as the tremendous challenge of online piracy. \nBarry pushed the company to innovate, but he also became an important \nvoice about the impact online piracy has on our economy and on \nindustries that are a vibrant part of American life. His counsel has \nbeen invaluable to me as Congress has looked for solutions to address \nthis issue. He has always been available to give advice--solid advice \nbased on knowledge, not on emotion.\n  Warner Brothers has been one of the world's most successful \nentertainment companies under Barry's tenure, but he has also focused \non humanitarian and charitable pursuits. He is a member of the board of \ndirectors for Human Rights Watch and the advisory board of the National \nMuseum of American History here at the Smithsonian.\n  He was also recognized in 2006 with the American Jewish Committee's \nDorothy and Sherrill C. Corwin Human Relations Award for his \nhumanitarian efforts. I know that when he was given that award, his \nrequest was that the speakers not praise him but instead praise things \nof importance to all Americans. This is typical of Barry Meyer as a \nperson.\n  Among these efforts was joining with his wife Wendy to establish \nscholarships at the University of Southern California to support \nstudents who have been in foster care. Barry and Wendy have wonderful \nchildren and grandchildren. They have a loving family with them. \nVisitors to their home find that it is a welcoming place that feels \nlived in, a place where children and grandchildren can feel comfortable \nand play. Barry and Wendy are fortunate to have that family. What they \nhave done is they have worked to help those who have not necessarily \nhad that advantage.\n  My wife Marcelle and I have gotten to know Barry and Wendy. They have \nbeen together with us in Vermont, here in Washington, and out in \nCalifornia. Some people who have the position he does might make sure \neverybody knows that they are important--not so with either one of \nthem. They are down-to-earth and quiet. When we get together, we pick \nup the conversation we had months before. They make you feel as if you \nare a member of the family.\n  So this remarkable couple is going to be working in other endeavors.\n  There have been some great articles about Barry, as he looks back on \nhis career and the work he has done to make sure the company remains in \ngood hands with his successor. As he begins this next chapter of his \nlife, I wish Barry all the best. I congratulate him on a wonderful and \ndistinguished career. Warner Brothers and the entertainment industry \nare not going to be quite the same without him, but he leaves behind a \nlegacy, an example for the next generation to follow. I know his \nsuccessor, and I wish Kevin Tsujihara the very best in following him.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a December 29, 2013, article from The Wrap, which my daughter \nAlicia showed me.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From TheWrap, Dec. 29, 2013]\n\n  Barry Meyer Ends 42-Year Tenure at Warner Bros.--A Modest Mogul Who \n                         Shunned the Spotlight\n\n                     (By Brent Lang and Lucas Shaw)\n\n       This year was Meyer's last at Warner Bros. after more than \n     four decades at the studio.\n       One of the most low-key moguls in Hollywood, Barry Meyer \n     will slip from the stage this January, when he relinquishes \n     his title as chairman of Warner Bros.\n       But Meyer's 42-year tenure at the studio--a remarkable \n     record in its own right, including 14 years at the helm--is \n     notable for being one of the most effective in the studio's \n     history.\n       Under his stewardship, Warner Bros. has consistently ranked \n     among the industry leaders in box office, syndication sales \n     and television ratings, launching franchises like ``Harry \n     Potter,'' driving the international success of shows like \n     ``Two and a Half Men'' all while managing the company during \n     a rocky corporate merger with AOL, the rise of digital piracy \n     and the steep decline of home entertainment.\n       And yet, Meyer, 69, is someone you rarely saw quoted in the \n     media or taking victory laps with stars of the big or small \n     screen--he generally left that to others.\n       Meyer gave up the CEO title to Kevin Tsujihara last March, \n     but has remained as chairman to ease the transition. Next \n     month, Tsujihara will succeed Meyer in that title as well.\n       Typical of Meyer's effectiveness behind-the-scenes came \n     when the studios were trying to convince Chris Dodd, the \n     former U.S. senator from Connecticut, to take the job as the \n     movie industry's top lobbyist.\n       Meyer and Walt Disney Company Chairman Bob Iger took Dodd \n     to dinner and suggested his reservations about becoming the \n     Motion Picture Association of America's new chairman and CEO \n     were unwarranted.\n       ``He said `Be a leader,' and that sounds like a simple \n     enough thing to say--but that's what he was at Warner \n     Bros.,'' Dodd told TheWrap. ``He was not a grandstander at \n     all and he does not seek the spotlight. He was not worried if \n     his name was in the press.''\n       Dodd also recalled that at a screening of ``Argo'' by the \n     Motion Picture Association of America, Meyer stood in the \n     back of the room as the audience applauded director Ben \n     Affleck and the real life CIA agent Tony Mendez, whose \n     heroism inspired the hit film. He waved off Dodd's attempts \n     to take the stage and share in the adulation.\n       ``That was a quintessential moment and that's why he got \n     listened to every time he talked,'' Dodd said. ``People knew \n     he never had agenda.''\n       Even Meyer's rivals agree that the mogul's style was one of \n     unusual discretion (he declined to be interviewed for this \n     piece). ``He never looked for recognition,'' Ron Meyer, vice \n     chairman of NBCUniversal, told TheWrap (no relation). ``He \n     never looked to have his name out there.''\n       Meyer's accomplishments came at a time when the \n     entertainment industry was beset by tectonic changes in how \n     people consume, distribute and pay for entertainment.\n       ``He was a source of stability in a choppy sea,'' Hal \n     Vogel, CEO of Vogel Capital Management, told TheWrap.\n       Warren Lieberfarb, the former head of home video at the \n     studio, recalled that shortly after Meyer assumed his \n     leadership role, Time Warner's rank and file became dismayed \n     that the merger with AOL had sent the company's share price \n     plummeting.\n       ``There was a lot of discontent and agitation in the \n     organization,'' Lieberfarb recalled. ``Barry brought \n     stability to the company and boosted morale at a critical \n     juncture in the post-AOL period and throughout the decade.''\n       Bob Daly, Meyer's predecessor as chairman, said his one \n     hesitation in recommending him for the job was that he lacked \n     experience on the film side of the business, but noted that \n     his reservations were ultimately unfounded.\n       ``He was a terrific executive and a good negotiator, but he \n     wasn't a movie guy,'' Daly said. ``What he did do was hire \n     great people and put them in a position to succeed.''\n       Meyer's partnership with Alan Horn, who oversaw the movie \n     side of Warner Bros., and later with Horn's successor Jeff \n     Robinov, yielded a string of hits such as the ``Harry \n     Potter'' and ``The Dark Knight'' franchises and critical and \n     commercial successes such as ``Argo,'' ``Mystic River'' and \n     ``The Blind Side.''\n       ``The biggest part of his management style was in his \n     selection of people he would have run his divisions,'' \n     Charles Roven, producer of ``Man of Steel'' and ``The Dark \n     Knight Rises,'' told TheWrap. ``He had the ability to pick \n     excellent people and to trust that they were doing a good \n     job.''\n       Under Meyer, the television side of the business produced a \n     stream of hits such as ``The Big Bang Theory'' and ``Two and \n     a Half Men'' that made it an even bigger source of profits \n     than the film business. Warner Bros. remains one of the most \n     prodigious producers of television series in the world.\n       Meyer also was instrumental in turning the CW into a \n     destination for younger female viewers with shows such as \n     ``The Vampire Diaries'' and ``Gossip Girl.''\n       ``In the syndication arena they've had great success and \n     they've been able to establish some first rate shows,'' Bill \n     Carroll, a television industry analyst for Katz Media Group, \n     said. ``They have a diverse lineup and they have had success \n     each season in introducing new shows.''\n       Facing a challenge from digital disrupters, under Meyer's \n     tenure the studio pushed back against Netflix by limiting its \n     access to new releases, while also signing deals with the \n     streaming giants such as Amazon, that licensed television \n     programs and other content. Warner Bros. has also been a key \n     booster of UltraViolet, the studio backed cloud service that \n     has helped bolster digital sales of films.\n       ``Barry saw what was happening in the world,'' Les Moonves, \n     chairman and CEO of CBS Corp., told TheWrap. ``And he \n     encouraged his executives to experiment and figure things \n     out.''\n       Not surprisingly, Tsujihara, the winner of a year-long \n     executive bake-off that ultimately led to the departures of \n     Robinov and TV chief Bruce Rosenblum, comes from the world of \n     online distribution. Now he faces the challenge of \n     maintaining Warners' success in the face of myriad \n     technological and social challenges.\n       ``Kevin is a really terrific guy,'' Daly said. ``He knows \n     so much about the technology\n\n[[Page S102]]\n\n     and he's a good administrator. When you look at Warner Bros.' \n     90 years, it's an unusual company in that there's been a \n     remarkable continuity of management . . . Kevin is the right \n     man at this time to run this company, but the challenges that \n     he faces will be completely different now than when I ran it \n     or Barry ran it.''\n       ``Barry continued the Warner Bros. tradition--you always \n     groom your replacement,'' Daly added.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I know I look forward to the next time \nMarcelle and I have an opportunity to be with Barry and Wendy, and \nwhile he may be retired, neither one of them is going to be sitting \nback doing nothing. I know them too well for that.\n  With that, Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, 50 years ago today President Lyndon \nJohnson challenged a joint session of Congress and the American people \nto begin a war on poverty. ``Unfortunately,'' President Johnson said, \n``many Americans today live on the outskirts of hope. Our task is to \nreplace their despair with opportunity.''\n  Since President Johnson first issued that call, Congress and our \nNation have taken important steps to build and sustain a circle of \nprotection around the most vulnerable in our society. That protection \nis not as complete or as strong as it can or should be, but through \nprograms such as unemployment insurance--which we are considering this \nweek in this Congress--we are more able to catch our neighbors when \nthey fall and support them as they work to get back to their feet.\n  Earlier this week this Senate began debate on whether to extend \nemergency unemployment insurance for the 3,600 Delawareans and more \nthan 1 million American job seekers whose benefits just expired. It is \nabsolutely critical that we approve this extension.\n  During this fragile but sustained economic recovery, unemployment \ninsurance has been a critical lifeline, one that has prevented millions \nof unemployed Americans from slipping further, falling into poverty. In \n2012, unemployment insurance kept 2.5 million Americans, including \n600,000 children, out of poverty. That means without Federal action to \nextend unemployment insurance, the Nation's poverty rate would have \nbeen doubled what it was. These numbers are for 2012, not the height of \nthe recession.\n  So let's be clear about what we are debating when we discuss an \nunemployment insurance extension. These are long-term benefits for \njobless Americans who have been out of work through no fault of their \nown for more than 26 weeks. When I say through no fault of their own, I \nmean it. People cannot get benefits if they are fired for cause. As \nthey receive unemployment insurance benefits, they must diligently \nsearch for another job. So when we talk about the millions of long-term \nunemployed Americans, we are talking about folks who were laid off \nbecause of the recession, are fighting to get back on their feet, and \nrely on those benefits to keep their families afloat, to keep a roof \nover their head, food on the table, their families together, and \nsustain them as they continue looking for work.\n  Yet 2 weeks ago, funding for long-term emergency unemployment \ninsurance benefits ran out. That meant $300 less weekly income for the \naverage job seeker and that meant $400 million left our economy in just \nthe first week.\n  In Delaware it pulled $877,000 out of our economy. That is money that \notherwise would be spent in local grocery stores and our markets.\n  One of the most vexing comments I have heard in the debate over \nwhether to continue these benefits is that they somehow incentivize \npeople to not bother looking for jobs, to not be serious; they instead \nlull able-bodied Americans into lives of dependency. Given the people I \nknow in Delaware, that is not just absurd, it is, forgive me, \noffensive. As President Obama said yesterday, it sells the American \npeople short.\n  I have met a lot of people in my years of public service. I have \nheard from and spoken with Delawareans up and down my State who are \nrelying on unemployment benefits that they paid into when employed. \nEvery one of them would trade a job for not relying on unemployment \ninsurance in a heartbeat. Let me share a few stories of Delawareans who \nhave contacted me and shared how hard this has been for them.\n  Debbie from Middleton, DE, wrote to me that while she is receiving \nunemployment benefits, she has applied to 156 jobs. She has been \ninterviewed three times. She is 56. She has worked diligently since she \nwas a teenager. She has worked hard. She paid her taxes. She paid into \nthis unemployment insurance system practically her whole life. Yet now \nwhen she needs it most, we fail to continue to provide this lifeline of \nsupport.\n  Linda from Newark wrote to me that on just $258 a week her family has \nbeen barely able to stay afloat. They are doing everything they can to \nkeep up on their bills, to stay current, but even with unemployment \ninsurance they have had to sell some of their family's treasured \npossessions and goods. She wrote to me:\n\n       This is no way for anyone to live. It's disheartening and \n     it is difficult to stay motivated to keep searching.\n\n  Frankly, she said:\n\n       I am thoroughly fed up with being categorized as someone \n     who lives off the Government by collecting unemployment \n     benefits.\n\n  I agree with her because, frankly, Linda, you paid into these \nbenefits for years. This is what it is there for.\n  John from Frederica told me he was laid off from the Dover Air Force \nBase in part because of the sequester and now depends on unemployment \nbenefits while he continues diligently searching for another job. This \nis a man who is a Navy veteran, was willing to make the ultimate \nsacrifice for our country. Yet right now, because of the partisan \ngridlock in this Congress, we are not there for him and his family.\n  The millions of Americans such as Debbie, Linda, and John in Delaware \nface a very tough job market. Nationally, for every available job there \nare three job seekers. The longer someone remains unemployed, the \nharder it becomes for them to find work. The more their skills are out \nof date, the more difficult the search becomes and the more they need \nour support to sustain that job search.\n  I have seen these effects up close and personal in Delaware. In my 3 \nyears as a Senator I have hosted 16 different job fairs to connect \nDelawareans looking for work with employers looking to hire, and I have \nbeen honored to partner with Senator Carper and Congressman Carney in \nhosting these job fairs. In fact, we are hosting another one in Dover, \nDE, in just a few weeks.\n  When you listen to unemployed Delawareans and listen to them talk \nabout their struggle, about how hard it is to keep making ends meet and \nget a job, you get a sense of how important these jobs are for their \nsurvival as families and you get a sense of how much more we can and \nshould be doing to tackle long-term unemployment in America.\n  As poverty of opportunity and hope afflicts too many of our \ncommunities and darkens the lives of too many of our neighbors, let us \nnot suffer in this Chamber from a poverty of imagination, \ndetermination, and ambition. On this issue, which is so fundamental to \nwho we are as a nation and to our service to this body, we cannot give \nin to complacency and apathy. Fighting poverty is hard, and adapting \nour economy to the realities of a new era is a challenge we have \nstruggled with for more than a generation. It is hard finding out how \nto realize an economy with growth that is both strong and more \nequitable, one that is dynamic and creative and competitive and also \nhas a broad middle class, provides security for working families and \nleaves no one behind, an economy that invests in the dreams and \naspirations of every child, but building that economy is surely one of \nthe most urgent and difficult challenges we face. Doing so requires \nthat we put aside our personal politics and ideologies and come \ntogether in areas where, until recently, there has been a broad and \nbipartisan consensus.\n\n  I now hear some of my Republican colleagues talk on this floor about \nthe war on poverty, 50 years later, as having been an abject failure. \nThey make sweeping indictments on government\n\n[[Page S103]]\n\naction, putting small government ideology ahead of the shared national \ngoal of fighting poverty. But this perspective misses the point. The \noriginal war on poverty was made up of a lot of programs, energetic \ninitiatives that worked at every level of government, some that failed \nbut many others that through steady and determined bipartisan work and \nsteady improvement and refinement over the years have become critical, \ncentral, and widely valued strands that hold together our social safety \nnet. Medicare, Medicaid, Head Start, food stamps, unemployment \ninsurance, all of these programs are valued and hold American families \ntogether and sustain American job seekers. Bipartisan leaders across \nthe decades have reaffirmed the importance and value of these programs \ntime and time again. These programs, let's remember, are about so much \nmore than lifting people out of poverty. They are about keeping people \nout of poverty in the first place. We need them to build and strengthen \nthe American middle class, which is one of the greatest legacies of \nthis Nation.\n  As we search for ways to adapt our fight to new times and new \nchallenges, there is no one way to win the war on poverty President \nJohnson declared 50 years ago. It is not a question of big or small \ngovernment, Federal or local action. As President Johnson himself said:\n\n       It will not be a short or easy struggle. No single weapon \n     or strategy will suffice. . . . Poverty is a national \n     problem. . . . But this attack, to be effective, must be \n     organized at the State and local level. . . . For the war on \n     poverty will not be won here in Washington. It must be won in \n     the field, in every private home, in every public office, \n     from the courthouse to the White House.\n\n  This was not an ideological call for big, centralized government. It \nwas an all-hands-on-deck call, a moral call, for our Nation to meet a \nnational challenge. Although we have made progress since he first \naddressed this Congress in 1964, his call to combat poverty remains \njust as important today, even as our challenges have evolved.\n  We have come a long way since the depths of our own great recession \njust a few years ago. More than 8 million private sector jobs have been \ncreated. There has been more than a three-point drop in the national \nunemployment rate. We have resurgent energy, housing, agricultural, and \nmanufacturing sectors. Although a few years have passed since our \neconomy sunk to its lowest lows, this crisis remains for those \nAmericans and their families who are still struggling to find a job \neither for their families' food or to keep a roof over their heads.\n  This week, while we are debating extending emergency unemployment \ninsurance, we should note this is not only obvious and necessary to do, \nit is the beginning of our real work of sustaining the war on poverty.\n  I am proud to be engaged in bipartisan efforts to strengthen the \nmiddle class, to focus on jobs and skills and manufacturing. We have to \nfind bipartisan solutions that engage the private and public sectors, \nFederal and local governments, in putting our people back to work. \nWhile we do that, we cannot forget to continue to insist on a circle of \nprotection around the most vulnerable in our society rather than \nallowing that valued circle to crumble. We have to remember we are all \nin this together, that ``there but for the grace of God go I,'' as we \nsee those in our community, in our families who are struggling in this \nrecovery.\n  We know that today it may be our neighbors, tomorrow it may be us. \nPresident Johnson called on us to focus on the best of America, the \nspirit that we hold each other up, the spirit that builds community \nthrough mutual sacrifice. As we begin our work in this new year to \njump-start our economy and spread hope and opportunity, we must never \nforget that basic spirit which President Johnson called forth and which \nhas kept this country moving from generation to generation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to speak on actually two \ntopics; one on extending the unemployment benefit program that is so \nessential to the people of Maryland and to other fellow Americans and \nalso to comment on the National Security Agency surveillance programs, \nthe need for reform of the program but the need not to reject the \nmission of the agency and cast a disparaging light on the men and women \nwho work there.\n  Let me start first though talking about unemployment benefits. I come \nwith a great sense of urgency and passion that we need to extend these \nunemployment benefits that expired January 1. This is one of the \ncoldest spells we have had in decades in the Northeast-Midwest area. I \nfind it unfathomable, when it is so cold, that the big chill in \nWashington is that we are not going to extend the unemployment \nbenefits, extending a warm helping hand to Americans who have lost \ntheir job through no fault of their own and have been unemployed for \nmore than 6 months.\n  Where are our national priorities? If we cannot help one another, be \na bridge to get to a job, then what is our government all about? We \nspend billions overseas--and I support that. We spend billions on tax \nbreaks to send jobs overseas. I do not support that. I want to make \nsure that for the men and women who do not have a job today but are \nlooking for one every day, that we help them out.\n  Senator Coons, the Senator from Delaware, just spoke and said today \nit could be your neighbor, tomorrow it could be you. I think we are \ngoing to be unemployed unless we start focusing on how to help the \nmiddle class. The middle class is shrinking and unemployment is \nstaggering. We have to lower the unemployment rate, although I want to \nmake sure that during this time while we look at how to create jobs, we \ncontinue to provide a social insurance program that helps people when \nthey are laid off through no fault of their own.\n  My own home State of Maryland is right this very minute affected by \n23,000 people--that is 23,000 families--who have now lost a modest \nbenefit which averages out to about $313 per week. That enables people, \nwhile they are looking for work, to be able to pay for their housing, \npay for their food, and pay for their heat.\n  There are those who are implying that if we provide unemployment \ncompensation or assistance we are going to encourage sloth, laziness, \nlaggardness; that they are going to kind of lounge around not looking \nfor work.\n  Let me tell the story about Western Maryland. This is not Barbara \nMikulski; this is reported in the Baltimore Sun and in the Washington \nPost. We have a community called Washington County. The unemployment \nrate is 7.3 percent. Just a few years ago they had a Good Humor plant. \nThey made ice cream. I visited that ice cream plant. Everybody was \nhappy, and they were busy producing Good Humor, which was sold all over \nthis country. Well, 2 years ago it closed, and 400 good-paying jobs \nleft Hagerstown. That is the bad news.\n\n  The good news is a co-op dairy farmer came in, purchased it, and is \nnow producing milk and ice cream but in smaller amounts. Guess what. \nThey received 1,600 job applications for 36 job openings. They had 36 \njob openings, and 1,600 people in that small rural county applied for \nthose jobs. There were 44 people for every job available.\n  Hagerstown has a great sense of patriotism. They sent many men and \nwomen to fight and die in the two wars we just fought. They have a \ngreat work ethic. They need an opportunity to have jobs. Don't tell \nthose people in Hagerstown or in Salisbury or in Baltimore or \nthroughout my State that they are too lazy. Maybe we are lazy; maybe we \ndon't get the job done.\n  One of the quickest ways to jump-start the economy, if we want to, is \nto pay unemployment compensation. All the data shows that unemployment \ninsurance adds about $1.60 back into the economy.\n  I want to create a sense of urgency. I say to my friends on the other \nside of the aisle: Over a decade ago, you had a man run for the \nPresident of the United States who won. His name is George W. Bush. He \ncampaigned on something that I thought was so interesting. I looked \nforward to actually hearing more about something he called a \ncompassionate conservative. We understand that people are conservative. \nWe understand that people are fiscally conservative, but the message \nwas that we can be compassionate conservatives.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: Remember the \ncompassionate conservative message from\n\n[[Page S104]]\n\na decade ago, and remember that man's father said we need the points of \nlight to light up America. I say, let's be a point of light here. Let's \nadd a beacon of hope to the unemployed so we can help them. Don't be \ncritical of those who can't find work.\n  Let's look at how we can have a job strategy. Let's get our \ninfrastructure back so we can create jobs in the construction industry. \nLet's eliminate the tax breaks that send jobs overseas and bring the \njobs back home. Let's do the tax extenders so we can get people working \nagain. Let's put people back to work.\n  Pass unemployment compensation. Let's pass some job creation bills. \nLet's get America working again, and in order to do that, we need to \nget to work and pass the unemployment compensation bill.\n\n\n                        National Security Agency\n\n  I want to also comment on something else, and that is the NSA, the \nNational Security Agency, which I am very familiar with as a member of \nthe Intelligence Committee, and it is also located in my State. I know \nthe men and women who work there, and I know the mission they provide. \nI also know that a few months ago a man by the name of Edward Snowden \nlit up the airwaves with his illegal barrage of revelations about the \nrole of surveillance that the National Security Agency played. Mr. \nSnowden provided a titillating, mesmerizing inside view of the United \nStates. Whether he was a whistleblower or a traitor, I will leave that \nfor another discussion.\n  Right now we know about NSA surveillance, and it sparked a lot of \ndebate. I think that is good. I think that is healthy.\n  I come to the floor today, first of all, to thank President Obama for \nestablishing a commission to look at this and make recommendations. My \nview is that we ought to review the recommendations of the Presidential \ncommission. We need to make reform where reform is necessary, but let's \nnot reject the mission of the National Security Agency that has \nprotected us for decades and decades. Let us not reject the men and \nwomen who work there every single day, standing sentry to protect us \nagainst attacks, whether it is a terrorist attack or a cyber security \nattack.\n  Yes, we need to protect the civil liberties of the United States of \nAmerica and honor our Constitution. As a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee, and as part of my principles, I have always said: Before we \nask NSA agents--or any member of any intelligence agency--to do \nanything, we should ask: Is it constitutional? Is it legal? Is it \nauthorized? Is it necessary? Remember the criteria. I recommend that \nthis be the grid of the prism we look at: Constitutional, absolutely; \nlegal, a necessity; and authorize. NSA doesn't do it on its own. The \nauthorization comes from the President and his intelligence apparatus. \nAnd last but not at all least, is it necessary to protect people?\n  I think we need to really work on this. President Obama established a \nreview commission. I think it is great, and I think Congress should \nreview it. I know appropriate hearings are already looking into that.\n  At the same time, we should practice reform. I am absolutely on the \nside of reform. I have joined with my colleagues in supporting reform \nfor these programs. For years I led the fight on the accountability of \nleadership. Back in 2007, I wanted the head of the National Security \nAgency confirmed by the Senate. I was stiff-armed by the Congress. I \nwas held back by the Armed Services Committee. We had to deal with the \nturf wars at the Pentagon: Don't meddle with our generals. Well, I \nwasn't meddling with the generals. I just think the head of the \nNational Security Agency should be there. So let's get off of the turf \nwars and fight terrorist wars. Let's restore confidence in the National \nSecurity Agency and have its head confirmed by the Senate. I am a great \nadmirer of General Alexander.\n  The committee also recommends that the next head of NSA be a \ncivilian. I think we ought to look at that. I think we ought to examine \nthat and see what is in the best interests of the mission of the agency \nand what we need to be able to do. But whoever is the head of the \nNational Security Agency, be they civilian or military, I think they \nought to be confirmed by the Senate.\n  I also joined across the aisle with my great colleague Senator Coats \nof Indiana to ask that the NSA inspector general also be confirmed by \nthe Senate to make sure that we have a confirmable position so there is \na bona fide whistleblower route with a confirmable inspector general to \nmake sure that NSA is doing the right thing and whistleblowers have an \navenue to do it.\n  I also supported transparency to make sure that those NSA programs \nare accountable and as transparent as they can be. That doesn't mean we \nreveal the secrets of the United States. Joining with Senators Wyden, \nUdall, and Heinrich, I have introduced an amendment to make the secret \nFISA court opinions were publicly available under certain \ncircumstances.\n  I also worked with Senators King, Warner, and Collins to bring \ngreater transparency to the FISA court through amicus curiae, or friend \nof the court, to assist in the consideration of novel interpretations \nof the law. There are those who say, in the President's report, that \nthere should be a civil liberties council and a red team that can go in \nthere. Let's talk about that. Let's debate it. Let's make sure there is \nmore than one opinion before the court on its legality. I support those \nsuggestions.\n  Let's look at the constitutionality. One judge recently said the NSA \nsurveillance program, particularly under something called section 215, \nwas shocking, and he said it was not constitutional, but 36 other FISA \ncourt opinions by 15 judges said it was constitutional.\n  I am a social worker. I am not a constitutional lawyer. Do you know \nwho decides on what is constitutional? The Supreme Court of the United \nStates. I think that Congress ought to call for--or the executive \nbranch and the President--an expedited review of these programs. I \nwould like to settle, once and for all, whether the programs and laws \npassed by the Congress in the area of surveillance--I would like to \nknow if they are constitutional. If they are, then we know that. If \nthey are not, then that ends the program. We will follow the law, and \nwe will obey the Constitution of the United States.\n  Let's get to work here. Let's go to work here. Let's make sure that \nwe are bringing about reform.\n  I want to talk about the mission of the agency. The National Security \nAgency is not a puzzle palace, and it is not some sneaky surveillance \nagency with people in tan raincoats and fedoras, hiding behind doors \nand spying on people. In fact, remember what they think they do--they \nthink what they do is constitutional, legal, authorized, and necessary.\n  We need the National Security Agency. There is only one thing the 215 \nprogram does: It protects us against counterterrorism. They are there \nto protect us against counterespionage. They are there to protect us \nand make sure that weapons of mass destruction are contained. They are \nadvocates for nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction in \ncooperation with the CIA and NRO.\n  They also protect us in the area of cyber security. Those 80 million \npeople who recently had their credit cards stolen at Target--we don't \nknow if that was a job that was done in the United States of America. \nFor all we know, it was organized cyber crime coming out of Albania or \nanother Eastern European country with shoddy rules and regulations. We \ndon't know. However, we do know the FBI and the NSA are working on it, \nas well as others. NSA's job is to look at what is over there. Some of \nour biggest bank heists in organized cyber crime are coming from over \nthere. Did you know that one of the biggest thefts out of the Medicare \nProgram was done by a cyber heist by organized crime out of Albania? \nCan you believe that? It was caught. In working with the inspector \ngeneral at CMS, the FBI, and the NSA, we caught them, got our money \nback, and now we are back on track. So they do a good job, and we are \nkind of losing sight as far as these concerns about surveillance.\n  There is no doubt that we protect the civil liberties of the United \nStates of America. We do believe in privacy. I am not going to describe \nthe program or go into it, but I will tell you what really bothers me. \nWhat really bothers me is that somehow or another, through the media, \nand even conversations in this body, we are painting NSA\n\n[[Page S105]]\n\nas if it were a bad, villainous, duplicitous, surreptitious agency. \nThat could not be further from the truth. Somehow or another, the men \nand women who work there every single day, standing sentry on behalf of \nthe United States of America on signals intelligence, are somehow or \nanother to feel that something is wrong. The morale at that Agency is \nterrible. The morale at that Agency is falling. The morale at that \nAgency is not in a healthy situation.\n\n  We have to do something about that by showing respect for the men and \nwomen who work there. Most of them are civilians. They are some of the \nbrightest people in the world. Did my colleagues know that the NSA is \nthe largest employer of mathematicians in the world because of the code \nbreakers, the cryptologists? They break codes. Who uses codes? It is \nnot Mother Teresa.\n  Respect. Let's have respect because they are hard at work. While the \nrest of us were home for Christmas enjoying turkey or home for \nThanksgiving, they were out there working. They were making sure there \nwasn't another Underwear Bomber. When our defenses appear to be \nlowest--when people are traveling on airplanes, when people are in the \nholiday spirit--they are working. They are working right now to make \nsure our Olympic athletes are safe, working with appropriate \ninternational law enforcement. They are at it every single day. Can't \nwe give them respect while we sort out constitutionality and legality? \nLet's sort it out, but let's stop the finger-pointing.\n  I must tell my colleagues that I was taken aback today when I got my \nNational Journal Daily and read where it says ``Obama Invites NSA Top \nCongressional Critics To Meet.'' I think it is always great when the \nPresident speaks with Congress, but he invited the critics of the \nprogram to the White House. I think that is good. I would prefer, \nthough, to read--instead of ``inviting the critics,'' the phrase would \nhave said ``reformers.'' Put me in the ``reformer'' category. If there \nare abuses, I am one of the first to criticize them. I have been part \nof reform. I intend to be part of reform, but I don't intend to be a \npart of rejecting the mission, and I don't intend to be a part of any \neffort that downgrades or downplays the contribution of the men and \nwomen who work there. So call the people reformers.\n  I hope the White House and this Congress will signal to the men and \nwomen at the National Security Agency that they are respected, that \nthey are valued; as we pursue reform, we will always do our duty to \nensure that what they do is constitutional, legal, authorized, and \nnecessary. But don't blame them for the job we asked them to do. I \nthink if we proceed with a spirit of reform rather than blame, we will \nbe able to accomplish a great deal.\n  This is a big day in the Senate. Let's pass unemployment \ncompensation. Let's do the reforms we need, and let's do a good job, as \nwe are supposed to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \ntalk about the fact that 50 years ago today President Lyndon Johnson \nmade his first State of the Union Address. He used that date--January \n8, 1964--to chart a new agenda for the country and to declare that \nAmerica would take on an unconditional war on poverty. With that \ndirective, Congress worked on some of the most successful programs in \nthe history of our country: Medicare, Head Start, Pell grants, and \nexpansions to Social Security. President Johnson knew that the \ndevastation of poverty went deeper than just the lack of a job or the \nlack of basic needs. Americans in poverty didn't even have a fair \nchance to make a better life for themselves and their families.\n  Now, since 1964, economists estimate the poverty rate has now fallen \nby 10 percent when accounting for social safety net programs. So we are \nmoving in the right direction, but we have a lot more work to do to \ngive everyone the fair chance they need to succeed in this country.\n  For too many people today, the war on poverty is a daily battle just \nto make ends meet. More than 46 million people in our country live in \npoverty--46 million people. That is according to the Census Bureau. \nMore than 20 percent--that is one in five of our kids in this country--\nlive in poverty. So to win this fight, we need to strengthen the \nprograms that support those in need.\n  Without question, one of the reasons we have seen a decline in \npoverty is because of the programs that provide a safety net for our \nmost vulnerable Americans. In 1964 Congress created the food stamp \nprogram for those struggling to feed their families. Today it is known \nas the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or better known as \nSNAP. In 2012 alone the program lifted 4.9 million people out of \npoverty, according to the Center on the Budget and Policy Priorities.\n  We have also worked to make sure preschoolers from low-income areas \nhave the building blocks they need to start kindergarten ready to \nlearn. Since the mid-1960s Head Start has provided early childhood \nlearning and health services to more than 30 million children and their \nfamilies.\n  That is the kind of progress we have to continue. Those programs and \nmany like them have provided economic security and opportunity to \nmillions across the country.\n  Yet even with the successes we have had in fighting hunger and ending \nunemployment, there are those today here in Congress who want to slash \nthe very assistance that gives so many Americans today an opportunity \nto make better lives for themselves and their families.\n  We can't waver in the fight to give all Americans a fair chance--a \nfair chance to get ahead. We have to expand opportunities for young \nlearners by investing in universal pre-K. We have to ensure that \nworkers can earn enough to put food on the table by raising the minimum \nwage. We have to keep fighting, and we have to win the war on poverty.\n  I know personally how vital these programs are. When I was just 15 \nyears old, my dad, who fought in World War II and was a veteran, was \ndiagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Within just a few years he couldn't \nwork anymore. My mom found a job. She stayed home to raise seven kids. \nThe job she found wasn't enough to support seven kids, and my dad had a \ngrowing stack of medical bills. All of a sudden, my family, without any \nwarning, had fallen on hard times.\n  This country at that time didn't turn its back on us. For several \nmonths my family relied on food stamps. It wasn't much, but it helped \nus get by. With the help of a government program--a government \nprogram--my mom was fortunate to attend Lake Washington Vocational \nTechnical School and got the training she needed to get a better job so \nshe could support her family. My older brother, my twin sister, and I \nwere able to stay in college because of student loans and support from \nwhat we now call Pell grants--all from this government.\n  Even through those hard times, none of us lost hope. With a lot of \nhard work--and we had help from our government--we were able to get to \nwhere we are today. That is why I believe so strongly that here in \nCongress today, we have to expand that hope I had as a young girl to \nmany more families and Americans who are struggling today.\n  Fifty years ago President Johnson recognized that poverty is a \nnational problem, and that is why he made it a national priority. So I \nthink we ought to rededicate ourselves today to that national priority. \nLet's work together here to support the men and women across the \ncountry who hope for their chance at the American dream. Let's not just \ncommemorate this anniversary; let's begin to use and have a renewed \nenergy to winning the war on poverty in our country once and for all.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, 50 years ago today President Johnson \ndeclared a war on poverty. He said:\n\n       Very often a lack of jobs and money is not the cause of \n     poverty, but the symptom. The\n\n[[Page S106]]\n\n     cause may lie deeper in our failure to give citizens a fair \n     chance to develop their own capacities, in a lack of \n     education and training, in a lack of medical care and \n     housing.\n\n  He proposed a broad range of new initiatives to address these deeper \nfailures: Medicare, Head Start, the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, the Higher Education Act, and housing and transportation programs. \nThese initiatives have given millions of people more opportunities to \nsucceed and help them get back on their feet when they stumble. \nPresident Johnson called on Congress to take up these proposals \nbecause, he said, ``many Americans live on the outskirts of hope. Our \ntask is to help replace their despair with opportunity.'' That is still \nour task today.\n  We have come a long way since 1964, but clearly the fight is not \nover. For years our American dream has been that if people work hard \nand play by the rules, they will succeed. However, the divide between \nthe very rich and the very poor is as wide as it has ever been. Wages \nhave stagnated, and more and more middle-class families struggle to get \nahead and provide opportunities for their children.\n  We have to carry on the work that began 50 years ago and update it \nfor the needs of our modern economy. Let's keep fighting to create new, \ngood-paying jobs and sustainable American industries. Let's make sure \nall Americans have access to the education and training needed to get \nthose jobs and succeed. Let's work to make sure that as our economy \ngrows, so do middle-class incomes and the opportunity to climb into the \nmiddle class and beyond.\n  I wish to speak briefly about three ideas for these goals. First, \nlet's increase the minimum wage so workers earn more than poverty-level \nwages. Second, let's make education more accessible from pre-K through \ncollege so that Americans are well prepared for the jobs of the future. \nFinally, let's strengthen the safety net programs that have kept so \nmany out of poverty so working families can get through the tough times \nand get back on their feet.\n  First, our economy has grown fourfold over the last 50 years, but the \npoor and middle class have not seen enough of the benefits of this \ngrowth. According to Census data, the economy is producing 45 percent \nmore per person than it was in 1987, but real median income has \nremained flat.\n  Workers earning minimum wage have fared even worse because today's \nFederal minimum wage has not kept up with inflation. The 1968 minimum \nwage, adjusted for inflation, would be $10.68 today, not $7.25. That \nmeans the minimum wage has lost one-third of its buying power. It is no \nwonder our families are struggling. The minimum wage should be \nincreased.\n  Raising the minimum wage is important for many Americans, but it is \nparticularly important for women. Most minimum wage workers--over 64 \npercent of them--are women. Today millions of women are trapped in \nminimum wage jobs.\n  The Federal minimum wage of $7.25 yields only $15,000 per year for a \nfull-time worker. If this woman is supporting a child or an elderly \nparent, as is often the case, their family income would be below the \nFederal poverty line. Their situation is even more dire in Hawaii, \nwhere the cost of living is much higher.\n  Fighting poverty is a women's issue. Poverty hurts more women and \nchildren than men. More than 58 percent of adults in poverty are women. \nMore than one in seven women--nearly 17.8 million--live in poverty. \nMore than one in five children--about 21.8 percent--are poor, almost \ntwice the rate for adult men.\n  The low minimum wage hurts not only workers--and particularly women \nworkers and children--it is unfair to taxpayers. That is because \nminimum wage workers are often eligible for food assistance, housing \nvouchers, and other safety-net programs. This means we taxpayers are \nsubsidizing companies that pay their workers poverty wages. If we want \nto reduce government spending--and make more workers fully self-\nsufficient--raising the minimum wage is a good place to start.\n  Second, expanding access to education--from birth to college and \ncareer training--will build new ladders out of poverty.\n  When I came to this country as an 8-year-old immigrant, my mother \nenrolled me in Hawaii public schools. That is where I learned English \nand developed a love of reading. When I graduated from Kaimuki High \nSchool, I attended the University of Hawaii. The Higher Education Act \nof 1965 helped me--and millions of other students--pay for college \nthrough work-study and low-interest Federal student loans. Today we \nneed to strengthen our commitment to our next generation of scientists, \narchitects, teachers, and innovators.\n  I know firsthand the power of a quality education. That is why for \nyears I have been fighting for quality preschool in Hawaii and \nnationwide. Children in poverty come to kindergarten with half the \nvocabulary of their higher-income peers. If they start school already \nbehind, how can we expect them to catch up?\n  President Johnson helped pass the Head Start Act. This law helped \nmillions of poor children attend preschool, while parents got the \nskills they needed to help their kids at home. Since then, we have \nreformed and strengthened Head Start quality, but, still, fewer than \nhalf of eligible 3- and 4-year-olds can get a Head Start seat. Fewer \nthan 1 in 20 eligible infants and toddlers can get a spot in Early Head \nStart.\n  The Federal Government cannot do it all. States and local governments \nwant to do their part too. That is why Governors, educators, and \nlegislators across the country--both Republicans and Democrats--have \nexpanded State preschool in 2013. Let's support their efforts.\n  This Congress I worked with Senators Harkin, Murray, Casey, and \nothers to introduce the Strong Start for America's Children Act. This \nbill would create a Federal-State partnership for high-quality \npreschool. It includes elements from our PRE-K Act so States such as \nHawaii that have further to go can have more support as they build \ntheir preschool system.\n  The bill's supporters include parents, educators, business leaders, \nand even police. They recognize that we can pay for quality preschool \nnow or pay later for law enforcement when kids drop out of school and \ncommit crimes. Let's come together to get this done.\n  While we need to focus on helping kids start kindergarten ready to \nsucceed, we also need to improve access to higher education when they \ngraduate from high school.\n  With student debt skyrocketing, the Pell grant is a bedrock \ninvestment in college access. In 1978, the Pell grant helped pay for 75 \npercent of college costs at a 4-year public university. Today it pays \nfor only a third.\n  This year I plan to introduce the Pell Grant Protection Act, a bill \nto strengthen and preserve the Pell grant. There is also more we can \ndo--like simplifying the Federal student aid process, improving work-\nstudy, and expanding access to adult basic education. I look forward to \nworking on these and other efforts in the Higher Education Act and \nWorkforce Investment Act this year.\n  Third, let's strengthen our safety net programs, including Social \nSecurity, Medicare and Medicaid, unemployment insurance, and the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.\n  These programs provide real hope and real opportunity for people. I \nknow this because I have lived it. My mother raised three children by \nherself. Most of us have relied upon or known families who have relied \nupon food stamps or unemployment insurance. My mother's unemployment \nchecks were a safety net for us, providing us with much needed \ntemporary help. They gave us breathing room and put food on the table \nwhile she searched for work. I know the anxiety when the family \nbreadwinner loses her job through no fault of her own.\n  These safety net programs have helped keep millions of Americans out \nof poverty. Using the Census Supplemental Poverty Measure, the national \npoverty rate has gone down from 26 percent in 1967 to 16 percent in \n2012. Without safety-net programs, the poverty rate would have climbed \nto 29 percent. Seniors would have been hurt especially badly.\n  Thus, it is alarming to see many of my Republican colleagues calling \nto shred the safety net programs. They have proposed drastic cuts to \nSNAP, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and a host of other vital \nsupports.\n\n[[Page S107]]\n\n  The basic idea of the safety net is to prevent people from falling so \nfar behind that they cannot catch up. So instead of making cuts, we \nshould strengthen these programs and, of course, focus on creating \njobs.\n  With the challenges facing our families today, the war on poverty \ncontinues. Let's not give in to the naysayers seeking to dismantle our \nsafety net. Let's not retreat in our efforts to help people climb out \nof poverty. Let's fight even harder to provide an opportunity agenda, \none that reaffirms the idea that if you work hard and play by the \nrules, you can get ahead. If we work together, I know we can get this \ndone.\n  I yield.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMcConnell or his designee be recognized from 2 o'clock to 2:45 this \nafternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I rise today to address the question \nthat is currently before the body; that is, whether we should extend \nthe emergency unemployment insurance for millions of Americans who are \nstill unable to find work. This is in addition to the 26 weeks that is \nprovided in most States--some a little more, some a little less--and \nthe question is whether we extend this again, as we have done several \ntimes since the great recession. The question is, should we extend it \nand, if so, how should we extend it? Should we pay for it? Should there \nbe some training or other requirements attached to it so it works \nbetter?\n  It is a good debate to have. I came on the floor yesterday to say \nlet's have a full debate on this issue. It is one of great importance \nto folks who are unemployed. It is also important to our Nation as a \nwhole that we deal with this issue, to encourage economic growth, to \nget people back to work. I was encouraged yesterday that the Senate \nmajority would permit appropriate amendments to this legislation. That \nis one reason I voted to proceed, of course with the understanding that \nwe would have the opportunity to talk about this issue, and debate it, \nand offer amendments. One ought to be how we pay for it.\n  Second, we ought to be able to deal with the underlying problem. \nUnemployment insurance is more of a bandaid, and we need to be sure we \nare dealing with the underlying problem of a weak economy and the lack \nof jobs and the lack of a connection between the skills that are needed \nand the jobs that are available. Let's really get at this problem in a \nserious way.\n  I will be frank. I heard from a lot of people in the last 24 hours--\nafter the vote on the motion to proceed--that they were surprised that \nI voted to proceed and that other Republicans did as well because they \nthought Republicans would all vote against it. In fact, I saw some \npress reports this morning indicating that some of the Democratic \nleadership would have been happier had that motion failed last night \nbecause then they could say: Well, we are blaming Republicans for being \nobstructionist.\n  I do not think my colleagues who voted the other way were being \nobstructionist. I think their concern was that they were not going to \nhave the opportunity to debate this issue and to offer amendments that \nare sensible, that are relevant to the issue at hand--like how we pay \nfor it, how we improve unemployment insurance so it works better for \nthose who are unemployed.\n  But anyway, for my part, I took my colleagues at their word when they \nsaid they were serious about actually improving unemployment insurance \nand taking serious steps to deal with the lack of growth and economic \nopportunity in our economy today. So in good faith I voted on this \nmotion to proceed yesterday, hoping again that we would be willing here \nin this body to have real debate, which is what the Senate is supposed \nto be about, have a debate over the long-term fiscally sound way \nforward on unemployment. I have come to the floor today in an effort to \nbe sure that people understand there are alternatives out there, offer \na specific idea to pay for the insurance, one that deals with fraud and \nabuse, one that is out of the President's budget actually, one that \nshould be bipartisan.\n  I have heard earlier today, some have come to the floor on their side \nof the aisle and said: We should not pay for this extension. We should \njust go further into debt and deficit. My question would be: If we can \npay for it, why would we not? Why would we want to take the country \nfurther into deficit this year, bust the budget caps that we just \nestablished in the budget agreement? I was one of nine Republicans who \nvoted for that budget agreement. It was not perfect, but it set up a \nprocess going forward where we can get back to our constitutional \nduties here in the Senate of actually appropriating, meaning the \noversight necessary of the Federal departments and agencies. There has \nbeen none over the last 4 years when we have not had a budget. Then \nprioritizing spending. That is what we are supposed to be doing. That \nis our constitutional responsibility.\n  It also did not raise taxes. It also does have a little bit of \ndeficit reduction--not as much as it should have; it was not perfect, \nbut it enabled us to move forward. So I voted for that budget. Now we \nare talking about, right after that, putting forward an unemployment \nemergency extension that is not paid for, that will bust those very \ncaps. I am told a budget point of order is going to lie against this \nbecause of it.\n  That is not the way we should go. Let's pay for it. The debt and \ndeficit are affecting our economy today. It is like a wet blanket over \nthe economy. You cannot have trillion-dollar deficits year in and year \nout. This year it is $680 billion. People are saying, well, that is \ngreat.\n  Are you kidding? That is the fifth highest deficit in the history of \nour country. It all adds up to a $17 trillion debt--unprecedented. I \nbelieve that is understated given all the liabilities we have as a \ngovernment. But the point is, we have never had debts of this level. \nThey are historic levels. It is not only the wrong thing to do for our \neconomy today and to help getting people back to work, but it is also \nclearly unfair to do to future generations. We have some young people \non the floor this afternoon. It is even immoral that we are leaving \nthis to them. So let's pay for this.\n  I was glad to hear Senator Reid say yesterday of our efforts to fund \nthis legislation, ``If they come with something serious, I'll talk to \nthem.'' Well, I have something serious--I think other Members will as \nwell--something that reflects, in my case, reforms proposed in the \nPresident's own budget, ideas that should be bipartisan.\n  My amendment would close a loophole that opens the system to double \ndipping. What do I mean by that? It is called concurrent receipts, \nwhere somebody is getting one Federal program, and then another Federal \nprogram they should not be eligible for if they have got the first one, \nspecifically, people who are both on Social Security disability \ninsurance, meaning they cannot work, SSDI, and also receiving funds \nfrom unemployment insurance, which means you are looking for a job or \nyou are working. We also add trade adjustment assistance. That is \nexactly the same theory.\n  We should not allow double dipping. In fact, we should stop this \nabuse. This is in the President's budget. This reform makes sense. \nSocial Security disability was designed to help people who are unable \nto work because of a serious medical condition. As we all know, the law \nrequires those on unemployment insurance to actively seek out job \nopportunities. So the two do not work together. Let's stop the double \ndipping. These two programs are mutually exclusive. Those who cannot \nwork should be on disability. Those who can work should be on \nunemployment insurance if they are eligible. By passing this simple \namendment, we can close this loophole and save $5.4 billion, almost \nenough to pay for the entire 3-month extension that we are talking \nabout on the table here today, which is about $6.2, $6.3 billion.\n  In addition, I will be adding another provision to my amendments that\n\n[[Page S108]]\n\ntakes the unemployment insurance program integrity provisions directly \nout of the President's budget. These are programs again in the \nPresident's budget to ensure that the unemployment insurance program is \nworking properly, again taking out the fraud and the abuse in it. The \nPresident's budget instructs the Department of Labor to implement it. \nMy amendment does too. By implementing the President's own plan to \nreduce these improper payments and speed reemployment, we save even \nmore money in the long run. This pays for, again, this unemployment \nextension over 3 months.\n  I hope we can pass my amendment, pay for this extension, and show \nthat this legislation is not just about politics--what we are talking \nabout here on the floor is not just about politics, it is about \nactually helping people who are unemployed to get back to work. I hope \nwhen my Democratic colleagues say they are ready to take real action on \ngetting our economy moving again, to help Americans who are suffering, \nthey mean it.\n  By the way, the fact that we are having this debate, the fact that so \nmany Americans are in need of long-term unemployment insurance in and \nof itself shows that something is not working. In fact, as we have \ntalked about on this floor before, we are now at historic levels in \nterms of long-term unemployment, people who have been unemployed for \nmore than 26 weeks.\n  The approach taken by the administration and many of my colleagues \nhere and in the other body to bring down unemployment and get this \neconomy moving does not seem to have worked, by their own standards. \nRecall that we had a stimulus package. It was said that unemployment \nwould be far lower than it is today. So by their own standards, it has \nnot worked. If it had, we would not be debating this today. We would \nnot be talking about the need for an extension on an emergency basis of \nunemployment insurance.\n  We cannot spend our way to prosperity. That is what we tried to do, \nin my view, in the stimulus package. That is one reason it has not \nworked. We certainly tried that over the last 5 years. If you look at \nwhat the government has done, we spent trillions of dollars we did not \nhave, we have burdened the next generation with previously unimaginable \ndebt levels that we talked about earlier. We have now run 5 years of \nhistoric deficits--5 years, trillion-dollar deficits the first 4 years.\n  Before this administration we had never had a trillion-dollar \ndeficit. Last year's deficit, again, $680 billion, the fifth largest in \nhistory, is certainly no cause for celebration, particularly when the \nCongressional Budget Office tells us that we are going to go back to \ntrillion-dollar deficits within 10 years. So we obviously have a huge \nproblem in terms of our debt and deficit.\n  What do we have to show for all of this spending that we did? \nSeventy-one months after the recession began, the economy has still not \nrecovered the jobs we lost in that recession. This has never happened \nin the history of our country. We have never had a recovery this weak. \nWe are down 1.3 million jobs. By comparison, we were up 10.4 million \njobs at this point after the 1981-1982 recession. That recession was \nalso deep. In fact, it was deeper if you measure it by the number of \npeople who were unemployed.\n  Ronald Reagan came in, and frankly he took progrowth policies and put \nthem in place and helped to create millions of jobs. By this time we \nwere up 10.4 million jobs after that recession. We were up 9.8 million \njobs after the 1990 recession at this point. We were up 4.8 million \njobs after the 2001 recession. Remember that? The recovery was called \nthe jobless recovery. Again, we have not even gained back the jobs at \nall yet after this recession. We were up 4.8 million jobs at this point \nafter the 2001 recession.\n  Making matters even worse, 1 out of every 3 unemployed persons has \nbeen out of work for 27 weeks or longer. As I said, this rate of long-\nterm unemployment is at levels we have not seen. You would think we \nwould have learned a lesson here in Washington. You would think \nWashington would want to do something differently. Yet I heard the \nPresident and the majority leader just yesterday present an \nunemployment extension as if it were some kind of economic panacea, a \nsilver bullet justifying their failure to pay for this extension with \nall of the growth they say it will generate.\n  Well, the Senate majority leader said yesterday, ``For every dollar \nwe spend on unemployment benefits, it gets $1.50 back to us just like \nthat.'' Just like that? Think about this. If unemployment benefits \ncreate so much growth, why would we just do a 3-month extension? Why \nnot a 3-year extension? Why would there be any limit? Money may not \ngrow on trees, but apparently in the eyes of some it grows from \ngovernment programs.\n  That is not how the economy works. I know there are economists out \nthere you can cite for just about anything. But the President's own \neconomic advisors have written that unemployment benefits slow down the \nsearch for jobs. But we do not need to get into a battle of experts \nhere. History has proven that just spending more money, even on \nunemployment benefits, is not the solution. It is not the long-term, \nserious solution to the problems we face as a country.\n  This extension, if it passes, will be the 11th time we have extended \nunemployment benefits in the last 5 years. These extensions have cost \nmore than $200 billion. No economic boom has resulted from this \nspending, just as it did not result, as I said earlier, from the \ntrillion dollars in stimulus money.\n  If spending were the answer, we would not be standing here today \nhaving this debate. We would be celebrating full employment. Our \neconomy would not be better off if we had higher unemployment and we \nwere paying out more in unemployment benefits. That is kind of the \nlogical extension of what has been argued on the other side as to why \nwe cannot pay for this. I cannot imagine anyone actually believes this.\n  Yet for too long we have treated government spending as if it does \ncreate wealth. If I take $1 from the Presiding Officer, take $1 from \none person and give that dollar to someone else, that other person may \nbe better off, but I did not add a dollar to the economy. Government \nprograms have to come from somewhere. So that dollar is being taken \nfrom somewhere and given to somebody else. Somehow the notion is that \nis going to add to the economy.\n  Again, the logical extension is: Let's just continue to provide more \nand more government spending; everything will be great. That is not how \nit works. Dividing the pie up differently does not create more pie. It \ncreates real, concrete progrowth policies to do that, policies that \nmean we are paying out less in unemployment benefits because more \npeople have the skills they need to get good jobs. That is what we \nought to be talking about.\n  Yes, I am willing to extend unemployment insurance and pay for it. \nBut during that period, let's come up with a better unemployment \ninsurance program that actually connects people to the jobs that are \nout there. Because there are a lot of jobs that require skills that are \nnot being filled. Our employment system ought to, both for the long \nterm and even for the short term, focus on that. How do you create \nbetter skills so that people have the opportunity, have the tools to be \nable to access those jobs?\n  Policies that allow more companies and small businesses to produce \nquality products they can sell here and around the world, creating \nbetter jobs and profits, would help. Implementing these kinds of \npolicies is not as easy as extending unemployment benefits for a few \nmonths or raising the minimum wage. We will not be able to ram these \nkinds of policies through in a week on a party-line vote with no debate \nand no amendments. But there is a real solution to the chronic \nunemployment we are seeing in our States, and that is the only way to \nencourage the kind of income mobility that will close the income gap, \nnot by tearing people down but by bringing people up. Progrowth \neconomic policies obviously need to be part of the solution here. If we \nextend unemployment insurance, we should do so because people are \nhurting as a result of the failed policies in Washington. But we should \nnot kid ourselves into believing that this extension alone will somehow \nsolve these economic problems. Again, it certainly will not pay for \nitself. As I said earlier, you cannot take a dollar away from one \nperson and give it to someone else and create more purchasing power. \nYou are redistributing that across the economy.\n\n[[Page S109]]\n\n  It does not have to be that way. We can pass these pay-for \namendments. I have my own amendments, as I said. Others have also \nproposed their amendments. I know Senator Ayotte has an amendment I am \nsupporting that, again, gets at fraud and abuse in government programs \nand says: Let's pay for the unemployment benefits.\n  She also, by the way, pays for veterans' benefits that were cut \nduring the budget agreement we just passed. I also support that. She \nhas a little left over for actual deficit reduction.\n  Senator Coburn is going to have a proposal out here. I think Senator \nHatch will have one. Senator McConnell will have one. My understanding \nis that Senator Coburn has one that is also out of the President's \nbudget.\n  There are plenty of ideas here as to how to pay for this extension, \nshort term, while we look at better ways to have the unemployment \ninsurance system work, to connect people who are unemployed to the jobs \nthat are out there, by giving them the skills they need. That is where \nthe hard work begins.\n  We have got to get this country moving again. We have got to do \nthings to actually increase economic growth and give people the skills \nthey need to access the jobs that are out there. We need to pass bills \nsuch as the CAREER Act, bipartisan legislation I have introduced with \nSenator Mike Bennet from Colorado.\n  In Ohio, we have about 400,000 people unemployed. We are told there \nare about 100,000 jobs right now open in Ohio. A lot of these jobs are \nhigh-tech jobs. Some are in advanced manufacturing, some are in \nbioscience, some in information technology. We need to be sure that the \npeople who are unemployed get the skills they need to be able to take \nadvantage of those jobs, those opportunities.\n  We can also start by working on tax reform. Everybody seems to talk \nabout it. Let's do it. Corporate tax reform alone would result in a lot \nmore revenue coming into the Federal Government by repatriating \nprofits. It would help expand opportunities, not for the boardroom, for \nthe people who work in those companies.\n  People who have looked at this at the Congressional Budget Office, \nthe economic experts, have said: If we did corporate business tax \nreform, over 70 percent of the benefit goes right to the workers: \nhigher pay, higher benefits. It is time to ensure that we have a \ngrowing economy, we are growing that pie, not just carving it up.\n  Let's streamline the regulations in this country. Currently the \nUnited States ranks 34th in the world in the time it takes to get a \ngovernment green light to actually build something. Think about that. \nThis is a key World Bank measure for ease of doing business. We want \nAmerica to be at the top of that list, not halfway down that list. \nUnless we do that, we are not going to see the kind of investment we \nwant in this country. How many jobs are lost every year because people \ncannot get a permit, that a good idea cannot be built? These are jobs \nthat are there if we change the policies here in Washington, DC.\n  Congress continues to pat itself on the back for scoring political \npoints rather than taking on these challenges that face our country. I \ncan tell you who is not patting us on the back: It is the American \npeople. They are not happy. They are not pleased with our progress. \nThere is good reason. They are actually seeing their take-home pay go \ndown as the deficit goes up, in, as the President talked about, a \nbetter economy.\n  Fifty years ago the United States declared a war on poverty. Yet \npoverty is still a major problem. The goal was noble, but the tools we \nused were not up to the challenge.\n  Since the recession began, 9 million more Americans have fallen into \npoverty and the median household income is down more than 8 percent. \nPoverty rates have actually increased during this administration with \nthe policies we have.\n  It is time for a change. For decades we have exported to the nations \naround the world these principles that have allowed us to enjoy so much \nprosperity and success. We have said: Follow the American way; the free \nenterprise system works. We have preached to them this gospel, as well \nas our belief that by removing the shackles of government interference \nfrom the market--whether in the form of overregulation, overspending, \nor overtaxing--everyone can prosper.\n  As U.S. Trade Representative I had the opportunity to travel all \naround the world representing our great country. It was a great honor \nto tell people the benefits of liberalizing trade, knocking down \nbarriers to increase economic growth and opportunity. It works. \nEntrepreneurs and job creators have lifted more people out of poverty \naround the world over the past few decades than any government program \never could because the free enterprise system does work. We need to get \nback to that.\n  Let's do something we can be proud of in this Chamber today. Let's \nempower the American people instead of the American Government. Let's \nnot kick the can of spending down the road any longer. Let's take some \nvotes. Not all of them are going to be easy votes, and they shouldn't \nbe. After all, that is what we are elected to do--take tough votes. \nThese votes we take today, though, can make a real difference in \npeople's lives.\n  Let's start today. Let's pay for this legislation. Let's use these \npay-fors we just talked about that are bipartisan, that are sensible, \nthat can be supported on both sides of the aisle and in both bodies. \nLet's ensure that we put in place the progrowth policies so that we \naren't just giving people a little more unemployment insurance for a \nfew more months but giving them the opportunity to get a job and the \ndignity and self-respect that come with that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, pay for this \nlegislation, put politics aside, and get to work for the American \npeople.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, over the past several years those of us \nwho are fortunate enough to serve have engaged in many fierce debates. \nSome have been forced upon us by external events, including a searing \nfinancial crisis, while others were brought about by an \nunapologetically liberal President who promised dramatic change and who \nhas worked very hard to follow through on that pledge--in some cases, \neven in the face of legal obstacles and widespread public opposition. \nSo change has, indeed, come.\n  Despite the daily drumbeat of headlines about gridlock and \ndysfunction in Washington, the truth is that an activist President and \na Democratic-controlled Senate have managed to check off an awful lot \nof items on their wish list one way or another. Yet just as important \nas what they did, my colleagues, is how they did it because that also \nhas been at the heart of so many of the fights we have had around here \nover the past few years. These conflicts haven't stemmed from personal \ngrievances or contempt, as some would have it. They are, instead, the \ninevitable consequence of an administration that was in such a hurry to \nimpose its agenda that it neglected to persuade the public of its \nwisdom and then cast aside one of the greatest tools we have in this \ncountry for guaranteeing a durable and stable legislative consensus, \nand that tool is the Senate.\n  Remember, I think we all know partisanship is not some recent \ninvention. American politics has always been divided between two \nideological camps. Today that is reflected in the two major parties, \nbut it has actually always been there. On one side are those who \nproudly place their trust in government and its agents to guide our \ninstitutions and direct our lives. On the other are those of us who put \nour trust in the wisdom and the creativity of private citizens working \nvoluntarily with each other and through more local mediating \ninstitutions, guided by their own sense of what is right, what is fair, \nand what is good.\n  Recent polling suggests that most Americans fall squarely into the \nlatter camp. People are generally confident in their local governments \nbut lack confidence in Washington.\n  Despite the political and ideological divides which have always \nexisted in our country, we have almost always managed to work out our \ndifferences--not by humiliating the other side into submission but \nthrough simple give-and-take. It is the secret of our success. The same \nvirtues that make any\n\n[[Page S110]]\n\nfriendship, marriage, family, or business work are the ones that have \nalways made this country work. And the place where it happens, the \nplace where all the national conflicts and controversies that arise in \nthis big, diverse, wonderful country of ours have always been resolved, \nis in this Chamber.\n  I realize it may not be immediately obvious why that is the case, but \nthe fact is that every serious student of this institution, from De \nTocqueville to our late colleague Robert Byrd, has seen the Senate as \nuniquely important to America's stability and to its flourishing. In \ntheir view, it has made all the difference, and here is why--because \nwhether it was the fierce early battles over the shape and scope of the \nFederal Government or those that surrounded industrialization or those \nthat preceded and followed a nation-rending civil war or those \nsurrounding the great wars of the 20th century or the expansion of the \nfranchise or a decades-long cold war or the war on terror, we have \nalways found a way forward, sometimes haltingly but always steadily, \nand the Senate is the tool that has enabled us to find our footing \nalmost every time.\n  I mention all this because as we begin a new year, it is appropriate \nto step back from all the policy debates that have occupied us over the \npast few years and focus on another debate we have been having, and the \ndebate we have been having is over the State of this institution. What \nhave we become? It is not a debate that ever caught fire with the \npublic or with the press, but it is a debate that should be of grave \nimportance to all of us because on some level every single one of us \nhas to be at least a little bit uneasy about what happened here last \nNovember. But even if you are completely at peace with what happened in \nNovember, even if you think it was perfectly fine to violate the all-\nimportant rules that say changing the rules requires the assent of two-\nthirds of Senators duly elected and sworn, none of us should be happy \nwith the trajectory the Senate was on even before that day, even before \nNovember, or the condition we find the Senate in 225 years after it was \ncreated. I don't think anybody is comfortable with where we are. I know \nI am not, and I bet, even though there is nobody over here at the \nmoment, I bet almost none of them are either.\n  I wish to share a few thoughts on what I think we have lost over the \nlast 7 years and what can be done about it together. ``Together'' \nobviously requires the involvement, one would think, of some people on \nthe other side of the aisle. Even though they are not here to listen, \nthey have been invited.\n  Let me state at the outset that it is not my intention to point the \nfinger of blame at anybody, although some of that is inevitable. I \ndon't presume to have all of the answers either, and I am certainly not \nhere to claim that we are without fault. But I am absolutely certain of \none thing: The Senate can be better than it is. Many of us have seen a \nbetter Senate than we have now, no matter who was in the majority. This \ninstitution can be better than it is. I just can't believe that on some \nlevel everyone in this Chamber, including the folks on the other side, \ndoesn't agree. It just can't be the case that we are content with the \ntheatrics and the messaging wars that go on day after day. It can't be \nthe case that Senators who grew up reading about the great statesmen \nwho made their name and their mark over the years are now suddenly \ncontent to stand in front of a giant poster board making some poll-\ntested point-of-the month day after day and then run back to their \nrespective corners and congratulate each other on how right they are. I \ncan't believe we are all happy about that on either side.\n  Don't misunderstand me--there is a time for making a political point \nand even scoring a few points. I know that as well as anybody. But it \ncan't be the only thing we do. Surely we do something other than \nscoring political points against each other. It cheapens the service we \nhave sworn to provide to our constituents. It cheapens the Senate, \nwhich is a lot bigger than any of us.\n  Hopefully, we can all agree that we have a problem. I realize both \nsides have their own favorite account of what caused it. We have our \ntalking points, and they have their talking points. We all repeat them \nwith great repetition, and we all congratulate each other for being on \nthe right side of the debate. I understand that. People over there \nthink Republicans abuse the rules, and we think they do. But, as I \nsaid, my goal here isn't to make converts on that front; my purpose is \nto suggest that the Senate can be better than it has been and that it \nmust be if we are to remain great as a nation.\n  The crucial first step of any vision that gets us there is to \nrecognize that vigorous debate about our differences isn't some \nsickness to be lamented. Vigorous debate is not a problem. When did \nthat become a problem? It is actually a sign of strength to have \nvigorous debates.\n\n  It is a common refrain among pundits that the fights we have around \nhere are pointless. They are not at all pointless. Every single debate \nwe have around here is about something important. What is unhealthy is \nwhen we neglect the means that we have always used to resolve our \ndifferences. That is the real threat to this country, not more debate. \nWhen did that become a problem?\n  The best mechanism we have for working through our differences and \narriving at a durable consensus is the U.S. Senate. An Executive order \ncan't do it. The fiat of a nine-person court can't do it. A raucous and \nprecarious partisan majority in the House can't do it. The only \ninstitution that can make stable and enduring laws is the one we have \nin which all 50 States are represented equally and where every single \nSenator has a say in the laws we pass. This is what the Senate was \ndesigned for. It is what the Senate is supposed to be about, and \nalmost--almost--always has been.\n  Take a look at some of the most far-reaching legislation of the past \ncentury. Look at the vote tallies. Medicare and Medicaid were both \napproved with the support of about half the Members of the minority. \nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 passed with the votes of 30 out of the 32 \nMembers of the Republican minority--all but two Republican Senators. \nThere weren't many of them. That was the year after the Goldwater \ndebacle. Only two Senators voted against the Social Security Act, and \nonly eight voted against the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  None of this happened, by the way--none of it happened--by throwing \nthese bills together in the back room and dropping them on the floor \nwith a stopwatch running. It happened through a laborious process of \nlegislating, persuasion, and coalition building. It took time and it \ntook patience and hard work and it guaranteed that every one of these \nlaws had stability--stability. Compare that--compare that, if you \nwill--to the attitude behind ObamaCare. When Democrats couldn't \nconvince any of us the bill was worth supporting as written, they \ndecided to do it on their own and pass it on a party-line vote and now \nwe are seeing the result.\n  The chaos this law has visited on our country isn't just deeply \ntragic; it was, my friends, entirely predictable--entirely predictable. \nThat will always be the case if we approach legislation without regard \nfor the views of the other side. Without some meaningful buy-in, we \nguarantee a food fight, we guarantee instability, and we guarantee \nstrife.\n  It may very well have been the case that on ObamaCare the will of the \ncountry was not to pass the bill at all. That is what I would have \nconcluded if Republicans couldn't get a single Democratic vote for \nlegislation of that magnitude. I would have thought: Well, maybe this \nisn't such a great idea. But Democrats plowed forward anyway. They \ndidn't want to hear it. The results are clear. It is a mess, an \nabsolute mess.\n  The Senate exists to prevent that kind of situation. Because without \na moderating institution as the Senate, today's majority passes \nsomething and tomorrow's majority repeals it; today's majority proposes \nsomething, and tomorrow's majority opposes it. We see that in the House \nall the time. But when the Senate is allowed to work the way it was \ndesigned to, it arrives at a result that is acceptable to people all \nalong the political spectrum. That, my friends, is the whole point.\n  We have lost our sense for the value of that, and none of us should \nbe at peace. Because if America is to face up\n\n[[Page S111]]\n\nto the challenges we face in the decades ahead, she will need the \nSenate the Founders, in their wisdom, intended, not the hollow shell of \nthe Senate we have today--not the hollow shell of the Senate we have \ntoday.\n  First, one of the traditional hallmarks of the Senate is a vigorous \ncommittee process. It is also one of the main things we have lost. \nThere was a time--not that long ago--when chairmen and ranking members \nhad major influence and used their positions to develop national policy \non everything from farm policy to nuclear arms. These men and women \nenriched the entire Senate through their focus and their expertise. \nJust as important, they provided an important counterweight to the \nexecutive branch. They provided one more check on the White House. If a \nPresident thought something was a good idea, he had better make sure he \nran it by the committee chairman who had been studying it for the past \ntwo decades. If the chairman disagreed, then they would have a serious \ndebate and probably reach a better product as a result.\n  The Senate should be setting national priorities, not simply waiting \non the White House to do it for us. The place to start that process is \nin the committees. With few exceptions, that is gone. With very few \nexceptions, that is gone. It is a big loss to the institution, but most \nimportantly it is a big loss for the American people who expect us to \nlead.\n  Here is something else we have gained from a robust committee process \nover the years. Committees have actually served as a school of \nbipartisanship. If we think about it, it just makes sense. By the time \na bill gets through committee, one would expect it to come out in a \nform that was generally broadly acceptable to both sides; nobody got \neverything, but more often than not everybody got something, and the \nproduct was stable because there was buy-in and a sense of ownership on \nboth sides.\n  On the rare occasions when that has happened recently, we have seen \nthat work. The committee process in the Senate is a shadow of what it \nused to be, thereby marginalizing, reducing the influence of every \nsingle Member of the Senate on both sides of the aisle. Major \nlegislation is now routinely drafted not in committee but in the \nmajority leader's conference room and then dropped on the floor with \nlittle or no opportunity for Members to participate in the amendment \nprocess, virtually guaranteeing a fight.\n  There is a lot of empty talk around here about the corrosive \ninfluence of partisanship. If we truly want to do something about it, \nwe should support a more robust committee process. That is the best way \nto end the permanent sort of shirts-against-skins contest the Senate \nhas become. Bills should go through committee. If Republicans are \nfortunate enough--if Republicans are fortunate enough--to gain the \nmajority next year, that will be done.\n  Second, bills should come to the floor and be thoroughly debated. We \nhave an example of that going on right now, and that includes a robust \namendment process. In my view, there is far too much paranoia about the \nother side around here. What are we afraid of? Both sides have taken \nliberties and abused privileges. I will admit that. But the answer \nisn't to provoke even more. The answer is to let folks debate. This is \nthe Senate. Let folks debate. Let the Senate work its will, and that \nmeans bringing bills to the floor. It means having a free and open \namendment process. That is legislating.\n  That is what we used to do. That is exactly the way this place \noperated just a few years ago. The senior Senator from Illinois, the \nDemocratic assistant majority leader, likes to say--or at least used to \nsay--that if you don't want to fight fires, don't become a fireman, and \nif you don't want to cast tough votes, don't come to the Senate. I \nguess he hasn't said that lately.\n  When we used to be in the majority, I remember telling people: Look. \nThe good news is we are in the majority. The bad news is, in order to \nget the bill across the floor, you have to cast a lot of votes you \ndon't want to take--and we did it and people groaned about it, \ncomplained about it. Yet the Sun still came up the next day and \neverybody felt as though they were a part of the process.\n  Senator Durbin was right about that when he said it. I think it is \ntime to allow Senators on both sides to more fully participate in the \nlegislative process, and that means having a more open amendment \nprocess around here. As I said, obviously it requires us, from time to \ntime, to cast votes we would rather not cast. But we are all grownups. \nWe can take that. There is rarely ever a vote we cast around here that \nis fatal.\n  The irony of it all is that kind of process makes the place a lot \nless contentious. In fact, it is a lot less contentious when we vote on \ntough issues than when we don't, because when we are not allowed to do \nthat, everybody is angry about being denied the opportunity to do what \nthey were sent here to do, which is to represent the people who elected \nus and offer ideas we think are worth considering.\n  At a meeting we just came out of, Senator Cornyn was pointing out \nthere were 13 amendments people on this side of the aisle would like to \noffer on this bill, all of them related to the subject and important to \neach Senator who seriously felt there was a better way to improve the \nbill that is on the floor right now. But, alas, I expect that \nopportunity will not be allowed because one person who is allowed to \nget prior recognition can prevent us from getting any amendments or, \neven worse still, pick our amendments for us, decide which of our \namendments are OK and which aren't.\n  I remember the late Ted Stevens telling the story about when he first \ngot here. Senator Mansfield was still the majority leader, and he tried \nto offer an amendment--Senator Stevens did--and the Member of the \nmajority who was managing the bill prevented it, in effect. Senator \nMansfield came over to Senator Stevens, took his amendment, went back \nto his desk and sent it to the floor for him. He sent it to the floor \nfor him. That was the Senate not too long ago.\n  If someone isn't allowed to get a vote on something they believe in, \nof course they are going to retaliate. Of course they are going to \nretaliate. But if they get a vote every once in a while, they do not \nfeel the need to. Voting on amendments is good for the Senate and it is \ngood for the country. Our constituents should have a greater voice in \nthe process.\n  Since July of last year, there have been four Republican rollcall \nvotes. In the whole second half of 2013, Members on this side of the \naisle have gotten four rollcall votes--stunning. That is today's \nSenate.\n\n  So let me say this: If Republicans are fortunate enough to be in the \nmajority next year, amendments will be allowed, Senators will be \nrespected, and we will not make an attempt to wring controversy out of \nan institution which expects, demands, and approves of great debates \nabout the problems confronting the country.\n  A common refrain from Democrats is that Republicans have been too \nquick to block bills from ever coming to the floor. What they fail to \nmention of course is that often we have done this either because we \nhave been shut out of the drafting process--in other words, had nothing \nto do with writing the bill in the first place--or it had been made \npretty clear that there wouldn't be any amendments, which is, in all \nlikelihood, the situation we are in this very day.\n  In other words, we already knew the legislation was shaping up to be \na purely partisan exercise in which people we represent wouldn't have \nany meaningful input at all. Why would we want to participate in that? \nIs it good for our constituents? Does it lead to a better product? Of \ncourse not. All it leads to is a lot more acrimony.\n  So look. I get it. If Republicans had just won the White House and \nthe House and had a 60-vote majority in the Senate, we would be tempted \nto empty our outbox too. But you can't spend 2 years emptying your \noutbox and then complain about the backlash. If you want fewer fights, \ngive the other side a say.\n  That brings me to one of the biggest things we have lost around here, \nas I see it. The big problem, my colleagues, has never been the rules. \nSenators from both parties have in the past revered and defended the \nrules during our Nation's darkest hours. The real problem is an \nattitude that views the Senate as an assembly line for one party's \npartisan legislative agenda rather than as a place to build consensus \nto solve national problems. We have become far\n\n[[Page S112]]\n\ntoo focused on making a point instead of making a difference, making a \npoint instead of making good stable laws. We have gotten too \ncomfortable with viewing everything we do here through the prism of the \nnext election instead of the prism of duty, and everyone suffers as a \nresult.\n  As I see it, a major turning point came during the final years of the \nBush administration, when the Democratic majority held vote after vote \non bills they knew wouldn't pass. I am not saying Republicans have \nnever staged a show vote when we were in the majority. I am not saying \nI don't even enjoy a good messaging vote from time to time. But we have \nto wonder, if that is all we are doing, why are we here? It has become \nentirely too routine, and it diminishes the Senate. I don't care which \nparty you are in; you came here to legitimate, to make a difference for \nyour constituents. Yet over the past several years the Senate seems \nmore like a campaign studio than a serious legislative body.\n  Both sides have said and done things over the past few years we \nprobably wish we hadn't. But we can improve the way we do business. We \ncan be more constructive. We can work through our differences. We can \ndo things that need to be done. But there will have to be major changes \nif we are going to get there. The committee process must be restored. \nWe need to have an open amendment process.\n  Finally, let me suggest that we need to learn how to put in a decent \nweek's work around here. Most Americans don't work 3 days a week. They \nwould be astonished to find out that is about it around here.\n  How about the power of the clock to force consensus? The only way 100 \nSenators will be truly able to have their say, the only way we will be \nable to work through our tensions and disputes is if we are here more. \nA number of you will remember this: Not too long ago, Thursday night \nwas the main event around here. There is a huge incentive to finish on \nThursday night if you want to leave on Friday. It is amazing how it \nworked.\n  Even the most eager beaver among us with a long list of amendments \nwhich were good for the country--maybe 10 or 12--around noon on \nThursday, it would be down to two or one by midnight on Thursday. It \nwas amazing how consent would be reached when fatigue set in. All it \ntook was for the majority leader--who is in charge of the agenda--to \nsay: Look, this is important. There is bipartisan support for this. \nThis came out of committee. We want to have an open amendment process, \nbut we want to finish this week, and we can finish on Thursday \nafternoon or Thursday night or Friday morning. We almost never get worn \nout around here.\n  What happened to the fatigue factor to bring things to a close? \nAmendments voluntarily go away, but important ones still get offered, \nand everybody feels like they have a chance to be involved in the \nprocess no matter which side of the aisle they are on. This is \nobviously particularly effective on bills which come out of committee, \nwith bipartisan support, so there is an interest in actually passing \nit. We almost never do that anymore--almost never. On those occasions, \nwe worked late, sometimes well into the morning.\n  I know that sounds kind of quaint for people who haven't been around \nhere very long, but it actually worked. There is nothing wrong with \nstaying up a little later and getting to a conclusion. I can remember \nthe majority leader himself, when he was whip, walking around late at \nnight on Thursdays with his whip card making sure he had enough votes \nto do whatever he wanted to do.\n  When you finished one of those debates, whether you ended up voting \nfor the bill or voting against the bill, you didn't have the feeling \nthat, unless you chose to go away with your amendment, you had been \ndenied the opportunity to participate and to be a part of the process \nand actually make a difference for your constituents.\n  That is how you reach consensus: By working and talking and \ncooperating through give-and-take. That is the way everyone's patience \nis worn down, not just the majority leader's patience. Everyone can \nagree on a result even if they don't vote for it in the end. Using the \nclock to force consensus is the greatest proof of that, and if \nRepublicans are in the majority next year, we will use the clock. \nEverybody gets an opportunity, but we will use the clock, we will work \nharder, and get results.\n\n  Restoring the committee process, allowing Senators to speak through \nan open amendment process, and extending the workweek are just a few \nthings the Senate could and should do differently. None of it would \nguarantee an end to partisan rancor. There is nothing wrong with \npartisan debate. It is good for the country. None of it would cause us \nto change our principles or our views about what is right and what is \nwrong with our country.\n  Partisanship itself is not the problem. The real problem has been a \ngrowing lack of confidence in the Senate's ability to mediate the \ntensions and disputes we have always had around here. There are many \nreasons some have lost that confidence, and ultimately both parties \nhave to assume some of the blame.\n  But we can't be content to leave it at that. For the good of the \ncountry, we need to work together to restore this institution. \nAmerica's strength and resilience has always depended on our ability to \nadapt to the various challenges of our day. Sometimes that has meant \nchanging the rules when both parties think it is warranted. When the \nmajority leader decided a few weeks back to defy bipartisan \nopposition--there was bipartisan opposition to what happened in \nNovember--by changing the rules that govern this place with a simple \nmajority, he broke something. He broke something.\n  But our response can't be to just sit back and accept the demise of \nthe Senate. This body has survived mistakes and excesses before. Even \nafter some of its worst periods, it has found a way to spring back and \nto be the place where even the starkest differences and the fiercest \nideological disputes are hashed out by consensus and mutual respect. \nIndeed, it is during periods of its greatest polarization that the \nvalue of the Senate is most clearly seen.\n  So let me wrap it up this way. We are all familiar with the Lyndon \nJohnson reign around here. Robert Caro has given us that story in great \ndetail. Some look at LBJ's well-known heavyhandedness as a kind of \nmastery. Personally, I have always believed the leader who replaced him \nwas a better fit for this place, and evidently so did Johnson's \ncolleagues who elected Mansfield upon Johnson's departure with \noverwhelming enthusiasm. They had had it up to here with LBJ, and they \nwere excited that he was gone.\n  In fact, Caro reports that he tried to come to the first lunch after \nhe became Vice President and was going to act as the sort of de facto \nmajority leader even though he was now Vice President. That was, shall \nI say, unenthusiastically received, and he was almost literally thrown \nout of the lunch never to return, and Mansfield was, as I said, \nenthusiastically chosen to replace him.\n  The chronicles of LBJ's life and legacy usually leave out what I just \ntold you, but by the time he left the Senate, as I indicated, his \ncolleagues had had enough of him, right up to here. They may have bent \nto his will while he was here, but the moment they had a chance to be \ndelivered from his iron-fisted rule, they took it.\n  With their support, Mike Mansfield would spend the next 16 years \nrestoring the Senate to a place of greater cooperation and freedom. As \nwe look at what the Senate could be--not what it is now, but what it \ncould be--Mansfield's period gives us a clue.\n  There are many well-known stories about Mansfield's fairness and \nequanimity as leader. But they all seem to come down to one thing, and \nthat was his unbending belief that every single Senator was equal. That \nwas Mansfield's operating mode: Every single Senator is equal. He acted \nthat way on a daily basis and conducted himself that way on a daily \nbasis: The unbending belief that every Senator should be treated as \nequal.\n  So, look. Both sides will have to work to get us back to where we \nshould be. It is not going to happen overnight. We haven't had much \npractice lately. In fact, we are completely out of practice at doing \nwhat I just suggested as the first steps to get us back to normal. But \nit is a goal I truly believe we can all agree on and agree to strive \ntoward together, and it takes no rules change. This is a behavioral \nproblem.\n\n[[Page S113]]\n\nIt doesn't require a rules change. We just need to act differently with \neach other, respect the committee process, have an open amendment \nprocess, and work a little harder. None of that requires a rules \nchange, because restoring this institution is the only way we will ever \nsolve the challenges we face. That is the lesson of history and the \nlesson of experience. We would all be wise to heed it.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Republican leader \nfor his remarks. Without being presumptuous, I think I could express \nthe hope that all of us feel that he will help us restore the Senate to \nthe role the American people need it to play in this country.\n  There is a new history of the Senate, ``The American Senate,'' \nwritten by Neil MacNeil, the late Neil MacNeil, who wrote the best book \nabout the House of Representatives, and the former Historian of the \nSenate. I suspect this book is likely to become the best chronicle of \nthis body. It speaks of the Senate as ``the one touch of authentic \ngenius in the American political system.'' It needs to be restored to \nthat position.\n  The Republican leader is absolutely right. This does not require a \nchange of rules. This requires a change of behavior--some behavior on \nour part on this side of the aisle, but a great deal of behavior on the \npart of whomever the majority leader of the Senate is, because that is \nthe person who sets the agenda.\n  The debate for this year really is: Will this year be the end of the \nSenate--which is what the distinguished majority leader said it would \nbe if we ever changed the rules in a way that allowed the majority to \ncut off debate--or will it be the year in which the Senate is restored, \nrestored to that role of authentic genius in the American system? I \nhope it would be that way. I hope it starts tomorrow because it could \nbe started as quickly as tomorrow because it requires no change of \nrules, only a change in behavior, and that could happen as soon as \ntomorrow. But we know it can happen after November if we have six more \nRepublican Senators on this side.\n  We have heard your commitment on the floor today about how the \ncommittees can operate, about how amendments should operate. We have \nheard that before in our own meetings, in private lunches, and I am \nglad you took the occasion in this eloquent way to say to the American \npeople and all of us what we expect out of service in the Senate.\n  I had the privilege, as the Senator from Kentucky did, of seeing \nSenator Mansfield as the leader of this body. I have not served in the \nSenate as long as others who were here, but I came here--it seems hard \nto believe--47 years ago as a young aide to a Senator who eventually \nbecame the majority leader of the Senate, Howard Baker. Those were the \ndays of Mansfield and Dirksen. Those were the days when Barry Goldwater \nand John Tower and Hubert Humphrey would engage in hours of debates \nhere and hug each other at the end of their discussion. Those were the \ndays when the Democratic majority leader would offer an amendment of a \nRepublican Senator whose amendment had been denied unfairly, he \nthought. Those were the days of committees that did their work and \nRepublicans and Democrats who came to the floor and together offered \nbills.\n  I saw the Senate in the 1970s when I came back and Senator Baker was \nthe Republican leader and I saw it in the 1980s and the 1990s. I saw \nwhat the Republican leader said--let's take the Panama Canal debate. \nSenator Baker and Senator Byrd would run the Senate in the way the \nRepublican leader suggested, in the way most majority leaders have \nsuggested. They would come to the floor and they would put a bill on \nthe floor that a Republican and a Democratic Senator agreed on--let's \nsay it is Senator McCain and Senator Levin, Senator Inhofe and Senator \nLevin. They would ask for amendments. They might get 300 amendments. \nThey would then ask for unanimous consent to cut off all the amendments \nand of course they would get it because everyone had a chance to have \nhis or her amendment.\n  Then within that unanimous consent agreement would be a procedure for \nhow to vote on them, and they would say: We are here on Monday and we \nare going to finish this week, just as the Republican leader had said.\n  It does not work perfectly. There was a Senator from Alabama, and \nthen there was a Senator from Ohio, and they did all they could to put \nglue in the works. But the majority leader had all the tools he needed \nto run the Senate in that way. Everybody got a say. Senator Byrd, in \nhis last remarks before the Rules Committee, and I was there to hear \nit, said we should never tear down this necessary fence. He meant the \nfilibuster that protects us from an excess of the executive and runaway \npopular factions. But he said one other thing. Senator Byrd said in \n2010 that any majority leader had the tools he needed already in the \nrules to operate this Senate in the way it should be run. So we need a \nchange in behavior, not a change of the rules.\n  One more example that goes to the point the Senator from Kentucky \nmade. How important is it to be able to offer an amendment? Serving in \nthe Senate today is like being invited to join the Grand Ole Opry and \nnot being allowed to sing. The people of Tennessee expect me to have an \nopinion on their behalf about ObamaCare, about Iran, about all of the \nissues--how do we help unemployed Americans get a job, about the \nminimum wage or the lack of it. They expect me to have a say about \nthat, not because they want to hear me but because I am their voice.\n  Senator Byrd wrote eloquently about that in his book. He talked about \nthe Panama Canal debate. There was a tough debate. They didn't just \nbring the Panama Canal treaty here and plop it on the floor and say we \nare going to vote on it next Monday. Do you think it would have gotten \n67 votes? No, it would not have gotten 67 votes. How did it get 67 \nvotes? The Democratic leader, Senator Byrd, and the Republican leader, \nSenator Baker, read David McCullough's book and changed their minds and \nthey both supported the treaty. Then they allowed every single \namendment and reservation that anybody wanted to offer.\n  Senator Byrd wrote that many of those were killer amendments. In \nother words, they were designed to kill the treaty. But, he said, we \nallowed every one of them--192 of them. Nothing passed that was not \nacceptable to the joint leadership. He said we beat everything else. We \ntabled them or defeated them. But if we had not allowed that to happen \nand the Senators had not had a chance to have their say, we would have \nnever ratified the treaty.\n  I know there may be others who want to speak. But we have gone down a \ntrail in the last several years--just a few years--that I never thought \nimaginable. We have 43 new Members of the Senate, 43 Members of the \nSenate who are in their first term, plus 1, the Senator from Indiana, \nwho is in his first term but served before so he has a broader view of \nthis. Those Senators have never seen this body operate properly. Most \nof them are on the other side. So it is not necessarily their fault \nthat this is happening, but this is not the way the Senate earned the \nreputation as the unique deliberative body in the world. No one would \nrecognize it as that today. No one would recognize it as the authentic \ntouch of creative genius in the American system of government.\n  My hope would be that the Democratic leader would recognize this and \nhave a change of behavior tomorrow, or maybe later this afternoon. But \nif he does not, I hope the American people take this seriously and take \nit into account when they cast their votes in November and put six more \nRepublicans on this side of the aisle so a Republican leader can \nrestore this body to the luster it deserves, and the American people \ndeserve, as the authentic touch of genius in the American political \nsystem.\n  Mr. WICKER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we just heard a very eloquent speech given \nby\n\n[[Page S114]]\n\nthe Republican leader on the Senate floor about the history of the \nSenate and the role it has played in our democracy, its past, and what \ncould be its future if we can restore it to where it once was.\n  The leader talked a lot about what used to be taken for granted \naround here, such as the committee process working and functioning \nwhere committees reported legislation out, worked on it, and brought it \nto the floor.\n  We had an amendment process. When legislation got to the floor, it \ncould actually be debated. We would have amendments offered and \namendments would be voted on. Individual Senators had an opportunity to \noffer amendments and could thereby be the voice our people who elected \nus to be here in the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, in many respects with this current Senate, the wheels \nhave come off. We find ourselves with a process where typically the \namendment tree is filled, which blocks amendments from being offered. \nPerhaps the best factoid with regard to that is that there have only \nbeen four Republican amendments voted on since July--half a year. Over \nthe course of half a year, we have had four Republican amendments that \nwere voted on in the Senate. In any institution where there is any form \nof open debate and open amendment process, there is going to be a lot \nmore votes than that, and I think that is very telling about where we \nare.\n  I was here as a young staffer back in 1985 and 1986. At that time \nSenator Bob Dole was the majority leader in the Senate. It was a very \ndifferent place. I worked on some issues for my boss, and he had his \nopportunity, as did other Senators at that time, to come to the Senate \nfloor, offer amendments, and speak out on behalf of his constituents on \nissues that were important to them and important to him, and that is \nsomething that has become a bygone era.\n  I also had the opportunity--prior to being elected to the Senate--to \nserve in the other body, the House of Representatives, where things are \nvery structured. There is a rules committee there that basically \nregulates what legislation comes to the floor, what amendments will be \nmade in order, and how much time is allowed for debate on each \namendment. That is how that institution was structured.\n  The Senate, as Senator McConnell the Republican leader pointed out \nearlier, is a very different institution by design. Our Founders wanted \nit to be different. Senator Alexander, in his remarks, talked about an \nauthor who described the Senate as a touch of authentic genius. We have \ngotten very far away from that in terms of its historic role and \ncertainly what should be its role today as we debate major policy and \nmajor legislation that impacts over 300 million Americans.\n  Today I come to the floor to discuss an issue that was debated here a \nfew years ago, which is an example--a byproduct, if you will--of one-\nparty rule, where a big piece of legislation is jammed through in a \npartisan way; that is, ObamaCare.\n  My colleagues on the Democratic side recently spent a lot of time \ntalking about income inequality. After 5 years of stagnation in the \nObama economy and an ever-growing gap between the rich and poor, I say \nit is high time for us to talk about that. But a critical part of that \ndiscussion that Democrats don't want to have has to be the ways in \nwhich ObamaCare is contributing to the problem.\n  As the last few months have made clear, ObamaCare is making it worse \nfor millions of Americans. Huge premium increases and soaring out-of-\npocket costs mean that families will have to take money that they would \nhave used to buy their first home or pay for a child's college \neducation and use it instead to pay for health care. Crippling mandates \non employers mean that fewer jobs are available for the unemployed and \nhours are reduced for workers. As if the economic problems caused by \nthe law aren't enough, recent weeks have made clear that the quality of \ncare is likely to diminish thanks to the President's health care law.\n  Contrary to the President's promise that you could keep the doctor \nyou had and liked, millions of Americans are discovering they will be \nlosing their doctors this year and their choice of replacement is \nlimited. Why? Because ObamaCare provides an incentive for insurers to \nlimit the pool of doctors--and I might add hospitals as well--that you \ncan visit. The President's health care law placed a number of new \nburdens on insurers, from new taxes to a requirement that everyone with \npreexisting conditions be covered at the same rate as healthy \nindividuals.\n  On top of that, the law gave States the authority to tell insurance \ncompanies how much they are allowed to charge for their health plans. \nAs a result, insurance companies are facing huge new cost increases \nwith very few ways to cover those costs. Many companies have chosen the \none cost control measure still available to them; that is, limiting \ntheir networks of doctors and hospitals.\n  In California, for example, as a Time magazine article recently \nreported, Blue Shield offered doctors a choice--be reimbursed up to 30 \npercent less for medical care or be excluded from the network. The Time \narticle was entitled ``Keeping Your Doctor Under ObamaCare Is No Easy \nFeat'' and goes on to report that ``among the providers who declined to \naccept the lower rates were some of the state's most prestigious--and \nexpensive--hospitals, including Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los \nAngeles and hospitals affiliated with the University of California.''\n  There is a reason these hospitals are prestigious and expensive. They \nare on the cutting edge of medical research and offer breakthrough \ntreatments that are unavailable at many other hospitals. People come to \nthese hospitals when other treatments have failed, and they often find \nhope. But these kinds of hospitals--world-class, cutting-edge \nfacilities--are the hospitals most likely to be excluded from exchange \nplans.\n  Time reports that ``a December 13 McKinsey study of 20 U.S. \nMetropolitan areas found that two-thirds of ACA plans analyzed had \n`narrow' or `ultra' narrow networks, with at least 30 percent of top 20 \nhospitals excluded for coverage.''\n  The consequences of these narrow or ultranarrow networks are many. \nFirst, of course, these networks might not include your doctor. If you \nhave been forced off your health plan into a new private plan or \nexchange plan, your new plan may not cover the doctor you have been \nseeing for years--the doctor you like and who knows your medical \nhistory. This is detrimental to any patient, but for someone who is \nbeing treated for a serious illness, this could be devastating.\n  Switching doctors midstream while being treated for cancer or another \nserious illness could have a disastrous impact on the quality of the \ncare the patient receives.\n  In addition to losing the doctor you have and like, these narrow \nnetworks also mean your choice of a replacement will be limited--at \ntimes severely limited--and that the same quality of care may simply \nnot be available in the new network.\n  Still another consequence, as Time points out, is the distance people \nmay have to travel to get to their doctor or hospital. Excluding \nhospitals from an insurance network may not present a huge travel \nproblem for urban residents--the article notes--but residents in rural \nareas may be forced to drive a long way to reach a hospital in their \nnetwork.\n  Time quotes Kaiser Family Foundation senior fellow Karen Pollitz, who \nnotes that exchange customers in central Maine have to travel as far as \nPortland to reach a covered hospital. That could be a 2\\1/2\\-hour \ndrive. That is not exactly ideal if someone is, say, having a baby or a \nserious health crisis.\n  Let's suppose that you do somehow find an affordable plan on the \nexchanges that does cover your doctor. You still may not be able to get \ncare. A recent FOX News article focused on expert warnings that the \nhealth exchange system may start to look a lot like Medicaid, the \nFederal health insurance program for the poor. Similar to the \nexchanges, Medicaid features narrow provider networks, as many doctors \neither refuse Medicaid patients all together or limit the number they \nsee because of Medicaid's lower reimbursements.\n  So what is the result? Medicaid patients generally face worse \noutcomes than patients with private insurance.\n\n[[Page S115]]\n\nThey wait longer for doctors if they can get in to see them at all. The \nsurvey published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 66 \npercent of children on Medicaid were denied appointments with \nspecialists compared to just 11 percent of children covered by private \ninsurance. Patients on Medicaid are more likely to suffer complications \nand spend longer in the hospital, and they are more likely to die from \ncancer, surgical complications, and other problems.\n\n  Unfortunately, this could soon be the future of those forced into \nnarrow networks on the exchanges. Patients will be denied access to top \ndoctors and hospitals and will be forced to compete with other patients \nfor access to a limited number of health care providers. Even those \nAmericans whose plans cover their preferred doctors will not \nnecessarily be able to get in to see their doctor if he is forced to \nstart limiting the number of exchange patients he takes.\n  Analysts, Fox News warns, ``emphasize . . . that having health \ninsurance won't necessarily translate into access to health care.''\n  Let me repeat that: Analysts emphasize that having health insurance \nwon't necessarily translate into access to health care.\n  This is what the grand promise of ObamaCare has come to: Even those \nwho have managed to make their way through the broken exchange Web \nsites and find an affordable plan still may not be able to get health \ncare.\n  Is this the rosy future we were promised? ObamaCare was supposed to \nfix our health care system. The President promised it would reduce \ncosts and expand access to care. Every American was supposed to \nbenefit. Instead, millions of Americans have lost their plans. Health \ninsurance costs have soared. There are parents who now can't afford to \ninsure their children and cancer patients who are losing their doctors \nand hospitals. Those few who have gained coverage are facing a system \nwell on its way to becoming a copy of Medicaid.\n  Surely we can do better. We have to do better. It is time to abandon \nthe failed ObamaCare experiment and move on to real health care reform. \nWe can do that and we should do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                        Truth in Settlements Act\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I rise to support the Truth in Settlements \nAct. This bipartisan legislation, which I introduced earlier today with \nmy colleague from Oklahoma, Dr. Coburn, will help the public hold \nFederal agencies accountable for the settlements they make with \ncorporate wrongdoers.\n  I am honored to partner with Dr. Coburn on this bill. In his decade \nin the Senate, he has been a leader in the fight for greater government \ntransparency. Dr. Coburn and I do not agree on every issue, but we \nstrongly agree that sunlight is a critical component of good \ngovernment. That is the motivation behind the Truth in Settlements Act, \nand I am proud to fight alongside Dr. Coburn to advance this \nlegislation.\n  When companies break the law, Federal enforcement agencies are \nresponsible for holding them accountable. In nearly every instance, \nagencies choose to resolve cases through settlement rather than going \nto a public trial. The government agencies defend this practice by \narguing that their eagerness to settle is in the best interests of the \nAmerican people. But their actions paint a very different picture.\n  If agencies were truly confident that these settlements were good \ndeals for the public, they would be enthusiastic about publicly \ndisclosing all of the key details of those agreements--hang it right \nout there so everyone can see what a great job they did on behalf of \nthe American people.\n  So is that what they do? No. Instead, time after time, agencies do \nthe opposite, hiding critical details about their settlements in the \nfine print or, worse, hiding those details entirely out of public view.\n  Copies of these agreements--or even the basic facts about the \nagreement--are not easily accessible online. Many agencies regularly \ndeem agreements confidential without any public explanation. When \nagencies do make public statements about these agreements, they often \ntrumpet large dollar amounts of money for the taxpayers. What they \ndon't trumpet is that the companies often pay dramatically less than \nthe ``sticker price''--through ``credits''--for engaging in routine \nactivities or through potentially huge tax deductions.\n  Add up all of these tricks and we end up with a predictable result: \nToo often the American people only see what the agencies want them to \nsee about these agreements.\n  These hidden details can make all the difference. When we dig below \nthe surface, settlements that seem tough and fair can end up looking \nlike sweetheart deals.\n  For example, last year, Federal regulators entered into a settlement \nwith 13 mortgage servicers accused of illegal foreclosure practices. \nThe ``sticker price'' on the settlement was $8.5 billion--that is a \nreally nice headline--but $5.2 billion of the settlement was in the \nform of credits, not in cash outlays. These credits were described in \nthe government's press release as covering what they called ``loan \nmodifications and forgiveness of deficiency judgments.'' So what does \nthat mean? Well, it turns out the servicers could rack up those credits \nby forgiving mere fractions of large unpaid loans. So, for example, if \na servicer wrote down $15,000 of a $500,000 unpaid loan balance, that \nservicer doesn't just get a $15,000 credit for the amount they wrote \ndown, they get a credit for the whole $500,000--the full value of the \nloan. That method of calculating credits--buried in the fine print--\ncould end up cutting by more than half the overall value of the $8.5 \nbillion settlement.\n  Another way to hide the ball is to omit an upfront determination and \ndisclosure of whether the settlement will be tax deductible. Several \nyears ago, the Justice Department announced a $385 million settlement \nwith Fresenius Medical Care for allegedly defrauding Medicare and other \nhealth programs for years. When the agreement was originally announced, \nthe Justice Department touted the sticker price as the agency's largest \ncivil recovery to date in a health care fraud case. But the DOJ didn't \nsay a word about the tax treatment. The agency's failure to even \nconsider that issue was a very costly mistake. By the time the company \nfinished claiming all of its tax deductions from the settlement, it \nended up paying $100 million less than originally advertised. In other \nwords, the taxpayers picked up more than a quarter of the tab.\n  It takes a lot of digging around to uncover these unflattering \ndetails, but at least it was possible to do so in these cases because \nof public information about these two agreements. For settlements that \nare kept confidential, the public is completely in the dark.\n  Just last year, Wells Fargo agreed to pay the Federal Housing Finance \nAgency $335 million for allegedly fraudulent sales of mortgage-backed \nsecurities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That is about 6 percent of \nwhat JPMorgan paid in a public settlement with FHFA to address very \nsimilar claims. So in what ways did the actions of Wells Fargo differ \nfrom those of JPMorgan? We will never know, because the JPMorgan \nsettlement is public, but the much smaller Wells Fargo settlement is \nconfidential.\n  The American people deserve better. Government enforcement agencies \nwork for us, not for the companies they regulate. Agencies should not \nbe able to cut bad deals and then hide behind their embarrassing \ndetails. The public deserves to know what is going on.\n  The Truth in Settlements Act requires transparency. It requires \nagencies making public statements about their settlements to include \nexplanations of how companies get credits and whether the wrongdoers \nwill be eligible for tax breaks for their settlement payments. The bill \nalso requires agencies to post text and basic information about their \nsettlements online. And while the legislation permits confidential \nsettlements, it requires agencies to disclose how frequently they are \ninvoking confidentiality and to explain their reasons for doing so.\n  If we expect government agencies to hold companies accountable for \nbreaking the law, then we, the public, must be able to hold agencies \naccountable for enforcing the law. We can't do that if we are kept in \nthe dark. The Truth in Settlements Act shines a light on these agency \ndecisions, and it gives the American people a chance to hold\n\n[[Page S116]]\n\nagencies accountable for fairly and effectively enforcing our laws. I \nurge my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Congratulating Greg Maddux\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Republican leader and I don't agree on \neverything, but we do agree on some. There is one thing no one can \ndispute we agree on, and that is our love of baseball. We both love \nbaseball season. It gives us an opportunity, when we go home after \nworking here, to turn on the TV and watch a few innings of a baseball \ngame.\n  For some people, baseball is a very slow, boring opportunity to watch \npeople moving slowly, but Senator McConnell and I love it. We talk \nabout baseball. We love the Nationals. He and I have great affection \nfor the Nationals because of Bryce Harper, a Las Vegas athlete.\n  The reason I mention that is because today, Nevada's greatest \nbaseball hero--in fact, one of the greatest baseball heroes not of \nNevada but of all time--was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n  Greg Maddux is an extremely nice man--a man of humility. I have gone \nout to dinner with him and his lovely wife a few times. I know his \nbrother well, who was also a professional baseball player, and he would \nbe the first to say when he was playing baseball and today about how \naverage he was: I am not a great athlete. But he is one of the best of \nall time.\n  He started his career with the Chicago Cubs and went on to win 355 \nprofessional Major League Baseball games and four consecutive Cy Young \nawards. Today he received almost 98 percent of all votes cast--the \nsecond highest tally in the history of Hall of Fame voting.\n  So I congratulate this good man on the honor he received so \ndeservedly--I repeat, a man of humility; a man who had probably the \ngreatest control in the history of baseball of being able to throw a \nball to the spot he wanted. He is not a big man. That is an \nunderstatement. He is not a big man, but he was precise in where he \ncould throw that baseball.\n  I have such fond memories of Greg Maddux. The last election was kind \nof a hard election for me. So I called Greg. I called him on his cell \nphone. I said: Greg, I want you to be a Republican for Reid. Would you \ndo that?\n  He said: I will do that.\n  I said: What are you doing?\n  He said: I am playing golf.\n  I said: Can you break 80?\n  And he said: If you leave me alone, I can break 70.\n  Greg Maddux is a fine man. I have great affection for him and his \nfamily. I am sure this is one thing that Senator McConnell and I agree \non.\n  This afternoon, the Republican leader came to the floor to complain \nabout the minority's ability to offer amendments, in particular, to \noffer amendments on the 3-month extension of the legislation now before \nthis body. It is interesting that during the Republican leader's \nremarks there wasn't a word uttered about jobs, about unemployment \ncompensation, or the economy--not a word.\n  So it is very clear what went on here today with my Republican \ncolleagues. Remember, the Republican leader came and Republican \nSenators came and sat here with him. It is impossible for my Republican \ncolleagues to explain to the American people their callous opposition \nto the plight of the 1.3 million Americans. About 20,000 of them live \nin Nevada.\n  Two very fine Senators on a bipartisan basis have this legislation \nbefore this body: Jack Reed of Rhode Island--and Rhode Island is tied, \nas we speak, with Nevada for the highest unemployment rate in the \ncountry--and the other Senator is my friend, the Republican Senator \nfrom Nevada, the junior Senator from Nevada Dean Heller. It is an \nimportant move they made on behalf of their States and the American \npeople.\n  Republicans, though, do not want to talk about the problems facing \nthe middle class, as evidenced by what went on this afternoon. They do \nnot want to talk--these Republicans--about the solutions to falling \nwages and job shortages.\n  In America today, the rich are getting richer and the poor are \ngetting poorer and the middle class is being squeezed. During the last \n30 years, the top 1 percent's wealth and income has increased by triple \nnumbers--triple. But what has happened to the middle class during that \nsame 30 years? Their wages have gone down 10 percent--tripling to going \ndown 10 percent.\n  So they do not want to talk about this, and that is why they plan to \nvote against an extension of these emergency unemployment insurance \nbenefits. The vast majority of them voted to not even let us get on the \nbill and have a debate, but a few stepped forward and said: No, we \nshould have a debate on this, and a debate we are having.\n  My Republican colleagues are looking for a distraction, a diversion, \na phony process argument to steal attention away from their \nunconscionable stand on the issues that matter most to the middle \nclass.\n  This issue of unemployment insurance was not developed by some \npolitical science professor from Harvard or Yale or Stanford. It is \nsomething to help people who are in desperate shape.\n  I repeat, they are looking for a distraction, a process argument to \nsteal attention away from their unconscionable stand on the issues that \nmatter most to the middle class. You have to give them credit, they are \ndoing their best to divert attention away from this issue. This is \nopposition--and it is coldhearted--to extending unemployment benefits. \nIt is a very tough position to defend, especially when Republicans \naround America support what Heller and Reed of Rhode Island are trying \nto do. Democrats support it, Independents, but Republicans in Congress \ndo not and they have said so.\n  The Republicans' complaint that the majority never allows the \nminority to offer amendments is false. It is not true. It is another \ndiversion.\n  During my tenure as majority leader--there has been volumes of stuff \nwritten about the obstruction we have had with my Republican colleagues \nduring the last 5 years with the Obama administration. Think of the \nobstruction that took place when Barack Obama decided to run for \nreelection.\n  That was a little interesting because the Republican leader said his \nNo. 1 goal as a Senator and the leader of the Republicans was to make \nsure he was not reelected. He fell real short on that because he was \nreelected overwhelmingly. So during that period of time: obstruction, \nobstruction, obstruction, obstruction, and after he was reelected it \ncontinued.\n  During my tenure as majority leader, the Senate has voted on minority \namendments at a higher rate than it did during either of my Republican \npredecessors--and the largest rate of minority amendments probably in \nthe history of the Senate. But let's just talk about Republican Leader \nFrist and Republican Leader Trent Lott--both friends of mine. I still \nam in touch with them all the time. They are people I will always \nadmire and have great respect for.\n  Since I have been leader, 7 out of 10 amendments on which the Senate \nhas voted have been Republican amendments. Under Senator Frist's \nleadership, certainly there were not that many, I will tell you that, \nthat were offered by the minority. Under Senator Lott's leadership, \nonly 54 percent of the amendments considered by the Senate were offered \nby the minority.\n  During my leadership of the 111th Congress, minority amendments \nrepresented a greater share of all amendment votes than during any \nsingle Congress during either Leader Frist's or Leader Lott's tenure. \nFacts.\n  In fact, often the minority is prevented from offering amendments. \nWhy? Their own Senators will not allow amendments. How many times has \nthe Presiding Officer and others come to this floor and wanted to offer \nan amendment--objection on the other side because they want to offer an \namendment that has nothing to do with anything we are debating on the \nfloor at a given time.\n  Last year just a handful of Republican Senators held up any \nlegislation. The best example was the legislation\n\n[[Page S117]]\n\nwe tried to do dealing with energy efficiency. Energy efficiency. We \ncould not get it done because of Republican obstruction.\n  Often a particular Republican will prevent any Senator from offering \nan amendment unless he gets a vote on what he wants voted on first--a \nlittle unusual.\n  So let's not revise history. Let's talk about history as I know it \nand as the books report how we should know it, what the facts are in \nthe Congressional Record.\n  We know how under my friend the Republican leader's leadership there \nhas been obstruction in the way of the filibusters. Filibuster is not \nsome right that was placed in the Constitution. It is a privilege that \nwas granted under the Senate rules, and that has been abused big time.\n  Their obstruction has continued to be unprecedented over the last 5 \nyears. Half of all filibusters waged in the history of the country--\nthat is 230-plus years--half of them have been waged against President \nObama's nominations--half of them in 5 years compared to 230 years.\n  Last year Republicans mounted the first ever filibuster of a \nSecretary of Defense--by the way, a former Republican Senator. They \neven filibustered him.\n  I understand Republicans do not want to talk about how we can create \njobs, how we can boost the economy or any of the other issues that \nmatter most to the middle class. I understand that Republicans are \nstruggling to explain turning their backs on 1.3 million unemployed \nAmericans. But I do wish they would stop trying to justify their \nopposition to helping Americans in need with false claims and \ndistortions of the truth.\n\n  Finally, as I leave the floor, I prefer not to pay for this emergency \nsituation where we have long-term unemployed. This is an emergency, and \nit should be considered accordingly and should not be paid for in the \nnormal course around here.\n  We believe in reducing the debt. In the Senate Chamber with me now is \nsomeone whom I had the pleasure of appointing to the Bowles-Simpson \nCommission, the senior Senator from the State of Illinois, the \nassistant majority leader. He worked hard. We have not followed Bowles-\nSimpson as a bible, but it certainly has been a guide we have followed. \nWhile we could have done better, we have done pretty good. We are \napproaching having reduced the debt by some $3 trillion right now as we \nspeak. We could reduce it another $1 trillion if we could get \ncomprehensive immigration reform done.\n  The goal of Bowles-Simpson was $4 trillion. So when I say this is \nsomething that has not been paid for ordinarily in the past, that is \ntrue, but that does not take away from the fact that we all are going \nto continue to work on this side of the aisle to reduce the debt.\n  But I do hear that some of my Republican colleagues want to pay for \nthis. I disagree with them, but that is what they want to do. So far \nall we have heard from Republicans' pay-fors is this: take a big whack \nout of ObamaCare. There are 9 million people--approaching 10 million \nnow--who benefit from ObamaCare. So they want to damage every one of \nthose 9-plus million people. Or they have another one: go after \nchildren--children--with the child tax credit. Those are their two pay-\nfors at this point--a little scary, I would think.\n  So I am waiting, we are waiting for Republican suggestions on how to \npay for a full-year extension of unemployment insurance. Let's hear \nfrom them how they want to pay for it. They say they want to pay for \nit. Let's hear what they want to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the majority leader for \nhis comments, and I will be very brief because I know the Senator from \nIowa has a statement he wants to make.\n  Let me just say that the statement made on the floor earlier this \nafternoon by the Republican leader never once addressed the issue \npending before the Senate. Pending before the Senate is an emergency \nunemployment insurance bill that will provide benefits to 1.3 million \nAmericans who are out of work and for 8 days now have been receiving no \nassistance whatsoever. Imagine the struggles they are facing.\n  That is why we called this bill first when we returned from our \nholiday recess. We consider it a priority. We were heartened yesterday \nwhen six Republicans joined us to move this bill forward. It gave us \nhope that we were going to do something to get this done in a timely \nway to help a lot of deserving people all across the United States.\n  We hoped today, when the Republican leader from Kentucky came to the \nfloor, that he would address the urgency and necessity of this bill. He \ndid not. As Senator Reid has said, he wanted to talk about the Senate \nrules.\n  The Senate rules are important, make no mistake. But they are \ncertainly not as important as providing essential benefits, essential \nrelief and help to 1.3 million unemployed Americans--people who are \ntrying to pay their utility bills, avoid eviction, put gas in the car, \nand go out and find a job. That is a higher priority, and I had hoped \nthe Republican leader would address it. Instead, he wants to talk about \nthe rules.\n  What the Senator from Nevada, our majority leader, has said is a \nmatter of record. It is still amazing to consider this: Nearly half of \nall the filibusters waged on nominations in the history of the United \nStates of America have been waged under the leadership of Republican \nSenator McConnell during the Obama Presidency--nearly half. In the \nhistory of the United States, 168 nominees have been filibustered; 82 \noccurred under the leadership of the Republican Senator from Kentucky \nduring the Obama administration.\n  In the history of the United States, 23 district court nominees have \nbeen filibustered--in our entire history. Twenty have been filibustered \nunder the leadership of the Republican Senator from Kentucky during the \nObama administration--20 out of 23. Nearly half of all the nominations \nthat have been filibustered: under this Senate Republican leadership. \nIs there any wonder why the rules needed to be changed?\n  We look at the wait time of those who finally get out of committee \nand sit on the calendar waiting indefinitely. It breaks my heart to \nthink of the fine women and men who are willing to offer their lives in \npublic service, go through extensive background checks, make the \nnecessary personal sacrifices, and languish on our calendar for no \nearthly reason.\n  In the end many of them have been approved with overwhelming votes, \nand yet they have been subjected to these incessant Republican \nfilibusters. The case involving our colleague, Congressman Mel Watt of \nNorth Carolina, is one of the most egregious. It is the first time, I \nbelieve, since 1843 that a sitting Member of Congress has faced a \nfilibuster in the Senate when appointed to a Presidential nomination. \nFinally, we broke that after the rules change. I was heartened to see \nthat Congressman Watt was sworn in yesterday to this position dealing \nwith America's housing challenges.\n  But that was an example of an outrageous filibuster against a \ncolleague, a fellow Member of Congress, a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives. The coup de grace, of course, was the DC Circuit Court \nof Appeals, where we offered three well-qualified nominees to fill \nobvious vacancies on that Court, and they were stopped by the \nRepublican filibusters, one after the other without any complaint about \ntheir qualifications, well qualified for this position to serve on the \nDC Circuit Court.\n  It was not until Senator Reid lead us in changing the Senate rules \nthat we finally found this necessary relief. It is time for us to \nreturn to the issue at hand. Pending before the Senate is emergency \nunemployment benefits for 1.3 million Americans. As important as a \nrules debate may be to some in this Chamber, there is nothing more \nimportant than to deal with this in a timely way. I hope the \nRepublicans will take the advice of the leader that he gave at the end \nof his remarks, produce for us their pay-for, if that is the course \nthat they want to follow, for us to pay for those unemployment benefits \nfor the coming year. We are waiting for their response. In the \nmeantime, I hope that some will come forward and join us in what has \ntraditionally been a bipartisan effort to help those in America seeking \nwork.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S118]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first I want to thank our leader and our \nassistant leader for their great leadership and for their eloquence \nhere on the floor today and for correctly stating what the issue is. It \nis not rules; it is justice. I am going to speak about that myself.\n  Mr. President, 50 years ago today, President Lyndon Johnson came \nbefore Congress and spoke these bold words: ``This administration \ntoday, here and now, declares unconditional war on poverty in \nAmerica.''\n  Lyndon Johnson, as we all know, was born and raised in stark poverty \nin the Texas hill country, coming of age during the Great Depression. \nFrom hard personal experience, he understood how poor schools, empty \nstomachs, and bad health make a mockery of America's promise of equal \nopportunity for all.\n  When President Johnson delivered that historic State of the Union \naddress, our Nation was enjoying unprecedented post-war prosperity. We \nhad become, in John Kenneth Galbraith's famous words, the ``affluent \nsociety.'' However, in the midst of this Nation of prosperity and \nplenty, there was also ``the other America'' as author Michael \nHarrington told us.\n  Fully one-fifth of our population was trapped in poverty. Across \nAppalachia, in urban ghettos, in large swaths of rural America, \nmillions of American children were being raised in shacks and slums, \ngoing to bed hungry, attending grossly substandard schools. Worse, \nexperts described this poverty as ``intractable.'' Experts warned that \ndespite the Nation's overall prosperity, poverty was growing more \nwidespread, because as one study put it, the poor were ``not part of \nthe economic structure.''\n  A report then by the President's Council of Economic Advisors \nasserted that, ``future economic growth alone will provide relatively \nfew escapes from poverty.'' Economic growth alone, they said, will not \nsolve the issue of poverty. Of course, I must add, it is very much the \nsame today. Economic growth alone will provide few escapes from poverty \nfor people today if 95 percent of income gains are going to the top 1 \npercent, and if the rewards of productivity gains go to shareholders \nand not to the workers.\n  So it was in this context that President Johnson--keep if mind, less \nthan 2 months after he assumed the office after the terrible \nassassination of President Kennedy. It was in this context that he \nsummoned the Nation so that the unconditional war on poverty could be \nwaged.\n  For LBJ, this was both an economic challenge and a profound moral \nchallenge. It was about doing justice. In his speech to Congress he \nsaid:\n\n       Very often a lack of jobs and money is not the cause of \n     poverty but the symptom. The cause may lie deeper, in our \n     failure to give our fellow citizens a fair chance to develop \n     their own capacities and a lack of education and training and \n     a lack of medical care and housing, and a lack of decent \n     communities in which to live and bring up their children.\n\n  President Johnson continued:\n\n       Our chief weapons will be better schools and better health \n     and better homes and better training and better job \n     opportunities to help more Americans, especially young \n     Americans, to escape from squalor and misery and unemployment \n     rolls, where other citizens help to carry them.\n\n  In the months that followed this State of the Union address, \nPresident Johnson proposed specific programs to attack poverty and \ninequality. He articulated his broader vision for what he called a \nGreat Society. There is no better place to appreciate the boldness and \naccomplishment of this era than at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library \nand Museum in Austin, TX.\n  My favorite part is a room--I have been there several times--\ncommemorating the Great Society with plaques and signing pens all along \nthe wall, listing the incredible array of legislation that President \nJohnson had passed into law. Listen to these: The great Civil Rights \nAct, the Voting Rights Act, Job Corps, VISTA, Upward Bound, the Food \nStamp Program, legal services for the poor, the Community Action \nProgram, community health centers, Head Start, the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, the Higher Education Act, Medicare, Medicaid, \nthe National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities, Public \nBroadcasting, the National Mass Transportation Act, the Cigarette \nLabeling Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Wilderness Act.\n\n  It takes your breath away, to think about all that was done. These \nGreat Society programs have defined the modern United States of America \nas a compassionate, inclusive society, a genuine opportunity society \nwhere everyone can contribute their talents and abilities.\n  Last month, on December 4, in his landmark speech on inequality, \nPresident Obama noted that these and other initiatives have helped to \nreduce the poverty rate by 40 percent since the 1960s--have helped \nreduce the poverty rate by 40 percent since the 1960s. President Obama \nsaid: ``These endeavors didn't just make us a better country, they \nreaffirmed that we are a great country.''\n  However, on this 50th anniversary of President Johnson's great \naddress to Congress, I must acknowledge that there are some who \nprofoundly disagree with this assessment on the war on poverty and the \nGreat Society. They insist it was a great failure. Indeed, I have heard \nthis claim from many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nsince I first came to Congress in 1975. This supposed ``failure'' of \nthe war on poverty, this failure of the Great Society, has indeed \nbecome almost an article of faith and dogma among conservatives. It is \ntruly the triumph of belief over reality.\n  As President Reagan said on May 9, 1983, ``The great expansion of \ngovernment programs that took place under the aegis of the Great \nSociety coincided with an end to economic progress for America's poor \npeople.''\n  Wow. That is quite an assertion by President Reagan. So allow me, on \nthis 50th anniversary, to take a few minutes to point out many of the \n``failures'' of the war on poverty and the Great Society. Perhaps a \ngood place to start is by pointing out the ``failure'' of Medicare. At \nthe bill signing ceremony for the Social Security Amendments Act on \nJuly 30 of 1965, President Johnson enrolled former President Harry \nTruman as the first Medicare beneficiary and presented him with the \nfirst Medicare card.\n  These days we talk about life after 65 as the golden years. I tell \nyou, life after 65 used to be the nightmare years, with tens of \nmillions of Americans unable to afford even basic medical care, \ncondemned to live out their senior years in the misery of untreated or \npoorly treated illnesses.\n  In 1959 the poverty rate among older Americans was 35 percent. Since \nthe Great Society programs started, the poverty rate among seniors has \nfallen by nearly two-thirds. What a failure. What a failure. Medicare \nis especially personal to me. I remember my father, who was then in his \nlate 70s, and never had access to any regular health care in his life. \nMy father only had a sixth-grade education, worked in coal mines most \nof his life, and suffered from what they then called ``coal-miners \nlung.'' They always called it ``coal-miners lung.''\n  He would get sick all the time. If it were not for the compassion and \nthe generosity of the Sisters of Mercy who would take care of him when \nhe got sick and nurse him back to health, I do not know what would have \nhappened to him. But I can remember, coming home from the military on \nmilitary leave in late 1965, and my father had his Medicare card.\n  For the first time in his life, for the first time in his life--and \nnow he was approaching almost 80 years of age--he could go see a doctor \nwithout paying. Without taking charity. It gave him the dignity and the \nsecurity of knowing that he could see a doctor if he needed to.\n  The Great Society also gave birth to community health centers, as \nlong as I am talking about health care. Community health centers \nprovided essential medical care to the poor. The first two community \nhealth centers were opened in 1964, one in Boston, MA, and one in rural \nMississippi.\n  This model of providing basic health services to the uninsured and \nunderserved was an enormous success. Listen to this. From that modest \nbeginning of two in 1964, community health centers have expanded to \ninclude more than 1,200 community health centers in more than 9,000 \nlocations serving more than 22 million patients annually. What a \nfailure. What a failure.\n\n[[Page S119]]\n\n  I guess another failure of the Great Society was the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. We call it ESEA. Since Brown versus Board of \nEducation, the decision of the Supreme Court in the mid 1950s, \nAmericans acknowledged that we had two school systems, one for the \nmiddle class and the well off and a grossly inferior one for the poor.\n  ESEA said that all children, regardless of their background and their \ncircumstances at birth, can learn, and the Federal Government will \nprovide resources to help create equity--equity among our schools.\n  Educating children of poverty will always be challenging. We still \nhave large achievement gaps that still persist. But Title I assistance \nto America's neediest schools has made a dramatic difference for the \ngood of millions of low-income children.\n  If it has been such a great failure, I would ask any Senator who \nwants to repeal Title I and defund it, please step forward. Speak up \nhere on the Senate floor.\n  Will any Senator who wants to do away with title I and defund it \nplease step forward and speak up? I doubt there will be any takers.\n  What about the failure of the Higher Education Act? In 1965, it was \nrare for young people from disadvantaged and low-income backgrounds to \ngo to college. So President Johnson and Congress passed the Higher \nEducation Act, creating need-based grants and loans with reduced \ninterest rates.\n  Today, Pell grants, created in the later version of the Higher \nEducation Act, help more than 9 million low-income students gain access \nto higher education. The Higher Education Act has swung open the doors \nto college for countless Americans, creating new opportunities and \naccess to the American dream.\n  Again, I suppose some see this as another failure, another government \nhandout that prevents people from standing on their own two feet. \nDecide for yourself if vastly expanding access to higher education \nconstitutes a failure.\n  But before we do, talk to a lower income student, striving to become \na doctor, the first in her family to go to college, thanks to the TRIO \nPrograms, Upward Bound, thanks to Pell grants, thanks to low-interest \ncollege loans. Ask her if she feels as though she is an undeserving \ntaker, unwilling to stand on her own two feet.\n  In August of 1964, again only a few months after declaring the war on \npoverty, Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Food Stamp Act. Prior to \nthat act, hunger and malnutrition were shockingly widespread in \nAmerica, particularly in our rural areas and urban ghettos. Today we \nstill have millions of food-insecure people in America, but thanks to \nthe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the new name for the \nfood stamp program, abject hunger in America is rare. Tens of millions \nof Americans, more than half of them children, are ensured a basic \nnutritional minimum.\n  Is this another failure, food stamps? Apparently many Members of this \nbody think so. In June of 2012, 33 Republican Senators voted to block \ngrant the food stamp program and slash the funding by over $300 billion \nover 10 years.\n  I ask Senators who voted for those cuts, have you ever talked to a \nfirst grader who is finally able to concentrate in class because she \nhad a breakfast paid for by food stamps? Has anyone asked her whether \nshe would prefer to tough it out without a meal to start the day?\n  In 1965, Lyndon Johnson's Office of Economic Opportunity created 269 \nlocal Legal Services offices across the country, providing legal \nassistance to low-income Americans. This later evolved into the Legal \nServices Corporation.\n  As a proud former Legal Aid lawyer myself, I know firsthand what a \ndifference this can make in so many circumstances for a struggling \nfamily facing foreclosure, a battered woman trying to leave an abusive \nmarriage, a senior citizen victimized by a financial scam. I know that \nwithout access to an attorney the poor are often powerless against the \ninjustices they suffer.\n  Is the dedicated work of Legal Aid attorneys a failure? I vigorously \ndisagree. The American Bar Association vigorously disagrees. It \nstrongly supports Legal Services.\n  Every Federal judge and Supreme Court Justice, in their oath of \noffice, swears to ``administer justice without respect to persons, and \ndo equal right to the poor and to the rich''--to do equal right to the \npoor and to the rich. It is Legal Services, and Legal Services lawyers, \nwho helped to translate that ideal into a reality for poor people in \ncourtrooms all over America.\n  Our frontline soldiers in the war on poverty are the dedicated \nprofessionals and volunteers in Community Action Agencies, another \nGreat Society program. These are funded by the Federal Community \nServices Block Grant. In 2012, these locally driven agencies served \nnearly 19 million low-income Americans, including more than 5 million \nchildren, more than 2 million people with disabilities, and 2.5 million \nseniors served by community action agencies.\n  These agencies equip people with skills to return to work. They \nprovide food, clothing, other emergency assistance. They administer \nHead Start Programs, other preschool programs, and do a lot more.\n  People can decide if the Community Action Program, Community Action \nAgency, and Community Services Block Grant have been a failure. But \nbefore they do, drop in on a Community Action Agency in your State. See \nfor yourself the amazing work they do in relieving poverty and helping \npeople to escape.\n  Speak to members of a local Community Action Agency board and people \nwill find that they are local business people, bankers, lawyers, as \nwell as people who receive the services. They will tell you how these \nagencies do so much with so little, performing indispensable services \nin their communities. Talk to them.\n  I can spend hours citing some other Great Society initiatives, but \nlet me mention just one more: the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  Prior to that act, African Americans faced open, legalized \ndiscrimination and segregation. We had our own American version of \napartheid. In many parts of our country, including in Washington, DC, \nAfrican Americans could not eat at the same lunch counter with Whites. \nThey could not use the same bathrooms, the same swimming pools, the \nsame water fountains. They literally were consigned to the back of the \nbus.\n\n  Because of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964, those Jim Crow laws and \npractices were ended in the United States of America. It became illegal \nto discriminate based on race, color, religion, gender, or national \norigin. Some apparently call that a failure--one of the Great Society's \nmany ``failures.''\n  You may decide for yourself whether America is better off today, \nwhether we are better as a society, stronger as a nation, because we \ndid away with segregation. You decide.\n  President Reagan, in his State of the Union Address in 1988, said \nthat the Great Society ``declared war on poverty, and poverty won.'' It \nwas one of President Reagan's catchy one-liners. But with all due \nrespect to President Reagan, it simply is not historically accurate, \nnot even close. From the time President Johnson took office in 1963, \nuntil 1970, as the full impact of the Great Society programs began to \nbe felt, the number of Americans living below the poverty line dropped \nfrom 22.2 percent to 12.6 percent--almost cut it in half. The poverty \nrate for African Americans fell from 55 percent in 1960 to 27 percent \nin 1968. The poverty rate among the elderly, as I said earlier, fell by \nover two-thirds.\n  The great shame is that this progress, this war on poverty of the \nGreat Society, was cut short. The war on poverty gave way to the war in \nVietnam. Then it gave way in retrenchment later on in later \nadministrations, which cared less about giving a hand up to the poor \nthan about giving handouts to the rich in the form of giant tax breaks \nand other advantages. What was started as a percolate-up economy under \nthe Great Society became a trickle-down economic society under later \nadministrations.\n  On this 50th anniversary of President Johnson's great address to \nCongress, let me state unequivocally and factually--historically \nfactually--the Great Society has been a historic success.\n  However, I must note that 50 years later our Nation confronts a new \nset of economic challenges, societal challenges, challenges that are \nevery bit as\n\n[[Page S120]]\n\ndangerous to our democracy, every bit as daunting and intractable as \nthose confronted by President Johnson and the Congresses of his time.\n  Our economy is still struggling to recover from the great recession. \nThe sluggish recovery has left us with chronic unemployment and a \nmiddle class in crisis. Social mobility, the ability to work your way \nup the economic ladder, is now lower in the United States than in \nEurope. For the vast majority of American workers, incomes have been \nstagnant for decades, but the rich have grown fabulously richer. Think \nabout this: Since the official end of the great recession in 2009, 95 \npercent of income gains in the United States have gone to the \nwealthiest 1 percent in the last 5 years--95 percent of income gains \nhave gone to the wealthiest 1 percent.\n  Unlike President Johnson's day, today it is not only the poor who are \nat risk, our great middle class is endangered. Millions of formerly \nmiddle-class Americans have lost their jobs, their homes, their \nsavings, their hopes for a decent retirement. For too many of our \ncitizens, the American dream has become hopelessly out of reach. This \nis the crisis. This is the challenge of our day.\n  Are we rising to meet this challenge as previous generations of \nAmericans have done? No, I am afraid we are not. Inside the Washington \nbubble, too many of our political leaders have persuaded themselves \nthat the biggest issue of the day is the budget deficit. Ignoring \nchronic unemployment and a struggling economy, this 113th Congress and \nthe previous Congress pursued policies of relentless austerity, \nslashing budgets, defunding research and investment, destroying jobs, \nand even refusing to extend Federal unemployment benefits for long-term \njobless, 1.3 million of whom lost their last lifeline of support only 3 \ndays after Christmas.\n  I am disturbed by the apparent shift of attitude by many elected \nleaders toward the ordinary people who do the hard day-in and day-out \nwork that makes our country strong. I said it before, and I say it \nagain. We are seeing an attitude of harshness. We used to agree that if \nsomeone worked hard and played by the rules, they should be able to \nearn enough to support their families, keep a roof over their heads, \nput some money away for a rainy day, and have a secure environment. We \nused to agree that if someone loses their job through no fault of their \nown--especially at a time of chronic unemployment--they should have \nsome support when they are looking for new work. We used to agree on \nboth sides of the aisle that no child in this country should go to bed \nhungry at night. But in recent years these fundamental principles, \nvalues, and agreements have come under attack in our public \ndiscourse. For instance, recently on a Sunday talk show, the junior \nSenator from Kentucky said it would be a ``disservice''--a \n``disservice''--to the long-term jobless to extend Federal unemployment \ninsurance. I have his exact words right here. Senator Paul said:\n\n       When you allow people to be on unemployment insurance for \n     99 weeks, you're causing them to become part of this \n     perpetual unemployed group in our economy. And while it seems \n     good, it actually does a disservice to the people you're \n     trying to help.\n\n  When there are three people looking for every job; when in some \nareas, some States, unemployment is even worse than that, you would cut \noff their long-term unemployment insurance? Where are they going to get \na job? Maybe what the Senator doesn't understand is that before you can \neven get unemployment benefits, you have to be actively looking for \nwork. A disservice?\n  I guess our new attitude is, tough luck. You are on your own. If you \nstruggle, even if you face insurmountable challenges, well, it is your \nown fault. Tough luck. You are on your own. If you are a kid born into \npoverty or a single parent working for minimum wage, struggling to pay \nthe bills and put food on the table, tough luck. You are on your own. \nIf you are a 55-year-old worker who lost her job due to outsourcing or \ntechnological change, tough luck. You are on your own. If you are a \nperson with a significant disability struggling to find work and \nindependence and dignity, tough luck. You are on your own.\n  Mr. President, there is a harshness among too many in powerful \npositions toward those Americans who have tough lives, who are ill-\neducated or marginally employed or who have lost their jobs through no \nfault of their own--a harshness among too many people in powerful \npositions toward these Americans. President Johnson would rebuke this \nharshness and this callousness, as he said in remarks 3 months after \nhis war-on-poverty speech. Listen to what President Johnson said:\n\n       God will judge his children not by their prayers and their \n     pretensions, but by their mercy to the poor and their \n     understanding of the weak. I tremble for our people if at the \n     time of our greatest prosperity we turn our back on the moral \n     obligations of our deepest faith.\n\n  That was President Johnson.\n  So today, 50 years later, I remind my colleagues that we are still a \nnation of great prosperity. We are the wealthiest Nation in the world. \nWe are the wealthiest Nation ever in the history of the world. Our \nproblem is this prosperity and wealth is concentrated at the very top. \nThe workers who have created it are not getting their fair share. So on \nthis 50th anniversary of President Johnson's war-on-poverty address, I \ncannot agree with those who say the budget deficit is our No. 1 \npriority. I am concerned about far more urgent and compelling deficits: \nthe deficit of jobs and opportunity, the deficit of research and \ninvestment, the deficit of early education for all our children, the \ndeficit of basic human understanding and empathy for those in the \nshadows of life.\n  I am also concerned about the deficit of imagination today in \nWashington. I am concerned by our failure to confront today's economic \nchallenges with the boldness and the vision that earlier generations of \nAmericans summoned in times of national challenge. Indeed, our \nRepublican friends reject the very possibility that the Federal \nGovernment can act to spur economic growth and create good middle-class \njobs. This is their ideological position, and they are sticking to it. \nBut this flies in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary \nacross our Nation's history.\n  One can go back to President Lincoln, who insisted that every \nAmerican has a ``right to rise.'' To that end, he created the land-\ngrant college system, provided for the transcontinental railroad, and \nestablished the Department of Agriculture with the mission of helping \nfarmers boost their production and income and raise their standard of \nliving.\n  President Teddy Roosevelt fought for safe workplaces, the 8-hour \nworkday, and busting up the trusts that were strangling opportunity for \nordinary Americans.\n  Think of Franklin Delano Roosevelt who put to work millions of \nunemployed Americans, including my father, in the Works Project \nAdministration, building roads and dams and bridges and schools, many \nof which still exist today. Franklin Roosevelt created Social Security \nto end the scourge of poverty in old age.\n  Think of President Eisenhower, who championed investment in our \ninfrastructure, beginning with the Interstate Highway System, which has \nexpanded commerce and opportunity for nearly six decades now.\n  As we are doing today, let's pay tribute to one of our greatest \nPresidents, Lyndon Baines Johnson, and the enormous achievements of his \nwar on poverty and the Great Society.\n  Mr. President, I have not come to the floor today just to look back \nfondly and nostalgically or to try to correct the record about the \nachievements of the Great Society. I am here at the beginning of this \nlegislative year to urge my colleagues to look with fresh eyes at the \nurgent economic and societal challenges confronting the American people \ntoday. We need to think more broadly and with more ambitious vision \nabout how we in Congress can come together to create a greater society, \nan America of greater opportunity, greater economic mobility, greater \nfairness. We need to create what I call a new America.\n  Let's dare to imagine a new America where every child has access to \nquality early learning.\n  Let's dare to imagine public investments to create a truly 21st-\ncentury infrastructure, modernizing our roads, our bridges, ports, and \ncanals, building high-speed rail systems from Maine to Miami and \nSeattle to San Diego--a new infrastructure for a new America.\n  Let's dare to imagine retrofitting all of our buildings to make them \nenergy\n\n[[Page S121]]\n\nefficient, making wind, solar, geothermal, and other renewables the \nmain sources of our energy--yes, a renewable energy basis for a new \nAmerica.\n  Let's dare to imagine doubling our investment in the National \nInstitutes of Health, making possible a real war on cancer and \nAlzheimer's and other devastating diseases. Think of that--a cancer-\nfree, Alzheimer's-free new America.\n  Let's dare to imagine a true health care system where wellness and \nprevention and public health are the first priority, keeping people \nhealthy in the first place in this new America.\n  Let's dare to imagine a new retirement system where every worker \nbuilds a private pension that can't be touched until they retire and a \nstronger Social Security System--solvent, secure--with increased \nbenefits for the next 50 years. Think of it--a secure retirement for \nevery citizen in this new America.\n  These are the big challenges we in Congress should be addressing.\n  I know that by all means there are issues demanding our immediate \nattention--again, beginning with the need to extend Federal \nunemployment insurance for the long-term jobless. We will be voting on \nthat motion to proceed within the hour. As I said earlier, some 1.3 \nmillion Americans were cut off just a couple of weeks ago. Another 3.6 \nmillion Americans will be cut off over the course of 2014. These \nbenefits are not much, but they make a critical difference for those \nwith no other lifeline. So this is an immediate concern and must be our \nimmediate priority in these initial days of this session.\n\n  In addition, the Senate will soon take up my bill to raise the \nminimum wage to $10.10 an hour and to link it to future cost-of-living \nincreases. Get this: Since the minimum wage peaked in 1968 as part of \nthe Great Society, it has lost one-third of its buying power. So if you \nwere making the minimum wage in 1968 compared to what you are making \ntoday, you could have bought one-third more than you can buy today.\n  Over the decades, the minimum wage has become a poverty wage. Think \nabout that. People go to work every day. They work hard, sometimes at \ntwo jobs, and they are still below the poverty line. No person in \nAmerica who puts in a full day's work ought to have an income below the \npoverty line.\n  These two are the immediate moral and economic issues we need to \naddress. Yes, I say moral and economic issues. Today we do confront \nhuge economic challenges. As Americans, we pride ourselves on our \nrobust free-market system. Some say the unfettered free marketplace \nwill solve all our problems. Just let it go. They glorify the ideas of \nAyn Rand and academic theorists who say that greed is good, extremes of \ninequality are necessary, and poverty is deserved, which reminds me of \nthe words of the philosopher Bertrand Russell nearly a century ago. He \nsaid:\n\n       The modern conservative is engaged in one of man's oldest \n     exercises in moral philosophy--that is, the search for a \n     superior moral justification for selfishness.\n\n  I remind my colleagues that it is precisely the unrestrained, often \nrun-amok free marketplace that has created so many of the problems we \nface today. Financial and real estate bubbles. Who suffered because of \nthat? Ordinary Americans. Chronic unemployment. Who is suffering? \nOrdinary Americans. Stagnant wages. Who is suffering? Ordinary \nAmericans. Gaping income inequality. Who is suffering? Not the few at \nthe top. Disappearing pensions. Who is suffering? Ordinary working \nAmericans. On and on.\n  Like a busy highway system, our free marketplace only really works \nfor all when all the players obey essential rules of the road--rules \nput in place by government to avoid crashes and bubbles, to rein in \nwasteful and dishonest money manipulators, and, yes, to provide for \nsocial and economic justice. And there are some things--big national \nundertakings--that the private sector simply is not capable of doing.\n  At critical junctures going back to the beginning of our Republic, \nCongresses and Presidents have acted decisively to spur economic \ngrowth, foster innovation, and help create jobs. No question, that is \nwhere we are falling short today.\n  Members of Congress and elected officials across America can learn \nfrom the successes of the war on poverty and the Great Society. We need \na new generation of leaders with Lyndon Johnson's passionate commitment \nto improving education, expanding opportunity, and fighting inequality \nand discrimination. As I said, we need to come together to create a \ngreater society, a new America. We need to act with boldness and \nvision.\n  The war on poverty and the Great Society initiatives have defined the \nmodern United States of America as a compassionate, inclusive society, \na genuine opportunity society where everyone can contribute their \ntalents and abilities. We see the Great Society all around us today--in \ncleaner air and cleaner water, young people from poor backgrounds \nattending college, seniors and poor people who have access to decent \nmedical care, and people of color exercising their right to vote and to \nlive in the neighborhoods of their choice.\n  We see the great society in Head Start Programs, quality public \nschools, vocational education programs, college grants and loans, all \nthose rungs on the ladder of opportunity which put the American dream \nin reach of every citizen, even those from humble, hardscrabble \nbackgrounds like Lyndon Johnson himself.\n  We might notice I said a ladder of opportunity. I didn't say an \nescalator. I think a lot of times my conservative friends say we just \nwant to give everything to everybody, give everybody a free ride. I \nalways talk about the ladder of opportunity. I don't talk about an \nescalator. An escalator is a free ride. With a ladder you still have to \nassert energy and initiative to get up. But there is one thing \nnecessary: The rungs have to be there on that ladder, many of them put \nthere by government and society acting together, things like affordable \nchild care programs, early learning, quality of public schools, Pell \ngrants, job training, and on and on. They provide those rungs on that \nladder, and sometimes people fall off the ladder through no fault of \ntheir own. They lose their job, they become disabled or they contract a \nterrible illness. In those cases, it is the moral duty of government \nand society working collectively to provide a hand back up. Things \nlike, yes, unemployment insurance, disability insurance, job training, \nand many others.\n  Up until 1990, we looked around America and we saw that no matter how \nhard they tried, they could never climb that ladder of opportunity. \nThese were Americans with disabilities. So in 1990 we passed the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. Again, we built a ramp of opportunity. \nWe didn't build a moving walkway; that is a free ride. I have often \npointed out, not one dime in the Americans with Disabilities Act goes \nto a person with disabilities. What we did is we broke down the \nbarriers. We built the ramps to accessible buses and trains, provided \naccessible workplaces, widened doors in accessible bathrooms. We broke \ndown the barriers so people with disabilities could exert their own \nenergy and initiative to get up that ramp.\n  Like every great leader in our Nation's history, Lyndon Baines \nJohnson brought us a giant step closer to achieving our highest ideals \nas a people. He fought passionately for social and economic justice for \nall Americans. He fought to put the American dream within reach of \nevery citizen, and he saw this as a moral imperative. That is why I \nconsider him one of our greatest Presidents. This is the legacy we \nsalute today. This is the lesson we should learn as we move forward in \nthis country. As we move from this 50th anniversary of President \nJohnson's great address to Congress, it is this spirit of ambitious \npublic purpose that we should strive to emulate in the legislative year \nahead and the legislative years to come.\n  Fifty years ago today, Lyndon Johnson spoke to our deepest moral \nunderpinnings. He didn't just couch it in terms of an economic \nsolution. It was justice. It was making sure the American dream really \nwas alive for all. We can't in our time become small-minded, looking \nupon just what is good for today or what are the economics of things. \nWe have to think about it in terms of what our commitment is for moral, \neconomic, and social justice for all Americans. That was the lesson of \nPresident Lyndon Johnson. That is\n\n[[Page S122]]\n\nwhat we should take from this 50th anniversary.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, when the history books are written about \nthose who fought hardest against poverty, who stood up for those with \nno voice, with very little power and an increasingly unfair economy, \nLBJ and his war on poverty will be a few chapters in that book. Senator \nTom Harkin will occupy a pretty big place in that story as well. I \nsalute him for spending the time to talk about this long fight on \npoverty this country has waged, and still needs to wage, and salute the \nrole he has played. It is an inspiration to many of us who have sought \nto try to stand in his shoes and in his place.\n  I wish to talk about the same subject, because over the holidays I \nhad the chance to spend a day in New Haven, CT, with a 40-year-old \nhomeless man who up until last spring had been employed for the better \npart of the last 20 years. But as has happened to millions of Americans \nover the last several years, this man--who I will call for today's \npurposes Nick--lost his job.\n  Nick has had it tough his whole life. His father was a drug addict \nwho got Nick addicted to crack when he was 13 years old. He was born \ninto a cycle of drug use and violence and poverty that is far too \nprevalent in places like New Haven and Bridgeport and cities across \nthis country. But despite the odds stacked against him, Nick graduated \nfrom high school, he built a career for himself around sales. Now, \nafter 20 years of working and 40 years of fighting the odds, Nick for \nthe first time in his life is homeless.\n  So I spent the day with Nick, seeking shelter from the cold, using \nthe public library to apply for jobs, attending meetings that have \nhelped keep him clean and sober. Aside from receiving the support he \nneeds for his health issues, Nick spent most of that day just looking \nfor work. He wants to work. He desperately wants to get back on the \njob, and he is hopeful that one day he will find work soon. But he is \ncaught right now in this vicious downward spiral of homelessness. He \ncan't find a job without a home. He fills out dozens of job \napplications, but with his address being a homeless shelter, he doesn't \ncompete very well with other applicants. But of course, as Nick tells \nit, how can he get a home without a job? He is caught, he is stuck, \nlike millions of other Americans.\n  One of the things that keeps Nick from starving, other than the food \nand the shelter he gets from Columbus House and the local soup kitchen, \nis the $100 he used to get--until last week--in unemployment insurance. \nWithout that measly $100 a week, things get pretty dire, right now as \nwe speak, for Nick.\n  The fact is while unemployment benefits make homelessness a little \nmore manageable for a guy like Nick, these emergency funds are often \nthe only thing standing between a family where their primary \nbreadwinner is out of work and a life on the streets. It is during a \nlong stretch of unemployment where these meager benefits become the \nonly way a family can continue to pay the mortgage or the only way a \nyoung guy can continue to keep up with the rent.\n  If we don't restore unemployment benefits now, tens of thousands more \npeople will be living on the street. That is not hyperbole. That is \nreality. Then they will be captured in that same catch-22 of \nhomelessness: No job without a home. No home without a job.\n  Like Nick, there are 28 million Americans who have needed emergency \nunemployment compensation since 2008. These Americans aren't some \ndistant, unfamiliar group of people. They are our friends. They are our \nneighbors. They are people who have worked their entire lives and want \nto get back to work again.\n\n  I recently sat down with about a half dozen long-term unemployed \nindividuals in Bridgeport, CT, and we see the pain and agony on their \nfaces as they recount their daily hours-long quest to find work, \napplying to hundreds of jobs, making dozens of phone calls, and coming \nup empty. There is something almost dehumanizing about that effort to \nseek work, to prove your worth, and to come up empty time after time \nagain.\n  One guy I met, Ronny, sat behind a desk his entire career. He worked \nhis entire life in a white-collar job, and he said he would take any \njob. He would sweep floors. He would do anything just to get back to \nwork. He is not lazy. He is not gaming the system. He is just one of \nmillions who would rather do any job at all than be unemployed.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle say they are opposed to \nextending unemployment benefits because they want to get back to normal \nwith regard to unemployment insurance. But that reasoning totally \nignores the reality of this recession. Unlike the recessions in 1982 \nand 1991 and 2001, the unemployment rate has not fallen after the end \nof the recession with respect to people who are long-term unemployed. \nThe rate of those unemployed for more than 26 weeks is at the highest \ntoday than it has been in 60 years. There are now three unemployed \nworkers for every one job opening, compared to two or fewer workers per \njob opening in the wake of previous recessions. This just isn't a \nnormal recession. There are more people out of work for longer periods \nof time than at any time in most of our lives.\n  If you were in the top 10 percent of earners prior to this recession, \nthings are pretty much back to normal. In 2012, the top 10 percent of \nearners took home about half of all income in the United States. Those \npeople have recovered. During that time corporate profits were also at \nan all-time high. For those people and for those entities, things are \nback to normal. Maybe that is why some Republicans think it is right to \nbring unemployment insurance back to prerecession norms. But it is not.\n  One of the hallmarks of this abnormal recession is the number of \npeople who become unemployed and stay unemployed. Forty-three percent \nof the unemployed people in Connecticut are long-term unemployed, don't \nhave a job, and have been out of a job for months and years.\n  Rebecca, who lives in Connecticut, emailed my office and she said:\n\n       I am 34 years old. For the first time since I was 16, I am \n     unemployed. I am an attorney, and I apply to 20-40 jobs per \n     week.\n\n  Another woman wrote to my office:\n\n       My husband has been out of work for 52 weeks. He spent 30+ \n     years in the banking industry. His last position was as a \n     regional director of retirement services.\n\n  Frank from Meriden, CT, writes:\n\n       I have worked all my life--43 years. I was laid off in 2009 \n     and again in 2013. In both instances, I dedicated my \n     unemployed time searching to secure a job. I'd prefer to work \n     as long as I am capable and with your assistance in extending \n     the EUC program, I may at least have a fighting chance of \n     securing employment. Please afford me the opportunity to \n     continue the employment search without the added burden of \n     discontinued benefits.\n\n  But we shouldn't only extend benefits because it is the right thing \nto do. It is also the economically smart thing to do. The Congressional \nBudget Office tells us that 200,000 jobs are going to be lost this year \nif we don't restore emergency unemployment benefits. In the week since \nunemployment benefits lapsed, $400 million has been drained from \nStates' economies.\n  You see, when we give people support during their time of need when \nthey are out of work, they spend that money--and they spend it quickly. \nExtending unemployment benefits offers the best bang for the buck we \ncan offer our economy. Every dollar we put into UI returns as much as \n$1.90 to the economy. CBO says that extending unemployment benefits \nthrough 2014 will boost the GDP of this Nation by 0.2 percent. One \naction of this Congress can boost GDP by 0.2 percent.\n  No matter what we do, it is still going to be a long road back for \nthose who have been unemployed for 1 year or more, who are going to \nface discrimination based on their age or based simply on the fact that \nthey have been unemployed for a long period of time.\n  Just giving them benefits does not magically put them back to work. \nBut the most remarkable thing that you find when you talk to these \nindividuals is that while they are frustrated, their spirit is not \nbroken. Every time somebody sheds a tear to me, recounting their ordeal \nof unemployment, their story always ends with a hopefulness that \nemployment is just around the corner.\n\n[[Page S123]]\n\n  Nick is that kind of guy too. He knows that things are going to get \nbetter for him. But as we walked around New Haven in the cold for 10 \nhours last week, and we talked virtually the entire time, he wondered \nwhether anybody down here truly cared about the dehumanizing existence \nof being without a job and being without a home. He wondered why \nCongress would turn its back on him and the millions of others who have \nbeen clobbered by the worst recession in our lifetime.\n  I have kept in touch with Nick in the days since I spent the day with \nhim. Just yesterday he sent me an email. He said:\n\n       I am sitting right now in the Department of Labor office, \n     updating my resume. Chris, I have not had any luck yet with \n     employment but I will keep trudging, just as I am doing in \n     pretty much every aspect of my life. I know it will get \n     better as I continue to strengthen my faith and stay on a \n     straight and narrow path. As long as I continue to do those \n     two things the sky is the limit for me, Chris.\n\n  Nick believes that things are going to get better for him. Millions \nof other Americans who have been out of work for 50, 100 weeks, still \nbelieve that salvation is around the corner. All they ask is that we \nextend some modicum of support to them so they can make that winnowing \ndream a reality.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, hopefully later this evening or tomorrow \nthere will be a very important vote regarding the extension of long-\nterm unemployment benefits. What that vote is about is to make it very \nclear which side we are on. Are we prepared to stand with over 1 \nmillion workers and their children and say, no, we are not going to \nturn our back on you, we are not going to leave you literally out in \nthe cold, worrying how you are going to heat your home or pay your rent \nor put gas in your car or, as fellow Americans, we are going to stand \nwith you and make sure you at least have some income through extended \nunemployment benefits coming in to your family.\n  I think, as we all know, the good news is that unemployment has gone \ndown in recent years. When President Bush left office we were \nhemorrhaging over 700,000 jobs a month--clearly unsustainable, clearly \na tragedy for our Nation. Today, while the economy is nowhere near \nwhere it needs to be, where we want it to be, the fact is we are \ngrowing several hundred thousand jobs a month. That is the good news. \nThe bad news is that real unemployment is close to 13 percent, if we \ncount those people who have given up looking for work and those people \nwho are working part time when they want to work full time.\n  The even worse news is that long-term unemployment today is almost \nthe highest it has ever been on record. Today it takes about 37 weeks \nfor the average unemployed American to find a job. Today, 37 percent of \nunemployed Americans have been out of work for more than 6 months. \nToday, there are three job applicants for every one job opening. The \nreality is there are simply not enough jobs for the 11 million \nAmericans who actively seek work.\n  If we do not extend unemployment benefits now for these 1.3 million \nAmericans, the situation will only become worse. By the end of the \nyear, we will be looking at close to 5 million Americans whose benefits \nwill have been exhausted.\n  I understand some of my Republican friends are saying, yes, we are \nprepared to extend these unemployment benefits, but we need an offset. \nLet me suggest to some of my Republican friends that if that is their \nposition--and I should point out that under President Bush, when long-\nterm unemployment was not as serious a problem as it is today, under \nPresident Bush, time and time again, extended unemployment benefits \nwere seen as an emergency and were passed without offsets. But if my \nRepublican friends believe they desperately need an offset now that \nBarack Obama is President, let me suggest a few of the areas they may \nwant to explore.\n  We are losing about $100 billion every single year because corporate \nAmerica is putting its money into tax havens in the Cayman islands, \nBermuda, and elsewhere. If we need an offset, what about telling the \none out of four corporations in this country that today pays nothing in \nFederal taxes that we are going to end their loopholes. Are we prepared \nto demand that corporate America start paying its fair share of taxes \nso long-term unemployed Americans can afford to have food on their \ntable or heat in their homes?\n  Many of my Republican colleagues believe we should repeal completely \nthe estate tax, a tax which only applies to the top 3 percent of the \nwealthiest people in America. We are talking about families such as the \nWalton family who are worth $100 billion. If some of my Republican \nfriends think the Walton family, the wealthiest family in America, \nneeds another tax break while working Americans who are desperately \nsearching for work should not get any help at all, I suggest to my \nRepublican colleagues they are way out of touch with the values of \nAmerica and the values that make this a great country.\n  I think there are some people who believe the folks who are long-term \nunemployed right now just do not want to work. That is grossly unfair \nand grossly untrue. Let me give a few examples. In Hagerstown, MD, \n3,600 of our fellow citizens recently applied to work at a dairy farm \nto process milk and ice cream. This dairy farm will be hiring 36 \npeople. Yet 3,600 people applied for those 36 jobs. Do those people \nwant to work? They sure do.\n  Last October, Walmart received over 11,000 job applications for \nstores they are opening in Washington DC. As we all know, Walmart is \nnot the highest paying employer in America. Yet they received 11,000 \napplications in the DC area at a time when they will be only hiring \n1,800 workers.\n  That type of scenario is true in many parts of this country. An \nemployer puts an ad in the paper, makes it known the company needs \nworkers, and they are seeing 10 times as many workers applying for \nlimited jobs.\n  The last point I wish to make is not only is this a moral issue, the \nissue of not turning our backs on people, some of whom who have worked \nfor their entire lives, at this moment when they and their families \nhave so much need--that is the moral issue--but there is an economic \ncomponent as well. If a long-term unemployed worker does not get the \naverage $300 check he or she would otherwise get, what kind of money \ndoes that person have to spend locally? What the economists tell us is \nthat when we dry up that source of spending in communities all over \nthis country, when people do not have the money to buy the goods and \nservices they desperately need, that in itself, that lack of spending, \nwill result in several hundred thousand jobs being lost in the overall \neconomy. So not extending unemployment not only hurts the individual, \nit hurts our overall economy, and the economists also tell us that not \nextending long-term unemployment benefits will reduce our GDP by about \n.2 percent.\n  We have a moral issue. We have an economic issue. If my Republican \ncolleagues want offsets, there are more than enough offsets available \nif they are prepared to ask some of the wealthiest people in this \ncountry and some of the largest corporations in America to start paying \ntheir fair share of taxes. But the bottom line is that in an economy \nwhich today is still hurting very deeply, we cannot punish people who \nare severely in need.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, President Johnson 50 years ago, as Senator \nHarkin was talking about, declared a war on poverty down the hall in \nthe House of Representatives in his State of the Union Message. A \nlittle later he visited Athens, OH, in the heart of Appalachia, and he \nsaid:\n\n       I came out here today to see you because we can't always \n     see poverty from the Capital in Washington. But you can see \n     it when you get out and ride the rivers and the range, the \n     mountains and the hills.\n\n  When President Lincoln was in office, even though his staff said stay \nin the office, win the war, free the slaves, preserve the Union, \nPresident Lincoln\n\n[[Page S124]]\n\nwould say, no, I need to get out and take my ``public opinion baths''--\nI need to see the people and talk to them and understand their \nproblems.\n  Pope Francis recently exhorted his parish priests to go smell like \nthe flock, obviously using the allegory of the sheep in the Old \nTestament and New Testament, but also saying to his parish priests: \nUnderstand how people live, talk to them about their issues and their \nproblems and their lives and live among them as much as you can, \nsomething perhaps none of us in this body--I know the Presiding Officer \nfrom Vermont possibly does more townhalls and meetings with people than \nanybody in the Senate. All of us need to do that more to understand \nbetter.\n  But as we debate the extension of unemployment benefits, $500 a week \nis the average benefit; 52,00 people in my State were cut off from \nbenefits at the end of the year, tens of thousands more will lose their \nbenefits if we don't act. It is not just what this means to parents so \nthey can feed their families and continue to look for work. But as the \nPresiding Officer knows, they need to continue to look for work in \norder to get this $300 a week on average. We also know it helps the \neconomy.\n\n  One hundred years ago this week, Henry Ford made an announcement that \nstunned the country. He said: Everybody in my auto plant is going to \nreceive $5 a day. Whether it was the young man sweeping the floor or \nthe autoworker, they were all going to receive $5 a day.\n  Whether it was done out of generosity or not, what Henry Ford knew \nwas putting money in workers' pockets--just the same as when you put \nmoney in people's pockets for unemployment benefits, which is the \ninsurance they paid into--the money that they get will help grow the \neconomy. It will help people be able to do things they would not \notherwise be able to do. That is the importance of the extension of \nunemployment benefits, and that is the importance of passing minimum \nwage legislation, which Senator Harkin also spoke about.\n  The fair minimum wage would raise the minimum wage 90 cents upon the \nsignature of the President, 90 cents a year later, and 90 cents a year \nafter that. At the same time it would raise the subminimum wage for \nthose people who work in diners, push wheelchairs in airports, and for \nvalets in restaurants. Those workers often make less than the minimum \nwage. The subminimum wage--the tipped wage--is only $2.13 an hour. It \nhasn't been raised since 1991.\n  The Harkin, Sanders, Brown--and others who are part of this \nlegislation on the minimum wage bill--legislation will increase the \ntipped minimum wage over time up to 70 percent of the real minimum \nwage.\n  I will close with a letter from Karen in Columbus. She said:\n\n       I had to come out of medical retirement because I couldn't \n     make ends meet.\n       I have now worked at a department store for four years and \n     still don't make $9.00 an hour. My salary goes entirely \n     towards rent and utilities.\n       My water bill just went up $8.00--\n\n  For those of us in this Chamber, if the water bill goes up $8, you \ndeal with it. It is not that big of a deal. She is not even making $9 \nan hour. The increase in her water bill is 1 hour of pay at this \ndepartment store.\n\n       My water bill just went up $8.00--as it goes up every \n     year--just like the electric, food, and gas.\n       Heaven forbid my car would break down or I would fall \n     victim to a serious illness.\n\n  I hope that our colleagues are getting their public opinion baths. I \nhope our colleagues are out among people listening to these stories.\n  I close, again with a quote from President Johnson's speech in \nAthens, OH, which was 50 years ago this year.\n\n       Poverty hides its face behind a mask of affluence. But I \n     call upon you to help me get out there and unmask it, take \n     that mask off of that face of affluence and let the world see \n     what we have, and let the world do something about it.\n\n  We have an opportunity today to do something about unemployment \ninsurance and help people get back on their feet. We have an \nopportunity in the months ahead to raise the minimum wage. To restore \nit to something close to what it was back in 1968 in real buying power, \nthat should be our obligation, our duty, and our mission in the months \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/08/senate-section/article/S124-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to a period \nof morning business until 6:30 p.m. with Senators permitted to speak up \nto 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is a little bit humorous to me that we \nare talking about extending unemployment benefits in the midst of one \nof the most intense cold fronts in American history. I saw one \nnewscaster yesterday who said: If you are under 40, you have not seen \nthis stuff before. It has to make everyone question--and I am going to \ntie this together--whether global warming was ever real.\n  While I know the leftwing media is giving me a hard time for talking \nabout my opposition to the administration's global warming policies \nwhen it gets cold outside, I think it is important to point out two \nthings. No. 1, the administration is intentionally ignoring the most \nrecent science around global warming, and No. 2, global warming \npolicies costing between $300 billion and $400 billion a year, along \nwith the rest of the EPA's environmental regulations, are resulting in \nmillions of job losses.\n  We are talking about extending unemployment benefits, yet it is \nreally jobs we need, and the jobs are being robbed from us by the \noverregulation that is taking place in the Environmental Protection \nAgency, and of course, the crown jewel of all of those is cap and \ntrade. When I say $300 billion to $400 billion a year, that would \nconstitute the largest tax increase in American history.\n  I find that sometimes when we are talking about these large numbers--\nand I am sure the Presiding Officer agrees with this--it is hard to \nrelate that to everyday people, to our own States, and to how it \naffects our families. So at the end of each year I get the total number \nof families in my State of Oklahoma who filed a Federal tax return and \nI do the math. In this case, it would cost about $3,000 for each family \nin my State of Oklahoma to pay this tax, this cap-and-trade tax that \nsupposedly will stop us from having global warming.\n  It is interesting that people now realize this would not stop it. \nEven if we did something in the United States, it wouldn't affect \noverall emissions of CO2, and that is what we are talking \nabout. That is what makes global warming so important to mention as we \ndebate the extension of unemployment benefits.\n  If we want to improve our employment figures, what we need to do is \nstop the onslaught of environmental regulations that have come out \nduring this Obama Presidency.\n  First, let's talk about the global warming issue. It is interesting \nthat we have often seen global warming related to events affected by \nunseasonable or unusually cold weather. Often, this has occurred \nwhenever Al Gore has been involved in an event. Let me give a couple of \nexamples. In January of 2004, Al Gore held a global warming rally in \nNew York City. It turned out to be what would go down as one of the \ncoldest days in the history of New York City. Three years later, in \nOctober of 2007, Al Gore gave a big global warming speech at Harvard \nUniversity, and it coincided with temperatures that nearly broke \nBoston's 125-year-old temperature record.\n  In March of 2009, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was snowed out of \na global warming rally in Washington,\n\n[[Page S125]]\n\nDC. Because of all the snow, her plane wasn't able to land and they had \nto cancel her appearance at the event.\n  A year later, in March of 2010, the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee had to cancel a hearing entitled ``Global Warming \nImpacts in the United States'' due to a major snowstorm. At that time, \nI was the ranking member of that committee, and they were all geared \nup, ready to have this big hearing, and they couldn't do it because of \na major snowstorm. That was in 2010. So this has been going on now \nevery year going back to 2010.\n  Just last year, in July of 2013, a cruise liner that was chartered to \ndiscuss the impact of global warming planned to sail through the \nNorthwest Passage of the Arctic but got stuck because the passage was \nfull of ice. Now, more on that in a minute. In that same month, Al Gore \nhad an event in Chicago training people about global warming but was \ngreeted with the coldest temperatures in 30 years.\n  A lot of folks, even in the last day, have said that just because \nthere are cold temperatures does not mean global warming has stopped. \nMost alarmists will, however, correct you that it's no longer global \nwarming, but instead, climate change. Increases in temperature still \nmatter. In a November 2013 Executive order, the President implemented \nnew climate change policies--very expensive ones; large tax increases--\nstating that ``excessively high temperatures'' are ``already'' harming \nnatural resources, economies, and public health nationwide. In other \nwords, he's implementing his climate change policies because of rising \ntemperatures, otherwise known as global warming.\n  So temperatures falling and really cold days do matter. It does \nmatter when the ice caps are growing and temperature increases pause \nfor 15 years. And that is what has happened for the last 15 years. If \nglobal warming is not happening, then there is no need for the ensuing \npolicies--whether you call it global warming or anything else.\n  Monday was a cold day. At one point, the temperature average in the \ncountry was 12.8 degrees. In Chicago, it was 16 degrees below zero. \nThat broke the record that was set way back in 1884, when it was 14 \ndegrees below zero. This made Chicago colder than even the South Pole \nat the same moment, where it was only 11 degrees below zero.\n  Just this week, down at the South Pole, a number of ships were stuck \nin the ice, even though it is in the middle of the summer down there. \nThis was all over the news, and for good reason.\n  On November 27, a research expedition to gauge the effect of global \nwarming on Antarctica began.\n  On December 24, a Russian ship carrying climate scientists, \njournalists, tourists, and crew members for the expedition became \ntrapped in deep ice up to 10 feet thick.\n  An Australian icebreaker was sent to rescue the ship, but on December \n30 efforts were suspended due to bad weather.\n  On January 2, a Chinese icebreaker, the Xue Long, sent out a \nhelicopter that airlifted 52 passengers from the Russian ship to safety \non the Australian icebreaker.\n  The Chinese vessel is now also stuck in the ice along with the \nRussian vessel. Twenty-two Russian crew members are still on board the \nRussian ship, and an unreported number of crew members remain on the \nChinese ship.\n  On January 5, the Coast Guard--that is us; we came to the rescue--\ncalled to assist the ships that are stuck in the Antarctic. Our \nicebreaker ship is called the Polar Star.\n  Just a few months ago the journal Nature--that is a well-respected \npublication on environmental science--they published an article that \nsaid over the last 15 years ``the observed [temperature] trend is . . . \nnot significantly different from zero [and] suggests a temporary \n`hiatus' in global warming.'' This is not something that is appreciated \nby the Obama administration. What they are saying is--and this was the \nJournal--that it had stopped. In fact, I along with some of my \ncolleagues, have asked the President for the data backing up his claims \nthat warming is actually happening faster now than previously expected. \nConsidering the most recent data, those statements have not been true. \nNo models predicted there would be a fifteen year pause in global \nwarming, but the President hasn't yet fully responded to our inquiry. \nLet's go back. When you look back in history, and you look at these \ncycles, you have to come to the conclusion that God is still up there.\n  I have this from memory, and I think I will get this right. From \n1895--they had a cold spell that came in, and that is when they said \nanother ice age is coming. That lasted until 1918. In 1918, that all \nchanged, and all of a sudden it started getting warmer, and that is \nwhen the term ``global warming'' first came out. So from 1918 to 1945 \nit was a warming period that we went through. Then, in 1945, it changed \nand another ice age was coming that everyone was concerned about. That \nlasted from 1945 to 1975.\n  Then, in 1975--and this is interesting because in 1975 we got into \nthis time period we are talking about now; and that is, they were \nsaying that global warming is coming upon us.\n  Well, what is happening now--and these people have an awful lot of \ntheir time and resources and reputation at stake here--it is now to the \npoint where that has reversed and we are going into another one of \nthese cycles.\n  The interesting thing about 1945 is that 1945 was the year where the \ngreatest surge in CO2 emissions happened. It was during that \nyear. That was right after World War II. That precipitated not a \nwarming period but a cooling period.\n  In December of 2008, Al Gore said:\n\n       The entire North Polarized cap will disappear in five \n     years.\n\n  The North Polar cap is the Arctic ice cap.\n  Well, we are now 5 years later when, as Al Gore said, it should all \nbe melted by now. The deadline was December of 2013, Arctic ice is \nactually doing pretty well. Just last month, the BBC reported that the \nArctic Ice Cap coverage is ``close to 50% more than in the \ncorresponding period in 2012.'' In other words, in 1 year it increased \nby 50 percent. This is the very ice cap that Al Gore said would be gone \nby now. So contrary to what Al Gore predicted, the ice cap did not \ndisappear last year; it grew.\n  In May of 2006, Al Gore said in his movie ``An Inconvenient Truth'' \nthat the Antarctic Ice Cap melt could result in a 20-foot increase in \nsea levels.\n  You contrast that with the frozen global warming expedition down \nthere this week and a September 2013 report in the Washington Post that \nAntarctic Sea Ice has hit a 35-year high this past year.\n\n  Now, these things--people do not seem to stop and think. These were \npredictions that were made. This is the same Al Gore where there was an \narticle in the New York Times saying that arguably he is the world's \nfirst environmental billionaire, and all these things people were \nsaying were gospel truth. Now we know they are not, but nobody talks \nabout it. The media does not talk about it. When you put it all \ntogether, it is impossible not to sit back and wonder: If there is this \nevidence that the temperatures are actually getting colder, should we \nreally pursue cap and trade and other similar regulations and policies \nthat will cost the economy $300 billion to $400 billion a year to \nimplement? In light of our high unemployment levels--and that is what \nwe are talking about today; we are talking about extending unemployment \ninsurance--I do not think so. That is what we are here talking about \nanyway: unemployment numbers.\n  To help remedy the problem, I am submitting two amendments. The first \none I want to talk about is amendment No. 2615.\n  The EPA has systematically distorted the true impact of its \nregulations on job creation by using incomplete analyses to assess the \neffects of its rules on employment. They have even published that many \nof their regulations will result in net job creation.\n  EPA's costly regulations, as any reasonable person knows, actually \nreduce business profitability and cause actual job losses. New mandates \nand requirements do not help the economy add jobs.\n  For example, the EPA estimated that its 2011 Utility MACT--that was \npassed. MACT means ``maximum achievable control technology.'' In other \nwords, we come along in all of our great wisdom up here and we pass a \nlaw saying how much emissions can take place, and yet there is no \ntechnology that will accommodate that.\n  So the EPA estimated that its 2011 Utility MACT--that is the one that\n\n[[Page S126]]\n\npassed; it was passed into law--rule would create 46,000 temporary \nconstruction jobs and 8,000 net new permanent jobs. By contrast, a \nprivate study conducted by NERA Economic Consulting that examined the \n``whole-economy'' impact of the rule--and we are talking about the \nUtility MACT; that is what put coal out of business in a lot of the \nUnited States--the study estimated that the rule would have a negative \nimpact on worker incomes equivalent to 180,000 to 215,000 lost jobs in \n2015, and the negative worker impact would persist at the level of \n50,000 to 85,000 such ``job-equivalents'' annually.\n  The EPA estimated its Cross State Air Pollution rule would create 700 \njobs a year. By contrast, the same NERA study estimated the rule would \neliminate 34,000 jobs from 2013 through 2037.\n  It lets you know that the EPA is controlled by the President, and \nthey are there to fortify anything he says, even though we have studies \nto show just the opposite is true.\n  The EPA also estimated its Industrial Boiler MACT rule--every \nmanufacturer has a boiler, so this affects all manufacturers--would \ncreate 2,200 jobs a year. By contrast, NERA, in their study, estimated \nthe rule would eliminate 28,000 jobs each year from 2013 to 2037.\n  In addition to those examples, the National Association of \nManufacturers did a study that determined the cumulative impact of \nEPA's regulations is $630 billion annually and totals about 9 million \njobs lost. That did not even include the cap-and-trade regulations, \nwhich would cost another $300 billion to $400 billion per year.\n  The EPA has not yet fully studied or disclosed the impact of these \nrules, but we know it is going to be very expensive.\n  If we really want to do something about unemployment numbers in this \nNation, we need to hit the brakes on EPA's regulations. Let's do not \nworry about extending the time of unemployment compensation, \nunemployment insurance; let's do something about the costly \nregulations.\n  I think everybody knows some of the disasters that are taking place \nin the country. They are aware of ObamaCare. They are aware of what he \nis doing to the military. They are aware of the excessive spending that \nhas come from his budgets. But nobody talks about the regulations, \nwhich really exceed the cost of supporting greater national debt.\n  So my amendment does this by prohibiting the EPA from making any of \nits new regulations final until it complies with requirements under the \nClean Air Act's section 321.\n  Section 321 was put into the Clean Air Act back in 1977, and it was \nsupposed to require the Federal Government to state what the job impact \nwould be as a result of the various regulations it pursued. How many \ntimes has the EPA conducted this study? Not once. So that amendment \nwould help reduce the impact of EPA's rules on job loss.\n  My second amendment would actually help create jobs. It is really \nkind of unrelated, but since I am talking about two amendments that are \nvery significant now and would help resolve our jobs problem to a great \nextent, I will talk about amendment No. 2605. It would help us take \nadvantage of our vast domestic oil and gas resources.\n  We have seen huge increases in oil and gas development in recent \nyears due to the advancements in precision drilling, hydraulic \nfracturing, and other technologies. These technologies have unlocked \nthe shale revolution and, because of this, official government \nestimates now predict that we will become completely energy sufficient \nby 2035.\n  What they will not tell you is that this could happen a lot faster. \nRight now, 83 percent of Federal lands are currently off limits to oil \nand gas developers. There is not a good reason for this. It is just the \nadministration preventing us from having more jobs and energy \nindependence.\n  You have to keep in mind, we now and then hear people from the Obama \nadministration saying: Well, wait a minute, during the last 4 years or \n5 years, the production has increased by some 40 percent. But that is \nall on State property and on private land. On Federal land, it has \nactually decreased by about 15 percent because of the war against \nfossil fuels that has taken place out of the White House.\n  So the amendment I am offering would give these resources to the \nStates to unlock and develop on their own. The assumption here is the \nStates should be in a better position to know what they want to do with \nthese regulations in their own State and any damage that might come to \nthe environment--let them make that decision instead of the Federal \nGovernment doing it.\n  A recent report by the Institute for Energy Research estimated that \nif we completely developed these off-limits Federal resources, it would \ncreate 2\\1/2\\ million jobs and generate $14.4 trillion in economic \nactivity. But it would also help us achieve energy independence by \n2024, 11 years sooner than it would otherwise.\n  So if we want to create jobs, this is how we can do it. We should \nembrace our energy future and aggressively expand production. If we \nwant fewer people to lose their jobs in the future, we should prevent \nthe EPA's regulations from moving forward, at least until they fully \nstudy the impact the rules will have on job losses.\n  We have been trying to do this now for a long period of time, to \ndetermine what these costs are. When the American people find out, in \nterms of the dollars of cost and the jobs that are lost with excessive \nregulation, they will come and let their feeling be known, certainly at \nelection time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today, like so \nmany of our colleagues, to talk about the urgent need to pass \nlegislation to extend unemployment insurance. I was encouraged, as I \nknow many of us were, that the Senate voted on Monday to move to this \nlegislation. I really hope that we are able to build on that progress \nand to pass this critical assistance this week.\n  Emergency unemployment insurance has always had bipartisan support. \nCongress has acted eight times since 1958, under congressional \nleadership and Presidents from both parties, to establish extended \nbenefit programs when the unemployment rate is too high. In fact, as I \nthink a number of my colleagues have said, the program we are currently \nlooking to extend was actually passed when George W. Bush was \nPresident, with strong bipartisan support.\n  It is important that we do not turn our backs on Americans who are \nstruggling to find work right now. We cannot afford the economic \nconsequences of inaction. Failing to renew unemployment benefits will \ncost us jobs, it will hurt economic growth, it will eliminate a \ncritical lifeline for families who are struggling to make ends meet.\n  While New Hampshire's unemployment rate is below the national \naverage, if you are out of work, your household is 100 percent \nunemployed. There are too many families in New Hampshire who have \nalready been hurt by the expiration of these benefits. According to New \nHampshire's Governor Maggie Hassan and our State's Employment Security \nCommissioner George Copadis, the lapse in this critical program has \nabruptly cut off vital support for about 1,350 individuals in New \nHampshire. For each week that extended benefits are not available, an \nadditional 500 to 600 New Hampshire citizens will exhaust regular \nunemployment insurance coverage.\n  In total, more than 8,500 citizens of New Hampshire could be hurt \nover the course of the next year. That would result in a potential loss \nto our economy of as much as $14 million, according to the State of New \nHampshire, and it is a particular issue in certain pockets in the \nState.

Nancy Pelosi,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Republican Leader McConnell, \n     Speaker Boehner and Democratic Leader Pelosi: I am writing to \n     strongly urge your support for the reinstatement of the \n     Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program, a program that \n     provides a critical lifeline to thousands of New Hampshire \n     residents, and also stimulates the economy and creates jobs \n     as unemployed workers purchase essential goods and services. \n     It is imperative that Congress takes up this important issue \n     as soon as it reconvenes.\n       The expiration of the EUC program has abruptly cut off \n     vital support for 1.3 million of our fellow Americans, \n     including approximately 1,350 individuals in New Hampshire. \n     For each week that the EUC program is not available, an \n     additional 500 to 600 New Hampshire citizens per month \n     exhaust regular unemployment insurance coverage. More than \n     8,500 citizens of our state could be hurt over the course of \n     the next year, resulting in a potential loss to our economy \n     of as much as $14 million.\n       As we continue to recover from the Great Recession, we must \n     support measures that will encourage economic growth. \n     Although New Hampshire continues to experience lower \n     unemployment rates than most states, there remains a critical \n     need for the EUC program as our unemployed workers continue \n     their efforts to secure employment throughout 2014. Failure \n     to reinstate the EUC program will undermine our fragile \n     economic recovery.\n       Again, I urge you to act quickly and reinstate the \n     Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program. We all need to \n     work together to ensure that the economy continues to grow \n     and that we continue to lend a helping hand to unemployed \n     workers in New Hampshire and across the country.\n           With every good wish,\n                                             Margaret Wood Hassan,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            New Hampshire Employment Security,\n\n                                     Concord, NH, January 2, 2014.\n     Hon. Jeanne Shaheen,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeanne Shaheen: Our understanding is the \n     Senate intends to deliberate on extending Emergency \n     Unemployment Benefits (EUC) when they return from their \n     break. I wanted to take this opportunity to provide you with \n     information on the number of citizens here in New Hampshire \n     who will be affected by the loss of the EUC Program which \n     expired on December 28, 2013.\n       The expiration of the EUC Program is projected to \n     immediately effect 1,350 individuals who will lose their \n     benefits at the close of 2013. For each week that EUC is not \n     available, an additional 500 to 600 NH citizens per month \n     exhaust regular UI benefits. The highest impact over the \n     course of one year would be 8,500 citizens of our state. The \n     collective loss of these monies in local communities could be \n     as high as $14 million in 2014. Although New Hampshire is \n     doing much better than most states, there is still a critical \n     need for the EUC Program for new exhaustees throughout 2014.\n       The Department of Employment Security fully supports the \n     extension of the EUC Program beyond the expiration of \n     December 28, 2013. As you know the EUC Program provides a \n     lifeline for those individuals along with a little more time \n     and a little more hope as they continue to seek employment \n     opportunities in our communities.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me with any issues or \n     concerns you might have regarding the extension of the \n     Emergency Unemployment Benefits.\n       I thank you for your time and consideration of my request.\n               Sincerely yours,\n     George N. Copadis,\n       Commissioner, New Hampshire Employment Security.\n     Richard J. Lavers,\n       Deputy Commissioner, New Hampshire Employment Security.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. As these letters show, the impact of a failure to \nextend unemployment benefits is very real for thousands of working \nfamilies in New Hampshire. Of course, that is true, we know, across the \ncountry. Failing to pass this legislation will hurt our economic \nrecovery in New Hampshire. It will hurt the Nation's economic recovery.\n  The Economic Policy Institute estimates that the expiration of \nunemployment insurance will cost the economy 310,000 jobs, which is \nroughly the equivalent of a single month of job growth. We know from \neconomists from the Congressional Budget Office that each dollar we \nspend on extending unemployment insurance generates about $1.50 in \neconomic growth. It is one of the best places we can spend public \ndollars to try to stimulate this economy, to create jobs that can \nultimately put people who are unemployed back to work.\n  Although the unemployment rate has gone down and our economy has \nshown signs of recovery, we still have a lot more to do. We have to get \nmore people back to work. There is so much on the line, for jobs, for \nhard-working Americans, and for our economy as a whole. We should pass \nthis legislation on behalf of workers and families in New Hampshire and \nacross this country.\n  I also want to point out that I have filed an amendment to this \nunemployment insurance bill. I hope we will have a chance to vote on \nthis amendment. It is identical to a bill I have authored that has 19 \ncosponsors, including the Presiding Officer, the Military Retirement \nRestoration Act. This legislation would replace the military retiree \nand benefit cuts that have been included in the recent budget \nagreement. It would do that by closing a tax loophole that some \ncorporations use to avoid paying their share of taxes. This provision \nis designed to address corporations that set up shell entities in tax \nhavens to avoid being considered an American company and paying at the \ntax rate in the United States. They do that even though these companies \nare controlled and operated on American soil. It would ensure that \nthose companies pay American tax rates. I think most people would agree \nthat this kind of tax avoidance is unfair, that we should close this \ntax loophole, and we should do that rather than reducing military \nretiree benefits.\n  In addition to the 20 cosponsors of the legislation in the Senate, \nthere is a similar bill in the House that has 46 cosponsors. My idea of \nhow to pay for the military retirement benefit is just one idea. I know \nthere are other bills that have been introduced. I am open to those \nother solutions. But I hope we can work in a bipartisanship way to \nreplace these cuts before they go into effect in 2 years. It is \nimportant that we address this issue for the men and women who have \nserved this country so well, who have put their lives on the line for \nus. I hope we can do that as part of this legislation when we vote on \nit. If we are not able to do that, I certainly hope we are going to be \nable to address this in the near future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/08/senate-section/article/S127-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S127-S128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        PENNSYLVANIA CASUALTIES\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to offer a few brief \nremarks. I am joined on the floor by my colleague Senator Toomey. We \nare both here tonight to read a list of names of those who gave, as \nPresident Lincoln said a long time ago, the last full measure of \ndevotion to their country, Pennsylvanians who lost their lives in \nOperation Enduring Freedom.\n  We know that since the beginning of the conflict, Pennsylvania now \nhas lost to date--the latest number I have seen is 92 killed in action. \nTonight we will read the names of five who gave that last full measure \nof devotion.\n  Before I turn to my colleague, it is very hard for me to fully \nunderstand or appreciate what the loss of a loved one means when they \nlose their life in war. We often turn to quote Lincoln or the \nScriptures. They are both appropriate. One of the best descriptions I \nheard was by the songwriter Bruce Springsteen. He was writing songs in \nthe aftermath of 9/11. He had one song where the refrain was ``you're \nmissing.'' Of course, it could apply to a family who lost someone in \nwar.\n  One of the lines in that song goes something like this: You are \nmissing. When I turn out the light you're missing. When I close my eyes \nyou're missing. And when I see the sunrise, you're missing.\n\n[[Page S128]]\n\n  I can only turn to words such as that because I have never walked in \nthose shoes, of being part of a family who lost someone in Iraq or \nAfghanistan or in any conflict. So tonight we pay tribute to those \nPennsylvanians who gave so much to their country, and their families as \nwell have given so much to their country.\n  I am honored to be joined by my colleague Senator Toomey, who will \nbegin to read the names.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator Casey for \norganizing this brief tribute that is so much deserved by the \nservicemembers we are going to be acknowledging in a few minutes.\n  I would like to begin by extending my deepest condolences to the \nfamilies, friends, loved ones of these true Pennsylvania heroes and the \nlives that they led and the cause for which they died. Those men \nrepresent all that is great about this great country.\n  Some enlisted right after graduating from high school. During those \nvery tough and grueling days and weeks in basic training, I suspect \nthey never heard of the places in Afghanistan where they would make \nthis sacrifice.\n  These Pennsylvanians, of course, join a long list of soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and Coast Guard members who have given their lives for \nthis country, to include those who gave their lives in World War II, \nthe Korean war, the Vietnam war, of course the ongoing war against \nviolent radical Islamists all around the world.\n  It is no accident that Pennsylvania has suffered so heavily in this \nconflict, as it has in every other conflict in our Nation's history. I \nthink it is because in the towns across Pennsylvania, towns and cities \nsuch as Tafford and Mohnton, there are certain values that are deeply \nrooted in those communities: importance of family, importance of faith, \nthe importance of serving this Nation. There is a deep conviction that \nfreedom is worth defending, and a belief that a cause worth fighting \nfor is not just someone else's responsibility. These are the values \nthat have helped shape these service members, their families, their \nchurches, their houses of worship, and their communities. These values \nare exemplified in the lives of our fallen who will forever be honored \nby our great Commonwealth for their service to this country.\n  I will begin reading the names of the men who made the supreme \nsacrifice for freedom last year in this conflict, and Senator Casey \nwill complete the list:\n  CWO Matthew Paul Ruffner, U.S. Army, Tafford; CWO Jarett Michael \nYoder, U.S. Army, Mohnton; SSG Marek Soja, U.S. Army, Philadelphia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for starting the list. \nI will read the remaining names. I should correct myself. I said five \nat the beginning. I had the count wrong. It is actually six \nindividuals:\n  SSG Thomas Baysore, Jr., United States Army, Milton, PA; SGT Patrick \nHawkins, U.S. Army, Carlisle, PA; SSG Patrick Quinn, U.S. Army, \nQuarryville, PA.\n  As I conclude the list of Pennsylvanians who were killed in action \nover the past year, I want to say again we honor them. We pay tribute \nto them. By this brief commemoration we remember them. We remember them \nand we also remember the families they left behind. To quote Lincoln a \nsecond time, he once wrote to a family, ``I pray that our Heavenly \nFather may assuage of your bereavement, and leave you only the \ncherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must \nbe yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of \nfreedom.''\n  None of us could say it better than Abraham Lincoln did. But we offer \nthat prayer tonight to the families. So to the families of our fallen \nheroes, from these and from other conflicts, please know that they and \nyou are in our thoughts and prayers.\n  Again, I thank Senator Toomey.\n  I yield the floor and would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/08/senate-section/article/S128-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S128-S129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MILITARY RETIREMENT RESTORATION ACT\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am very proud to follow my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire and thank her for her leadership in offering the \nMilitary Retirement Restoration Act, which I am very pleased to support \nas an amendment to the unemployment insurance extension bill.\n  For all the reasons I have stated, and others have expressed even \nmore powerfully than I, this bill makes sense. We must extend \nunemployment benefits for the long-term jobless. The merits of this \nbill are absolutely indisputable and undeniable. This bill offers a \ncritically important opportunity, and we ought to seize it to correct \nand fix a defect in the budget agreement that was reached by the very \nexcellent work of our colleague Senator Murray and Congressman Ryan, \nand that was passed overwhelmingly by a bipartisan majority in this \nbody.\n  It was an agreement that advanced and enhanced economic certainty. It \nhad many advantages, but it also was far from perfect. Its flaws \nincluded a cut in military retiree benefits. These benefits were cut by \nprovisions to that agreement that was approved by this body, with many \nreservations and regrets, and now we ought to seize this opportunity to \ncorrect that defect as this measure offers us through an amendment.\n  We can pay for it. It can be budget neutral, if we simply close a \ncertain egregious corporate tax loophole as Senator Shaheen has \nsuggested. I want to emphasize again what Senator Shaheen said so well. \nWe can think of a lot of different ways to pay for the $6.5 billion \nthat is necessary to correct these cuts in military retiree benefits. \nWhat is beyond question is the need to fix this flaw. It is a flaw that \nnot only diminishes in monetary terms the benefits these retirees need \nand deserve, it also dishonors the service and sacrifice they have \nmade. What better opportunity than now, as we deal with the extension \nof unemployment benefits in a measure that deserves overwhelming \nsupport just as the budget deal received, to correct this flaw.\n  There has been a lot of misinformation and confusion about exactly \nwhat the Murray-Ryan agreement did to military retirement benefits, and \nthere is a need to address in the longer term the system that provides \nfor retiree benefits, to make it serve better the interests of our \nretirees, our veterans, our patriots who have given so much to our \nNation. But right now, in these next few days, beyond any kind of \nquestion or doubt, is the need to correct this defect and to follow \nthrough on the understanding that many of us had, including myself, \nthat in fact we would correct this defect.\n  I supported the budget agreement with the understanding, as Chairman \nLevin of Michigan made clear, the Senate would work this year, as soon \nas possible, to stop the 1-percent reduction in the cost of living \nadjustments for military retirees until the age of 62 that would take \neffect in December of 2015. December, 2015 of that year is a long way \noff. There may be other opportunities to correct this flaw--the \nreduction in retiree benefits--but let's do it now. Let's not delay in \nrestoring the benefits that these retirees need and deserve.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join in this effort, paying for this \nchange by making sure companies managed and controlled in the United \nStates can't avoid U.S. taxes simply by claiming foreign status. Many \nof us have long advocated closing this loophole. It seems to me a \nreasonable approach, far better than taking away the child tax credit \nfor poor migrant families.\n  Ultimately, the pay-for issue, the offset question, should be \nresolved, and I believe it will be, if not in this act then in the \nOmnibus appropriations bill we will address next and then make sure we \nkeep faith. We must assure that we will keep faith with these retirees \nwho have given and served so much.\n  As Senator Shaheen has said, most Americans would agree this kind of \ntax avoidance is unfair, and we ought to\n\n[[Page S129]]\n\nclose this tax loophole rather than reducing military retiree benefits. \nWhat all Americans would agree with is that we should keep faith and \nleave no veteran behind, making sure this amendment is voted on and \napproved and given legal force and effect so we correct and fix the \nflaw in the budget agreement that has disallowed and dishonored the \nobligation we owe these retirees.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/08/senate-section/article/S129-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S129-S130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING DICK CLARK\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on December 5, the world lost one of the \ngreatest leaders of our era, and of any era, when Nelson Mandela died \nat the age of 95. His capacity for forgiveness was rivaled only by his \ncourage. His actions serve as an example for the entire world. Having \nled South Africa out of its darkest period of history, Mandela focused \non achieving national reconciliation to transition his government from \nminority rule and apartheid, to a multicultural democracy. He was \nsuccessful in this endeavor because he believed in the importance of \nbringing people together, breaking down the barriers that defined, and \nimprisoned, many South Africans. For Nelson Mandela, the opportunity to \nlead meant the possibility of painting South African society on a blank \ncanvas. It meant the possibility of creating a unified and free South \nAfrica, rather than perpetuating a fractured mosaic defined by \ninequality.\n  We are fortunate to have leaders among us who share many of Nelson \nMandela's qualities of leadership and a focus on human rights. Having \nserved for nearly four decades in the Senate, I have had the privilege \nto serve with some of them. Dick Clark, a Senator from Iowa who was in \nthe Senate when I was first elected, is one such individual, and his \nstory is connected to Nelson Mandela's legacy. I not only served with \nSenator Clark but I travelled with him to Vermont and elsewhere. His \nsense of commitment and his conscience set a Senate standard that is \nrarely matched.\n  He was a fierce opponent of apartheid, and a recent POLITICO article \nrecalls Dick Clark's efforts to raise awareness in Congress on the \nimportance of the issue, and to push legislation that would distance \nthe United States from the South African government's activities in the \nregion. His efforts eventually contributed to his electoral loss at the \nend of his term, but that did not keep him from pursing his goals. I am \npleased that during this important period of reflection, Dick Clark's \ncontributions continue to be recognized.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the recent POLITICO article, A \nNelson Mandela backstory: Iowa's Dick Clark, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                       [POLITICO, Dec. 26, 2013]\n\n             A Nelson Mandela Backstory: Iowa's Dick Clark\n\n                           (By David Rogers)\n\n       Dick Clark was Mandela when Mandela wasn't cool.\n       A one-term Democratic senator from Iowa and for years \n     afterward a leader of congressional discussions on apartheid, \n     Clark is now 85 and long gone from the public scene. But the \n     ups and downs of his career are an intriguing back story--and \n     counterpoint--to the outpouring of praise for Nelson Mandela, \n     the black liberation leader and former president of South \n     Africa who died Dec. 5.\n       It wasn't always that way in Washington.\n       Indeed, Mandela turned 60 in South Africa's Robben Island \n     prison in the summer of 1978 even as Clark--chairman of the \n     African Affairs panel on the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee--was fighting for his own re-election in Iowa.\n       It was a time when Republican challenger Roger Jepsen felt \n     free to taunt the Democrat as ``the senator from Africa.'' \n     Tensions were such that the State Department called in a \n     South African Embassy official in May for making disparaging \n     remarks about Clark in Iowa. And after Clark lost, South \n     Africa's ousted information secretary, Eschel Rhoodie, said \n     his government invested $250,000 to defeat Clark, who had \n     become a thorn in the side of the white regime.\n       Jepsen denied any knowledge of South Africa's alleged role. \n     Nor does Clark accuse him of such. But 35 years after, Clark \n     has no doubt that the apartheid government led by Prime \n     Minister B. J. Vorster wanted him out--and had a hand in his \n     defeat.\n       Clark's liberal record and support of the Panama Canal \n     Treaty, which narrowly cleared the Senate in the spring of \n     1978, also hurt his chances in Iowa. But the fatal blow was a \n     fierce wave of late-breaking ground attacks from anti-\n     abortion forces--something even conservative writers like \n     Robert Novak had not anticipated in a published column weeks \n     before.\n       ``Abortion was the issue, and how much effect this apparent \n     $250,000 had to do with promoting it more, I have no way of \n     evaluating it,'' Clark said in a recent interview at his home \n     in Washington. ``No question that they did it. They said they \n     did, and I think they did.''\n       Clark had made himself a target for South Africa with his \n     high-profile chairmanship of the Africa subcommittee. In \n     Washington as well, he was not without critics who accused \n     him of being too puritanical, too quick to fault U.S. policy. \n     But like no senator before him, Clark used the panel to raise \n     the visibility of human rights issues in the southern regions \n     of the continent. The roster of prior Africa subcommittee \n     chairs reads like a Who's Who of national Democrats: John \n     Kennedy in the late 1950s; Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, father \n     of the future vice president; future Senate Majority Leader \n     Mike Mansfield; and former Vice President Hubert Humphrey \n     after his return to the Senate. But all stayed for just one \n     Congress before moving on. Clark stuck, challenging Cold War \n     policies that he believed hurt the larger struggle against \n     apartheid that Mandela symbolized.\n       ``He was the icebreaker here,'' says his friend Rep. George \n     Miller (D-Cal.). ``He was out breaking ice on Africa issues \n     for the country and certainly for the Senate.'' What's more, \n     after losing his Senate seat, Clark didn't stop. Instead, he \n     found a new classroom via the Aspen Institute, where the \n     former professor began what amounted to his own graduate \n     program in 1983 to educate members of Congress about \n     different policy issues.\n       Russia had been Clark's early academic interest and was as \n     well in his first years at Aspen. But Africa tugged and he \n     set out ``to try to get a get a cadre of Congress who would \n     know about South Africa and what was going on in South \n     Africa.''\n       These typically were nearly weeklong seminars--held at \n     choice locales overseas to lure members of Congress but also \n     to provide neutral ground for the warring parties inside \n     South Africa.\n       Bermuda, for example, served as a meeting place in 1989. \n     The island allowed officials from the South African \n     government to shuttle in and out before the arrival of \n     outlawed representatives for Mandela's African National \n     Congress, which was operating then from outside South Africa.\n       ``All of them were there, making their pitches,'' Clark \n     said. And once Mandela was released from prison in 1990, the \n     venue shifted to South Africa itself. ``We got Mandela, who \n     had just gotten out of jail not long before, to come,'' Clark \n     recalls of an April 1991 session in Cape Town--a seminar that \n     also included F. W. de Klerk, South Africa's white president.\n       Most striking here was Clark's impact on Republicans--the \n     party that helped to throw him out of the Senate.\n       ``He is a wonder,'' says former Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.). \n     ``I had been told he was a lefty, the stereotype, but he just \n     drew out people. He never showed bitterness toward the right \n     or promoting one side.''\n       Just as ``Mandela made a difference, Dick Clark made a \n     difference in awareness'' at home in Congress, Simpson adds.\n       Former Rep. John Porter (R-Ill.) remembers an Aspen meeting \n     in Cape Town at which Clark surprised the participants on the \n     last day by sending them out to walk through the \n     neighborhoods of a black township to meet with families. \n     ``Dick Clark would do things like that,'' Porter said.\n       ``This was before all the big changes in South Africa when \n     we were debating sanctions,'' said former Sen. John Danforth \n     (R-Mo.). ``He was just so dedicated to it and knew all the \n     players.'' In fact, Clark says he knew very little about \n     Africa before coming to the Senate after the 1972 elections. \n     But when a seat opened up on Foreign Relations in 1975, he \n     grabbed it and fell into the Africa post--just ahead of his \n     classmate Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.), the future vice \n     president. Timing is everything in Congress and it was \n     Clark's good fortune in this case. The legendary but very \n     controlling Foreign Relations Committee Chairman J. William \n     Fulbright (D-Ark.) had just left the Senate at the end of \n     1974 and this allowed subcommittee chairs like Clark to act \n     more on their own.\n       ``Fulbright's attitude was the subcommittees couldn't do \n     anything. Everything ought to be done by the full \n     committee,'' Clark said. ``I was next to last on seniority. \n     When it got down to me, the only thing left was Africa about \n     which I knew very little. Some would say none. So I just \n     figured: Here's a chance to learn something and I spent a lot \n     of time doing hearings and learning about Africa.''\n       He also traveled--venturing into southern, sub-Saharan \n     Africa which was then unfamiliar to many on the Senate \n     committee.\n       ``Humphrey told me that he got as far south as Ethiopia,'' \n     Clark said. ``It was new territory and interesting and of \n     course we were putting a lot of covert money in Africa, as \n     were the Russians.'' In the summer of 1975, Clark and two \n     aides left Washington for what was to be a trip to just \n     Tanzania, Zambia and Zaire. But that itinerary quickly \n     expanded to include the two former Portuguese colonies, \n     Mozambique and Angola.\n       The Angola detour was pivotal and included face-to-face \n     meetings with Central Intelligence Agency personnel on the \n     ground as\n\n[[Page S130]]\n\n     well as the leaders of the three rival factions in Angola's \n     post-colonial civil war. The Soviet Union and Cuba were then \n     actively backing the new leftist government under Agostinho \n     Neto. The CIA and South Africa had begun a covert partnership \n     assisting rebel factions: chiefly Jonas Savimbi in the south, \n     but also Holden Roberto, whose base was more in the north and \n     Zaire.\n       Soon after Clark returned, the debate broke into the open \n     after news reports detailing the U.S. and South African \n     operations. Congress cut off new funding in a December 1975 \n     appropriations fight. It then quickly enacted a more \n     permanent ban--the so-called Clark amendment--prohibiting \n     future covert assistance for paramilitary operations in \n     Angola.\n       Signed into law in February 1976, the Clark amendment was \n     repealed under President Ronald Reagan in 1985. Conservatives \n     long argued that it was always an overreach by Congress, \n     reacting to Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon's handling of \n     the Vietnam War.\n       ``The danger now is the pendulum will swing too far the \n     other way,'' Secretary of State Henry Kissinger warned \n     Clark's panel in a January 1976 hearing. But for all the \n     echoes of Vietnam, Clark says he saw his amendment more as a \n     way to separate the U.S. from South Africa's apartheid \n     regime.\n       ``The reason the amendment passed so easily in both houses \n     was because of Vietnam, so I certainly related the two,'' \n     Clark said. ``But my interest was really in Africa and South \n     Africa. We were aligning ourselves with apartheid forces. The \n     reason for my amendment was to disassociate us from apartheid \n     and from South Africa.''\n       ``Kissinger had really no feeling for human rights that I \n     could ever discern and certainly not in South Africa,'' Clark \n     said. ``His association with South Africa was obviously very \n     close.'' A year later, visiting South Africa, Clark got a \n     taste of how closely the white government under Vorster had \n     been watching him.\n       That trip included an important meeting in Port Elizabeth \n     with the young black leader, Steve Biko, who had just been \n     released from jail and would die 10 months later after a \n     brutal interrogation in the summer of 1977. Clark said he \n     became a courier of sorts, taking back a Biko memorandum to \n     Jimmy Carter's incoming administration. But while in South \n     Africa, Vorster himself wanted to see Clark and spent much of \n     an hour quizzing the senator on his past public comments--\n     even down to small college appearances in the U.S. ``He spent \n     an hour with me,'' Clark said. ``They obviously had followed \n     me to each of these, much to my surprise.''\n       ``He would quote me. And then he would say, Did you say \n     that on such and such a date and such and such a place?' ``We \n     went through this for an hour. He just wanted the opportunity \n     to tell me how wrong I was about everything I was saying.''\n       ``He was the last great Afrikaner president,'' Clark said. \n     ``In fact, he ultimately resigned over the embarrassment of \n     the Muldergate thing years later.'' The Muldergate thing--as \n     Clark calls it--was a major scandal inside South Africa in \n     the late 1970s when it was revealed that government funds had \n     been used by the ruling National Party to mount a far-\n     reaching propaganda campaign in defense of apartheid.\n       This went well beyond placing favorable articles or opinion \n     pieces in the press. Tens of millions of dollars were \n     invested to try to undermine independent South African \n     papers. There was even a failed attempt in the U.S. to buy \n     the Washington Star in hopes of influencing American policy. \n     Muldergate got its name from Connie Mulder, South Africa's \n     information minister at the time. But just as Watergate had \n     its John Dean, Rhoodie--a top deputy to Mulder--proved the \n     top witness: a suave propagandist who later gave detailed \n     interviews and wrote his own book on the subject filling 900-\n     plus pages.\n       Rhoodie, who was prosecuted for fraud but cleared by an \n     appeals court in South Africa, ultimately relocated to the \n     U.S., where he died in Atlanta in 1993. But by his account, \n     the Vorster government had used its contacts with a Madison \n     Avenue public relations firm, Sydney S. Baron & Co. Inc., to \n     undermine Clark's reelection.\n       Rhoodie describes a meeting early in 1978 in South Africa \n     attended by Mulder, Vorster and Baron at which Clark's \n     election was specifically discussed, and the $250,000 was \n     later moved into one of Baron's accounts ``to make sure that \n     Clark was defeated.'' As South Africa's information \n     secretary, Rhoodie was in fact the signatory of contracts \n     with Baron, according to filings with the Justice Department. \n     These show the New York firm initially received about \n     $365,000 annually under a contract signed in April 1976. This \n     was increased to $650,000 a year later. In August 1977, the \n     same arrangement was extended through January 1979, including \n     a $250,000 payment in April 1978.\n       Whether this $250,000 is a coincidence or what Rhoodie was \n     speaking on is not clear. At this stage, most of the major \n     players are dead and New York state corporate records show \n     Baron's firm was dissolved in 1993--the year that Rhoodie \n     died.\n       Watching it all is Clark's friend, old boss in the House \n     and later Senate colleague, John Culver. The two met in 1964, \n     when Clark signed on to help Culver win his first House \n     election and then worked with Culver in Washington until \n     1972, when Clark went back to Iowa to run for the Senate. A \n     Harvard-educated Marine Corps veteran, Culver said he had his \n     own fascination with Africa as a young man in the 1960s. But \n     he remembered that era as a time of greater optimism, as new \n     countries across the continent were emerging from colonial \n     rule.\n       ``Dick came to it when there was less political reward,'' \n     Culver said. ``But he stuck to it.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/08/senate-section/article/S130-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S130-S131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO KATHLEEN McGHEE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Saxby \nChambliss to honor and thank one of the Senate's longest-serving and \nmost widely-respected professional staff members--Kathleen McGhee. \nKathleen is retiring this week after 33 years of continual service to \nthe Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  As all Senators know, much of the work of the Senate is done quietly \nand behind the scenes, by staff whose names are not in the papers and \nwho are not in public service for the recognition. This is especially \ntrue for the work of the Intelligence Committee, which operates behind \nclosed doors and--when things are working right--without public \nattention. For 33 years, Kathleen McGhee was the person who made sure \nthat the committee operated professionally by ensuring that our \nhearings ran smoothly, reports were written, letters sent and received, \ntranscripts maintained, and budgets were met, all in a timely fashion.\n  The only thing she has not been able to overcome is the mice.\n  Kathleen came to the committee shortly after graduating from the \nUniversity of Maryland, joining the committee staff on April 7, 1980, \nin order to assist the committee's arms control expert. She \nsubsequently provided administrative support to the committee's budget \ndirector, minority counsel, and minority staff director. In 1987, \nChairman David L. Boren appointed Kathleen as the chief clerk of the \nIntelligence Committee, a position she has held ever since.\n  In her time here, she has been present when some of our Nation's most \nimportant national security issues were considered and debated--from \nespionage during the Cold War to the response to the terrorist attacks \nof September 11, 2001, and many more. In the thousands of hearings, \nbriefings, and markups she has run, Kathleen has truly seen and heard \nit all.\n  Kathleen has served as clerk, and mostly as chief clerk, for 11 \ncommittee chairmen: Birch Bayh, Barry Goldwater, Dave Durenberger, \nDavid Boren, Dennis DeConcini, Arlen Specter, Richard Shelby, Bob \nGraham, Pat Roberts, Jay Rockefeller, and for me. Owing to the nature \nof the committee and its rules, and to her even-handed, nonpartisan \napproach, she has also served many Vice Chairmen equally well during \nher tenure: Patrick Moynihan, Pat Leahy, Bill Cohen, Frank Murkowski, \nJohn Warner, Bob Kerrey, Richard Bryan, Kit Bond, and now Saxby \nChambliss, to name a few. Few people in the U.S. Congress can say that \nthey have worked for so many Senators--85 Senators in all--and as \nprofessionally.\n  As importantly, in her time here, and especially as the committee's \nchief clerk for more than two decades, Kathleen has worked with more \nthan 300 staffers who have uniformly appreciated and respected her \nprofessionalism and collegiality. Kathleen has managed the \nadministrative staff and functions of the committee, and coordinated \nwith other Senate offices on matters ranging from the rules to the \narchitecture. She has walked dozens of staff directors through the \npreparation and execution of the committee's budget and has been hailed \nrepeatedly as the committee's ``institutional memory.''\n  As the chief clerk, Kathleen has been responsible for showing new \nstaffers the ropes and making sure they were able to transition \nsmoothly into their new roles on the committee staff. Especially for \npeople used to the bureaucratic difficulties in the executive branch, \nher ability to pave the way has been nearly miraculous.\n  Sadly, but understandably, it is now the time for her own \ntransition--although true to her form, Kathleen agreed to continue her \nservice longer than anticipated in order to make sure that the hand-off \nto her successor would go smoothly.\n  Now, we are pleased to take the opportunity on behalf of the Senate \nto thank Kathleen McGhee for her tremendous service to the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, the Senate, and\n\n[[Page S131]]\n\nthe Nation. We wish her all the very best as she enjoys a well-earned \nretirement to her home in Falls Church, VA, and on her beloved shores \nof Bethany Beach, DE, with her husband Mike and children, Luke and \nMolly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/08/senate-section/article/S131-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING WEBER STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, this week marks the 125th anniversary of the \nfirst week of classes at Weber State University, and I would like to \ntake a moment to officially recognize this valued Utah institution.\n  In the mid-1800s, pioneers from the Mormon Church, also know as the \nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, settled an area 35 miles \nnorth of Salt Lake City, known as the Weber Valley. The surrounding \narea, including the Weber River, was earlier named in honor of John \nHenry Weber, a noted frontier trapper with the Rocky Mountain Fur \nCompany.\n  As our country continued westward expansion, it became necessary to \ncreate territorial governments. During this expansive period, Congress \npassed the Compromise of 1850, part of which created the Utah \nTerritory. The territorial government oversaw general administrative \nmatters, including the establishment of schools, during the latter half \nof the 19th century. The region experienced an increase in population, \nas Mormons and non-Mormons alike came to further settle the West. With \nthe driving of the golden spike at nearby promontory summit in 1869, \nthe completion of the Transcontinental Railroad brought tremendous \neconomic growth to the Weber Valley.\n  As the Mormon settlers grew in numbers and cultivated the land, they \nalso created institutions of learning for themselves and their \nchildren. In 1888, members of the Mormon Church were encouraged by \ntheir leaders to institute local boards of education to oversee the \ncreation of schools that could teach the principles of religion in \nconjunction with the standard curriculum of the day.\n  In 1889, the regional group of Mormon congregations, known as the \nWeber Stake of Zion, started the Weber Stake Academy for the education \nof local students who had passed the sixth grade. The school was ``open \nto students of either sex, and of any religious denomination or \nnationality.'' The mission of the academy was ``to provide an education \nwhich includes moral culture, as well as mental and physical \ntraining.'' Courses were offered in theology, business, pedagogy and \npsychology, languages, English and literature, natural and physical \nscience, mathematics, history, and political science.\n  The school grew in notoriety and enrollment over the following 20 \nyears. In 1918, it was renamed ``Weber Normal College'' and \nsubsequently ``Weber College,'' as the institution eventually dropped \nall preparatory and high school education to focus on college-level \neducation. During the first few decades of the 20th century, the famed \npurple and white were chosen as school colors, and the wildcat was \napparently adopted as the school mascot after a reporter dubbed the \nfootball players ``scrappy as a bunch of wildcats.''\n  As the 1920s closed, the Great Depression began to take shape and \nWeber College, like all other institutions at the time, did not foresee \nthe financial calamity that would befall her. After a few years of \nstruggle, the Weber College Board, in conjunction with the church's \nBoard of Education, transferred the school to the State of Utah in \n1933. The subsequent years were very difficult for faculty and \nstudents, but the junior college persevered and continued to mold good \ncitizens.\n  The school carried along and grew in size as the Depression subsided. \nWith the attack on Pearl Harbor and the entry of the United States into \nWorld War II, Weber College's faculty and students did all that they \ncould to support the war efforts. Many students joined the armed \nforces, and the school helped in training naval cadets and radio \noperators for the military.\n  Because of the war, mostly women attended the school, and they ``had \nto hold things down until the fellows returned to campus,'' as one \nalumna recalled. In 1945, the school even held a dance called the \n``Polygamist Prance,'' which was girl's choice. To make sure that all \nthe girls could attend, the boys were to accept all requests for a \ndate. Many boys showed up at the dance with 5 or 10 dates, and even \nthough such a ration was unfair to the girls, the students had a great \ntime.\n  Although it was a tremendously difficult time for the entire country, \nWeber College students, showing the spirit of America's greatest \ngeneration, exhibited principled leadership and courage through the \nstorm of World War II. In all, 82 faculty and alumni did not return \nfrom Europe or the Pacific, and all were profoundly affected by the \ngreat and terrible conflict.\n  As the war came to a close, Weber prepared for the return of many \nsoldiers who were anxious to go to college. Enrollment exploded from \n465 students in 1945 to over 2,000 students in 1959, and 3,000 students \nin 1962. During this time of expansion, the Utah Legislature directed \nthe State board of education to find a new place for the burgeoning \nschool. The college was subsequently moved from downtown Ogden to \nHarrison Boulevard, where it currently resides today.\n  In 1959, the men's basketball team, an ever-formidable force, won the \nJunior College National Championship. In that same year, the Utah \nLegislature passed a bill allowing Weber College to become a 4-year \nsenior college, and the first courses contributing to 4-year degrees \nwere offered in 1962. The next year, Weber College became Weber State \nCollege, and the campus was greatly expanded during this time.\n  Weber continued to grow and progress as Weber State College over the \nsubsequent 30 years, and in 1991 Weber State College was made Weber \nState University. The university now has more than 26,000 full- and \npart-time students and offers more than 250 undergraduate degrees and \n11 graduate degrees. The athletic programs continue to be ranked among \nthe best in their divisions, and the arts at Weber State continue to \nenrich the lives of many Utahns.\n  President Charles A. Wright now continues the tradition of excellence \nin leadership, which has been passed down for 125 years. Weber State \nboasts many notable alumni, and the institution continues to fulfill \nits mission to serve ``as an educational, cultural, and economic leader \nfor the region.''\n  Although I normally bleed blue, I have set aside this week to bleed \npurple with my Wildcat friends and colleagues. I congratulate the \ncountless students and faculty members who have worked hard to make \nWeber State University what it is today. May the next 125 years be as \ntremendous as the last, and may the ensign of truth and right continue \nto proudly wave o're ole Weber.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/08/senate-section/article/S131-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S131-S132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Sergeant Daniel Vasselian\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and \nservice of U.S. Marine Sgt. Daniel Vasselian, who was killed in the \nline of duty on December 23, 2013 while conducting combat operations in \nHelmand province, Afghanistan. Sergeant Vasselian was assigned to 1st \nBattalion, 9th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine \nExpeditionary Force, Camp Lejune, N.C., and was serving his third tour \nof duty when he was killed at the young age of 27.\n  ``Danny'', as he was known by family and friends, was a proud son of \nthe small Massachusetts town of Abington, where he was known as a kind, \ncourageous and fun-loving young man. Danny graduated from Abington High \nSchool in 2004, and was fortunate to have already met the love of his \nlife, Erin, whom he went on to marry. Erin and Danny celebrated their \nfourth wedding anniversary in December. A tribute to his standing in \nAbington, thousands of people lined the town's streets to escort \nSergeant Vasselian's casket to the funeral service.\n  In 2006, Sergeant Vasselian enlisted with the Marines and was \nassigned to \n2/3 Echo Company Infantry, eventually deploying to tours in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The heroism and professionalism of Sergeant Vasselian and \nhis Marine Corps units merited numerous awards, including a Purple \nHeart Award, a Combat Action Ribbon, a Presidential Unit Citation and a \nNavy Unit Commendation. Sergeant Vasselian's love for his Marine \nbrothers was infallible, and ultimately led him to volunteer for the \nmission that cost him his life.\n  Sergeant Vasselian's outsized personality and good heartedness will \nnot\n\n[[Page S132]]\n\nsoon be forgotten by those who were lucky enough to have known him. It \nis my hope that during this extremely difficult time, his family and \nfriends will find comfort in knowing that Americans everywhere \nappreciate deeply his vow to defend our country so that the rest of us \nmay continue to live in peace and freedom.\n  Along with his parents Mark and Karen, as well as his step-mother \nAlice, Danny is survived by his wife Erin (Doyle) Vasselian; his \nsiblings Jeannine, Julianne and Joseph; his grandmother Jeanne \nVasselian; his grandfather Thomas P.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of the dedication of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Elementary \nSchool in Butte, MT. The school is marking 50 years since it became the \nfirst in the country to change its name in honor of President Kennedy. \nI would like to commend the faculty, staff, and students of the school \nand the entire Butte community on this important occasion. In January \n1964, Senator Mike Mansfield spoke at the dedication ceremony for the \nschool. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Mansfield's speech be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nDedication of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Elementary School, Butte, Montana\n\n\n             Address by Senator Mike Mansfield (D-Montana)\n\n                    Butte, Montana, January 4, 1964\n\n  It was in this neighborhood that Maureen Mansfield, my wife, lived as \na child. These streets echoed her footsteps. These by-ways knew her \nchildhood laughter and tears. These dwellings housed her friends and \nneighbors.\n  Many who knew her in those days not so long ago have gone and many \nwho do not know her have come. But the attachment remains. And for that \nreason I am grateful to be here today among old friends and new.\n  And I am grateful, too, for another reason. After the immense sorrow \nof the past few weeks, I am grateful for the occasion which has \nsummoned us all here. For we have come together to give a name to a \nschool. The name we give is that of a fine human being, a man of \nwarmth, of depth, and of deep dedication to his country.\n  John Fitzgerald Kennedy was an extraordinary man in an ordinary way. \nHe loved his family. He loved the United States of America. And he \nfused these two great loves of his life, in the fires of a profound \nhuman understanding and an exceptional intellect, into a great \nleadership.\n  It was a leadership which sought to awaken us to our responsibilities \nto one another in this nation. It was a leadership which called to us \nto correct through our individual lives and our common institutions and \nthe inequities and inadequacies which weigh heavily on millions of \nAmericans. It was a leadership for the things which enlighten for \nconfidence, for tolerance, for mutual restraint and respect among all \nAmericans. It was a leadership against the things which divide--against \narrogance and the purveyance of fear, bigotry, hatred and the idolatry \nof ignorance.\n  This nation is a better nation because John Fitzgerald Kennedy lived \namong us and was our president and died in our service. He gave to us \nin life. He gives to us, too, in death. For the loss which we have \nsuffered has awakened in all who were touched deeply by it, an \nawareness of all that is finest in ourselves and in this nation. Out of \nthat awakening may we find the quiet strength to seek a new decency at \nhome and to pursue in the years ahead, a reasoned peace in the world. \nThese were the two fundamental objectives of President John Fitzgerald \nKennedy and with God's help they shall be achieved in the fullness of \ntheir time.\n  Today, we give this school his name. There is no more fitting way in \nwhich to express a respect and appreciation for him. He knew that \neducation was a master key to human decency and to international peace. \nAnd the contributions which, under his leadership, this Congress has \nmade to its advancement represent one of the most significant advances \nin many decades.\n  A school is bricks and mortar. It is wise and understanding teachers. \nIt is young people, eager and trusting. It is all these things brought \ntogether and held together by the belief that truth is the end and that \nby reason and faith we shall know it. That belief, John Fitzgerald \nKennedy held in every fiber of his being. May his name help to solidify \nin this school that belief.

A bill to prevent and mitigate identity theft, to ensure \nprivacy, to provide notice of security breaches, and to enhance \ncriminal penalties, law enforcement assistance, and other protections \nagainst security breaches, fraudulent access, and misuse of personally \nidentifiable information; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing the Personal Data \nPrivacy and Security Act. The recent data breach at Target involving \nthe debit and credit card data of as many as 40 million customers \nduring the Christmas holidays is a reminder that developing a \ncomprehensive national strategy to protect data privacy and \ncybersecurity remains one of the most challenging and important issues \nfacing our Nation. The Personal Data Privacy and Security Act will help \nto meet this challenge, by better protecting Americans from the growing \nthreats of data breaches and identity theft. I thank Senators Franken, \nSchumer and Blumenthal for cosponsoring this important privacy \nlegislation.\n  When I first introduced this bill 9 years ago, I had high hopes of \nbringing urgently needed data privacy reforms to the American people. \nAlthough the Judiciary Committee favorably reported this bill numerous \ntimes this legislation has languished on the Senate calendar.\n  In the meantime, the dangers to Americans' privacy, economic \nprosperity and national security posed by data breaches have not gone \naway. According to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, more than 662 \nmillion records have been involved in data security breaches since \n2005. According to Verizon's 2013 Data Breach Investigations Report, \nthere were more than 600 publicly disclosed data breaches last year. \nThese data security breaches have become all too common and these \ncyberthreats have placed Americans' privacy rights at great risk.\n  In 2011, the Obama administration released several proposals to \nenhance cybersecurity, including a data breach proposal that adopted \nthe carefully balanced framework of our legislation. I am happy that \nmany of the sound privacy principles in this bill have been embraced by \nthe administration.\n  The Personal Data Privacy and Security Act requires companies that \nhave databases with sensitive personal information on Americans \nestablish and implement data privacy and security programs. The bill \nwould also establish a single nationwide standard for data breach \nnotification and require notice to consumers when their sensitive \npersonal information has been compromised.\n  This bill also provides for tough criminal penalties for anyone who \nwould intentionally and willfully conceal the fact that a data breach \nhas occurred when the breach causes economic damage to consumers. The \nbill also includes the Obama administration's proposal to update the \nComputer Fraud and Abuse Act, so that attempted computer hacking and \nconspiracy to commit computer hacking offenses are subject to the same \ncriminal penalties, as the underlying offenses.\n  I have drafted this bill after long and thoughtful consultation with \nmany of the stakeholders on this issue, including the privacy, consumer \nprotection and business communities. I have also consulted with the \nDepartments of Justice and Homeland Security, and with the Federal \nTrade Commission.\n  This is a comprehensive bill that not only addresses the need to \nprovide Americans with notice when they have been victims of a data \nbreach, but that also deals with the underlying problem of lax security \nand lack of accountability to help prevent data breaches from occurring \nin the first place. Enacting this comprehensive data privacy \nlegislation remains one of my legislative priorities as Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Protecting privacy rights is of critical importance to all of us, \nregardless of party or ideology. I hope that all Senators will support \nthis measure to better protect Americans' privacy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1897\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING POLICY \n                   RECOMMENDATIONS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that State and local \n     governments should review and adopt the following policy \n     recommendations:\n       (1) Pension reform.--State and local governments should--\n       (A) implement reforms to address any fiscal shortfall in \n     public pension funding, including utilizing accrual \n     accounting methods, such as those reforms undertaken by the \n     private sector pension funds; and\n       (B) restructure and renegotiate any public pension fund \n     that is deemed to be insolvent or underfunded, including \n     adopting defined contribution retirement systems.\n       (2) Taxes.--State and local governments should reduce \n     jurisdictional tax rates below the national average in order \n     to help facilitate capital investment and economic growth, \n     particularly in combination with the provisions of this \n     division.\n       (3) Education.--State and local governments should adopt \n     school choice options to provide children and parents more \n     educational choices, particularly in impoverished areas.\n       (4) Communities.--State and local governments should adopt \n     right-to-work laws to allow more competitiveness and more \n     flexibility for businesses to expand.\n       (5) Regulations.--State and local governments should \n     streamline the regulatory burden on families and businesses, \n     including streamlining the opportunities for occupational \n     licensing.\n       (6) Abandoned structures.--State and local governments \n     should consider the following options to reduce or fix areas \n     with abandoned properties or residences:\n       (A) In the case of foreclosures, tax notifications should \n     be sent to both the lien holder (if different than the \n     homeowner) and the homeowner.\n       (B) Where State constitutions permit, property tax \n     abatement or credits should be provided for individuals who \n     purchase or invest in abandoned or dilapidated properties.\n       (C) Non-profit or charity demolition entities should be \n     permitted or encouraged to help remove abandoned properties.\n       (D) Government or municipality fees and penalties should be \n     limited, and be proportional to the outstanding tax amount \n     and the ability to pay.\n       (E) The sale of tax liens to third parties should be \n     reviewed, and where available, should prohibit the selling of \n     tax liens below a certain threshold (for example the \n     prohibition of the sale of tax liens to third parties under \n     $1,000).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2615.

ANALYSIS OF EMPLOYMENT EFFECTS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR \n                   ACT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Environmental Protection Agency has systematically \n     distorted the true impact of the regulations of the Agency on \n     job creation by using incomplete analyses to assess effects \n     on employment and failing to take into account the cascading \n     effects of a regulatory change across interconnected \n     industries and markets nationwide;\n       (2) although in many instances, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency has stated that the impact of certain \n     regulations will result in net job creation, implementation \n     of the regulations will actually require billions of dollars \n     in compliance costs, resulting in reduced business profits \n     and millions of actual job losses;\n       (3)(A) the analysis of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     of the final rule of the Agency entitled ``National Emission \n     Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Coal- and Oil-\n     Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units and Standards \n     of Performance for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Electric Utility, \n     Industrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small Industrial-\n     Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units'' (77 Fed. \n     Reg. 9304 (Feb. 16, 2012)) estimated that implementation of \n     the final rule would result in the creation of 46,000 \n     temporary construction jobs and 8,000 net new permanent jobs; \n     but\n       (B) a private study conducted by NERA Economic Consulting, \n     using a ``whole economy'' model, estimated that \n     implementation of the final rule described in subparagraph \n     (A) would result in a negative impact on the income of \n     workers in an amount equivalent to 180,000 to 215,000 lost \n     jobs in 2015 and 50,000 to 85,000 lost jobs each year \n     thereafter;\n       (4)(A) the analysis of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     of the final rule of the Agency entitled ``Federal \n     Implementation Plans: Interstate Transport of Fine \n     Particulate Matter and Ozone and Correction of SIP \n     Approvals'' (76 Fed. Reg. 48208 (Aug. 8, 2011)) estimated \n     that implementation of the final rule would result in the \n     creation of 700 jobs per year; but\n       (B) a private study conducted by NERA Economic Consulting \n     estimated that implementation of the final rule described in \n     subparagraph (A) would result in the elimination of a total \n     of 34,000 jobs during the period beginning in calendar year \n     2013 and ending in calendar year 2037;\n       (5)(A) the analysis of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     of the final rules of the Agency entitled ``National Emission \n     Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Major Sources: \n     Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional Boilers and Process \n     Heaters'' (76 Fed.

Mr. President, there will be no rollcall votes tonight.\n  I think as most people know, though it bears reiterating, I oppose \npaying for a short-term extension of unemployment insurance benefits. \nThe current level of long-term unemployment is an economic emergency, \nwithout any question, and this would be very unfair to the people who \nare desperately in need of help, to say we are happy to give you this \nmoney, but we are going to take something else out of the economy to do \nthat. We are not going to do that. I think that would be wrong.\n  Having said that, there are a number of Senators who are having \nproductive conversations about possible offsets, one of whom is on the \nfloor today, my friend, the Senator from Ohio. He is someone who \nunderstands finances, as he was head of the Office of Management and \nBudget. So whenever we have him working on the numbers, we are always \ndealing with someone who knows what they are talking about. I don't \nalways agree with his conclusions, but certainly he is a person whom we \nall look to for guidance in this area.\n  As I said here a few hours ago, the Republicans feel this should be \npaid for. Let's find out how they feel it should be paid for. Again, we \non this side don't want to pay for a short-term extension. If it is \ngoing to be paid for, we should figure out in years how to pay for it. \nThat would be much better than this nickel-and-diming. We have tried to \ndo it for 3 months, paid for, but I would almost bet it will not get \ndone. So we should, if we are going to have pay-fors, try to figure out \nhow to do it for 1 year.\n  We should let the conversations go on overnight. I have spoken to a \nnumber of Republican Senators; and, of course, I want to assert every \nbit of influence, help, pressure, whatever you want to say, to try to \nget this done for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that \namong a number of cosponsors of this is the junior Senator from Nevada. \nThis is an example of bipartisanship and how it should work. We have \none of the most liberal Members of the Senate and one of the most \nconservative Members of the Senate who have introduced this \nlegislation, and that is what we are working on now.\n  So I repeat, I hope the conversations continue overnight and we will \nsee where we are in the morning.\n  I do have a few other things here, and I will be as fast as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/08/senate-section/article/S185-4", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TO REDESIGNATE THE DRYDEN FLIGHT RESEARCH CENTER AS THE NEIL A. \n  ARMSTRONG FLIGHT RESEARCH CENTER AND THE WESTERN AERONAUTICAL TEST \n          RANGE AS THE HUGH L.

Mr. President, I applaud the majority leader for his \nwork on the Neil Armstrong Flight Research Center. This is something \nDianne Feinstein has been very involved with and Jay Rockefeller \nsupported, and it is an appropriate way to pay tribute to Neil \nArmstrong, who was a constituent of mine and a dear friend. I spoke to \nhis family about this. They believe it is an appropriate way to pay \ntribute to him as well.\n  He was a true hero, not just because of what he did as the first man \nto walk on the moon, but also the way he led his life subsequently. He \nwas a humble hero to me and to so many others. I am delighted that \nthrough the action we just heard on the floor here a moment ago with \nthe majority leader, we have now passed legislation which will go to \nthe President for his signature. The Dryden Flight Research Center in \nCalifornia will now be renamed the Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research \nCenter at the Dryden Aeronautical Test Range. So that is good news \ntonight. The Senate got something done.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  I also wish to comment on what the Presiding Officer said earlier \nwith regard to the retirement provisions in the budget as it relates to \nour veterans. The military retirement issue is one I had great concerns \nabout, and when I voted for the budget, it was my understanding that \nwould be resolved. The Senator from Connecticut has a proposal he is \nsupporting tonight from our colleague from New Hampshire. I am \nsupporting a proposal as well from another colleague from New \nHampshire, and how we pay for this is the subject of some debate, but \nwe need to resolve this.\n  I think it is unfair for a couple of reasons; one is it singles out \nour military at a time when there are so many other ways in which we \nneed to address our overspending in this country. I think it is not \njust for us to simply single out military retirees. I believe that is \nnot consistent with the promises we made to them, and I believe it is \nin effect changing the rules midstream.\n  Second, there is a commission looking at this. The commission is \nlooking at, in a comprehensive way, retirement, benefits, health care. \nThat commission is both comprehensive and transparent and expected to \nreport later this year.\n  So in my view, this certainly was not appropriate to be in the \nbudget. It is about $6 billion. We certainly should be able to find a \npay-for in a budget of over $3 trillion. Again, I commend those who are \nworking on this.\n  I have cosponsored a particular approach which Senator Ayotte of New \nHampshire is proposing that is an antifraud provision for the child tax \ncredit. I know there is some difference on that, but I think all of us \nwant to be sure the child tax credit is being properly administered, \nand those who do not qualify for it or are ineligible for it should not \naccess it.\n  At a time of record debt and deficits, we have to be sure there is \nnot fraud, abuse, and waste in our government, and that is one example. \nSo I hope we can find a way to come together on that and deal with that \nissue.\n\n\n                         Unemployment Insurance\n\n  Finally, the majority leader talked a little about the legislation \ncurrently before this body to extend unemployment insurance. I wish to \ntalk for a moment about where we are on that bill and say I was \nencouraged by the words of the majority leader. It sounds as if he is \ninterested in looking at various ways we could pay for it. He indicated \nhe is not in support of paying for it but would be willing to listen to \nsome of our ideas. Let me say a couple things about it.\n  One, this is the emergency unemployment insurance on top of the \nroughly 26 weeks currently provided by States such as my State of Ohio. \nSo it is additional emergency unemployment insurance on top of that.\n  The unemployment insurance ended at year-end, and the question is: Do \nwe extend it? How do we extend it? How do we deal with the fact it adds \nto the deficit?\n  I voted, along with a handful of other Republicans, to proceed to \nthis because I believe we ought to have a debate about, one, whether it \nshould be paid for or not. I think it should be, and I won't be able to \nsupport it unless it is paid for; two, over the 3-month period--which \nthe extension is, just a 3-month period--how can we improve the \nunemployment insurance program so it really works to get people \nemployed?\n  As we know, the problem now is we have the highest number of people \nwho are long-term unemployed we have ever had in this country. It is a \nhistoric rate, and it is a very troubling, sad situation, where people \nare over 27 weeks at historic levels. So we are not doing what we \nshould be doing to connect those people who are unemployed to the \njobs out there, clearly, by definition with so many people long-term \nunemployed. Let's improve this system. Let's provide people with the \njob skills and the tools they need to access the jobs available.\n\n  In my own State of Ohio, we are told we have about 100,000 jobs, many \nin advanced manufacturing, bioscience, and information technology, \nsectors of our economy where there is requirement for skills those who \nare unemployed do not have. Long-term unemployment insurance isn't \nproviding them with the training and skills opportunities.\n  I think we ought to be able as a body to come up with reforms, \nworking with the administration. The President has indicated his \ninterest in doing that. That is the reason for the 3-month extension. \nBut I certainly think we should pay for the 3-month extension.\n  The argument was made tonight that it is an emergency. The same \nDemocrats who are saying that are saying the economy is improving. In \nany case, it violates the budget which was passed. We passed a budget \njust a few weeks ago. It was quite contentious here on the floor. The \nbudget provided, for the first time in 4 years, a budget for the House \nand for the Senate to work against so we can start the appropriations \nprocess again. I supported that. It had no tax increases. It actually \nhad net deficit reduction in it--barely but some. It didn't do \neverything, but it set those budget levels so we now have caps we can \nwork against so we can begin the appropriations process, which involves \noversight, which has not been done appropriately for 4 years now. It \nalso involves prioritizing spending which has not been done.\n  Frankly, the agencies and departments of the Federal Government have \nbeen kind of on their own with these so-called continuing resolutions \nbecause there hasn't been the constitutional requirement that Congress \nappropriate. That is our constitutional duty, the power of the purse, \nwhich simply hasn't happened.\n  I think the budget is important. But by setting those caps, we made a \nstatement to the American people: We are going to stick to these budget \ncaps,\n\n[[Page S187]]\n\nboth on the discretionary side--which is the smaller part of the budget \nwe appropriate every year--and also on the mandatory side. Those caps \nare violated by unemployment insurance being extended without paying \nfor it subject to a point of order on the floor of the House and the \nSenate. Frankly, I think if that point of order were raised--which I \nhope it would be, because we don't want to break these caps--I think it \nwould be very tough to get the 60 votes.\n  I understand the majority leader disagrees with me, and I respect his \nopinion. But I do think that, because it violates the budget and \nbecause we have historic levels of debt and we have a deficit this year \nwhich is forecast to be over $600 billion, we ought to deal with this \nin a fiscally responsible way and find the money to pay for the \nextension. It is about $6 billion, about the same as dealing with the \nmilitary retirement issue.\n  Again, certainly we can find $6 billion in a budget of well over $3 \ntrillion. In fact, a number of us have come up with specific proposals, \nand I have introduced a couple of amendments on this today.\n  I spoke about one of these amendments earlier today, but I would like \nto go into a little more detail because there were some comments made \non the floor earlier that Republicans are only offering two \nalternatives. One is a one-year delay in ObamaCare--which I support but \nis opposed by the other side--and the second is the proposal on the \nchild tax credit, which I talked about earlier and which focuses on \ncurrent mispayments of the child tax credit. Again, I think that is a \ngood pay-for. I support that. I am actually on the amendment which \nprovides for that, but it also has enough funds in it to deal with the \nmilitary retirement issue we talked about. So it could extend the \nunemployment insurance program for 3 months, plus deal with the \nmilitary retirement program and have a little left over for deficit \nreduction.\n  But I want to make it clear to those on the other side of the aisle \nwho said that is all Republicans have that we do have alternatives. I \nspecifically filed amendments which I hope will be made in order that \nsay: Let's look at the President's own budget and pull out some pay-\nfors which are within the budget, and let's use those. This certainly \nshould be bipartisan.\n  Specifically, I have two provisions in my amendment to pay for the \nextension. One is to remove a current loophole in the system which \nallows double-dipping between Social Security disability and \nunemployment insurance. That is in the President's budget. It is in \nthere because it doesn't make sense to have folks who are on Social \nSecurity disability which is designed for people who are unable to \nwork, to also be drawing unemployment insurance which is for people who \nare out of work and looking for a job. That is a requirement.\n  Clearly those two programs are mutually exclusive, which is why the \nPresident's budget includes this prohibition on what is called \nconcurrent receipts--in other words, getting both SSDI and unemployment \ninsurance.\n  I add to that Trade Adjustment Assistance, another program where, as \na worker, if you lose your job due to trade and some external factors, \nyou can go through a retraining program. But you are a worker by \ndefinition. The same principle applies to both. That combination pays \nfor most of the extension of unemployment insurance.\n\n  I see my colleague from Maine is on the floor this evening. He, along \nwith one of his Democratic colleagues and one of his Republican \ncolleagues, has made a similar proposal in legislation and also filed \nan amendment along those lines to say: Let's clean up this issue. Let's \nbe sure we do not have double dipping, that we do establish clearly \nthat if you are qualified as a nonworker in one case, you cannot \nqualify as a worker in another case. I do think that is a responsible \nway to pay for this that would not run afoul of anything the majority \nleader said he was concerned about, although, again, I do not have the \nconcerns he does about the child tax credit issue. I think it is a \nquestion of missed payments. But I want to make clear we do have this \nproposal out there.\n  On top of that, to be sure there is additional pay-for to pay for the \nentire amount of the extension of unemployment insurance, we also add \nan unemployment insurance integrity program, straight out of the \nPresident's budget. This is to ensure through the Labor Department that \nthere are not improper payments on the existing unemployment insurance \nprogram. This will enable us to save money in the long run and help get \npeople into jobs, which I think should be everybody's priority.\n  These are both proposals that are in the process here, that had been \nfiled. We are hoping that they will be pending tomorrow and that we can \nhave a debate on these and other amendments. I believe there are \nseveral other amendments, including the one from my colleague from \nMaine, that will say: OK, we will extend the unemployment insurance \nprogram for 3 months to come up with a better unemployment insurance \nprogram, to improve it so it does connect people to the jobs that are \nout there and provide the kinds of skills training that is needed and \ngives people the tools to be able to access those jobs. But we are \ngoing to pay for it at a time of historic debts and these large \ndeficits and at a time when it violates the budget agreement otherwise \nthat we just passed.\n  I am hopeful that we can make progress on this over the next couple \nof days and that we will be in a position to move forward on dealing \nwith unemployment insurance improving that.\n  I also filed another amendment that relates to this because part of \nwhat we ought to do, in my view, during this month is tie worker \nretraining with unemployment insurance. Senator Bennet and I have \nsomething we called the Career Act that we introduced over the last few \nyears, and this Career Act helps to improve the federal worker \nretraining program, which I believe should be part of this. \nSpecifically, we have a couple of provisions in that legislation that I \nhave introduced as an amendment here to be able to help in terms of the \nunemployment insurance issue. We need to create an environment where \npeople don't need unemployment in the first place. This amendment will \nreform local one-stop centers for worker retraining that help connect \nthe unemployed with retraining services by requiring them to give \npriority consideration to training services that provide workers with \nin-demand industry-recognized credentials. We are finding in Ohio and \nother States that those credentials are what are really needed to get a \njob often, and that is not being prioritized now in our Federal worker \nretraining program.\n  By the way, the Federal Government spends about $15 billion a year on \nthese programs, so we need to make sure that money is well spent, and \nagain, by definition, it is not working as it should. We have so many \nwho are not able to find jobs because of this skills gap. There are \n100,000 jobs open in Ohio right now and about 400,000 people are out of \nwork, and somehow we cannot connect those folks with the jobs, partly \nbecause they do not have the skills.\n  Our proposal also includes an innovative approach, endorsed by the \nPresident in his 2014 budget, that gives States the flexibility to \nspend some of the WIA--Workforce Investment Act--funds on job training \nprograms that use the pay-for-success model. What does that mean? The \npay-for-success model allows providers who right now are getting \nfunding through this program to be reimbursed only if they generate \nresults, which seems pretty basic. You should be looking at outcomes, \nbut that is not in the system now, so it really is a pay-for-success or \npay-for-performance program. It will ensure that these programs are \naccountable and that they actually produce measurable results for \nworkers. Not only will this save money, but it will also help get \nAmericans back to work one job at a time.\n  These seems to me to be really responsible proposals that I hope we \nwill take up in the Senate and be able to move forward with something \nthat pays for this unemployment insurance extension but also begins the \nprocess of improving unemployment insurance so that it works better for \nthat historic number of long-term unemployed.\n  Finally, this is a great opportunity for us to do what actually helps \ngrow this economy because ultimately that is the problem, isn't it? \nUnemployment insurance is taking a dollar from one pocket and giving it \nto someone else. That is needed sometimes. During high unemployment, as \nwe have now, and\n\n[[Page S188]]\n\nlong-term unemployment being high, something is needed in terms of \nunemployment insurance. I think most of us agree with that. But \nultimately that is not the solution. The solution is to create more \neconomic growth and therefore more jobs so people will not need to rely \non unemployment insurance.\n  I am hopeful we can also have discussions about some of those issues. \nWe are not going to reform the Tax Code here in the next couple of \ndays, but we ought to talk about issues like that that give the economy \na shot in the arm.\n  One thing I have introduced along those lines is an amendment to \nstrengthen what is called the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. This is to \nhelp with the regulations out there that are unfortunately causing more \nand more burdens to job creators, making it harder to create jobs.\n  We know the cost of regulations is going up. In 2012--the last year \nfor which we have numbers--the Obama administration regulations cost in \n2012 alone was equal to the costs in the first term of the Bush \nadministration and the Clinton administration combined--more and more \nregulations, more and more costs, about 4,000 regulations a year. We \nhave to be sure we have a process in place to pare down the regulations \nand make sure they are based on a real analysis of the cost and the \nbenefits.\n  I was an author of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 back when \nI was on the House side, and this particular amendment offered today \nimproves that bill. Originally, that was an effort to prevent Congress \nand the Federal regulators from blindly imposing economic burdens on \nthe private sector without going through these costs and benefits. I \nthink most people would acknowledge that it has been a success, but \nwith today's regulatory environment, we need to upgrade and modernize \nit.\n\n  This amendment would require agencies to assess the effect of new \nregulations on job creation, which is not in the current act, so it \nwould add this requirement. Let's look at how this affects creating \njobs. That seems like a commonsense idea. And require those agencies to \nconsider alternatives to the kinds of regulations being proposed that \nmight lessen that effect on jobs.\n  It would also broaden the scope of the unfunded mandates act to \ninclude rules issued by independent agencies. Right now, independent \nagencies are not covered by the cost-benefit analysis because, by \ndefinition, they are independent from the Office of Management and \nBudget and from the analysis that is done. Some independent agencies do \nan analysis; some do not. They use different rules. This would require \nall agencies, whether it is an executive branch agency or an \nindependent agency, to live under these same rules of cost-benefit \nanalysis. That makes a lot of sense.\n  The President has proposed this himself, not in legislative form but \nexecutive action. We need to codify what the President talks about. \nFrankly, he cannot do it by executive agency because, again, these are \nindependent agencies, independent of the White House, so our idea is to \nbring them into the same cost-benefit analysis to make sure they are \nadopting the least burdensome rules possible so they are not affecting \nour economy in negative ways and we get people back to work.\n  Finally, we did require agencies to look at what the options are, \neven after the cost-benefit analysis is done, to determine the least \nburdensome way to achieve the same objective. If you have the same rule \nbeing put in place, you would be required to say how you get from point \nA to point B in the least burdensome way. With so many Americans out of \nwork and so many who are looking for jobs who are underemployed, I \nthink it is time for us to look at everything. Regulatory reform would \ncertainly be one, health care costs is another, tax reform, and looking \nat our trade policy so we can be sure to expand exports. There are lots \nof things to do, but I think on this regulatory front, this is one area \nwhere we have a lot of bipartisan census and we might be able to move \nforward.\n\n  I know we are debating the extension of unemployment benefits today, \nand not all these other issues, but they are all part of it. We have to \nmake sure we are creating an environment for success, that we are \ncreating the opportunity for job creators to invest, take a risk, and \nto begin to take the money off the sidelines in this economy so they \ncan put it to work. That will require us to make some changes here in \nWashington in terms of the way we approach these issues to free up the \nprivate sector so they can do what they do best, which is to create \nmore jobs and opportunity.\n  Again, I was very pleased to hear the Senate majority leader express \na willingness to include reasonable amendments and offsets to the cost \nof this legislation. I do hope he will work with us to ensure we can \nmove forward in a way that does take on some of these issues of waste, \nfraud, and abuse in the Federal Government. We want to make sure there \nis no double dipping, and make sure there are not concurrent receipts \nwith disability plus unemployment insurance, and TAA. We want to ensure \nthat if you are working, you are getting the benefits you are eligible \nfor, and if you are not working, you can get those benefits but not \nboth. These are just sensible provisions and, again, reflective of what \nis in the President's own budget.\n  If we can do that and pay for this for 3 months, we can then go to \nwork as Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike--because there \nis an Independent on the floor tonight--to resolve not just whether we \nextend unemployment but this deeper issue of how to have the \nunemployment program work to get people into jobs that are available \nout there. Again, record levels of long-term unemployment mean we have \na real problem. It is not working.\n  Second, how do we grow this underlying economy? How do we get the \njobs back through economic growth and through creating more opportunity \nfor everyone? How do we get middle-class wages and benefits back up so \nwe can enable every American to have a shot at the American dream by \ngiving people the equal opportunity they deserve?\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his indulgence and staying late \ntonight, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/08/senate-section/article/S188-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
