Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nominations: Calendar Nos. \n338, 339, 341, and 343.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. No.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Well, I object. The majority leader asked for consent, and \nI object.\n  Mr. REID. OK.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, inside the House Republican bubble, the \ncrowd cheered a plan to deny health insurance to tens of millions of \nAmericans or else shut down the government. Outside the House \nRepublican bubble, the reaction was altogether different. The radical \ntea party plan to shut down the government unless Democrats agree to \ndeny funding to implement ObamaCare--passed by the House of \nRepresentatives on Friday--has been called ``the dumbest idea ever'' by \none Republican Senator. It has been called a ``box canyon''--a morass \nfrom which Republicans will not escape unscathed--by a second \nRepublican Senator. It has been called ``dishonest'' by one Republican \nSenator and a ``suicide note'' by another Republican Senator. So, Mr. \nPresident, the reviews are in, and they are universal: The ransom \ndemanded by House Republicans in exchange for keeping the government \nopen is unworkable and unrealistic.\n  President Obama has been clear, and I have been clear: Any bill that \ndefunds ObamaCare is dead on arrival in the Senate. The Affordable Care \nAct has been the law of the land for 4 years now. Democrats are willing \nto work with reasonable Republicans to improve this law. But we now \nunderstand that there is an anarchy movement that is afoot. A lead \neditorial in the New York Times of Wednesday of last week said that. \nBut we are not going to bow to tea party anarchists who deny the mere \nfact that ObamaCare is the law. We will not bow to tea party anarchists \nwho refuse to accept that the Supreme Court ruled ObamaCare to be \nconstitutional. And we will not bow to\n\n[[Page S6674]]\n\ntea party anarchists in the House or in the Senate who ignore the fact \nthat President Obama was overwhelmingly reelected a few months ago.\n  These fanatics really point to disapproval for ObamaCare as \njustification for taking the Federal Government and our economy hostage \nto their demands. What they fail to mention to the American people and \nto the Senate and to the House is that 59 percent of Americans either \nsupport the law or wish it were even more far-reaching and \ntransformative of our health care delivery system, according to a CNN \npoll. The vast majority of Americans--including those who disapprove of \nthe health care law--want Congress to work to improve it, not to tear \nit down. And according to a new CNBC poll, Americans overwhelmingly \noppose defunding ObamaCare, especially if it means shutting down the \ngovernment to do so.\n  So the facts are that the vast majority of the American people are \nsatisfied with ObamaCare. The simple fact remains that ObamaCare is the \nlaw of the land and it will remain the law of the land as long as \nBarack Obama is President of the United States and as long as I am the \nSenate majority leader. The latest gamble by Republicans in the House \nof Representatives--made with the backing of their radical allies in \nthe Senate--only postpones the inevitable.\n  This week the Senate will act as quickly as tea party Republicans \nwill allow. Once the Senate has acted, House Republicans will face a \nchoice--whether to pass a clean continuing resolution or shut down the \nFederal Government. So the question is, Are extremist Republicans \nreally willing to shut down the government? Time will only tell. But \nthe world looks to America for leadership. Is this lack of respect for \nthe rule of law truly the example we wish to set for others? Are \nRepublicans so intent on undermining both President Obama and his \nsignature health care law that they are willing to inflict severe \ndamage to our economy in the process? America will know exactly whom to \nblame--Republican fanatics in the House and the Senate.\n  I urge those Republicans to listen to the more reasonable Republicans \nin the Senate. I have read some of their commentary on what is \ncontemplated and how dumb they think it is. I repeat, one Republican \nSenator said: It is the dumbest idea I have ever heard. Two dozen \nSenate Republicans have spoken against this foolhardy plan to drive the \neconomy off a cliff--two dozen. This ``Thelma and Louise'' style is not \ngetting the attention of the American people in a positive tone. If \nDemocrats do not bow to every demand they have, they want to go right \nover the cliff. We are not going to go with them.\n  I am glad to see more and more of my moderate Republican colleagues \nstepping up to speak sense to an extremist element of their own party.\n  Maureen Dowd wrote in the New York Times on Saturday:\n\n       Speaker John Boehner, trapped under the thumb of Tea Party \n     anarchists, called Friday's vote to defund Obamacare and \n     invite a government shutdown, ``a victory for common sense.''\n\n  She said:\n\n       More like a triumph of nonsense [not common sense].\n\n  So a few reasonable Republicans are wise enough to know that risking \nthe Nation's economic recovery for the sake of a Pyrrhic ideological \nvictory would be another step toward a death knell for the Republican \nParty.\n  Mr. President, every one of these Senators whose comments I read to \neveryone listening, plus the 20 or so others whose comments I did not \nmention specifically, are conservative people, conservative \nRepublicans, they are just not radical.\n  So I say to House and Senate Republicans who continue to deny a \nreality and risk America's economy: Listen to the chorus all around \nyou. Listen to what they are saying. Your conservative Senate \ncolleagues have urged you off this reckless course. The Nation's \nlargest business group, the chamber of commerce, has urged you off this \nreckless course. American families, who are weary both of these foolish \npartisan fights and of these difficult economic times, have urged you \noff this reckless course. And on behalf of Democrats, who long for the \ndays when we legislated through cooperation--we did it instead of \nhostage-taking--I personally urge you off this reckless course.\n  What remains to be seen is whether my Republican colleagues on both \nsides of the Capitol are wise enough to listen.\n  Mr. President, we have a number of people we are trying to get \napproved, confirming nominations. They have been approved by everyone, \nas far as I know, and I will again, unless my friend from Texas objects \nto these people getting confirmed--does my friend object?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Reserving the right to object, I am happy to discuss it \nwith the majority leader, but at this point, yes, I object.\n  Mr. REID. Fine. I will make my request, and the Senator can grab his \nreservation, and we will talk about it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nto consider the following nominations: Calendar Nos. 338, 339, 341, and \n343; that the nominations be confirmed en bloc; the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that there be no \nintervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to \nany of the nominations; that any related statements be printed in the \nRecord; that President Obama be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is objection.\n  Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, earlier this month we marked the 12th \nanniversary of the terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers and the \nPentagon that killed more than 3,000 people.\n\n[[Page S6675]]\n\n  Our fight against terrorism continues today. We can be proud of all \nthat America's military personnel and the veterans of the global war on \nterror have accomplished, as well as the ongoing efforts.\n  Many brave Americans put their lives on the line every day to defend \nthis country because terrorists remain committed to harming the United \nStates. Many have made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms. We must \nhonor the sacrifice of the men and women who laid down their lives for \nus.\n  Arkansas has a proud history of its citizens serving this country in \nthe military. Many brave Arkansans, including two recently, have given \ntheir lives defending our country on the battlefield. We continue to \nhonor the men and women who have given their last full measure of \ndevotion to protect our Nation.\n  SGT Jamar Avery Hicks sacrificed his life for this country in support \nof Operation Enduring Freedom. Sergeant Hicks graduated from Hall High \nSchool in Little Rock, AR, in 2009. One of his former teachers \ndescribed him as a student who didn't mind going out of his way to help \nothers and never looked for anything in return. She says she would have \ntaken a whole classroom filled with students like Jamar. Those closest \nto Sergeant Hicks describe him as a quiet, gentle, and unassuming man \nwith an infectious smile who always had a positive outlook on life.\n  Sergeant Hicks joined the Army in November of 2009. His friends say \nhe loved the Army, and his military service drove him to continue to \nimprove himself. Sergeant Hicks was assigned to Headquarters and \nHeadquarters Battery, 4th Battalion, 320th Field Artillery Regiment, \n101st Airborne Division, Fort Campbell, KY, as a vehicle driver. He \ngave his life on August 11, 2013, his 22nd birthday, after enemy forces \nattacked his unit with indirect fire in the Paktia Province of \nAfghanistan.\n  I ask my colleagues to keep his family, including his wife Debra, his \nson Jamar, Jr., and friends in their thoughts and prayers during this \nvery difficult time.\n  Most recently the Natural State honored the life of SFC Ricardo Young \nas State flags flew at half-mast. Sergeant First Class Young graduated \nfrom Nevada High School in Rosston, AR, in 1997. His family and friends \ndescribe him as fun-loving, caring, and always full of life. Sergeant \nFirst Class Young joined the Army in September 1997. He trained at Fort \nBenning before his first assignment at Fort Campbell, KY. In his 15 \nyears of military service, Sergeant First Class Young was deployed to \ntwo tours in Iraq, one in Afghanistan, in addition to other missions \naround the globe.\n  Sergeant First Class Young was assigned to the 738th Engineer Support \nCompany, 307th Engineer Battalion, 20th Engineer Brigade, 18th Airborne \nCorps, Fort Bragg, NC. On August 28, 2013, he gave his life in support \nof Operation Enduring Freedom in Farah Province, Afghanistan.\n  On behalf of a grateful nation, I humbly offer my sincerest gratitude \nfor the patriotism and selfless service of Sergeant First Class Young \nand Sergeant Hicks.\n  Let us never forget the sacrifices of our troops, and let their \nlegacies be an inspiration for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I would like to be recognized to speak on \na few issues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. In the course of the next few weeks it is going to be \nwhite-knuckle time. Here, coming up next week, October 1, begins a new \nfiscal year, of which all appropriations funding of the Government, \nsave for those programs that automatically flow such as Medicare, \nSocial Security--all others will cease to have funding unless we can \ncontinue to fund through appropriations bills coming up. That is next \nweek.\n  As you know, there are a number of people on that side of the aisle \nwho are threatening to shut down the government unless they get their \nway. In this particular case a lot of them in the House of \nRepresentatives are saying their way or no way; that they want to \ndefund the implementation of the law that has been in existence for 3 \nyears, setting up a reform of the health care system.\n  But the white knuckles--assuming we can get over that little hurdle--\nthe white knuckles will continue because shortly thereafter we are \ngoing to get to the day of reckoning about whether the U.S. Government \ncan pay its bills because of the artificial debt ceiling set in statute \nthat says that above a certain level the U.S. Government cannot borrow \nany more money. These are obligations that have already been incurred.\n  Just think how many of us own U.S. bonds. A bunch of those bonds are \ncoming due. That is in large part how we finance the debt of the United \nStates, by selling securities with the full faith and credit of the \nstrongest financial government on the face of planet Earth. Therefore, \nif that debt ceiling, that artificial ceiling set in statute, is not \nraised, the government cannot go out and borrow any more money--in \nother words, issuing new bonds. That is when the knuckles completely \nturn white.\n  Listen to what a respected economist, the chief economist for Moody's \nMark Zandi told the Joint Economic Committee last week. He says the \nfinancial markets of this country, indeed the international markets as \nwell, will start to get jittery starting next week if there is no clear \npath to a deal on raising that artificial, statutory debt ceiling. He \nsays then that jitteriness is going to turn into panic once the U.S. \nTreasury cannot make its payments. He further went on to say: ``If you \ndon't do it in time, confidence will evaporate, consumer confidence \nwill sharply decline, businesses''--I hope the American people, by the \nway, can understand this, what are the consequences of this--`` . . . \nbusinesses will stop hiring,'' he says, ``consumers will stop \nspending--'' listen to that, shopowners--``and the stock market will \nfall significantly in value:'' and how about this, small business \nowners--``borrowing costs for businesses and households will continue \nto rise'' significantly.\n  Do you know what he told us, the same economist told us 2 years ago \nwhen we were getting right up to the precipice on the debt ceiling? He \nsaid:\n\n       At the end of the day if we don't raise the debt ceiling, \n     the economy is going to go back into a recession. Interest \n     rates are going to spike.\n\n  In the State of the Presiding Officer, the housing market is \nrecovering, as it is in my State. People are excited about buying a new \nhouse or selling their old house and moving into a new house. Interest \nrates are still relatively low. But in a State such as Virginia or my \nState of Florida, where housing is such a critical component of the \neconomy, just think what is going to happen if the interest rates \nsuddenly spike and now the cost of getting into a new house is double \nwhat it was before because of the interest rate spiking and because \nthey are less inclined, if the interest rates spike, to get that new \nmortgage. Then the houses are not selling and the values of the houses \nthat have been recovering, out of the deep recession, instead of going \nthis way are starting to go that way.\n  The American people have not focused on the consequences if these \nguys on that side of the aisle and down there at the other end of the \nCapitol in fact cause the U.S. Government to go into default.\n  Let's listen to some more experts. Martin Feldstein, former Chairman \nof the Council of Economic Advisors--for whom? For a Republican \nPresident, President Reagan:\n\n       The debt ceiling is a very dangerous thing to play with.\n\n  How about the respected Bob Rubin, Treasury Secretary under President \nClinton? Remember the 1990s, how the economy was surging, how people \nwere feeling good? Let's see what he says.\n\n       Defaulting on our commitments is unthinkable and dangerous, \n     and the debt ceiling should be raised now without conditions.\n\n  That is what the President has said. He is not going to negotiate on \nthe debt ceiling because of all of these consequences. Yet they are \nsaying if they\n\n[[Page S6676]]\n\ndo not get their way to take away the funding for the implementation of \nthe part of the health care bill that is supposed to go into effect--a \nlot of it has already gone into effect--they want to take away the \nfunds.\n  Let's listen to another respected economist. After all, he has \nshepherded us out of the recession because he is the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve, Ben Bernanke. He says:\n\n       But I do hope that Congress will allow the Government to \n     pay its bills, not raise the possibility of default which \n     would be very, very costly to our economy.\n\n  That is a little bit of understatement, as the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve always does, but it is a zinger.\n  Mark Zandi, the one we quoted before, says:\n\n       This dark scenario is so dark I can't imagine it.\n\n  How about another former Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan \nBlinder:\n\n       In short, the consequences of hitting the debt ceiling are \n     too awful to contemplate. . . . A sane Congress wouldn't even \n     think about it.\n\n  Let me quote another Republican, Bruce Bartlett, deputy assistant \nsecretary for economic policy at Treasury under President George H.W. \nBush. This is what he said:\n\n       A potential debt default is far more than a domestic \n     consideration; it is a matter of foreign policy.\n\n  That leads me to briefly comment. We suddenly have in the \ninternational arena a whole bunch of new things that might be \noptimistic signs. If the Russians follow through and if President Assad \ndoes in fact open--and those are two big ``ifs'' but at least it has \nhappened thus far in the first week--if Assad does in fact open his \nchemical weapons, then there is the possibility that not only would the \nability to disperse chemical weapons in Syria have been eliminated but \nthose entire weapons would have been eliminated.\n  That is a pretty good first step.\n  We are also hearing the new President of Iran--as a result of an \nelection in Iran--start to sing a new tune and have more of an outreach \nto the West. Should we be skeptical? Of course. I talked to the new \nForeign Minister of Iran, who was a former Iranian Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations, last Friday. I talked to him about what a gesture of \ngood will it would be if they could find the missing retired FBI agent \nwho disappeared 6\\1/2\\ years ago, Bob Levinson, from the tourist island \nof Kish off the Iranian coast--if they could find him and return him to \nhis wife and seven children after having been gone for 6\\1/2\\ years. We \nhave had proof of life twice--one with a video and the second time was \n2 years ago in a photo. What a gesture of good will it would be if they \nwere sincere about having a new relationship with the West.\n  So if intrigues are real and they happen, would we want to undermine \nso much of that--to put it in the words of a Republican adviser of the \nTreasury to President George H. W. Bush--that a potential default is \nfar more than a domestic consideration, it is a matter of foreign \npolicy. Would we want to weaken the U.S. Government as it negotiates \nover these critical matters?\n  I will conclude by saying there is some movement and discussions \nunderway about a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians \nwith security safeguards for both. Again, if there is any reality to \nthese new messages that are flowing around and which our Secretary of \nState and our former colleague John Kerry is trying desperately to \nbring about--just think of what that does to improve the world \nsituation, of which the enormous beneficiary is the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Yet would we be threatening again, pulling the economic underpinnings \nout from all of our negotiators on these three main negotiated topics \nthat are now in front of us that affect the national security so \ndesperately of the United States and the security of our allies? I \ndon't think so. That is why I think there are a bunch of folks over \nhere who have tried to get the Members in the House of Representatives \nto come to their senses.\n  We have seen this brinkmanship before. I hope cooler and more \nrational heads will prevail.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have a very serious problem with the \nnew health care law. Costs are surging. We now have a projection from \nthe Government Accountability Office. Under a realistic set of \nassumptions, the health care law will add over $6 trillion to the \nunfunded liabilities of the United States of America. Private health \ninsurance premiums are going up. Unions are in full rebellion. Congress \nis in rebellion with regard to our staff. Doctors are rebelling. Many \nof them are giving up practices. They didn't get the one thing they \nreally needed, which is a fix to their Medicare reimbursement. The \nPresident has had to delay the employer mandate. This law is nowhere \nclose to workable. It is not good. There are many more bad things I \ncould say about the status we are in today.\n  The only person who apparently is stuck with this, who doesn't have \npower to influence the process, is John Q. Citizen. Businesses are \ngetting their employer mandate delayed because it just won't work.\n  In fact, this law is clearly, indisputably savaging job creation and \neconomic growth. Seventy-seven percent of the people who got jobs this \nyear got part-time jobs, and every expert says ObamaCare is a big part \nof the reason--a big part of that. Businesses are staying below 50 \nemployees so they feel as though they are not so bound. Wages are down \nagain this year. Unemployment is high. The percentage of the American \npeople who are actually working is down--the workplace rate--and it is \nat the lowest point since 1975. This health care law is a big part of \nit. It just is, and everybody knows it. Talk to any businessperson, and \nthey will say that the uncertainty, the costs, the problems that are \nentailed with it are impacting what they do. That is just a fact.\n  So this year the Senate has done nothing--absolutely nothing. Every \nattempt to confront the serious problems with this law has been blocked \nby the Senate Democratic majority led by Senator Reid. That is just a \nfact. The House has passed repeated bills to confront this problem, and \nthey have now sent over a bill from the House that funds the Government \nof the United States but defunds this unworkable health care law. \nRepublicans in the House and Senate have put forward serious proposals \nto improve health care in America.\n  We ought to understand the posture we are in here. The Senate \nDemocrats have refused to consider any reform. The House has passed a \nnumber of bills to deal with this in a responsible way, and they have \nnow passed a bill--a continuing resolution--to fund the Government of \nthe United States, but defund the President's health care law.\n  What does he say? He says: Well, I will talk with Putin, negotiate \nwith him. I will negotiate with Assad. I will negotiate with Iran. But \nI will not even talk to anyone in the U.S. Congress about this health \ncare law that is clearly unworkable and, as one of our Democratic \nMembers said, a train wreck. No chance. Not one jot, not one tittle of \nmy health care law will be changed.\n  What is he saying there? I will shut down the government before I \nallow a change in my ``perfect'' health care law.\n  So I want to raise the question, Who is causing the problem in this \ncountry? Who is the one who is refusing to fix an obviously failed \nhealth care law that needs major reform? It is the President of the \nUnited States and a majority in the Senate. I express my deepest \nconcern about it, as a member of the Budget Committee, and we will talk \nmore about it in the days to come, but this law is financially \nunsustainable. It is not what it was sold to be.\n  The American people have never believed you can have a huge expansion \nof health care and not have an impact on the U.S. budget. They are \nabsolutely right, as the GAO has already told us.\n  I know others are prepared to talk. I just want to say that we need \nto understand what has happened. It is time for\n\n[[Page S6677]]\n\nus to make some fundamental changes to this law, and all we are hearing \nfrom the White House is this: No, sir. Not one change will they accept. \nWe will not even have serious negotiations about it. That is \nunacceptable. It needs to change. I hope in the next few days the \nAmerican people will become engaged, and perhaps our colleagues will \nsee it differently.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given 20 \nminutes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have no objection whatsoever to the \nSenator speaking, but it was my understanding he was going to ask some \nconsent requests. I understand he has great persuasive talents in \nspeaking, but I am not going to be able to do that. I interrupted my \nschedule today, which I was happy to do, at the convenience of the \nSenator from Texas. So I will be back in 20 minutes, and the Senator \ncan ask his unanimous consent requests at that time. Is that OK?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I would be happy to ask the unanimous \nconsent requests at the outset if that would be preferable to the \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. REID. OK. And if the Senator would do that, I would really \nappreciate it. And he has my word that I will watch what I can, and if \nI cannot, I will read every word of it tonight.\n  Mr. CRUZ. And I am hopeful my remarks will be persuasive when the \nSenator watches them.\n  Mr. REID. My friend is always persuasive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRUZ. The first unanimous consent request that I would put \nforward: Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate agree \nto the motion to proceed to H.J. Res. 59; that no debate, amendments, \nor motions to the resolution be in order; that any and all points of \norder be waived; that the resolution be read a third time and passed \nand the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable, without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, my \nfriend went right to the point, and I appreciate that. I understand \nthat the junior Senator from Texas asks consent to pass the House-\npassed continuing resolution by consent without any amendments. I \nunderstand that. As I said, he came right to the point.\n  The House-passed resolution, as we know now, would defund ObamaCare. \nIt would block not only the administration of the program but all \nrelated benefits as well, and that is untoward.\n  Second, it includes so-called debt prioritization language, or what \nhas been called the ``pay China first'' policy. This would leave us \nvulnerable to default on our obligations to everyone else besides \nbondholders and Social Security--everyone from veterans, to small \nbusinesses, to Federal employees and contractors, to doctors and \nhospitals and Medicare patients generally.\n  Mr. President, the President would veto this continuing resolution, \nso it is not going to become law anyway, and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, the second unanimous consent request that I \nwould put forward: Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate agree to the motion to proceed to H.J. Res. 59; that any and all \npoints of order be waived; that during consideration of H.J. Res. 59, \nadoption of any amendments be subject to a 60-affirmative-vote \nthreshold; and that upon disposition of all amendments, the resolution \nbe read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table, without any intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object I again \nunderstand the Senator from Texas in his request, which would create a \nnew 60-vote hurdle where the Senate rules do not require one at the \npresent time. I really try to follow the Senate rules. Sometimes they \nare obnoxious and I wish they were different, but I try my best, in \nleading us in this difficult Senate sometimes, to live up to all the \nrules as they exist. The Senate rules set up a lot of hurdles. That is \nthe way the precedents have been developed over the years, and I \nunderstand that. Sometimes Senators like these, sometimes they do not. \nI would guess that most would say the Senate has enough--enough--60-\nvote hurdles, that the Senate has enough of these really arbitrary \nhurdles as it is, that we do not need to add even more barriers to \ngetting things done.\n  We should be careful about adding new barriers. The American people \nare really fed up. I travel the country, and it is rare that I go \nsomeplace where they do not say: What are you going to do to change the \nrules? They know what the rules are and how difficult they are. I would \nbet the vast majority of Senators--Democrats and Republicans--would \nlike them changed. The problem is that we have tried that recently. We \nwere able to make a little headway but not a lot. So I think most \nAmericans would rather we work in ways to agree to work together rather \nthan disagree. I almost would bet, although I am not a betting man, \nthat most Americans would rather we avoid shutting down the government.\n  Mr. President, I know the sincerity of the Senator from Texas. I \nunderstand that. I disagree with him I hope as sincerely as he \ndisagrees with me, but I do not take away from his sincerity. But \nhaving said that, I am in a position now to object, and I must do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, at this time I now ask unanimous consent \nthat I be allowed 20 minutes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, these two unanimous consent requests have \nthe virtue of clarifying this debate the Senate will face this week. I \nam going to suggest to the Presiding Officer that the Senate has not \nfaced a more important debate in the short time he and I have both \nserved in this institution. No American wants a government shutdown. I \ndo not want a government shutdown. No one on this side of the aisle \nwants a government shutdown. The House of Representatives does not want \na government shutdown.\n  Five minutes ago the Senate could have acted to prevent a government \nshutdown. The requests I promulgated to the majority leader were to \npass the continuing resolution the House of Representatives passed. If \nthat had happened, there would be no government shutdown. A government \nshutdown would be taken off the table. The specter the Presiding \nOfficer and I see on the television screen every day--the countdown \nclock that has started to appear--would disappear. But unfortunately \nthe majority leader chose to object--to object and to say, no, he would \nrather risk a government shutdown than act to prevent it. Why? Again, \nthe majority leader was quite candid: because he supports the law \ncalled ObamaCare.\n  I would note that a component of that also--one of the pieces the \nHouse of Representatives passed--is a law that has been called the \nDefault Prevention Act. The President of the United States has been \ndoing a fair amount of public speaking, raising the prospect of a \ndefault on our debt. The House of Representatives acted boldly to \ninclude in their continuing resolution language that would say the \nUnited States will never, ever, ever default on its debt, that in the \nevent the debt ceiling is not raised, we will always pay our debt \nfirst.\n  I suspect every Member of this body has spoken publicly about the \ncalamity that would come from a default on the debt. I think it is \nquite revealing that the majority leader explicitly referenced and \nobjected to by name taking a default off the table. I think that is \nunfortunate.\n  There is a tendency in this town toward brinkmanship, toward pointing \nto\n\n[[Page S6678]]\n\nevents that can cause instability and uncertainty and using them to try \nto get your way. I wish the majority leader had been willing to step \nforward and say: I agree, No. 1, that the government should be funded; \nwe should not have a government shutdown; and, No. 2, that we should \nnever ever even discuss a default on the debt.\n  Had the majority leader simply said, ``I consent,'' a default on the \ndebt would have been taken permanently off the table. Why didn't he? We \nall know why he didn't. Because the majority leader embraces ObamaCare. \nI am going to suggest that this body a little over 3 years ago passed \nObamaCare. It passed on a straight party-line vote. In the time since \nit has passed, America has learned it is not working. Americans all \nover this country are suffering because of ObamaCare. It is the single \nbiggest job killer in America. Every day we are seeing more and more \nevidence that ObamaCare is killing jobs; that it is hurting American \nworkers who are struggling; that it is causing people to be forcibly \nput into part-time work, 29 hours a week; that it is jacking up their \nhealth insurance premiums. It is causing more and more people, who are \nstruggling, to lose their health insurance altogether.\n  Today the New York Times reported that because of ObamaCare, \n``Insurers are significantly limiting the choices of doctors and \nhospitals available to consumers.'' That is today in the newspaper.\n  USA Today reported on a new ``family glitch'' that could cause up to \na half million children to go without insurance coverage.\n  A headline in the Washington Post today read, ``One week away, \nObamaCare's small business insurance exchanges not all ready for \nlaunch.''\n  Even the labor unions that once championed ObamaCare are now publicly \ndecrying it as a threat to the 40-hour workweek that is the backbone of \nthe American middle class. That is in the words of organized labor.\n  This law is hurting the American people. It is why there is \nbipartisan consensus outside of Washington, DC, that we need to step up \nand stop it. That would be the responsible thing for Senators on both \nsides of the aisle to do, to say: The same rules should apply to hard-\nworking American families that apply to big corporations and that apply \nto Members of Congress.\n  We have seen the President unilaterally put in place exceptions for \ngiant corporations and Members of Congress. I would submit, hard-\nworking American families deserve that same exception. So I think it is \nunfortunate the majority leader chose to object to continuing \ngovernment, to preventing a shutdown, to taking a default off the \ntable. But I do think it is clarifying to make clear, as the majority \nleader just did, that he is willing to risk a government shutdown. He \nis willing to force even a government shutdown in order to insist that \nObamaCare is funded.\n  That leads to the second unanimous consent request I put forward, a \nsimple request that every amendment on this continuing resolution be \nsubject to 60 votes. Everyone in this body knows that is not an unusual \nrequest in the Senate. Amendments in this body are routinely subjected \nto 60-vote thresholds. Indeed, a few months ago when this body was \ndebating the issue of guns--a contentious issue, an emotional issue, an \nissue of great moment for this country--the majority leader agreed with \nthe minority that every single amendment on the floor would be subject \nto a 60-vote threshold. Those were the terms under which every aspect \nof the gun debate was debated.\n  I would note that one amendment that was submitted during that gun \ndebate was the Grassley-Cruz amendment. It was the law enforcement \namendment that put real teeth in going after felons and fugitives who \ntry to illegally buy guns. It put real teeth into forcing States to \nreport mental health records so we can prevent those with serious \nmental illnesses from illegally purchasing firearms.\n  I would note that the Grassley-Cruz amendment received a majority \nvote in this institution. A majority of Senators voted for it, \nincluding nine Democrats. It was the most bipartisan of the \ncomprehensive gun amendments voted on in this body. Yet it did not pass \ninto law because the majority leader set a 60-vote threshold for every \namendment.\n  I would suggest that ObamaCare is no less important. ObamaCare is no \nless controversial. ObamaCare, likewise, should be subject to the same \nthreshold. If the majority leader believes ObamaCare is good for \nAmerica, if the Democrats in this body believe ObamaCare is good for \nAmerica, then I would encourage this body, let's debate--not in the \nartificial sense in which we debate, one or two Senators talking to an \nempty hall, but in the real sense of making the case to each other and \nthe American people about whether this law is working or whether it is \nnot. Because everywhere I travel in the State of Texas and across the \ncountry, Americans come to me and raise the single biggest challenge \nthey are facing: ObamaCare. It is killing their jobs. It is taking \ntheir health care. It is not working.\n  We all know that 3\\1/2\\ years ago ObamaCare was forced into law on a \nstrict party-line vote, by straight, brute force. But it should not be \nfunded that way. That is not the way a government should proceed. That \nis not the way this institution should proceed. A 60-vote threshold \ndoes not require that the majority leader get a great many Republican \nvotes, but it does require that he get a few, that he cannot simply do \nit with the votes of only the Democrats in this body.\n  This country will be better off if we work together to restore \neconomic growth and to stop the incredible job loss that is coming from \nObamaCare. In fact, regarding a 60-vote threshold, here is what the \nlearned majority leader has had to say:\n\n       For more than 200 years, the rules of the Senate have \n     protected the American people and rightfully so. The need to \n     muster 60 votes in order to terminate Senate debate naturally \n     frustrates the majority and oftentimes the minority. I am \n     sure it will frustrate me when I assume the office of \n     majority leader in a few weeks. But I recognize this \n     requirement as a tool that serves the long-term interests of \n     the Senate and the American people and our country.\n\n  I agree with Majority Leader Reid. I agree that 60-vote thresholds \nensure that we behave not just in a partisan manner but in a way that \nbrings us together. Given the challenges coming from ObamaCare, I \nbelieve nothing is hurting the American people more, nothing is hurting \nthe economy more, nothing is damaging jobs more, than ObamaCare.\n  Given the majority leader's objection raised today, the path the \nmajority intends to go down is now clear. It is clear to Democrats, it \nis clear to Republicans, it is clear for the world to see: The majority \nleader has stated it is his intention to force a vote to fund \nObamaCare, and do so using just 51 votes, to do so on what could be a \nstraight party-line vote, in all likelihood would be a straight party-\nline vote.\n  I would suggest that is not a responsible course of action. It is not \na course of action that I think Republicans should acquiesce to. If it \nis the majority leader's intent to fund ObamaCare using just 51 votes, \nthen I would submit to every Republican in this body it is our \nobligation to our constituents to do everything we can to prevent the \nmajority leader from funding ObamaCare with 51 votes. Any Member of \nthis body who votes for cloture on this bill will be voting to allow \nthe majority leader to fund ObamaCare on 51 votes. I think that vote is \na mistake. I think that vote disserves our constituents. I think that \nvote hurts the people of America.\n  So 232 Members of the House of Representatives came together and said \nexplicitly: Do not fund ObamaCare. I would note that included two \nDemocrats who came together with Republicans in a bipartisan manner to \nsay: This law is not working. Maybe we thought it would work, but the \nfacts, the evidence, have proven it is not working.\n  The Senate should do likewise. The House acted last week because the \nHouse listened to the American people. I would suggest that every \nMember of this body should do exactly the same: Listen to the American \npeople. Because if we listen to the American people, we will, No. 1, \nkeep the government running. I wish the majority leader had agreed to \nmy request to take a government shutdown off the table by passing the \nHouse continuing resolution.\n  If we listen to the American people, we will, No. 2, take any default \non the debt off the table. I wish the majority\n\n[[Page S6679]]\n\nleader had not objected to doing so right now. I wish the majority \nleader had not said he intends to continue to use the threat of a \ndefault to engage in brinkmanship to try to force ObamaCare on the \nAmerican people.\n  If we listen to the American people, we will recognize that this law \nis not working. That is why big corporations asked for and received an \nexception. That is why Members of Congress asked for and received an \nexception. That is why unions have recently come forward and asked for \nan exception. They have not yet been granted it, but I will venture a \nprediction now that if Congress votes to continue funding ObamaCare, \nthat union exception will not be far away. Then we will be left in a \nworld where the burdens of ObamaCare, the job-killing consequences of \nObamaCare, fall on hard-working American families, not on big \ncorporations, not on Members of Congress and, in the near future, I \npredict not on union bosses, only on hard-working American families, on \nsingle moms, on young people, on people struggling to climb the \neconomic ladder.\n  I would suggest that is getting it exactly backward. This body should \nbe not be granting special rules, special favors for the ruling class, \nfor those with power and privilege. We should be fighting for those who \nare struggling. Those are the people who are getting hurt the most by \nObamaCare.\n  I believe this week will be a critical week for the Senate, where \nevery one of us--and I hope to see Republicans and Democrats stand \ntogether and to say, setting aside partisan differences, we have an \nobligation to the people of our States. ObamaCare is not working, so we \nare going to step forward and recognize the simple reality that it is \nthe biggest job killer in this country and we should not affirmatively \nfund it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Civilian National Service\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on September 11 we came together as a \ncountry on the National Day of Service and Remembrance to honor those \nlives lost on that tragic day 12 years ago and celebrated the bravery \nand commitment of our men and women in uniform. As our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen and marines continue to defend our freedom and security \nabroad, Americans back home have also been stepping forward to serve \ntheir communities and country.\n  Last week brought the 20th anniversary of the signing of legislation \nthat created AmeriCorps. With that goal in mind, I rise to speak in \nhonor of the men and women in civilian national service who have \nsacrificed their time and energy to serve our country by strengthening \nour communities. We honor them for their commitment and hold them as \nshining examples for rising generations.\n  Over the last two decades more than 820,000 AmeriCorps members have \nquietly and selflessly given in total more than 1 billion hours of \nservice to our country. In Arizona alone more than 15,000 residents \nhave served more than 16 million hours and have earned Segal AmeriCorps \nEducation Awards totaling nearly $37 million. They have mentored and \ntutored schoolchildren, helping students stay on track with their \neducation and having a chance at a better future. They have helped \ncommunities recover from devastating natural disasters, supported \nmilitary families, and helped veterans overcome the stress of a decade \nof conflict and reintegrate back into civilian life. They have worked \nin our national parks and on our public lands that preserve the story \nof America for future generations, and they have done so much more.\n  For their dedication and service they receive a modest living \nallowance and an education award that can keep the dream of a college \neducation within reach. They have also earned my respect and the \nadmiration of citizens around the country.\n  As we reflect on the dedication of those who have served, we must \nalso ask ourselves what more can we do to give more young Americans the \nopportunity to follow in their footsteps. As the Franklin Project at \nthe Aspen Institute has called for, we should make a year of national \nservice, whether military or civilian, a right of passage for all young \nAmericans. We should expand AmeriCorps service positions, as we called \nfor in the bipartisan Serve America Act that we passed nearly 5 years \nago. We should strengthen partnerships with Federal departments and \nagencies to use national service as a cost-effective strategy to meet \ntheir missions, and we should work with the private sector, from \ncorporations and philanthropic organizations to higher education and \nfaith-based institutions, to support the creation of service \nopportunities and to recognize the contributions of those who serve.\n  We should also continue to remain engaged throughout the world by, \namong other things, fulfilling the promise of the Peace Corps. At its \nfounding, America started with a grand notion, the recognition that all \nmen are created equal and that they are endowed with certain \ninalienable rights that must be protected. But recognizing there are \nthose among us and common causes greater than our own self-interests \nthat require our attention and care, the Declaration of Independence \nalso emphasized `` . . . we mutually pledge to one another our Lives, \nour Fortunes and our Sacred Honor.'' Benjamin Franklin likewise talked \nabout creating a ``Republic, if you can keep it,'' and created a corps \nin Philadelphia through which citizens could serve their community. \nJohn Adams likewise spoke of how the duty to serve our country ended \nbut with our lives.\n  Throughout history, Presidents of both parties put into place \ninitiatives that put our people into productive service to our Nation. \nExamples include Franklin Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps, John \nKennedy's Peace Corps, Lyndon Johnson's VISTA Program, Richard Nixon's \nSenior Corps, George H.W. Bush's Points of Light, Bill Clinton's \nAmeriCorps, George W. Bush's USA Freedom Corps, and, more recently, the \npassage of the Serve America Act, which reauthorizes and expands \nnational service programs.\n  Congress should step up. With so much division and discord throughout \nthe country, national service can help bring our country closer \ntogether. Drawing from lessons learned from programs of the past, a \nrenewed commitment to national service by this body can unleash the \ningenuity of the American people and their desire to contribute to \ncauses greater than themselves. It can channel the energy of the \ninstitutions of civil society to get our country moving again. Think of \nit: Passionate, engaged young people from all backgrounds and regions \nacross the Nation tackling our toughest challenges in education, \npoverty, conservation, health, disaster response, reintegrating \nveterans, and more in a truly enduring way.\n  In my view, nothing else binds us better and has us move forward as a \nnation more effectively than service to our Nation, particularly \nservice designed to improve lives and strengthen communities. For this \nreason, my vision for civilian national service is worth more than our \naspirations. It deserves our commitment to achieving it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, on Friday a unified House Republican \nconference sent a strong message to the American people: Let's keep the \ngovernment open, and let's protect the American people simultaneously \nfrom the harmful and potentially devastating effects of ObamaCare.\n  It is now time for the Senate to act. We know the President's health \ncare law is not ready to implement. The Wall Street Journal recently \nreported that the government's software that runs the online insurance \nmarketplaces, known as exchanges, simply is not ready. It can't \nreliably determine how much people need to pay for coverage.\n\n[[Page S6680]]\n\n  In the face of this and the other aspects of the law that are not \nready--many of them by the President's own admission--if the \nadministration goes ahead with this law anyway, we know ObamaCare will \nbe implemented in a manner that is manifestly unfair and that is likely \nto harm hard-working Americans. Big business, unions, and other special \ninterests may well all receive special treatment under ObamaCare while \nthe rest of the country will be forced into ObamaCare's unfair, \nunworkable, and fundamentally unsound system.\n  We know the law is unaffordable. We know it will be bad for the \neconomy. At a time when we are running annual deficits approaching $1 \ntrillion, ObamaCare is going to cost roughly $2 trillion over the next \n10 years. The law is forcing employers to shed workers, cut back hours, \nand stop providing health insurance for employees. And we know it is \nnot going to work. The Congressional Budget Office recently concluded \nthat after 10 years of ObamaCare, 31 million Americans will still lack \nhealth insurance.\n  We understand these are inconvenient facts for the President and for \nMembers of this body who still support this law. But those are the \nfacts, and we have a responsibility to do something about it.\n  How many more people will have to lose their jobs, wages, and health \ncare benefits before Congress acts? How many more States will have to \nannounce that premiums are going up before we do something to protect \nthe country? If the President won't act to protect the American people \nfrom this law and its harmful effects, Congress should.\n  Last Friday a unified Republican House showed tremendous courage in \nenacting legislation, knowing full well what the media would say, what \nthe President would say, and what Democrats on both sides of the \nCapitol would say. Two hundred twenty-eight Republicans responded to \nthe will of the American people and overwhelmingly passed a bill that \nwould fund government and protect the country from ObamaCare. Only one \nparty has voted to fund the government. Only one party has voted to \navoid a government shutdown. Right now the ball is in the Senate's \ncourt.\n  Once the ball has reached the Senate, as has now happened, the Senate \ncan respond in one of several ways. Basically, I see three options on \nthe table, two of which are perfectly appropriate, one of which is \nunacceptable.\n  The first option would be for this body, under the leadership of our \nmajority leader, to take a vote on the House-passed continuing \nresolution--the House-passed continuing resolution that keeps \ngovernment funded but defunds ObamaCare--and to give that an up-or-down \nvote, to vote on that bill, as is, without any modification.\n  The second approach would be to open it for an open amendment \nprocess, to allow us to debate and discuss and consider amendments on \nthe House-passed bill as each individual Senator might deem appropriate \nfor this body to consider.\n  Both of these first two options are appropriate. Both of these first \ntwo options are understandable and acceptable under the totality of the \ncircumstances. Some might naturally lean toward the first option, \nmoving quickly to consideration of the House-passed bill in an as-is \ncondition, given the fact that we are T-minus 7 days and a few hours \nuntil the existing continuing resolution expires on midnight of next \nMonday night. We are a little over 7 days before that continuing \nresolution expires. So under those circumstances many of us might \nsuggest the best option might be to take that first approach, for the \nSenate to open this for a vote on the House-passed continuing \nresolution in as-is condition.\n  But if this body doesn't want to do that, if it wants to amend the \nHouse-passed continuing resolution, it would still be appropriate for \nus to have an amendment process. But that needs to be an open amendment \nprocess, one that is appropriate for this body--a body that many have \ndescribed as the world's greatest deliberative body. If in fact it is \ngreat and deliberative, if in fact we want to continue this tradition, \nthen we need to have an open amendment process when amendments are \nconsidered.\n  The third option I referred to, the option I would consider \nunacceptable, would be an option in which the majority leader would use \na procedural trick to allow the majority party to gut the House-passed \ncontinuing resolution, removing its single most significant provision \nwithout allowing even consideration of one single additional amendment. \nThis is not OK.\n  What I am saying is we need to either pass the bill as is--pass it or \ndon't pass it--or we need to open the amendment process so all Members \nof this body have the opportunity to introduce and vote on amendments \nas each individual Senator deems appropriate. Those are the only two \nacceptable options.\n  It would not be an acceptable option if the majority leader were to \ndecide to use a procedural trick to allow only one amendment--an \namendment that would gut the House-passed continuing resolution and \neffectively negate its single most distinguishing provision.\n  The question that leaves us with is that once this bill comes up in \nthis body, will we as Senators be courageous? Will we do the right \nthing for the American people or will Senate Democrats threaten to shut \ndown the government in order to protect an ill-conceived, unworkable, \nunaffordable, and fundamentally unfair law?\n  There is no doubt that many voices will say we can't win this fight, \nbut I am not so sure. Two months ago these same voices said we could \nnot and would not get this far. They said this effort would amount to \nbad politics. They said this simply would not work in the Congress as \nit exists in 2013. And they were wrong. They were wrong because what \nthe House of Representatives passed on Friday is what the American \npeople have been demanding, and they have been demanding it \noverwhelmingly. They have demanded that Congress act to keep the \ngovernment open and functioning while protecting the American people \nfrom the harmful, potentially devastating effects of ObamaCare. That is \nwhy I believe we can win.\n  The Senate majority may have the upper hand, but the American people \nwill and always must have the last word.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize volunteers doing \nextraordinary service to our country.\n\n[[Page S6681]]\n\nTwenty years ago, on September 21, President Clinton signed the \nNational and Community Service Trust Act of 1993, establishing the \nCorporation for National and Community Services and its three main \nprograms: AmeriCorps, Senior Corps, and Learn and Serve America.\n  In Illinois and across the Nation, volunteers of all ages and \nbackgrounds are stepping up to help others. More than 800,000 people \nhave served as AmeriCorps members since 1994, and more than 1 billion \nhours have been invested in improving lives and strengthening \ncommunities. In Illinois, 30,000 Illinois residents have served 37 \nmillion hours through AmeriCorps, qualifying for Segal AmeriCorps \nEducation awards of $93 million.\n  This year, more than 3,600 Illinoisans joined AmeriCorps to engage in \nresults-driven service that meet education, environmental, health, \neconomic, and other pressing needs in communities across our State. \nYoung men and women in AmeriCorps accept challenging assignments in \ntough towns and neighborhoods.\n  When the town of Joplin, MO, was devastated by a tornado in 2011, \nAmeriCorps members from Belleville, IL, helped with the recovery effort \nand with rebuilding the community. When low-income families are cash-\nstrapped and hungry during the holidays, members of AmeriCorps prepare \nfestive and nutritious meals at a community center in their \nneighborhood. Some volunteers have collected used children's books for \nunderserved preschool programs in southern Illinois communities. \nAmeriCorps members have provided tutors and mentors to strengthen \nliteracy programs in approximately 30 local grade schools.\n  These are a few examples of the service we see from AmeriCorps \nmembers. For their hard work, we pay them a few cents more than minimum \nwage and give them an educational grant to help fund their college \nexpense.\n  In 2009, President Barack Obama signed the Edward M. Kennedy Serve \nAmerica Act to expand AmeriCorps and volunteer opportunities in six key \nareas: disaster services, economic opportunity, education, \nenvironmental stewardship, healthy futures, and veterans and military \nfamilies. I was honored to join my colleagues in support of this \nlegislation and President Obama's national call to service.\n  These volunteer hours and this commitment can make a tremendous \ndifference in giving people some hope and in giving them the basics \nthat they need to survive. That volunteer spirit is part of America. It \nis an American value we cherish.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the hard work of these \nvolunteers as the AmeriCorps celebrates its 20th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/23/senate-section/article/S6681-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ENERGY SAVINGS AND INDUSTRIAL COMPETITIVENESS ACT\n\n\n                            Forest Products\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak \ntoday and offer some clarity about the treatment of wood products in \nthe amendment that Senator Wicker and Senator Landrieu have offered \nwith regard to green building standards. I commend Senator Wicker for \nhis hard work on this amendment, which will update the current EISA \nstatute to reflect the evolution of green building rating systems and \ncreate a more strategic approach for the Federal Government so that we \nhave the highest performing, most efficient, and most cost-effective \nbuildings while also taking advantage of an abundant domestic resource.\n  Mr. WICKER. The amendment I have introduced with Senator Landrieu \naddresses a number of issues that are important to America's forest \nproducts industry. In particular, the amendment specifies that the \nDepartment of Energy and the General Services Administration must allow \nthe use of multiple green building rating systems. A voluntary standard \nendorsed by the Federal Government can wield immense influence over \ngreen building specifications in the Federal sector and broader \ncommercial marketplace. DOE and GSA must support competition and allow \nthe free market to produce the best energy-efficient buildings at the \nlowest costs.\n  The intention of section 406(3)(G) of our amendment is to direct GSA \nand DOE to adopt a policy that provides equitable treatment to all \ndomestic sources of sustainable wood. It is simply unacceptable for the \nFederal Government to endorse a standard that discriminates against \ndomestically sourced, sustainable U.S. wood.\n  Wood is an ideal green building material because it is renewable, \nstores carbon, and is energy efficient. According to objective \ncriteria, the majority of the domestic wood products industry is \nsustainably managed and endorsed internationally. In addition, the \nforest products industry employs nearly 1 million men and women in \nwell-paying jobs, including more than 123,000 in my home State of \nMississippi. There is no reason to shut out the wood products being \nproduced in our own backyard in favor of imported substitutes. Our \nintention is to provide an equal playing field that keeps Mississippi \nwood--as well as wood from other states--a vital component of federal \ngreen building policy.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I agree with the Senator. We have a lot of hard-working \nAmericans who are employed by this industry, and we need to ensure that \nthere is a level playing field for them so that the Federal \nGovernment's green building policy doesn't stand in the way of bringing \nsustainably produced domestic wood to market. I would also emphasize \nthat wood is a vital component of sound architectural design and \nconstruction, in addition to being a renewable resource that sequesters \nhuge amounts of carbon. This amendment strengthens our bill by making \nclear that green building programs avoid discriminatory or arbitrary \nprovisions and ensuring that they consider environmental impacts across \nthe entire life cycle of a building material or product by \nincorporating Life Cycle Assessment.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank the Senator. We believe this amendment is a step \nforward to ensure GSA and DOE's green building policies support \ndomestically sourced wood. I look forward to working with the Senator \nand committee leadership as this legislation moves forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/23/senate-section/article/S6681-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/23/senate-section/article/S6681-3", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/23/senate-section/article/S6681-4", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 3102.

Res. 251\n\n       Whereas the United States Preventive Services Task Force \n     (referred to in this preamble as the ``USPSTF'') is an \n     independent panel of primary care physicians, not employed by \n     the Federal Government, who are experts in preventive and \n     evidence-based medicine;\n       Whereas the physicians on the USPSTF conduct scientific \n     evidence reviews of a broad range of clinical health care \n     preventive services and develop recommendations for primary \n     care clinicians and health systems;\n       Whereas prostate cancer is the second leading cause of \n     cancer-related deaths of men in the United States;\n       Whereas the National Cancer Institute estimates that, in \n     2013, 238,590 men will be diagnosed with, and 29,720 men will \n     die of, prostate cancer;\n       Whereas the National Cancer Institute estimates that 1 in 6 \n     men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his \n     lifetime;\n       Whereas family history has been shown to be a risk factor \n     for prostate cancer for men of all races and ethnicities, and \n     men with a family history of prostate cancer are twice as \n     likely to be diagnosed with the disease;\n       Whereas the USPSTF acknowledges that prostate cancer is the \n     most commonly diagnosed non-skin cancer for men in the United \n     States, with a lifetime risk for diagnosis estimated at 15.9 \n     percent;\n       Whereas the USPSTF acknowledges that African-American men \n     are twice as likely to die from prostate cancer than other \n     men in the United States;\n       Whereas the USPSTF does not have any members who are \n     urologists, a type of physician who specializes in diagnosing \n     and treating patients with prostate cancer;\n       Whereas the USPSTF does not have any members who are \n     oncologists, a type of physician who specializes in \n     diagnosing and treating patients with cancer;\n       Whereas the Food and Drug Administration first approved the \n     prostate-specific antigen (commonly referred to as ``PSA'') \n     blood test for prostate cancer screening and diagnosis in \n     1992 and, since that time, the mortality rate due to prostate \n     cancer has decreased by 40 percent;\n       Whereas, in August 2008, the USPSTF recommended against \n     prostate-specific antigen-based screening for prostate cancer \n     for men ages 75 and older, because the USPSTF determined that \n     there was insufficient evidence to assess the balance of \n     benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening in men \n     younger than age 75;\n       Whereas, in May 2012, the USPSTF issued a new \n     recommendation, to replace its 2008 recommendation, against \n     prostate-specific antigen-based screening for prostate cancer \n     for men in all age groups, because the USPSTF concluded that \n     there is moderate-to-high certainty that the test has no net \n     benefit, or that the harms outweigh the benefits, and \n     suggested that this screening practice be discouraged;\n       Whereas the May 2012 recommendation against screening \n     applies to all men in the United States, regardless of age;\n       Whereas the May 2012 recommendation against screening \n     applies to all men in the United States, regardless of race, \n     even though the USPSTF acknowledges that African-American men \n     have a substantially higher incidence rate for prostate \n     cancer than white men have and more than twice the mortality \n     rate from prostate cancer that white men have;\n       Whereas the May 2012 recommendation against screening \n     applies to all men in the United States, even though the \n     USPSTF acknowledges that there is convincing evidence that \n     prostate-specific antigen-based testing helps detect many \n     cases of asymptomatic prostate cancer; and\n       Whereas the USPSTF acknowledges that clinical decisions \n     regarding cancer screening\n\n[[Page S6685]]\n\n     involve multiple considerations and that clinicians should \n     individualize decision making to the specific patient or \n     situation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States Preventive Services Task Force \n     should--\n       (A) reevaluate its recommendation against prostate-specific \n     antigen-based screening for prostate cancer for men in all \n     age groups;\n       (B) seriously engage and consult with specialists, \n     including urologists and oncologists, as it reevaluates its \n     recommendation;\n       (C) identify areas for additional research and evaluation \n     of methods of treatment of, and screening procedures for, \n     prostate cancer;\n       (2) prostate cancer screening decisions should be made by \n     each individual patient and his physician, taking into \n     account the personal risk factors of the patient, such as his \n     overall health, age, race, family history, and life \n     expectancy, as well as his desire for eventual treatment if \n     he is diagnosed with prostate cancer; and\n       (3) steps should be taken to raise awareness of, and \n     increase public knowledge about, prostate cancer, the \n     benefits of early detection, and the appropriateness of \n     screening tests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/23/senate-section/article/S6685-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1964.
