As I have indicated, this evening we will vote on the \nmotion to proceed to the bipartisan USA FREEDOM Act, which reforms the \nU.S. Government's domestic surveillance authorities under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, as we have come to call it.\n  In 2013 the American public first learned that the Federal Government \ncollected telephone and Internet records of ordinary Americans--even \nwhen those Americans were not suspected of any wrongdoing. Earlier this \nyear Senator Leahy introduced the USA FREEDOM Act to end this bulk data \ncollection. This bill has the support of the entire U.S. intelligence \ncommunity, including the Director of National Intelligence, Gen. James \nClapper. It enhances privacy and civil liberties protections, and it \ncontinues to give the U.S. intelligence community the ability to gather \nthe information it needs to help keep America safe.\n  Two weeks ago the American people sent Congress a simple message: \nLet's work together. The USA FREEDOM Act is an excellent opportunity \nfor Democrats and Republicans to work together to pass legislation that \nis good for this country.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Pat Leahy, has done \ntremendous work in crafting this bill. I hope we will invoke cloture \ntoday to allow us to proceed to this matter. Chairman Leahy will manage \nthe bill on the Senate floor in what I hope will be an open, bipartisan \nprocess.\n  In working to craft this bipartisan legislation, I expect Senators on \nboth sides will want to offer amendments. Everyone should understand \nthat there is not going to be any effort to stop this by the procedural \navenue we call tree-filling. Instead, if we get on the legislation, the \nbill's managers will address amendments as they are offered. So I hope \nDemocrats and Republicans will be able to come to agreements for votes \non a number of amendments--hopefully a reasonable number or, of course, \nwe will have no alternative than to try to terminate that by trying to \nget cloture on the bill itself. I am optimistic that we can work \ntogether--I hope so--to forge a compromise and pass this essential \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/18/senate-section/article/S6027-7", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker).

Mr. President, the recent beheading of U.S. citizen \nPeter Kassig was the latest reminder of the brutal tactics employed by \nISIL, a murderous terrorist organization and insurgency that slaughters \nthe innocent and routinely employs suicide bombers and IEDs in its \ncampaign of terror.\n  The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant slaughtered Sunni tribe \nmembers in Anbar Province, executed prisoners, and captured key terrain \nin cities such as Mosul.\n\n[[Page S6028]]\n\n  Americans know ISIL is lethal, but it is also versatile. It has \nassociates and sympathizers in countries across the West, some self-\nradicalized on the Internet, including not only in Europe and Canada \nbut right here in the United States. The ISIL fighting force continues \nto grow more numerous--now numbering at least 20,000 strong--with its \nsuccess on the battlefield having drawn more extremists to the fight \nfrom many of the same places, including, again, right here in America.\n  At its core, ISIL includes many seasoned veterans who once fought \nunder the banner of Al Qaeda in Iraq and either survived the U.S. \nmilitary detention or el uded our military altogether during the years \nof Operation Iraqi Freedom. Many of these fighters are familiar with \nAmerica's intelligence capabilities, and many are savvy with \ncommunications. These are terrorists who know how to use encryption, \nand they know how to change devices frequently. That is part of the \nreason I am strongly opposed to legislation offered by the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee that would end one of the Nation's critical \ncapabilities to gather significant intelligence on terrorist threats. \nThis is the worst possible time to be tying our hands behind our backs.\n  The threat from ISIL is real. It is different from what we faced \nbefore. If we are going to overcome it, if our aim is to degrade and \ndestroy ISIL, as the President has said, then it is going to require \nsmart policies and firm determination. At a minimum, we should not be \ndoing anything to make the situation worse. Yet that is what this bill \nwould do.\n  Most damagingly, it would hinder the ability of intelligence \ncommunity analysts to query a database to determine links between \npotential terrorists. Instead, the Leahy bill would have this data be \nheld by telephone companies. It would make it far harder for records to \nbe gathered for a specific selection term. Under the Leahy bill, the \ntelephone companies would face no statutory requirement to even hold \nthe relevant data.\n  There is a legitimate debate to be had over the proper balance to \nstrike in our democracy. We continue to have that debate, and we \nshould. But the opponents of this collection program have not provided \nany examples--no examples--of the National Security Agency \nintentionally spying on innocent civilians--no examples of that. In \nfact, the NSA, the courts, and the Congress have put in place detailed \noversight procedures to protect both privacy and national security. \nMoreover, the only data captured under this program is the telephone \nnumber dialed--the telephone number dialed--the number from which the \ncall was made, and the length of the call. Under section 215 of the \nPATRIOT Act, the content of the call is not captured. So I think the \nprograms we have in place strike an appropriate balance between \nprotecting our civil liberties and keeping our Nation safe. I think the \nbill before us would upend that delicate balance completely.\n  What is more, legislation with such far-reaching effects should be \ngiven the closest possible scrutiny, but this bill was never even \nconsidered by the Judiciary Committee or the Intelligence Committee. So \nit is unclear why the majority leader is moving to it now rather than \ntaking up a bipartisan measure such as the FISA Improvements Act that \npassed the Intelligence Committee on a strong bipartisan vote of 11 to \n4.\n  With the current law not even expiring until next June, it is unclear \nwhy the majority leader wants to rush this untested bill through in \nthis lameduck session rather than after a reasonable consideration by \nrelevant committees and by the newly elected Members who will actually \nbe responsible for overseeing the program's operation.\n  The point is that the authorities we enacted after September 11, \n2001, which were crafted to ensure that we integrated intelligence \ngathered overseas and here in the United States, are acutely relevant \nright now. We live in a dangerous world. Threats such as ISIL only make \nit more so. At a moment when the United States is conducting a military \ncampaign to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat ISIL, now is certainly not \nthe time to be considering legislation that takes away the exact tools \nwe need to combat ISIL.\n  Our intelligence community is working to track foreign fighters \nreturning from fighting in Syria, to prevent others from traveling to \nthe battlefield, and to keep those within Syria from radicalizing their \nfriends and families back home. It makes little sense to pass \nlegislation that hinders our intelligence community--legislation that \nhas yet to receive any committee consideration.\n  On that note, today's Wall Street Journal features an excellent \nopinion piece offered by former Federal judge and Attorney General \nMichael Mukasey and Gen. Michael Hayden, the former Director of the CIA \nand the NSA. I recommend their column, ``NSA Reform That Only ISIS \nCould Love.'' I ask unanimous consent that a copy be printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 7, 2014]\n\n                  NSA Reform That Only ISIS Could Love\n\n             (By Michael V. Hayden and Michael B. Mukasey)\n\n       For those charged with gathering the information our \n     government needs to keep us safe, the news has been grim. \n     Following the leaks by Edward Snowden beginning in June last \n     year of highly classified intelligence gathering techniques, \n     the former head of the National Counterterrorism Center, \n     Matthew Olsen, disclosed in September that terrorists tracked \n     by U.S. intelligence services have started encrypting their \n     communications in ways that defeat detection, and that the \n     government has lost track of several.\n       Meanwhile, Islamic State terrorists continue to rampage \n     across Syria and Iraq, even as the group, also known as ISIS, \n     uses sophisticated Internet communications to swell its ranks \n     with recruits bearing U.S., Canadian or European passports \n     who can easily slip back into their native countries and \n     wreak havoc.\n       In that threat environment, one would think that the last \n     thing on the ``to do'' list of the 113th Congress would be to \n     add to the grim news. Yet Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid \n     has announced that he will bring to the floor the \n     extravagantly misnamed USA Freedom Act, a major new bill \n     exquisitely crafted to hobble the gathering of electronic \n     intelligence.\n       For starters, the bill ends the National Security Agency's \n     bulk collection of what is called telephone metadata. This \n     includes the date, time, duration and telephone numbers for \n     all calls, but not their content or the identity of the \n     caller or called, and is information already held by \n     telephone companies. The bill would substitute a cumbersome \n     and untried process that would require the NSA, when it seeks \n     to check on which telephone numbers have called or been \n     called by a number reasonably associated with terrorist \n     activity, to obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court, or FISA court, and then scurry to each of \n     the nation's telephone-service providers to comb through the \n     information that remains in their hands rather than in the \n     NSA's.\n       Nothing in the bill requires the telephone companies to \n     preserve the metadata for any prescribed period. Current \n     Federal Communications Commission regulations impose an 18-\n     month retention requirement, but administrative regulations \n     are subject to change. It isn't hard to envision companies \n     that wish to offer subscribers the attraction of rapid \n     destruction of these records, or a complaisant bureaucracy \n     that lets them do it.\n       The bill's imposition of the warrant requirement on the NSA \n     would be more burdensome than what any assistant U.S. \n     attorney must do to get metadata in a routine criminal case, \n     which is simply to aver that the information is needed in \n     connection with a criminal investigation--period.\n       Proponents say this change is necessary to allay fears that \n     the NSA could use telephone metadata to construct an \n     electronic portrait of an American citizen's communications, \n     and determine whether that person has, say, consulted a \n     psychiatrist, or called someone else's spouse. However, only \n     22 people at the NSA are permitted access to metadata, and \n     only upon a showing of relevance to a national-security \n     investigation, and they are barred from any data-mining \n     whatsoever even in connection with such an investigation. \n     They are overseen by a Madisonian trifecta of the FISA court, \n     the executive and committees of Congress. Those people and \n     everyone else at the NSA live in constant dread of failing to \n     detect a terrorist attack. Nonetheless, the sponsors of the \n     USA Freedom Act prefer the counsel of hypothetical fears to \n     the logic of concrete realities.\n       This sensitivity to abstract concerns doesn't stop at the \n     water's edge. Under the bill, if the FISA court directs any \n     change, however technical, in the gathering of information \n     from foreigners abroad, no information gathered before the \n     change is implemented could be used before any official body \n     in this country--agency, grand jury, court, whatever.\n       Back in the bad old days, as during World War II and the \n     Cold War, intelligence of all sorts directed at protecting \n     national security was gathered by the executive without \n     supervision by judges who, after all, know nothing about the \n     subject and cannot be held to account for adverse outcomes. \n     After the Watergate scandal and the resignation of\n\n[[Page S6029]]\n\n     President Nixon, the FISA court was established in 1978 to \n     provide oversight for intelligence gathering, in addition to \n     that already provided by the executive and by Congress. Now, \n     there are those who complain that the FISA court accedes too \n     often to requests for government access to information, and \n     does not appear to resemble a true court in that there is no \n     public advocate opposing the government position.\n       But the nearly uniform success of the government before the \n     FISA court is due both to the government's careful restraint \n     in presenting applications, and to pushback from the court \n     itself--which results in the amendment of applications. Even \n     when the government applies for wiretaps or search warrants \n     in ordinary criminal cases there is no advocate opposing the \n     application.\n       Nonetheless, this new bill would establish a permanent \n     advocate appointed by the court to oppose the government's \n     applications before the FISA court. This provision has \n     elicited an extraordinary written objection from a former \n     presiding judge of the FISA court. U.S. District Judge John \n     D. Bates points out that the presence of such an advocate, \n     who cannot conceivably be aware of all the facts, would \n     simply add to the burdens of the court and could wind up \n     sacrificing both national security and privacy.\n       This bill redefines the FISA court, which was never meant \n     to be an adversary tribunal and was imposed simply as an \n     added safeguard in the 1970s, without regard to its history \n     or its purpose. Worse, it is a three-headed constitutional \n     monster: It is a violation of both the separation of powers \n     principle and the Constitution's appointments clause by \n     having judges rather than the president appoint the public \n     advocate, and then it has the advocate litigate against the \n     Justice Department when both executive offices are supposed \n     to be controlled by the president.\n       The bill is not an unrelieved disaster. It rightly allows \n     for the expansion of metadata gathering to include more calls \n     made by cellphones.\n       Not surprisingly, the bill has received the endorsement of \n     President Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, and his \n     director of national intelligence, James Clapper, who in a \n     Sept. 2 letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee said they \n     were ``comfortable'' with the bill's provisions--even as they \n     conceded that the bill may have ``additional impacts that we \n     will be able to identify only after we start to implement the \n     new law.''\n       If that calls to mind the Affordable Care Act and the \n     suggestion that we should wait and find out what is in the \n     bill until after it passes, bear in mind that ``additional \n     impacts'' here may include holes in the ground where \n     buildings used to stand and empty chairs where people used to \n     sit.\n       There is no immediate or emergency need for this piece of \n     legislation. Current surveillance authorities do not expire \n     at the end of this year, which is fortunate given the current \n     threats we face at home and abroad. The USA Freedom Act \n     should await the attention of the Congress that will actually \n     oversee it. A change to national-security procedures is not \n     something to be rushed through in a lame-duck session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/18/senate-section/article/S6029-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. On an entirely different matter, later today the \nSenate will vote on whether to send Congressman Cassidy's Keystone jobs \nbill to the President. It is a vote that is long overdue but certainly \nwelcome. Keystone XL is just common sense. It is a shovel-ready jobs \nproject that would help thousands of Americans find work. It would \nincrease our supply of North American energy. It would do all of that \nwith minimal net climate impact. That is why the American people \nsupport it. That is why Republicans support it. That is why so many \nrank-and-file Democrats support it too.\n  I wish the Senate would have followed the lead of Congressman Cassidy \nand his House colleagues in approving Keystone years ago. It is just \ncommon sense. Those who took a serious look at the science and the \npotential benefits reached that conclusion long ago. They understand \nthat the whole drama over Keystone has been as protracted as it has \nbeen unnecessary. We hope to turn the page on all of that today.\n  The reason we are able to have this vote is because the American \npeople sent a strong message earlier this month. They told us they just \nwant Washington to get on with approving serious policies such as \nKeystone and then move on. That is why after years of delay and so many \nthwarted attempts to bring Keystone up for a vote, the Democratic \nleadership is finally, after 6 years, allowing us to vote on passage of \nthe Cassidy Keystone bill. That is a good thing. It is a step forward. \nNow it will be up to our friends on the other side to vote with us and \nactually pass the Cassidy Keystone bill through Congress.\n  The President's remarks opposing this bipartisan legislation are \ncertainly not helpful. Republicans are committed to getting Keystone \napproved. We want to see those jobs created as soon as possible. That \nis what the people want. The House already acted long ago, and \nCongressman Cassidy and his colleagues, such as Senator Hoeven, who is \nhere on the floor, deserve recognition for their years of hard work on \nthis issue.\n  So I would urge a ``yes'' vote on the legislation to send Congressman \nCassidy's Keystone bill to the President and create more American jobs. \nIf not, then a new majority, after the beginning of the year, will be \ntaking this matter up and sending it down to the President.\n  I also wish to take a moment to thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor his persistence on this issue for literally years.\n  Without his leadership I don't know where we would be. I just want to \nextend my gratitude to him for his great work on this matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Republican leader yield for a question?\n  The minority leader will not yield for a question, but I would note, \nbased on his concerns about the bipartisan piece of legislation \nregarding the NSA and others and his concern about ISIL--which we all \nshare--that the NSA and all of our intelligence community had every \nsingle tool the Republican leader advocates for, while ISIL built up \nits strength, while ISIL had Iraq's army flee from them while they went \nforward. With every single one of those elements the Republican leader \nadvocates for, there was not one single alarm bell that rang. So let's \ndeal with the facts and not hypotheses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/18/senate-section/article/S6029-2", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I just \nwanted that to be clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Today we vote on S. 2280, introduced by myself and \nSenator Landrieu. There are actually 54 sponsors on the legislation \nwith us. So we have a total of 56 sponsors of this bipartisan bill. \nThat is the same bill that has been passed in the House of \nRepresentatives. That was passed on Friday--the same version. The prime \nsponsor in the House was Representative Cassidy.\n  The bill we vote on today, S. 2280, is approval of the Keystone XL \nPipeline. We have actually passed legislation on the Keystone XL \nPipeline before. This is not the first bill. In 2012, we passed \nlegislation that required the President to make a decision on the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. We attached it to the payroll tax holiday. At \nthat time the President turned down the pipeline project.\n  So today we have submitted a number of different pieces of \nlegislation, but this legislation actually has Congress approving the \nKeystone XL Pipeline.\n  When the President turned down the project, what we did was we went \nback and we did the research.\n  Under the commerce clause of the Constitution, Congress has the \nauthority to oversee commerce with foreign powers, with other \ncountries.\n  So in this situation, Congress has the authority to approve the \nKeystone XL Pipeline crossing the border from Canada into the United \nStates, and that is\n\n[[Page S6030]]\n\nwhat we crafted in this legislation. So rather than the President \nmaking a national interest determination, which he seems to be \nunwilling to do--and I say that based on his actions--we have now been \nat this for about 4 years in this Senate trying to get approval. But \nthis project has been in the application process for 6 years.\n  I was Governor of North Dakota in September of 2008 when the \nTransCanada Corporation applied for a permit to get approval to build \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline. They had already built the Keystone pipeline, \nso they were applying for approval to build the sister pipeline, the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. It started in September of 2008, and 2 years went \nby. We started actually working on it in about 2011 in the Senate, as I \nsay, and we passed legislation, trying to get the President to approve \nit. But it has now been--and I can show a chart with the time line, but \nit is a little hard to see--6 years in the permitting process.\n  The time has come to act. The time has come to act, and that is what \nthis legislation is all about. It provides approval of the Keystone XL \nPipeline so they can move forward and it can be constructed.\n  We have debated this issue in the Chamber for almost 4 years. So we \nhave gone through all of the merits, and we will do that again today. \nWe have not only come to an agreement on getting a vote, but we have \nalso come to an agreement on the parameters for the debate. It is 6 \nhours of debate, with 3 hours for the proponents and 3 hours for the \nopponents.\n  On the Republican side of the aisle we are taking 2 hours solely on \nthe proponent side because all 45 Republican Senators are in support of \nthe project, will be voting for the project, and will be making the \ncase for the project. On the majority side there will be 3 hours for \nopponents of the project making their case and 1 hour for the \nproponents making their case, and we will alternate throughout this \ndebate.\n  We will be having this debate today and we will make our case. I will \ncontinue with my colleagues to make the case for the pipeline. There \nwill be Members of the majority party that will make that case and \nthere will be some Members, obviously, in opposition.\n  So I will reserve some of my time to speak later, but the point I \nwant to make at the outset is this is really about the American people \nmaking this case. When we look at this project, it is about energy, it \nis about jobs, it is about economic growth. It creates tax revenue to \nhelp reduce the deficit and the debt. It doesn't cost 1 penny of \nFederal money or government money. It is privately funded, and it is \nabout national security. It is about national security by helping us \nbuild energy security in this country with our closest friend and ally, \nCanada, working together with Canada so that we don't have to get \nenergy from Venezuela or from the Middle East or from other parts of \nthe world, and so we can produce at home.\n  That is not only a vitally important issue in terms of our economy \nand being competitive in a global economy because energy is truly a \nfoundational sector for all the other industry sectors. When we have \nlow-cost dependable energy, we are more competitive as a country, but \nit really is a national security issue.\n  I see the good Senator from Vermont is on the floor. He has a bill \nthat deals with how we handle surveillance and covert information, \ngiven the terrorist threat we face. It is important that we do that \nwell.\n  But one of the ways to truly strengthen our country is to make sure \nwe are energy secure, to make sure we don't have to get oil from the \nMiddle East, to help our friends and allies in Europe so they are not \ndependent on Russia for energy when Putin engages in the kind of \naggression he has. So when we talk about this energy issue, it is not \njust jobs, it is not just the energy we get that makes us stronger in a \ncompetitive global economy, it really is a national security issue, and \nit is long past time to act. It has been 6 years.\n\n  Today we will have that debate again, and I hope at the end of the \nday we will have the 60 votes that we need. We will find out this \nevening when we vote.\n  Again, it comes back to what do the American people want. We are here \nrepresenting the American people. Overwhelmingly, in poll after poll \nwhen they have been asked, 60 percent, sometimes 70 percent or more \nsay: Build the Keystone XL Pipeline. That is whom we work for.\n  I hope today, at the end of the day, that is the work we will get \ndone for the American people.\n  I see my cosponsor on the floor, and I would turn to the good Senator \nfrom Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank my cosponsor and lead sponsor on the bill, a \nformer Governor and good Senator from North Dakota who has been a great \nleader and partner with me on this bill.\n  As the American people have absolutely figured out, Democrats cannot \ndo anything alone and neither can Republicans. It has taken us a while \nto figure this out in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, \nbut the American people figured this out a long time ago, just as they \nfigure out practical things such as how to keep a roof over their \nheads, food on the table, and how to keep their kids moving forward \neven through difficulty.\n  The American people are very smart. I trust them. I always have. I \nhave been honored to represent the people of Louisiana, 4.5 million \npeople, and I have done my very best to represent them in the time I am \nin the Senate, and I hope to continue for years to come.\n  One of the things they know that is not clear to people here is that \nit takes both parties working together, compromising, to get the job \ndone for them--not for us, for them--and I think we forget that a lot.\n  I am in a lot of meetings around here where people talk about what is \ngood for the Democratic caucus, what is good for the Republican caucus, \nwhat is good for Leader Reid, what is good for Leader McConnell. It is \nkind of interesting to me because the family I grew up in was all about \npublic service--not for ourselves but for the people we represent. That \nis why I am on the floor today. That is why I have actually been on the \nfloor dozens of times on this bill and on similar bills.\n  This is the Keystone bill, which I have supported with Senator \nHoeven, literally for years. In fact, I have a letter from 2011 with \nOrrin Hatch, who was the lead signer with me. Senator McConnell's \nsignature wasn't on the letter. Maybe he was busy that day and couldn't \nsign it. But about 15 of us sent a letter in 2011 urging Secretary of \nState Clinton--this is how far back it goes, and people can hardly \nremember she was Secretary of State because now John Kerry is Secretary \nof State--a long time ago saying it was very important for us to get \nthis pipeline built for any number of reasons. The main reason is that \nit will signal a great sign that America understands that energy \nindependence for our Nation is possible for the first time ever.\n  When I mean energy independence, I mean energy independence for the \nNorth American continent. We might be able to do it in just the lower \n48. We might. Hawaii can contribute some. Alaska, clearly, can \ncontribute a lot. So we might be able to do it in the 50 States.\n  But I know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that with our partners in \nCanada and Mexico, this can be done and North America can be the super \nenergy powerhouse of the planet.\n  Why is that important? There are so many reasons. I will name two, \nand then I am going to sit down and reengage in this debate because \nBarbara Boxer, who is the lead opponent, wants and has indicated her \ntime on the floor, and I have more time later today.\n  But one of the reasons this is so important is because what people in \nLouisiana want, what people in Texas want, what people in Mississippi \nwant, what people in New Jersey want, what people in South Dakota, \nIllinois, Kansas, and Vermont want are good-paying jobs.\n  When a country or a continent, as blessed as we are, uses its \nresources wisely to create wealth not only for those at the top, which \nis what is happening now--just at the top--and the people at the top \nare doing great. In the fancy restaurants I walk by I see--and \nsometimes I am actually in them myself--people are drinking champagne. \nThey are buying new cars. I see\n\n[[Page S6031]]\n\nMercedes, and other people see that. But the people in the middle class \nin this country are really struggling, and our job as leaders is to \nhave our eyes on them, providing for them.\n\n  These energy jobs are not minimum wage jobs. They are not even $15-\nan-hour jobs. They are not even $30-an-hour jobs. They are $45-an-hour \njobs. Our laborers--men and women who represent the middle class--some \nare unionized, some are not, but all are hard working. I am going to \nsay that again. Some are unionized and some are not, but all are hard \nworking.\n  How would I know? Because I have stood in line with them at 4 or 5 in \nthe morning during a shift change. I do that a lot during my elections. \nI do it regularly, but I do it a lot during election time. I have felt \ntheir hands. I know how cold they are in the morning and how rough they \nare because they work all day. Those people would expect us to work \nlonger than we do here. We have very short weeks--Tuesday through \nThursday. We take long lunch hours, long weekends. Most Americans think \nwe have completely lost it because they work hard, from morning until \nnight. Their hands are tough, and so they expect us to stand up for \nthem. That is why I am standing here.\n  I have been fighting for this because of energy independence for \nAmerica. I would know something about that because Texas and Louisiana \nand Oklahoma--our area of the country--we are proud producers of \nenergy. We produce mostly oil, mostly gas, and a little bit of coal. We \ngenerate a lot.\n  Just an FYI to everybody who thinks this pipeline is the end of the \nworld, we already have 2.6 million miles of pipe in America--2.6 \nmillion miles of pipe. We are only completing basically 1,000 miles. \nWhat is everybody upset about? We have been building pipelines in this \ncountry for a long time, and we need to build this one. This is about \nenergy independence, it is about jobs, and that is why I am here. This \nis what the people want.\n  I am going to close with this. For the 25th time at least I am going \nto say this because I want the record of the Congress to reflect the \ntruth, whether people acknowledge it or not. The record of this \nCongress will reflect this to be the truth. Some of us, not just me, \nhave worked to get this bill to the floor for years, and it was blocked \nby both majority leader Harry Reid and minority leader Mitch McConnell \nfor their own political reasons. Those reasons cleared up after the \nelection. They just cleared up.\n  Mitch McConnell couldn't bring this bill to the floor without \nallowing a vote on the EPA coal regulation. Barbara Boxer knows this--\nthis is the truth--and she wouldn't allow the vote because she is \nadamantly opposed to having a vote on EPA. I respect that. I respect \nher. Everyone here knows that is the truth.\n  Harry Reid didn't want this vote to come up because there were one or \ntwo Members of our caucus who had a serious issue with this being voted \non. I knew that. As part of a team--and I try to be part of a team, but \nI am independent--I knew the results of the election, with Senator \nMcConnell winning and some of our Senators, unfortunately, my dearest \nfriends, losing, that we had an opportunity, and so I took that \nopportunity and I called for this vote--not Harry Reid, not Mitch \nMcConnell, I called for it, and I think it is worth fighting for.\n  The last thing I want to say is that Thanksgiving is coming up and \nChristmas is coming up, and it is a shame this Congress has not \ndelivered more in the last 5 or 6 years for the middle class. We say we \ntry. I am not sure we are trying hard enough. So I am going to lead by \nexample. It is the way I was raised. We are going to truly try today.\n  This is one of the first debates I have been in, in 8 years at least, \nwhere the outcome is uncertain. All the rest of the stuff we do here is \npreset, preordained. It is similar to theater for the American people. \nWe usually know the outcome of the vote before we take it because the \ndeals are all cut.\n  So I brought this bill to the floor, knowing in my heart we have 60 \nvotes. I sure hope we have the courage that supports that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will be controlling the time in \nopposition, very strong opposition, to this legislation. Before I yield \nto the first debater on our side, who will be Chairman Leahy--and I am \nvery honored that he will be--let me just say before Senator Landrieu \nleaves the floor that Senator Landrieu is the only reason we are \ndebating this today. So anyone who wants to play games about this and \nname this bill the Cassidy bill, that kind of is a joke because I \nbelieve I am correct that he introduced it November 12 of this year and \nthe Hoeven-Landrieu bill was introduced in May. But setting politics \naside, let the Record be clear forever that this debate would not be \nbefore this body were it not for Senator Landrieu's insistence. I want \nthat to be clear.\n  Secondly, we will hear today, I think, a terrific debate because the \npeople who support this think not only that this is a good thing for \nthe country--to build the Keystone XL Pipeline--they think it is a \ngreat thing for this country. I have great respect for them. On the \nother side, we have those of us who think it is not a good thing for \nthis country, it is not a good thing for jobs, it is not a good thing \nfor energy independence because it will be exported, all that oil, and \nit is actually dangerous.\n  In my case, I was thinking, what does ``XL'' stand for? They named it \nthe Keystone XL. It has no meaning, but to me it is extra lethal. My \ndebate will show why, as we analyze the tar sands oil that will be \ncoming into this Nation, 45 percent more than we have now, the risky \nbusiness that it has proven to be and what the health costs are for our \npeople. That is not me speaking, those are nurses and doctors saying \nso. I haven't even gotten into climate and all the other issues.\n  At this point I yield 5 minutes to my friend Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana has the majority of votes in this body for the Keystone \nPipeline, and that is a compliment to her hard work in getting from a \nminority of votes to a majority of votes.\n  I will not be one of them, as she knows, because I represent what is \nthe view of my fellow constituents in Vermont. I strongly oppose the \nfast-tracking of this process.\n  This pipeline poses considerable safety and environmental risks here \nin the United States, and it threatens the natural landscapes that are \nin the heartland of America. We feel this pipeline is one of the most \nstriking examples of the unquenchable thirst for oil that is destroying \nour environment. We feel that destruction is going to move forward \nunless and until we get a comprehensive national energy plan. This \npipeline will not lead us towards that. It leads us to an energy policy \nof the past instead of a sustainable energy future, while \nsimultaneously accelerating our impact on the climate. These tar sands \nrequire an energy-intensive process, complete with pollutants and \nharmful emissions to get them out of the ground, to extract them, and \nto refine them.\n  We should not rubberstamp a project like this that poses such serious \nrisks to the Nation's and the world's environment, and to our \ncommunities' safety. I was astounded by the fact that in its first year \nof operation the existing Keystone Pipeline--billed as you recall as \nthe safest pipeline in history when it was built just a few years ago \nin 2010--spilled 12 times in its first year of operation. That is more \nthan any other pipeline in U.S. history.\n  The worrisome part about these spills is that tar sands oil is harder \nto clean up. Ask the communities along the Kalamazoo River in Michigan. \nIt has cost more than $1 billion so far--$1 billion so far--to clean up \na tar sands spill in 2010. Now, more than 4 years later, it is still a \nmess, and landowners continue to wait for help in restoring their \nproperty and to rebuild the ravaged pipeline.\n  We do not need more empty assurances from the oil industry. Before \nthe Valdez spill in Alaska, Exxon executives told us their oil tankers \nwere safe. We heard similar promises from BP, which insisted that it \ncould handle an oil spill in a deep-water drilling operation. The \nimages from both of those spills are still fresh in our memories.\n  I realize that proponents argue that this pipeline will create jobs \nand will\n\n[[Page S6032]]\n\nhelp our energy security here in the United States. But this pipeline \nwill bypass refineries in the Midwest instead of heading to American \ngas stations to help lower the price of gas here at home. It will head \nstraight for the coast so the oil can be used in export markets, pumped \nonto ships headed for China. That may be good news for the Chinese, but \nit is not good news for the American people who are stuck with the \nsafety risks, the health challenges, future environmental disasters, \nand the rapid acceleration of our contribution to climate change.\n\n  These facts are clear: The Keystone pipeline significantly worsens \nthe problem of carbon pollution, and it is not in our national \ninterest. The Presidential Permit should be denied, not fast-tracked by \nCongress here today.\n  So I will not be among the majority who will vote for it today.\n\n\n                            USA Freedom Act\n\n  On another matter, while I have the floor, the distinguished \nRepublican leader spoke against the USA FREEDOM Act earlier this \nmorning. Unfortunately, he was too busy to respond to a couple of \nsimple questions, even though he was asked to. But I would note that \nlast year, Americans learned that section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act \nhad been secretly interpreted for years to allow the bulk collection of \ntelephone records. Unlike the comments made earlier that there were no \nhearings on this, the USA FREEDOM Act of 2014 came about after numerous \ncongressional hearings, including six--six--public hearings in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  At least two panels of independent experts have concluded that the \nbulk collection program has not been essential or even a key part of \nkeeping our country safe. We now have wide bipartisan agreement in the \nSenate and the House that the bulk phone records collection program is \nnot essential, it violates Americans' privacy, and it has to end. So \nthe question before Congress is not whether to end the program, but \nwhen and how.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act of 2014 ends the NSA's bulk collection program, \nbut does so responsibly. The bill contains key reforms to safeguard \nAmericans' privacy by prohibiting the indiscriminate collection of \ntheir data. It also provides for greater accountability and \ntransparency of the government's surveillance programs, and it improves \nthe FISA Court. The bill also ensures that the intelligence community \nhas the tools it needs to keep our country safe.\n  This legislation is the result of several months of intense \ndiscussions and deliberations with the intelligence community and \nstakeholders across the political and economic spectrum. It has the \nunprecedented support of the Director of National Intelligence, the \nAttorney General, American technology companies, and privacy and civil \nliberty groups ranging from the ACLU and EEF to the NRA and \nTechFreedom, as well as the Director of NSA and lawmakers from all \nparts of the political spectrum who support it.\n  We cannot afford to delay action on these reforms any longer, as the \nAmerican people continue to demand stronger protections for their \nprivacy. Unfortunately, some would rather use scare tactics than \nlegislate. Some would have us wait while American businesses continue \nto lose tens of billions of dollars in the international marketplace. \nOr we could even wait until we are facing down the expiration of \nSection 215 in a matter of months, thereby creating dangerous \nuncertainty and risk for the intelligence community.\n  The American people have had enough delay; they want action and real \nreform. It is time to get back to work, to show leadership, and to \ngovern this country responsibly. The USA FREEDOM Act of 2014 is an \nopportunity to do just that.\n  Let us get it done now, when it can be done.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nseveral letters and editorials in support of the USA FREEDOM Act of \n2014.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Office of the Director of National Intelligence, \n           Department of Justice,\n                                Washington, DC, September 2, 2014.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: Thank you for your letter of August \n     19, 2014, asking for the views of the Department of Justice \n     and the Intelligence Community on S. 2685, the USA FREEDOM \n     Act. We appreciate your extensive efforts to develop a bill \n     in coordination with the Administration, privacy and civil \n     liberties advocates, and representatives from the \n     communications providers that builds upon the good work done \n     by the House in its bill passed on May 22, 2014. As discussed \n     below, the Intelligence Community believes that your bill \n     preserves essential Intelligence Community capabilities; and \n     the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director of \n     National Intelligence support your bill and believe that it \n     is a reasonable compromise that enhances privacy and civil \n     liberties and increases transparency.\n       The USA FREEDOM Act bans bulk collection under a variety of \n     authorities. In particular, the bill permits collection under \n     Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act using a specific selection \n     term that narrowly limits the scope of the tangible things \n     sought to the greatest extent reasonably practicable, \n     consistent with the purposes for seeking the tangible things. \n     Recognizing that the terms enumerated in the statute may not \n     always meet operational needs, the bill permits the use of \n     other terms, provided there are court-approved minimization \n     procedures that prohibit the dissemination and require the \n     destruction within a reasonable period of time of any \n     information that has not been determined to satisfy certain \n     specific requirements. We believe that this approach will \n     accommodate operational needs while providing appropriate \n     privacy protections.\n       The bill also provides a mechanism to obtain telephone \n     metadata records in order to identify potential contacts of \n     suspected terrorists inside the United States. The \n     Intelligence Community believes that, based on communications \n     providers' existing practices in retaining metadata, the bill \n     will retain the essential operational capabilities of the \n     existing bulk telephone metadata program while eliminating \n     bulk collection.\n       The bill also increases transparency by expanding the \n     amount of information communications providers can disclose \n     and increasing public reporting by the government. Although \n     balancing national security and the public's legitimate \n     interest in additional transparency can be difficult, we are \n     comfortable with the transparency provisions in this bill \n     because, among other things, they recognize the technical \n     limitations on our ability to report certain types of \n     information.\n       We note that, consistent with the President's request, the \n     bill establishes a process for the appointment of an amicus \n     curiae to assist the FISA Court and FISA Court of Review in \n     matters that present a novel or significant interpretation of \n     the law. We believe that the appointment of an amicus in \n     selected cases, as appropriate, need not interfere with \n     important aspects of the FISA process, including the process \n     of ex parte consultation between the Court and the \n     government. We are also aware of the concerns that the \n     Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts expressed in a \n     recent letter, and we look forward to working with you and \n     your colleagues to address those concerns.\n       The USA FREEDOM Act represents the result of extensive \n     discussions and deliberations and has the support of a wide \n     range of interests. Admittedly, it is possible that there are \n     additional impacts that we will be able to identify only \n     after we start to implement the new law. You have our \n     commitment to notify Congress if we determine that the new \n     law is impeding the Intelligence Community's ability to \n     protect national security. Overall, the bill's significant \n     reforms should provide the public greater confidence in our \n     programs and the checks and balances in the system.\n           Sincerely,\n     Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n       Attorney General.\n     James R. Clapper,\n       Director of National Intelligence.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Reform Government Surveillance\n\n       Open Letter to the Senate: The Senate has an opportunity \n     this week to vote on the bipartisan USA Freedom Act. We urge \n     you to pass the bill, which both protects national security \n     and reaffirms America's commitment to the freedoms we all \n     cherish.\n       The legislation prevents the bulk collection of Internet \n     metadata under various authorities. The bill also allows for \n     transparency about government demands for user information \n     from technology companies, and assures that the appropriate \n     oversight and accountability mechanisms are in place.\n       Since forming the Reform Government Surveillance coalition \n     last year, our companies have continued to invest in \n     strengthening the security of our services and increasing \n     transparency. Now, the Senate has the opportunity to send a \n     strong message of change to the world and encourage other \n     countries to adopt similar protections.\n       Passing the USA Freedom Act, however, does not mean our \n     work is finished. We will continue to work with Congress, the \n     Administration, civil liberties groups and governments around \n     the world to advance essential reforms that we set forth in a \n     set of principles last year. Such reforms include: preventing \n     government access to data without proper legal process; \n     assuring that providers\n\n[[Page S6033]]\n\n     are not required to locate infrastructure within a country's \n     border; promoting the free flow of data across borders; and \n     avoiding conflicts among nations through robust, principled, \n     and transparent frameworks that govern lawful requests for \n     data across jurisdictions.\n       Now is the time to move forward on meaningful change to our \n     surveillance programs. We encourage you to support the USA \n     Freedom Act.\n         AOL, Apple, Dropbox, Evernote, Facebook, Google, \n           LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter, Yahoo.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                November 14, 2014.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Grassley: The USA Freedom Act, now \n     under consideration in the Senate, is broadly consistent with \n     the recommendatins we made last year in our report on how to \n     safeguard both liberty and security in a rapidly changing \n     world.\n       Specifically, we note the close similarity of the bill with \n     our first recommendation, that orders under Section 215 \n     should be issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Court about particular individuals and only where there are \n     reasonable grounds to believe that the particular information \n     sought is relevant to an authorized investigation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard Clarke,\n     Michael Morell,\n     Cass Sunstein,\n     Geoffrey Stone,\n     Peter Swire.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Nov. 14, 2014]\n\n             Bipartisanship in Defense of the Constitution\n\n\n     Reining in the NSA is something that all Americans can embrace\n\n                    (By Chris Cox and Laura Murphy)\n\n       Washington politicians are squaring off for another round \n     of confrontation following an election in which millions of \n     American voters demanded an end to the squabbling and a \n     commitment to actually solving the many problems facing the \n     country. There are, of course, issues on which agreement \n     shouldn't be expected, but there are others on which there \n     should be broad agreement, regardless of party and ideology.\n       As representatives of two organizations, the National Rifle \n     Association (NRA) and the American Civil Liberties Union \n     (ACLU), with very different perspectives on some issues, we \n     are joining together today because of our belief in the \n     constitutional guarantees of free speech and privacy and our \n     concern that both could be lost unless we rein in \n     governmental surveillance and monitoring that characterizes \n     life in this country.\n       The NRA last year joined the ACLU in court proceedings \n     aimed at limiting the surveillance of private citizens in the \n     name of national security. While we agree that government \n     should have the power it needs to protect the American people \n     from terrorist threats, those charged with doing so must be \n     accountable and play by the rules set down by the Founders in \n     the Constitution and its Bill of Rights.\n       Our lawsuit involved the National Security Agency's program \n     to collect what the government likes to call ``metadata,'' \n     including records of phone calls made by every single \n     American. That data can paint an intimate portrait of \n     someone's life--who they talk to, the organizations they \n     support and who their friends are. However, that same \n     information can be used to target innocent Americans involved \n     in perfectly legal activities that our government doesn't \n     happen to like.\n       For example, by using metadata, the government can identify \n     and track most gun owners by tracing contacts with gun \n     ranges, firearms retailers and the like, facilitating the \n     establishment of the national firearms registry that gun \n     owners fear and federal law prohibits. It can also be used by \n     government officials to get information on journalists or any \n     activists that are critical of government policies.\n       In our view, current surveillance practices violate the \n     First and Fourth Amendments and threaten other rights, such \n     as those guaranteed by the Second Amendment, and they are not \n     making us any safer. President Obama's own review panel and \n     the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board have found \n     that these call-records programs have not provided any \n     crucial information in even one terrorism case. Even James R. \n     Clapper, the nation's director of national intelligence, \n     supports legislation known as the USA Freedom Act, a modest \n     reform proposal that brings current practices more in line \n     with what the Constitution requires.\n       While there is much the Senate shouldn't or needn't do \n     during the ``lame-duck'' session, the USA Freedom Act is \n     badly needed legislation that has bipartisan support and will \n     protect the rights of all Americans. The NRA and the ACLU, \n     along with many members of Congress from both parties, \n     support these reforms and they should be enacted, without \n     weakening amendments, by the Senate and sent to the White \n     House as soon as possible.\n       Public frustration with Congress is heightened when \n     essential and widely supported legislation such as the USA \n     Freedom Act languishes and dies for reasons that defy common \n     sense. It's happened before. After all the rhetoric and after \n     the case is made, nothing happens. If the Senate can't pass \n     and the president can't sign a widely supported package of \n     reforms to protect the basic constitutional rights of the \n     American people, is it any wonder that Americans of both \n     parties conclude that Washington is simply dysfunctional?\n       Every day that the Senate fails to vote on these reforms is \n     a day in which law-abiding citizens have reason to fear that \n     the constitutional protections so dear to the Founders and so \n     crucial to the functioning of a free society no longer apply. \n     That is a fear the Senate can begin to correct by passing the \n     USA Freedom Act before the end of this year.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 17, 2014]\n\n   The Senate Should Approve a Bipartisan Proposal to Reform the NSA\n\n                              (Editorial)\n\n       The Senate is set to vote Tuesday on the USA Freedom Act, \n     the most promising National Security Agency reform proposal \n     before Congress. Neither national security hawks nor civil \n     libertarians get everything they want from the legislation, \n     which means it could fail to get the 60 votes it needs to \n     advance, or it could get pulled too far in one direction or \n     another during an open amendment process after that. Either \n     road to demise would be unfortunate: The bill deserves to be \n     approved, reconciled with a House-approved version and sent \n     to President Obama.\n       The headline of the Senate's bill, sponsored by a varied \n     group of Democrats and Republicans with Sen. Patrick Leahy \n     (D-Vt.) in the lead, is that it would end the government's \n     bulk collection of so-called metadata--phone calling records, \n     for example. In its place, the bill would give the government \n     authority to demand calling records from phone companies in \n     specific cases, if the collection is ``narrowly'' limited. \n     Even then, the government would have to discard information \n     lacking bona-fide intelligence value, and its metadata \n     collection operations would be subject to more oversight.\n       That's fine, but bulk metadata collection is not the most \n     important issue the bill addresses. The act would bring \n     change to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which \n     helps oversee the NSA's activities. The court, which \n     generally hears only the government's side of any issue, \n     would get balance from a panel of advocates tasked with \n     arguing for civil liberties when the judges are considering \n     important questions of law. The proposal also foresees \n     appeals courts reconsidering more FISA cases, and the bill \n     would press for major court decisions to be released.\n       The bill would enable a more orderly and informed debate on \n     NSA activities as well. It would require the government to \n     release much more information on how much it is using various \n     authorities and, crucially, on how many people's information \n     it has swept up in the process. It also harmonizes the \n     expiration of many surveillance authorities. Americans, then, \n     would have more information to assess surveillance activities \n     and a single date on which surveillance policy will be up for \n     debate.\n       Technology companies have come out strongly in favor of the \n     plan, as have many--though not all--civil liberties \n     advocates. So, too, has the Obama administration. Though the \n     intelligence community would have to change its behavior--\n     significantly in certain programs--it would get clear legal \n     authorities that it wants and an extended expiration timeline \n     for some of them. It would also maintain its core, foreign-\n     focused surveillance authorities without much change. Therein \n     lies the bill's careful balance. As the Senate works on the \n     proposal over the coming days, it should preserve that \n     delicate and authentic compromise.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 17, 2014]\n\n                A Crucial Vote on the Surveillance Bill\n\n                              (Editorial)\n\n       The Republican Party is so badly fractured that it is \n     impossible to tell what steps it will take on domestic \n     surveillance once it assumes control of Congress in January. \n     Its rising libertarian wing wants to crack down on abuses of \n     Americans' privacy, but many of its leaders express full \n     support for any action the intelligence agencies want to \n     take.\n       That's why it's important that the Senate break a \n     filibuster on the USA Freedom Act, which would reduce or end \n     the bulk collection of telephone records, in a vote scheduled \n     for Tuesday afternoon. If the bill doesn't pass in the \n     current lame-duck session of the Senate, still controlled by \n     Democrats, it may never get past the 60-vote hurdle in the \n     next session of Congress.\n       The bill, sponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of \n     Vermont, would require the National Security Agency to ask \n     phone companies for the records of a specific person or \n     address when it is searching for terrorists, instead of \n     scooping up all the records in an area code or city. It would \n     force the agency to show why it needs those records, and to \n     disclose how much data is being collecting.\n       The bill would also create a panel of advocates to support \n     privacy rights and civil liberties in arguments before the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court; currently, there is \n     no one to offer opposition to government requests before the \n     court. The government would have to issue clear summaries of \n     the court's most significant rulings.\n\n[[Page S6034]]\n\n       Not every potential surveillance abuse is addressed in the \n     measure. For example, it leaves open the possibility of \n     ``backdoor'' searches of American data that investigators \n     come across when searching for the communications of \n     foreigners. It exempts the F.B.I. from transparency on \n     searches. And it is not clear whether the government believes \n     there is some other hidden legal authority for bulk \n     collection other than the one addressed in the USA Freedom \n     Act.\n       Nonetheless, the bill is a good way to begin restoring \n     individual privacy that has been systematically violated by \n     government spying, revealed through the leaks provided by \n     Edward Snowden. It has been supported by the American Civil \n     Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and \n     other privacy watchdogs. On Sunday, a group of the biggest \n     technology companies--including Google, Microsoft, Facebook \n     and Twitter--endorsed the bill because it allows more \n     disclosure of the demands for information made of them by the \n     government.\n       In addition to Senate Democrats, the bill is supported by \n     some hard-right Republicans, including Ted Cruz of Texas and \n     Mike Lee of Utah. But Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who will \n     soon be the Senate majority leader, has supported the \n     N.S.A.'s spying on Americans. That's a good a reason to pass \n     it before a new Senate can water it down.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor, and I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom California for giving me this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee for his remarks. They mean a lot.\n  I want to put this vote into perspective. This is a major decision. \nPeople sometimes say: Oh, what is the big deal. It is a little \npipeline. We build pipelines all the time. Well, it is a major \ndecision, and I know each of us, regardless of our party, before we \ncast a major vote, thinks about whether our vote is going to make life \nbetter for our people we represent, the people who send us here and who \ncount on us every day. I am going to do everything in my power to make \nthe case that building the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline is going to \nmake life worse for the people we represent and those generations to \nfollow because I think I will prove today that misery follows the tar \nsands.\n  I said before it is called Keystone XL--extra lethal--not extra large \nbut extra lethal. Senators should ask themselves three questions before \nthey cast their vote on the Hoeven-Landrieu bill. First, why does it \nmake any sense for the Senate to force the approval of a project that \nwill bring millions of barrels of the dirtiest pollution you could \nthink of into America? Why do we want to bring barrels of filthy, \ndirty, dangerous pollution into America? This isn't an ordinary \npipeline. This pipeline is carrying tar sands oil, which is, in fact, \nthe most polluting kind of oil and I am going to tell you why. This \nisn't hyperbole.\n\n  Tar sands oil contains levels of toxic pollutants and metals that are \nmuch higher than conventional crude oil. I want to make this case. \nPresident Obama said when he became President that he would do \neverything in his power to make us energy efficient and to make us \nenergy independent, and he has worked on both fronts. We have seen a \ntremendous rise in domestic oil production. It is not tar sands oil. It \nis not filthy oil. Conventional crude oil is different than the tar \nsands. The tar sands have 11 times more sulfur and nickel, 6 times more \nnitrogen, and 5 times more lead. Let me say that again.\n  Before we invite a 45-percent increase in this filthy, dirty oil, \nlet's take a look at what this tar sands is. It has got more sulfur and \nnickel and nitrogen and more lead.\n  I know my colleague who is sitting in the chair cares deeply about \nenvironmental justice, and in the course of my presentation I am going \nto show what happens in places such as Port Arthur, TX, in minority \ncommunities when this oil is refined. We can show that photograph now.\n  What I am trying to impress on the body today is I am proving the \npoint that I am making. The facts are the facts are the facts. This is \nwhat it looks like in Port Arthur, TX. This is what the kids have to \nput up with. Here is a playground in a low-income community, and I had \nthe activists from Port Arthur, TX, here saying, please, please, \nplease, protect us from this oil.\n  Now these dangerous pollutants I cited and these metals can be very \nharmful to human health. Sulfur dioxide penetrates deeply into \nsensitive parts of the lungs and it causes respiratory diseases such as \nemphysema and bronchitis. You will not hear a word about that from the \nproponents, but this needs to be looked at. This is why I stood with \nthe nurses, that is why I stood with the public health doctors, to say \ntime out for a minute here.\n  What are we doing to our people that we are saying we are helping \nwith the tar sands?\n  It aggravates heart disease, leading to increased toxic emissions and \npremature death. Nitrogen dioxide increases symptoms in people with \nasthma. When I go to the various schools in my State, I ask the kids: \nHow many of you have asthma or how many of you know someone who has \nasthma? Almost half the class raises their hands, if not more.\n  Tar sands will exacerbate that problem. We know how dangerous lead \nis, how long it took us to get lead out of paint. It adversely affects \nthe nervous system, the kidney function, the immune system, the \ncardiovascular system. Misery follows the tar sands. The Keystone XL--\nextra lethal--pipeline.\n  We are talking about huge quantities coming through this pipeline--\n830,000 barrels of filthy tar sands oil coming across the Canadian \nborder heading down to our gulf coast region every single day--again, a \n45-percent increase in the tar sands oil, a 45-percent increase in \nthose heavy metals and those dangerous pollutants. This project could \nbe just the beginning.\n  We already know again, misery follows the tar sands from the \nextraction to the transportation to the refining to the waste disposal.\n  Let me show you a picture of petcoke, petroleum coke.\n  Again, it is an environmental justice question, because what we have \nis what is left after the refining, and it gets sent all across the \ncountry. This is a picture of petcoke piles in Chicago. Senator Durbin \nis going to talk more about this. This is a serious environmental \nhazard. The poison that is in this residue in a windstorm just blows \naround and we have stories in the press in Chicago of a Little League \ngame being interrupted because the petcoke was blowing all over the \nfield, and the kids were getting pitch black with the petcoke.\n  So, yes, I have stood with doctors and nurses and people in these \ncommunities who have faced harm along each step of the tar sands oil \nprocess. These are cancer-causing pollutants. So when somebody tells \nyou: Oh, this is nothing. This is a pipeline. We have a lot of \npipelines. This is nothing. No big deal. Why are you fighting? Why are \nyou standing up here? Why did I demand 3 hours of time in opposition? \nBecause this is a dangerous project.\n  Why should we vote to force the approval of a project that would \nbring this dirty, polluted tar sands into the United States when we \nknow it is the most difficult type of oil to clean up in case of a \nspill?\n  According to the EPA, tar sands oil creates especially difficult \nchallenges to clean up when the pipelines rupture because it is so \nheavy it sinks to the bottom of the water. You only have to look at the \nspill in Michigan's Kalamazoo River in 2010 which they still haven't \ncleaned up.\n  In Mayflower, AK, in 2013, we will show you a picture from there. \nThis is what happened when there was a spill. These spills are not \ncleaned up. This came right into residential communities. So again, \ndirty, filthy oil and the toughest to clean up in case of a spill. We \nknow as sure as I am standing here if this is built there will be a \nspill, because that happens; and it has already happened in 2010 and in \n2013.\n  Of the projected 830,000 barrels of tar sands oil, most of it isn't \ngoing to our domestic use. And that is the other question. Why would \nyou want to bring this dirty, polluted tar sands oil that you cannot \nclean up into our country if practically all of it is going to be \nexported? And we will have to bear the burdens of the refining, the \nfilth in the air, the petcoke in our cities, as we see the products \nbeing exported to other countries.\n  Now I could stop here--I am sure the proponents wish I would, but I \nam not, because if you are not convinced this is an enormous mistake, I \nhave got five reasons--a deeper look at the health of our people. I \nhave already said tar\n\n[[Page S6035]]\n\nsands is the filthiest oil on the planet. And I have already told you \nthat I have stood with nurses and doctors to make this point. Downwind \nfrom the tar sands extraction site and the refineries in Canada there \nare significantly higher levels of dangerous pollutants and carcinogens \nhave been documented.\n  People living in the nearby communities are suffering. I have met \nthem. I have talked to them on the phone. They flew down here to stand \nby my side to call attention to the health impacts. People living in \nnearby communities are suffering higher rates of cancers linked to \ntoxic chemicals including leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. That is a \nfact. The big oil companies won't talk about it. The Koch brothers \nwon't talk about it. My Republican friends won't talk about it. But I \nam going to talk about it and I am going to enter into the Record a \nUniversity of California-Irvine, University of Michigan peer-reviewed \nstudy documenting elevated cancer rates near tar sands processing \nzones. This was a peer-reviewed article dated September 2013.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Atmospheric Environment--Air Quality in the Industrial Heartland of \n         Alberta, Canada and Potential Impacts on Human Health\n\n  (By Isobel J. Simpson, Josette E. Marrero, Stuart Batterman, Simone \n              Meinardi, Barbara Barletta, Donald R. Blake)\n\n\n                               HIGHLIGHTS\n\n       Alberta's Industrial Heartland is Canada's largest \n     hydrocarbon processing center.\n       We characterize 77 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) \n     emitted in this region.\n       Dozens of VOCs, including carcinogens, were enhanced in the \n     industrial plumes.\n       Sources include propene fractionation, diluent separation \n     and bitumen processing.\n       Male hematopoietic cancer rates are higher in this region \n     than elsewhere in Alberta.\n\n\n                                abstract\n\n       The ``Industrial Heartland'' of Alberta is Canada's largest \n     hydrocarbon processing center, with more than 40 major \n     chemical, petrochemical, and oil and gas facilities. \n     Emissions from these industries affect local air quality and \n     human health. This paper characterizes ambient levels of 77 \n     volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the region using high-\n     precision measurements collected in summer 2010. Remarkably \n     strong enhancements of 43 VOCs were detected, and \n     concentrations in the industrial plumes were often similar to \n     or even higher than levels measured in some of the world's \n     largest cities and industrial regions. For example maximum \n     levels of propene and i-pentane exceeded 100 ppbv, and 1,3-\n     butadiene, a known carcinogen, reached 27 ppbv. Major VOC \n     sources included propene fractionation, diluent separation \n     and bitumen processing. Emissions of the measured VOCs \n     increased the hydroxyl radical reactivity (kOH), a \n     measure of the potential to form downwind ozone, from 3.4 \n     s-1 in background air to 62 s-1 in the \n     most concentrated plumes. The plume value was comparable to \n     polluted megacity values, and acetaldehyde, propene and 1,3-\n     butadiene contributed over half of the plume kOH. \n     Based on a 13-year record (1994-2006) at the county level, \n     the incidence of male hematopoietic cancers (leukemia and \n     non-Hodgkin lymphoma) was higher in communities closest to \n     the Industrial Heartland compared to neighboring counties. \n     While a causal association between these cancers and exposure \n     to industrial emissions cannot be confirmed, this pattern and \n     the elevated VOC levels warrant actions to reduce emissions \n     of known carcinogens, including benzene and 1,3-butadiene.\n\n\n                            1. Introduction\n\n       Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted from natural \n     biogenic sources such as vegetation and biomass burning, and \n     from anthropogenic sources such as the production, \n     distribution and consumption of fossil fuels, including \n     vehicular emissions (Guenther etal., 2000; Buzcu and Fraser, \n     2006). VOCs play key roles in the radiative forcing and \n     chemistry and of the atmosphere, for example producing \n     tropospheric ozone (O3) and secondary organic \n     aerosol (SOA) (Sillman, 1999; Robinson et al., 2007). VOCs \n     also control concentrations of the hydroxyl radical (OH) \n     (Guenther et al., 1995), the principal oxidizing agent in the \n     troposphere. Several halogenated VOCs are potent greenhouse \n     gases and cause stratospheric ozone depletion, and are \n     regulated under the Montreal Protocol and its Amendments \n     (MPA) (UNEP, 2012).\n       In addition to their influence on air quality and climate, \n     VOCs are of concern because of their potential health \n     effects. As examples. benzene and 1,3-butadiene are known \n     carcinogens (IARC, 2010). Biological evidence supports the \n     causal linkage between certain pollutants and certain \n     cancers, for example, between leukemia incidence/mortality \n     and exposure to benzene (Snyder, 2002; Forrest et al., 2005) \n     and 1,3-butadiene (Cheng et al., 2007; Kirman et al., 2010). \n     Increased rates of leukemia, melanoma and genotoxic risk have \n     been shown in petroleum workers and populations living \n     downwind of petrochemical facilities such as oil refineries \n     (Wong and Raabe, 2000; Whitworth et al., 2008; Barregard et \n     al., 2009; Basso et al., 2011), although elevated rates and \n     cancer mortality are not consistently observed (Tsai et al., \n     2004; Axelsson et al., 2010).\n       Established in the 1950s, the Industrial Heartland of \n     Alberta is currently a large (582 km\\2\\) industrial area with \n     more than 40 companies, including chemical, petrochemical, \n     and oil and gas facilities (http://\nwww.industrialheartland.com). It is situated about 30 km \n     northeast of Edmonton (53 deg.32'N, 113 deg.30'W; population \n     812,000) and a few km northeast of Fort Saskatchewan \n     (53 deg.43'N, 113 deg.13'W; population 19,000) in an \n     otherwise rural farming area Alberta (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1). \n     The Industrial Heartland is the largest hydrocarbon \n     processing region in Canada, and major land holding include \n     Shell Canada, Dow Chemical Canada, and Provident Energy & \n     Williams Energy Canada (now Pembina Pipeline & Williams \n     Energy Canada) (http://www.industrialheartland.com). Their \n     products include ethane, propane, propene, butane, styrene, \n     hexane, benzene, heavy aromatics, synthetic crude oil and \n     condensate (AIHA, 2012). For example, Shell Scotford is the \n     largest land holding in the Heartland and includes a chemical \n     plant, a refinery, and an upgrader that separates diluent and \n     processes bitumen from oil sands mined approximately 450 km \n     to the north, with a current processing capacity of 255,000 \n     barrels/day (AIHA, 2012).\n       Industrial emissions in the Heartland affect the local air \n     quality, for example causing intermittent odor episodes in \n     the nearby community of Fort Saskatchewan. However, there \n     have been very few independent, peer-reviewed analyses of air \n     quality in the region. Thirty VOCs were measured in the \n     Heartland from 2004 to 2006, and elevated VOC levels were \n     attributed primarily to industry followed by vehicles (Mintz \n     and McWhinney, 2008). Air quality is monitored locally by the \n     Fort Air Partnership (FAP), a multi-stakeholder group with \n     members from industry, government and the public (http://\nwww.fortair.org). Though the FAP data have not been published \n     in the peer-reviewed literature, they show several \n     exceedances of Alberta Ambient Air Quality Objectives (AAAQO) \n     in 2010 for PM2.5, SO2, NH3 \n     and NO2 (FAP, 2010). There were no reported \n     O3 exceedances in 2010 both for AAAQO standards \n     (82 ppb in 1 h) and for Canada-Wide Standards (65 ppb in 8 \n     h). The annual O3 average for 2010 was 22 ppb, and \n     a maximum 1-h O3 value of 72 ppb was recorded in \n     June (FAP, 2010).\n       Here we present concentrations of VOCs and carbon monoxide \n     (CO) measured in the Industrial Heartland in August 2010, and \n     we discuss potential impacts of industrial VOC emissions on \n     air quality and on human health in the local population.\n\n\n                               2. Methods\n\n     2.1. Ground-based air sampling\n       Previously our group identified VOC emission hot-spots \n     within a 12 12 km region of the Industrial Heartland, during \n     a grid study on April 10, 2008 (n = 58) as part of an \n     Environmental Impact Assessment in the Heartland (unpublished \n     data). For example, maximum levels of benzene, ethylbenzene \n     and styrene downwind of the Shell Scotford complex were 1.6, \n     2.0 and 4.0 parts per billion by volume (ppbv, \n     10-9), respectively, or 19, 435 and 6070 times \n     higher than local background concentrations measured on the \n     same day. During the 2010 study the sampling strategy focused \n     on these emission hotspots. Speciated VOC measurements were \n     obtained by collecting whole air samples (WAS) into evacuated \n     2 L stainless steel canisters, followed by analysis at our \n     University of California, Irvine (UC Irvine) laboratory using \n     multi-column gas chromatography (see Supplementary material). \n     Individual air samples were collected concurrently at an \n     upwind farm and downwind of several Heartland industries \n     throughout the day and evening of August 12 and 13, 2010 (n = \n     80; Fig. 1). In many but not all cases, strong odors were \n     associated with samples collected downwind of industrial \n     activity. Because the sampling campaign occurred over a \n     limited 2-day time frame, the results are not intended to \n     represent an assessment of conditions over longer time \n     scales.\n       Based on climate data from 1990 to 2002, the predominant \n     wind direction in the Fort Saskatchewan area (Strathcona \n     County) is from the southwest (SW) quadrant in fall and \n     winter, the northwest (NW) and southeast quadrants in spring, \n     and NW in summer (McCallum et al., 2003). During this study \n     most of the sampled air masses arrived from the NW--i.e., not \n     from Edmonton to the SW--at a median wind speed of 15 km \n     h-1 or a moderate breeze (Fig. 52). Therefore we \n     do not expect emissions from Edmonton to be a confounding \n     factor in this study. The temperature ranged from 14 to 21 \n     deg.C (http://www.casadata.org/Reports/SelectCategory.asp) \n     and conditions were overcast with occasional drizzle and \n     rain--in other words not ideal for active in situ \n     photochemistry.\n     2.2. Laboratory analysis\n       Each air sample was returned to UC Irvine and analyzed \n     within 10 days for CO and 77 VOCs, including C1-\n     C10 hydrocarbons, C1-C2 \n     halocarbons, C1-C5 alkyl nitrates and \n     C1-C2 sulfur compounds. Our analytical \n     procedures and calibration protocols are described in\n\n[[Page S6036]]\n\n     the Supplementary material. The detection limit of our \n     measurements varies by compound and ranges from 0.005 to 100 \n     pptv (Tables SI-S3). The measurement precision and accuracy \n     also vary by compound and are 3% and 5%, respectively, for \n     alkanes, alkenes and aromatics. Rigorous sensitivity tests \n     have shown that most measured VOCs are stable within our \n     canisters, though oxygenated hydrocarbon levels can increase \n     or decrease at a rate of a few percent per day, which is \n     reflected by their more poorly constrained precision and \n     accuracy (Tables 51-53 ).\n     2.3. VOC data analysis\n       Trace gas concentrations typically vary with factors \n     including season and latitude. During this study the \n     background VOC concentrations showed little diurnal \n     variability for most compounds (Fig. S3), and the upwind farm \n     samples were used to calculate the average local background \n     concentrations for this latitude and time of year (n = 8). \n     Because the plume samples were collected outside the \n     perimeter of the industrial facilities, perhaps 500 m or more \n     downwind of the emission source, the extent to which the \n     plumes had become mixed and diluted with background air \n     before being sampled is unclear. As a result the industrial \n     plume averages were calculated as the average of the top 10th \n     percentile concentrations for each species (n = 8). We note \n     that these industrial plume values will be less concentrated \n     than stack samples.\n     2.4. Human health data analysis\n       To investigate potential impacts of exposure to industrial \n     pollutants on human health, in particular cancer incidences, \n     two memos, tables and figures were obtained from the Alberta \n     Cancer Board (Chen, 2006, 2008) under the Canadian Freedom of \n     Information and Protection of Privacy (FOIP) Act. These \n     documents provide limited analyses of cancer incidences in \n     the region, specifically comparing the three-county area of \n     Fort Saskatchewan, Strathcona County and Sturgeon County \n     (Fig. 1) to the rest of the Edmonton-area health region, and \n     also to the rest of Alberta. Currently Fort Saskatchewan \n     houses 18 major industries, Strathcona County has 16 \n     industries, and Sturgeon County has 9 industries (AIHA, \n     2012).\n       Based on surveillance data from 1994 through 2006 \n     (inclusive), Chen (2008) remarks that the age-standardized \n     incidence rates for male hematopoietic cancer and male non-\n     Hodgkin lymphoma in the three-county area are elevated with \n     respect to the two comparison areas. We extended this \n     analysis by computing the mean (tstandard error) standardized \n     incidence rate for male hematopoietic cancers in the three-\n     county region using two five-year periods (1997-2001 and \n     2002-2006) that help to reduce the year-to-year fluctuations \n     in cancer cases (since the population is relatively small).\n\n\n                       3. Results and discussion\n\n     3.1. VOC concentrations\n       Complete results for the 2010 sampling campaign are \n     summarized in Tables 51-53. With the exception of methane \n     (CH4), which is long-lived and relatively abundant \n     in the atmosphere, background VOC levels ranged from sub- or \n     low- parts per trillion by volume (pptv, 10 -12) \n     up to low ppbv levels. By comparison, concentrations of many \n     VOCs were clearly elevated in the industrial plumes compared \n     to background values (Tables S1 and S2). Of the 77 measured \n     VOCs, 43 were very strongly enhanced in the plumes, with \n     concentrations spanning roughly 1 to 4 orders of magnitude \n     (Fig. 2a-f and Fig. S4a-c). These compounds include all 14 \n     aromatics that were measured, 12 alkanes, 6 alkenes, 5 \n     oxygenated compounds, 5 halocarbons and ethyne (Table S1). \n     After CH4, the most abundant VOCs in the \n     industrial plumes were, in descending order, propene (maximum \n     of 107 ppbv), i-pentane (103 ppbv), n-pentane (97 ppbv), \n     acetaldehyde (74 ppbv) and 2- methylpentane (62 ppbv). By \n     comparison, their average background levels ( 1s) \n     ranged from 0.031  0.013 ppbv to 1.4  \n     0.8 ppbv, or factors of 55-1980 lower. The most strongly \n     enhanced compounds were methyl tert-butyl ether (enhanced by \n     up to a factor of 6194), ethylbenzene (6179), 3-methylpentane \n     (4414), trans-2-butene (3609) and 2,3-dimethylbutane (3048).\n       An additional 15 compounds showed small-to-moderate, \n     statistically significant enhancements (up to 1.06-2.8-fold) \n     in the industrial plumes compared to background values (Table \n     S2). These include CH4, two sulfur compounds (DMS, \n     OCS), three methyl halides (CH3I, \n     CH3Br, CH3Cl), three brominated \n     compounds (CH3Br, CH2Br2, \n     CHBr3), four long-lived halocarbons (9-26 years; \n     HCFC-141b, HCFC-142b, HCFC-22, CCl4), and three \n     short-lived solvents (1-5 months; acetone, methyl acetate, \n     CHCl3) (Fig. S2d-f). With the exception of \n     CH4, their plume averages remained below 1 ppbv \n     (Table S2). Although carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) \n     is restricted under the MPA, the precision of these \n     measurements is 1% (about 0.8 pptv at the measured mixing \n     ratios), and CCl4 shows clear and measurable enhancements in \n     industrial plumes downwind of Dow and Shell compared to the \n     background of 89.4  0.4 pptv (Fig. S2f).\n       We speculate that these elevated plume concentrations are \n     due to emissions from pre-existing reservoirs.\n       Carbon monoxide and the remaining 19 of 77 measured VOCs \n     showed similar concentration ranges in both background air \n     and plumes, and were not appreciably impacted by industrial \n     emissions (Fig. S3a-d). This group comprises a number of \n     halocarbons (CFCs, halons, CH3CCl3, \n     HFC-134a, 1,2-dichloroethene), biogenic compounds (isoprene, \n     a-pinene and b-pinene) and alkyl nitrates (Table S3). Several \n     of the halocarbons are restricted under the MPA, and their \n     lack of industrial emission is not surprising (Fig. S3a). \n     Although the pinenes have previously shown an unexpected \n     association with industrial emissions from oil sands \n     operations near Fort McMurray (Simpson et al., 2010), an \n     industrial signature was not evident here (Fig. S3b). Carbon \n     monoxide was not enhanced in the industrial plumes (Fig. \n     S3c), showing that combustive sources (including vehicular \n     emissions) did not significantly impact the measured plumes. \n     Alkyl nitrate levels remained in the low pptv range (Fig. \n     S3d), indicating little evidence of secondary photochemistry. \n     This is most likely explained by a combination of unfavorable \n     conditions for in situ photochemistry (Section 2.1) and the \n     short travel time from plume emission to sample collection. \n     For example, an emitted plume could reach the sampling sites \n     in as little as a few minutes based on a wind speed of 10-20 \n     km h-1 (Section 2.1) and a downwind sampling \n     distance of 500 m.\n     3.2. Emission signatures\n       Based on linear correlations among the measured VOCs using \n     least squares linear fits (Simpson et al., 2010), the emitted \n     VOCs fell into at least five distinct correlating groups. \n     First, the C3-C4 alkenes were strongly \n     correlated (0.99   r2   1.00), driven by high \n     concentrations measured downwind of the Provident/Williams \n     facility (Fig. 2a), which includes a natural gas liquids and \n     propene fractionation project and produces C2-\n     C4 alkanes and C3-C4 butenes \n     (AIHA, 2012). Remarkably, the maximum propene level (107 \n     ppbv) was almost double that measured in the Houston-\n     Galveston Bay area (56 ppbv), even though Houston is both a \n     much larger metropolitan area than Fort Saskatchewan and the \n     largest petrochemical manufacturing center in the United \n     States (Ryerson et al., 2003; Gilman et al., 2009).\n       Second, the C5-C7 alkanes and \n     methacrolein were highly correlated (0.81   r2   \n     1.00), with largest concentrations downwind of Shell \n     Scotford, which separates diluent and processes bitumen \n     (Section 1), and Access Pipeline, which produces diluent and \n     blended bitumen (Fig. 2 band Fig. S4a). The maximum n-hexane \n     level (52 ppbv) was 2.5-17 times higher than maximum values \n     measured in some of the world's megacities (Beijing, Mexico \n     City, and Tokyo) (Parrish et al., 2009), although lower than \n     the maximum levels measured during a ship-based study in \n     Houston/Galveston Bay (81 ppbv) (Gilman et al., 2009). \n     Simpson et al. (2010) associated elevated levels of \n     C4-C9 alkanes with emissions from oil \n     sands and its products and/or diluent, and this second group \n     of VOCs is consistent with a diluent/bitumen signature. Even \n     though methacrolein and methyl vinyl ketone are both major \n     isoprene oxidation products (Montzka et al., 1993) they were \n     uncorrelated during this study (r2 0.01). Because \n     the maximum methacrolein level (20 ppbv) far exceeds the \n     amount that isoprene oxidation chemistry can explain, its \n     excess concentrations are attributed to industrial emissions.\n       Third, acetaldehyde (Fig. 54b), i-butane (Fig. 2c) and n-\n     butane were correlated strongly with one another (0.88   \n     r2   0.98) and somewhat with the C3-\n     C4 alkenes (0.58   r2   0.68). Maximum \n     levels of all three compounds (26-74 ppbv) were measured \n     downwind of Provident/Williams, which produces C2-\n     C4 alkanes (AIHA, 2012); Shell Scotford, which \n     lists C3-C4 mix as a product; and \n     Access Pipeline. Surprisingly, the maximum butane levels were \n     comparable to those in central Mexico City during the mid-\n     1990s when liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was a major source \n     of butanes and contributed to poor air quality (Blake and \n     Rowland, 1995). The characteristic emission ratio of i-\n     butane/n-butane is 0.2-0.3 for vehicular exhaust, 0.46 for \n     LPG, and 0.6-1.0 for natural gas (Russo et al., 2010 and \n     references therein). Here the average (1s) ratio \n     in the top 10% of plumes (based on the highest i-butane and \n     n-butane concentrations) was 0.47  0.18, similar \n     to that for LPG and to that measured downwind of the oil \n     sands industry (0.42  0.03) (Simpson et al., \n     2010), suggesting that the i-butane/n-butane ratio for \n     various petrochemical processes resembles that for LPG. The \n     main global source of acetaldehyde is photochemical \n     hydrocarbon oxidation, with a relatively small industrial \n     source (Singh et al., 2004; Millet et al., 2010). Here, \n     however, the very high acetaldehyde levels cannot be \n     explained by secondary photochemical production (Section 3.1) \n     and they are attributed to direct industrial emission from \n     various facilities. For example, the Shell Scotford chemical \n     plant reportedly released 3.9 tonnes of acetaldehyde in 2010 \n     (NPRI, 2012).\n       Fourth, toluene and the xylenes correlated strongly with \n     one another (0.79   r2   0.98) and with the second \n     group of compounds (0.60   r2   0.89). The highest \n     levels of toluene and the xylenes (2.7 ppbv and 0.65-3.4 \n     ppbv, respectively) were measured downwind of the Shell \n     Scotford complex (Fig. S4c), which lists heavy aromatics \n     among its products. The maximum toluene level was 69 times \n     higher than background (Table S1), but lower than maximum \n     values in megacities such as Mexico City, Tokyo and Beijing ( \n      10 ppbv) and near major petrochemical complexes in Texas and \n     Spain (16-77 ppbv) (Gilman et al., 2009; Ras et al., 2009).\n       Fifth, n-octane and the C9 aromatics \n     (ethylbenzene, trimethylbenzenes, n-\n\n[[Page S6037]]\n\n     propylbenzene) correlated strongly (0.74   r2   \n     1.00), and with highest concentrations downwind of the Shell \n     Scotford complex. The maximum ethylbenzene mixing ratio (23 \n     ppbv; Fig. 2d) was much larger than for other compounds in \n     this group (0.22-0.83 ppbv), indicating clear emissions of \n     this possible carcinogen. The Shell Scotford refinery \n     manufactures a range of products including gasoline, diesel \n     and jet fuel, and reportedly released 0.562 tonnes of \n     ethylbenzene in 2010 (NPRI, 2012).\n       Other chemicals were clearly emitted but did not \n     necessarily correlate strongly with other VOCs. Ethane and \n     propane were moderately correlated (r2 = 0.62), \n     with highest levels measured downwind of Keyera and \n     Provident-Williams (ethane and propane) and Dow Chemical \n     (ethane only). The maximum propane mixing ratio (45 ppbv) was \n     lower than in Houston/Galveston Bay) (347 ppbv) (Gilman et \n     al., 2009). Benzene showed some correlation with ethylbenzene \n     (r2 = 0.58) and the highest benzene level (6.6 \n     ppbv; Fig. 2e) was measured downwind of Shell Scotford, which \n     produces benzene and reportedly released 2.5 tonnes of \n     benzene from its refinery in 2010 (NPRI, 2012). The highest \n     1.3-butadiene level was also measured downwind of the Shell \n     facility (27 ppbv; Fig. 2f), though 1,3-butadiene is not \n     listed in the National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) for \n     Shell. The combustion tracers ethene and ethyne were only \n     weakly correlated (r2 = 0.52) and their highest \n     concentrations were measured downwind of Dow, which produces \n     ethene. Ethene/ethyne ratios of 1-3 and 10-30 are \n     characteristic of tailpipe emissions and petrochemical \n     facilities, respectively (Ryerson et al., 2003). Here the \n     ethene/ethyne ratio was 9.7  1.0, which confirms \n     the industrial rather than vehicular nature of the observed \n     plumes.\n     3.3 Air quality impacts\n       The contribution of individual VOCs to O3 \n     formation is a function of their concentration and their \n     reactivity towards OH, and can be expressed as the total OH \n     reactivity (kOH) Kovacs et al., 2003; Mao et al., \n     2010; Kim et al., 2011):\n\n     kOH =  \n         (kOH+VOCi[VOCi] + \n         kOH+CO[CO] + \n         kOH+NO[NO]+kOH + NO2[NO2]\n         +...)  (1)\n\n       Here kOH is used to evaluate the relative \n     contributions of CO and the measured VOCs to downwind \n     photochemistry. Because we did not measure nitrogen oxides \n     (NOX), which can contribute 15-50% to \n     kOH in cities such as Houston, Mexico City and New \n     York (Mao et al., 2010), the reactivity reported here is \n     likely underestimated and is understood to be only for the \n     measured species, rather than total OH reactivity.\n       The OH reactivity in background air was 3.4 s-1, \n     similar to clean air values of 1-3 s-1 (Kim et \n     al., 2011; Lou et al., 2010). Not surprisingly, isoprene was \n     the primary contributor to kOH in background air, \n     followed by CO, acetaldehyde and CH4 (Fig. 3a). By \n     contrast, kOH in the top 10th percentile of data \n     with highest VOC loadings was 62 s -1, or 18 times \n     larger than background. Even though we have missing \n     reactivity, this plume kOH value is already \n     comparable to levels in polluted megacities such as Mexico \n     City, Tokyo and Hong Kong/Guangzhou, which typically range \n     from 10 to 100 s-1 (Lou et al., 2010 and \n     references therein). Because of their abundance and \n     reactivity, propene, acetaldehyde and 1,3-butadiene were \n     responsible for more than 50% of kOH in the \n     plumes, while alkanes contributed another 23% (Fig. 3b). \n     These results show some similarity to airborne studies in \n     the greater Houston area, where propene and ethene were \n     identified as the two VOCs primarily responsible for rapid \n     O3 formation (Ryerson et al., 2003; deGouw et \n     al., 2009) and alkene emissions from petrochemical \n     facilities are the primary source of formaldehyde, also an \n     O3 precursor (Parrish et al., 2012).\n       Despite the abundance of VOC precursors and strong OH \n     reactivity in the industrial plumes, no O3 \n     exceedances were measured in the Fort Saskatchewan region in \n     2010 (Section 1). In general, the highest monthly \n     O3 averages occur during spring, and the highest \n     1-h O3 averages occur during hot summer afternoons \n     when wind speeds are low (FAP, 2010). Ozone levels are lower \n     within the center of the Heartland airshed, likely due to the \n     presence of NOX which lower O3 concentrations \n     through titration (FAP, 2010). Simpson et al. (2010) also \n     found relatively low levels of O3 downwind of the \n     Alberta oil sands because titration with NO exceeded \n     O3 production on the short time-scale since \n     precursor emission. Overall, it appears that industrial VOC \n     sources in the Fort Saskatchewan area are emitted into a \n     relatively clean background for O3, and local \n     O3 exceedances are not common.\n     3.4. Gaps in VOC emission reporting\n       Although 43 of 77 measured VOCs were strongly elevated in \n     the industrial plumes compared to local background \n     concentrations, only 16 were quantified in the 2010 NPRI for \n     the industries discussed in this paper (ethene, propene, 1,3-\n     butadiene, 1,2-dichloroethane, n-hexane, benzene, toluene, \n     ethylbenzene, total xylenes, styrene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, \n     acetaldehyde, carbonyl sulfide, chloroform, trichloroethene, \n     HCFC-22; NPRI, 2012), with individual companies reporting 0-\n     10 VOCs. As a first example, while strongly elevated levels \n     of at least a dozen C2-C8 alkanes were \n     detected downwind of several Industrial Heartland facilities \n     (Table S1, Fig. 2b-c and Fig. S4a), only n-hexane is included \n     in the NPRI. The VOCs reported in the NPRI include light \n     alkenes and are weighted towards aromatic species, yet our \n     study shows that alkanes are a leading contributor to \n     kOH in the Heartland (Fig. 3b). Second, while 1,3-\n     butadiene is a known carcinogen, emissions of this VOC are \n     reported by only one of the companies considered here.\n       Even when emission rates are reported, they require \n     verification to ensure that the reporting is accurate. For \n     example, recent NPRI listings of VOC emission rates \n     (including benzene) from an unnamed Canadian refinery were \n     found to be underestimated by 15-18-fold (Chambers et al., \n     2008). In addition to improved reporting of speciated VOCs in \n     the NPRI or other publically available inventories, \n     especially 1,3-butadiene and light alkanes, we recommend \n     independent air quality monitoring and VOC emission estimates \n     in the Heartland region so that emitted compounds can be \n     externally identified, quantified and reported in the peer-\n     reviewed literature.\n     3.5. Human health impacts\n       Of the 77 VOCs measured here, at least 10 are either known \n     human carcinogens (Group 1: benzene, 1,3-butadiene), probable \n     carcinogens (Group 2A: trichloroethene, tetrachloroethene), \n     or possible carcinogens (Group 2B: carbon tetrachloride, \n     chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, dichloromethane, \n     ethylbenzene, isoprene, styrene) (IARC, 2010). Of these, 1,3-\n     butadiene and ethylbenzene were the most abundant in the \n     industrial plumes, with maximum levels of 23-27 ppbv, or 3-4 \n     orders of magnitude larger than their background values \n     (Table S1).\n       An analysis of cancer incidences in the Industrial \n     Heartland shows elevated incidence rates of male \n     hematopoietic cancers in the three-county area where the \n     industries are located (Fort Saskatchewan, Strathcona County \n     and Sturgeon County) compared to neighboring regions for both \n     1997-2001 and 2002-2006, although the error bars are large \n     due to small sample sizes (Fig. 4). Several steps would help \n     to confirm such trends and possibly provide a more direct \n     link between these cancers and emissions of toxic VOCs in the \n     Heartland: improved estimates of VOC emissions and exposure \n     estimates that included more detail and historical data; \n     better cancer surveillance that included regular evaluations, \n     breakdown by cancer type (e.g., myelogenous, monocytic and \n     lymphocytic leukemias) and geocoding of cases; collection of \n     potential covariates and confounders (e.g., residence and \n     work history); and use of statistical and epidemiological \n     techniques to investigate spatial, temporal and exposure-\n     related patterns of disease in the community.\n       Elevated risk of hematopoietic cancers has also been found \n     in other populations living downwind of industrial \n     facilities, even at relatively low VOC exposures. For \n     example, leukemia incidence an exposed population living near \n     a large Swedish oil refinery known to emit benzene and other \n     VOCs was significantly elevated (33 cases vs. 22 expected \n     cases) compared to local controls (50 cases vs. 56 expected), \n     despite an estimated refinery contribution to annual average \n     VOC concentrations of only 0.63 ppb for benzene and 0.23 ppb \n     for 1,3-butadiene (Barregard et al., 2009). The authors note \n     that risk estimates extrapolated from high-level exposure \n     would not predict an increase of leukemia at low VOC \n     exposures, and they suggest that risk estimates using \n     standard carcinogenic unit risk or slope factors do not \n     adequately represent true risks from much lower exposures. As \n     a second example of a population-based study, higher exposure \n     to benzene and 1,3-butadiene in 886 census tracts surrounding \n     Houston, Texas was associated with increased incidence of \n     childhood lymphohematopoietic cancers (Whitworth et al., \n     2008). Some of the highest exposures occurred in the Houston \n     Ship Channel area, which contains a large number of petroleum \n     and chemical industries.\n       Recommended exposure limits and risk-based criteria evolve \n     as our understanding of the chemical toxicity of carcinogens \n     improves. Using benzene as an example, the recommended \n     exposure limit relevant for occupational settings has \n     decreased from 100 ppm in 1947 to 1 ppm (Wong et al., 1999; \n     McHale et al., 2010; Smith, 2010); the 1-h average ambient \n     air quality guideline in Alberta is 9 ppb (Chambers et al., \n     2008). However, adverse health outcomes, including \n     hematological changes and gene perturbations, have been \n     reported at exposure levels below 1 ppm (McHale et al., 2010; \n     Qu et al., 2002; Lan et al., 2004; Xing et al., 2010). \n     Indeed, recent literature suggests that there is probably no \n     safe exposure level to benzene because it does not appear to \n     have a functional low-dose threshold, and because the effects \n     of exposure appear to be additive in a linear or supralinear \n     fashion (Smith, 2010). Further, in environmental settings (as \n     compared to workplace), exposure to compound mixtures rather \n     than a single compound at a time is common, and simultaneous \n     exposure to complex mixtures, including multiple carcinogens, \n     may involve interactions and possibly synergistic effects on \n     target organs or systems at low exposure (Basso et al., \n     2011). Although VOC levels were significantly elevated above \n     concurrent local background values in the Heartland, \n     concentrations remained below existing guidelines for short-\n     term exposure. Guidelines for long-term exposures generally \n     use a risk-based approach, and there is considerable \n     uncertainty regarding the unit risk factors that describe the \n     toxicity of a chemical (or mixture) for the public and \n     susceptible individuals, as well as debate over what is \n     acceptable or protective. (A number of U.S. state and federal \n     rules use individual lifetime cancer risks in the range of 1 \n     in 10,000 to 1 in 1,000,000.)\n\n[[Page S6038]]\n\n       The elevated incidence of cancers within the Industrial \n     Heartland that are known to be linked to VOCs released in the \n     region raises questions regarding whether ambient levels, \n     emission controls, and risk calculations are adequately \n     protective of public health. In addition, on-site workers may \n     be at increased risk because of their closer proximity to \n     emission sources. While several factors might well explain an \n     observation of increased cancer rates, e.g., variability of a \n     population's genetic makeup, differences in dietary or \n     lifestyle factors, and statistical variability, it is also \n     important and responsible to improve health surveillance and \n     VOC exposure measurements, to utilize epidemiological studies \n     that can better link environmental factors to disease, and to \n     reduce exposures to pollutants that might plausibly be \n     related to adverse health impacts.\n\n\n                             4. Conclusions\n\n       Ambient monitoring in the Industrial Heartland of Alberta, \n     the largest hydrocarbon processing region in Canada, showed \n     remarkable enhancements in VOC concentrations. Even though \n     the Heartland is situated within a generally rural area, many \n     maximum concentrations were comparable to those measured in \n     the world's largest cities. Thirty VOCs were present at \n     levels above 1 ppbv, and maximum propene and i-pentane levels \n     exceeded 100 ppbv. Some of the largest VOC excesses were \n     measured in samples designated as ``no smell'', showing that \n     absence of odor does not necessarily indicate good air \n     quality. The industrial plumes showed distinct chemical \n     signatures that varied not only between facilities but also \n     within individual facilities. An analysis of OH reactivity in \n     the plumes suggests that propene, acetaldehyde and 1,3-\n     butadiene have the greatest potential to form downwind \n     O3.\n       Excess numbers of hematopoietic cancers were observed in \n     the same region that emits substantial quantities of complex \n     mixtures of industrial pollutants, including several VOCs \n     that are known to cause these cancers. While there are many \n     factors that preclude a causal linkage, including a lack of \n     exposure history for the local population and uncertainties \n     associated with the health impacts of low exposures to \n     multiple compounds, we suggest that immediate reductions in \n     emissions of known carcinogens such as benzene and 1,3-\n     butadiene are warranted and prudent.\n\n\n                            Acknowledgments\n\n       Laboratory analysis was performed by Brent Love and Gloria \n     Liu Weitz.

Once it leaves Canada and is transported to refineries in \nthe United States, the tar sands would increase the pollution in \nalready plagued communities such as Port Arthur, which I showed you and \nI will show you again.\n  Port Arthur is already refining tar sands oil. This is going to \ngreatly increase the amount of tar sands oil they are going to be \nrefining. They are on the EPA's list of cities with dangerous ozone \nlevels, people suffering from asthma, respiratory ailments, skin \nirritations, and cancer.\n  The oil companies aren't going to tell you about this and the Koch \nbrothers aren't going to tell you about this and my Republican friends \naren't going to tell you about this, but I am going to tell you about \nthis. Tar sands will add another threat to Port Arthur and other \ncommunities that are already in distress.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article \ndescribing health problems experienced by families living near Port \nArthur refineries, and it is entitled ``Everyone Deserves Clean Air and \nEqual Protection From Pollution,'' dated August 12, 2014.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Chron, August 12, 2014]\n\n    Everyone Deserves Clean Air and Equal Protection From Pollution\n\n\n    EVERY ONE SHOULD HAVE AN EQUAL RIGHT TO BREATHE CLEAN, SAFE AIR\n\n                   (By Hilton Kelley and Anne Rolfes)\n\n       Would you want your child to live next door to an oil \n     refinery and face an increased risk for cancer, heart or \n     breathing problems?\n       Millions of Americans live very close to some 150 oil \n     refineries in 32 states, including our home states of Texas \n     and Louisiana, and have an increased cancer risk because of \n     the air pollution coming from refineries. Those most \n     vulnerable to this pollution are disproportionately black, \n     Latino, children and lower income.\n       Port Arthur, for instance, is home to eight major oil and \n     chemical industrial sites, including oil refineries.\n       And cancer deaths in Jefferson County, where Port Arthur is \n     located, are 40 percent higher among African Americans than \n     they are for the average Texan, according to the Texas Cancer \n     Registry.\n       Children in the predominantly Latino Manchester \n     neighborhood of Houston--home to a Valero Refinery--have a 56 \n     percent greater chance of getting leukemia than children who \n     live elsewhere, according to researchers from the University \n     of Texas School of Public Health.\n       By conservative estimates, oil refineries emit more than \n     20,000 tons of hazardous air pollutants each year, including \n     cancer-causing benzene, lead and hydrogen cyanide.\n       This public health and environmental problem must be \n     addressed. Everyone should have an equal right to breathe \n     clean, safe air, including the people who live nearest the \n     country's oil refineries. Now, there's a possibility of \n     meaningful change nationwide. For the first time in nearly \n     two decades, the EPA has proposed updated standards to reduce \n     oil refineries' toxic air emissions. The current federal \n     standards do not require the most recent and up-to-date \n     technology that would limit hazardous air pollution and fail \n     to protect public health. For example, the existing rules do \n     not require refineries to monitor the hazardous pollutants \n     they emit at the edge of the property where refineries are \n     situated--called the fenceline--which would provide a more \n     accurate measure of the pollutants that are really going into \n     these communities.\n       In recent years, some refineries have adopted new \n     technologies that reduce toxic air emissions and prevent \n     pollution spikes and accidents. These pollution control \n     methods are available and affordable, but they have not been \n     adopted throughout the industry.\n       Under the EPA's proposed standards, oil refineries would be \n     required to measure benzene, a carcinogen, at the fenceline \n     as it drifts into the local community and then make that data \n     publicly available. This is a significant proposal on a \n     problem that communities living near refineries have been \n     raising for years.\n       The proposed standards would require tighter controls on \n     emissions from storage tanks and other parts of refineries \n     that are major contributors to toxic air pollution.\n       The oil industry has objected to the new rules, claiming \n     that they are unnecessary and burdensome. In reality, the \n     EPA's analysis shows that the new rules will reduce toxic air \n     pollution by 5,600 tons each year and that the cancer risk \n     will be significantly reduced for 1 million people.\n       The costs to the industry will be negligible, according to \n     the EPA, but even if the costs were significant, it would be \n     worth it to save lives. It is not fair for children living \n     near refineries to bear the hidden costs of oil production--\n     in the form of cancer, asthma, birth defects and other \n     serious illnesses--when the industry could fix a lot of \n     problems and reduce the toxic pollution it creates.\n       The EPA's proposed rules on air pollution from oil \n     refineries are a welcome step forward. The agency should, in \n     fact, make the rule even stronger by doing more to protect \n     people from the real-world health consequences of living next \n     door to an oil refinery, by incorporating a fenceline \n     monitoring requirement that would employ the best current \n     technology to give neighborhoods a real-time, continuous \n     measure of pollution, not just a snapshot, and ensure \n     refineries quickly fix pollution problems.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From USA Today, Oct. 20, 2007]\n\n         Texas Toxic Town Lures Industry While Residents Wheeze\n\n                            (By Monica Rhor)\n\n       Port Arthur, TX.--There is a quiet battle for the future of \n     this industrial town, one of America's most polluted places.\n       On one side is ex-mayor Oscar Ortiz, who in the waning days \n     of his administration worried about one thing. But it wasn't \n     the toxic chemicals that spew from petrochemical plants, the \n     town's richest landowners, through the windows of its poorest \n     residents.\n       What rattled the white-maned, barrel-chested Ortiz, who ran \n     Port Arthur for nine years, was that someday the \n     petrochemical plants would go away.\n       ``The only money here in the city of Port Arthur that \n     amounts to anything comes from industry, from petrochemical \n     companies,'' said Oritz, leaning back in his chair in an \n     office decorated with framed photographs of refineries. ``If \n     industry goes away, people might as well go away too because \n     there'll be no money. That's the continued salvation of this \n     city.''\n       Hilton Kelley, like Ortiz born and raised in Port Arthur, \n     is the opposition.\n       Kelley does worry about the toxic chemicals, the foul-\n     smelling air and the west side residents who suffer from \n     asthma, respiratory ailments, skin irritations and cancer. As \n     the city's most visible environmental activist, Kelley has \n     long campaigned for more restrictions on industrial \n     construction and stricter monitoring of plant emissions.\n       ``I grew up smelling the S02 (sulfur dioxide) smell, the \n     chemicals. I remember seeing little kids with sores on their \n     legs, with mucus running in August. It's ridiculous what \n     we've had to deal with,'' says Kelley, a former actor with \n     the sonorous voice of a radio announcer. ``We're not trying \n     to shut doors of industry. We're just trying to push these \n     guys to do what's right.''\n       Ortiz calls Kelley an alarmist who likes to ``stir things \n     up'' in the minority community Kelley accuses Ortiz of \n     sacrificing the community's welfare in exchange for slim tax \n     revenue from the plants.\n\n[[Page S6039]]\n\n       One man represents Port Arthur the way it has always been; \n     the other symbolizes a growing call for change.\n       But change, especially in a place like Port Arthur, never \n     comes easily.\n       ``This city is not going to change. It is a refinery town--\n     tomorrow, next year, 100 years from now. It will always be a \n     petro-chemical area,'' says Ortiz.\n       And if its residents are getting sick from the pollution?\n       Well, says Ortiz: ``We've all got to die of something.''\n       Port Arthur, located next to the Louisiana line, sits in a \n     corridor routinely ranked as one of the country's most \n     polluted regions. Texas and Louisiana are home to five oil \n     refineries considered among the nation's 10 worst offenders \n     in releasing toxic air pollutants, emitting 8.5 million \n     pounds of toxins together in 2002.\n       Yet even here, Port Arthur stands out.\n       Its skyline is framed by the smokestacks and knotted steel \n     pipes of the refineries and chemical plants clustered along \n     the edges of the town. Flares from the plants glow red \n     against the night sky, as incinerated chemicals filter into \n     the air.\n       The smell of rotten eggs and sulphur hangs stubbornly over \n     the apartments and shotgun houses on the west side. Port \n     Arthur, population 57,000, is on the EPA's list of cities \n     with dangerous ozone levels, and the state has flagged its \n     excessive levels of benzene.\n       Many cities along the Texas Gulf Coast are dotted with \n     refineries. But the companies' high tax bills are used to \n     improve schools, create green space and bulk up city coffers. \n     Port Arthur waives most property taxes to lure industry.\n       Eric Shaeffer, a former EPA official who runs the \n     Environmental Integrity Project in Washington, D.C., a \n     nonprofit advocacy group, has written two studies on \n     pollution in Port Arthur. ``It's one of the worst I've \n     seen,'' he said.\n       The Veolia Environmental Services plant in Port Arthur \n     recently alerted incinerating nearly 2 million gallons of VX \n     hydrolysate, the wastewater byproduct of a deadly nerve gas \n     agent.\n       Besides the pollution the state and EPA allow as part of \n     the cost of doing business, the plants spew more toxins \n     during ``upset events''--unpermitted releases caused by \n     lightning strikes, human error, start-ups and shutdowns.\n       Plant officials cite statistics showing steady progress in \n     reducing some emissions, but Shaeffer cites a continuing \n     hazard.\n       Around 2 a.m. Thursday, a pipeline explosion sent ethylene-\n     fueled flames shooting 100 feet into the air. The Union \n     Carbide-Dow Chemical pipeline lies about a quarter-mile from \n     the nearest home, Kelley said. No injuries were reported, but \n     officials warned people to stay indoors.\n       ``When you get releases, it really hits people tight in the \n     chest,'' said Shaeffer. ``It's one thing to be driving past \n     the plants on the highway. It's another thing for kids to be \n     out on the swing sets when there's a release.''\n       Jordan, 5, and Justin, 7, play on the swings at Carver \n     Terrace, the public housing project they live in next door to \n     refineries run by Motiva and Valero that produce half a \n     million barrels of oil a day and belch thousands of pounds of \n     pollutants into the air.\n       Jordan's lungs are so weakened from a lifelong battle with \n     asthma and bronchitis that he can't shout or call for help \n     like other children, says their mother, LaShauna Green.\n       He must inhale medicine every four hours through a plastic \n     mask that swamps his chubby face. Every two hours, he must \n     take one of seven prescription drugs that keep his air \n     passages from tightening.\n       Justin struggles to breathe after climbing just one flight \n     of stairs.\n       Those troubles vanished when the Green family left the area \n     for a year following 2005's Hurricane Rita. But two days \n     after their return to Carver Terrace, Justin was rushed to a \n     hospital twice in one day with respiratory attacks.\n       ``When you start getting this kind of toxic chemical soup, \n     we don't really know what the combination of all these things \n     are doing,'' said Debra Morris, an assistant professor at the \n     University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston who studied \n     Port Arthur-area pollution.\n       Texas oil was first discovered near Port Arthur. For \n     decades, the region nurtured industrial build-up with \n     generous tax abatements. In return, the companies would \n     promise to pay later and to create local jobs.\n       Oritz defends the incentives as the only way to keep his \n     city alive.\n       ``The one main substance that keeps the city floating is \n     the refineries,'' he said.\n       Refineries and chemical plants contribute about 67% of the \n     city's budget through some taxes, Ortiz said, Still, without \n     the abatements the city would have collected tens of millions \n     of dollars more.\n       The city of Port Arthur has at least 28 tax-abatement deals \n     with refineries and chemical plants. Surrounding Jefferson \n     County has at least six, including with Motiva, Total, and \n     Valero, which will pay no property taxes for the first two \n     years of a nine-year contract and then pay 10% of the taxes \n     it would owe for the next seven.\n       Motiva will pay no taxes on a $3.5 billion expansion \n     project for the next three years. Total taxes rise to $4.16 \n     million by 2012.\n       Jeff Branick, assistant to Jefferson County executive Ron \n     Walker, says the Motiva expansion is expected to create \n     thousands of temporary construction jobs and 300 permanent \n     jobs; Valero's project is expected to create 40 to 65 jobs, \n     he said.\n       ``It's going to be pumping a whole lot of money into the \n     local economy,'' Branick said. ``It creates hotel-motel tax \n     revenue and will be attracting people from the outside who \n     will be coming here to work and renting houses.''\n       Ortiz also points to a new development on Pleasure Island, \n     a resort with golf courses, new hotels and bustling shopping \n     centers springing up on the city's south side. All, says \n     Ortiz, spurred by the growth of the industrial complexes.\n       However, that prosperity bypassed Port Arthur's \n     predominantly black west side and central city neighborhoods \n     where singer Janis Joplin and sports legend Babe Zaharias \n     were raised.\n       ``This town is like a forgotten grandmother. It helped \n     nourish the growth of the area, now all the wealth is moving \n     (out),'' said Kelley. ``It's not fair to leave this entire \n     community unnourished.''\n       Despite the development Port Arthur is not as prosperous as \n     other refinery towns. Its median household income is two-\n     thirds the Texas average; its homes are valued at less than \n     half the state average. Port Arthur public high school \n     students pass the test required for graduation at about half \n     the state rate.\n       By comparison, the Houston suburb of Deer Park--home to its \n     own refinery row--collects more taxes from its petrochemical \n     complex. Before the state equalized school funding, its \n     school district was nearly the richest in the state. The \n     median home price is 25% higher than the state average and \n     its median household income is 30% above the state average.\n       Both cities have roughly the same percentage of residents \n     in chemical or construction fields.\n       Kelley is not the only one raising questions about how \n     things are done in Port Arthur.\n       Some city officials have also started to question the \n     benefits of the tax abatement deals.\n       In most, companies promise to ``give Port Arthur residents \n     a fair opportunity to apply for employment'' but don't \n     require jobs go to city residents. One company's pledge to \n     use local labor and contractors defined ``local'' as covering \n     a nine-county region.\n       Councilman Michael Sinegal says he frequently hears from \n     residents who say they have been rejected for jobs at the \n     plants. Overall unemployment here is about 6%, while among \n     blacks it's 14%, he said; the state rate is 4%.\n       ``The bottom line is that the people of Port Arthur are \n     getting the negative byproduct from the plants, but should be \n     getting an abundance of positive byproduct,'' Sinegal said.\n       Valero said the refinery has hired 161 people since Jan. 1, \n     2005. About 20% live in Port Arthur.\n       The city council recently ordered a study on contractors' \n     hiring practices so it can devise a monitoring plan.\n       ``We've let the community down.'' Sinegal said.\n       In late August a group of 28 state lawmakers joined Kelley \n     and others in urging Texas Gov. Rick Perry to block further \n     shipments of VX hydrolysate to Port Arthur. Perry declined to \n     intervene.\n       The latest assessment by state environmental regulators of \n     Port Arthur showed that benzene had dropped to acceptable \n     levels for the first time since 2000. Valero officials said \n     they reduced emissions by more than 82% between 1996 and \n     2005, and had reduced ``upset'' emissions by 98%. Residents, \n     however, still suffer higher rates of progressive pulmonary \n     diseases than people elsewhere in the state.\n       Last year, Motiva agreed to give $3.5 million to help fund \n     medical care, air monitors and a revitalization program for \n     Port Arthur's west side community. The agreement was part of \n     a settlement with Kelley's Community In-Power Development \n     Association, after it challenged the plant's expansion.\n       And, 50 years after Carver Terrace was built, the Port \n     Arthur Housing Authority plans to demolish the units and move \n     residents to new homes throughout the city.\n       Was Carver Terrace's proximity to the refinery the \n     authority's prime motivation? No, said authority chief Cele \n     Quesada. ``Of course, in the back of everyone's mind, there \n     is awareness that we are on the fenceline. We would rather \n     see a green area here than 180 families.''\n       The likely buyer? Motiva Enterprises.\n       Kelley, who was born in Apartment 1202-E in Carver Terrace, \n     commented: ``When you appeal to the conscience of man, how \n     these things are impacting our children. you can get them to \n     see our point. But a lot of the times, the bottom line still \n     wins.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. To get to the gulf coast, tar sands will be transported \nby pipeline through communities in environmentally sensitive areas in \nsix States. We know from experience how harmful this could be, again, \nbecause of how hard it is to clean up after a spill, and we know about \nthe petcoke. I have shown you the petcoke, which is black dust \ncontaining some heavy metals.\n  Open piles of this waste began to appear at unprecedented levels in \nmidwestern communities and it sparked health and environmental concerns \nin many neighborhoods in Detroit and Chicago.\n  Let's take this back and show the Chicago picture again.\n\n[[Page S6040]]\n\n  In this Chicago neighborhood, billowing black clouds of petcoke \nforced Little League players off the baseball field. The children were \nforced to seek cover from the clouds of black dust that pelted homes \nand cars. According to one newspaper, ``Kids that were playing ball \nwere sent scurrying away because the stuff was getting into their eyes, \non to their faces and into their mouths and everything. They just had \nto get the heck out of there.''\n  I would like to enter into the Record at this time an article that \nsays, ``In Chicago, piles of petroleum coke suggest the future of \nCanadian tar sands oil,'' dated November 17, 2014.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record as \nwell.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Marketplace, Nov. 18, 2013]\n\nIn Chicago, Piles of Petroleum Coke Suggest the Future of Canadian Tar \n                               Sands Oil\n\n                           (By Dan Weissmann)\n\n       This summer, residents of Chicago's far southeast side \n     noticed mountains of black dust growing in one corner of the \n     neighborhood. It's petroleum coke--pet coke for short. That's \n     what gasoline refineries produce as a byproduct of refining \n     gasoline. It's full of carbon, sulphur and heavy metals.\n       On August 30, a big wind brought the coke piles to the \n     whole neighborhood's attention. At a baseball field a block \n     or two away, a little league game ended in a hurry.\n       ``Kids that were playing ball were sent scurrying away \n     because the stuff was getting into their eyes and their face \n     and their mouths and everything,'' says Tom Shepherd, a \n     volunteer with the Southeast Environmental Task Force. ``They \n     had to just get the heck out of here.''\n       He calls the 30th ``a day that will live in infamy.'' He \n     says, ``People were calling 911 and saying, `There's a fire! \n     We don't know where the fire is, but the neighborhood's full \n     of smoke.' ''\n       But it wasn't smoke. It was dust from the piles that had \n     been growing throughout the summer.\n       They're a sneak preview of what's ahead. At least some of \n     the dust came from a local BP refinery. It's across the state \n     line in Indiana, but it can be seen from the neighborhood. \n     And that refinery is about to triple the amount of pet-coke \n     it turns out. BP is finishing a huge upgrade this fall, to \n     process oil from Canada's tar sands.\n       That oil is ``heavier'' with elements that get refined out \n     and turned into pet-coke. Post-upgrade, the Indiana refinery \n     will turn out 6,000 tons a day. Eventually, it gets sold as \n     fuel, much of it to countries like Mexico and China. But \n     meanwhile, it piles up.\n       ``It's the most visual part of the success of North \n     American energy independence,'' says Phil Verleger, an \n     economist who studies energy markets.\n       That success has both an upside and a downside: Nearby \n     sources of oil should mean lower fuel prices in the Midwest, \n     which has high gas prices. And more piles of pet coke.\n       ``So the question is,'' Verleger says, ``How do we deal \n     with this pile of black stuff that's bringing us this supply \n     of fuel?''\n       So far, nobody's got an answer.\n       In early November, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan \n     filed a complaint in state court. Her office said the dust \n     from the piles violated environmental regulations. Madigan \n     says she doesn't know exactly what it would take to make pet-\n     coke a good neighbor. ``Well, you know, if it's not safe \n     where it is, it may have to go somewhere else,'' she says.\n       That would be a popular answer on the Southeast Side. Last \n     week, neighbors packed a local church when Illinois EPA \n     officials came to gather input. Again and again, the meeting \n     got stopped by a chant: ``Move the piles! Move the piles!''\n       So far, neighbors have blamed BP and Koch Industries, which \n     owns the yard with Chicago's pet-coke piles. BP and Koch say \n     there's been a misunderstanding so far. BP says that it \n     wasn't actually sending more pet coke than usual to the \n     Chicago yard this summer.\n       Koch has its own explanation for the taller piles: It was \n     moving petroleum coke around in the yards to make room for \n     new safety equipment. It installed big water cannons, which \n     are supposed to keep the piles wet so the dust doesn't blow \n     around. Making room meant more activity, and some piles got \n     taller for a while.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Now when this petcoke started to blow all across the \ncommunities, residents felt they could not safely open the windows \nduring the summer for fear the black clouds would trigger their \nchildren's asthma, and with good reason. We know this type of toxic air \npollution can increase the number and severity of asthma attacks, cause \nor aggravate bronchitis, or contribute to other diseases.\n  Asthma. The Federal Government has said that asthma has become a \nnational epidemic. This is a picture of a little girl who is having a \nhard time breathing.\n  I say to my friend from Kansas, I have another 15 minutes, just for \nhis information.\n  This is a photo of a little girl who is having difficulty breathing \nbecause she has asthma. The Federal Government has said asthma has \nbecome ``a national epidemic''--which is that 1 out of every 12 people, \nor 26 million Americans, and 7 million of these are children. We don't \nneed more asthma. American communities don't need more petcoke. My \nRepublican friends are not going to talk to you about asthma. They are \nnot going to quote the oil companies saying what a great job they are \ndoing preventing it. Ultimately, the Keystone tar sands pipeline \ndecision should be based on whether the project is in the national \ninterest.\n\n  Today I ask rhetorically of my colleagues: How are more Americans \nwith asthma in the national interest? How are more Americans with \ncancer in the national interest? How is it in the national interest \nwhen kids playing baseball have to duck and cover from dangerous \npollution?\n  The health of our children and our families is at stake, and we have \na right to know how tar sands oil will affect our health. \nUnfortunately, we don't have all the information we need to have.\n  Senator Whitehouse and I wrote to Secretary John Kerry and asked for \na comprehensive health impact study on the tar sands oil and how the \nKeystone Pipeline will impact the health of communities across the \nNation. We don't have the studies. Again, Senator Whitehouse and I are \nnot physicians. That is why we stood with the nurses and the doctors.\n  A Gallup poll has found 12 years in a row that nursing is the most \ntrusted profession. So National Nurses United, which is the Nation's \nlargest professional association of registered nurses--185,000 strong--\nhas joined our call for a comprehensive health study.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have their letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       National Nurses United,\n\n                                                   March 13, 2014.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Kerry, On behalf of the 185,000 registered \n     nurses of National Nurses United, we are writing to endorse \n     the request by Senators Barbara Boxer and Sheldon Whitehouse \n     for an immediate, comprehensive State Department study on the \n     human health impacts of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline \n     project.\n       As the State Department must make a national interest \n     determination on whether to approve the pipeline, NNU \n     believes that a project that places the health and safety of \n     Americans at substantial risk cannot possibly be in our \n     national interest\n       Therefore, we call on the State Department to issue an \n     affirmative finding, prior to any final decision on the \n     project, that the Keystone XL pipeline will have no adverse \n     health Impact on the U.S.\n       National Nurses United is the largest US. organization with \n     185,000 members in all 50 states, including those along the \n     proposed path of the pipeline. NNU nurses now care daily for \n     patients with health problems, including asthma, other \n     respiratory disorders, cancer, skin diseases, and other \n     ailments associated with environmental pollution.\n       Our organization has expressed our opposition to the \n     pipeline, in particular to the health hazards already \n     identified with tar sands oil, including tar sands extraction \n     in Alberta, Canada, tar sands pipeline spills, and the \n     effects of tar sands refining.\n\n\n                        Tar Sands Health Hazards\n\n       In Alberta's Athabasca region, researchers have linked tar \n     sands pollutants to carcinogens, elevated rates of leukemia \n     and other cancers of the lymph and blood-forming systems. \n     Water bodies within the watershed adjacent to tar sands \n     production have been found to be contaminated with chemicals \n     linked to cancer, genetic damage, birth defects, and organ \n     damage, according to a National Academy of Sciences 2012 \n     study.\n       Tar sands pipeline spills are a significant concern. The \n     2010 Kalamazoo River spill in Michigan--the effects of which \n     are still being felt by that community--resulted in \n     inhalation of benzene and other chemicals and more than 150 \n     cases of illness. Michigan's Department of Public Health \n     identified cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, \n     ocular, dermal and respiratory impacts. Similarly, following \n     a 2013 spill near Mayflower, AK. residents reported \n     persistent coughs, headaches, nausea, and respiratory \n     problems for months afterwards.\n       Refining raw bitumen from the tar sands is also likely to \n     have a negative impact on health. Tar sands contains up to 11 \n     times more sulfur than conventional crude oil with high \n     levels of sulfur compounds linked to serious ailments of the \n     nervous and respiratory systems. Residents of South East\n\n[[Page S6041]]\n\n     Texas, particularly refinery towns like Port Arthur and \n     Houston, already live in known `cancer zones.' Refining raw \n     bitumen from the tar sands threatens to make a bad situation \n     worse.\n       Further, the petroleum coke byproduct of tar sands refining \n     dumped in large ``petcoke'' piles contains high \n     concentrations of mercury, lead, arsenic, chromium, vanadium, \n     and nickel. Black dust clouds from petcoke piles in Detroit \n     and Chicago have led to neighborhood evacuations amidst \n     concerns about acculumation in homes and areas where children \n     play. The EPA has said the particulate matter in the dust \n     contributes to such health effects as heart attacks, \n     decreased lung function, asthma and premature death.\n\n\n                       Climate Change and Health\n\n       NNU is also concerned about the long term contribution that \n     tar sands oil and the Keystone pipeline will make to the \n     global rise on greenhouse gas emissions and the climate \n     crisis.\n       In its Fourth Assessment Review (2007) the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made a direct \n     connection between global warming and climate instability to \n     a wide range of negative health outcomes.\n       Higher air temperatures can increase bacteria-related food \n     poisoning, such as salmonella, and animal-borne diseases such \n     as West Nile virus. Ground level ozone contaminants can \n     damage lung tissue, reduce lung function, and increase \n     respiratory ailments. Pediatricians have said they are \n     already witnessing a rise in vector-borne diseases including \n     diarrhea, cholera, gastroenteritis, typhoid, and hepatitis \n     due to environmental factors and the effects of climate \n     change.\n       For several years NNU has been dispatching teams of RN \n     volunteers to provide disaster relief in response to weather \n     disasters, such as Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina, and most \n     recently Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, all of which many \n     experts believe are fueled by climate change. Our members \n     have provided care for thousands of patients who have \n     suffered serious injuries as well as the loss of family \n     members, their homes, and their livelihoods.\n\n\n                       We need a change of course\n\n       NNU concurs with Senators Boxer and Whitehouse that what is \n     known today about the health hazards associated with the \n     expansion of the tar sands could well be just a sampling of a \n     much larger set of significant risks to human health. NNU \n     believes that the health consequences of Keystone XL have \n     been substantially ignored in State Departments FEIS, and \n     needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.\n       Nurses and their families are also affected by \n     environmental pollution, and the increased harm associated \n     with Keystone XL, greater tar sands operations, and the \n     climate crisis. It is for our patients, our members, our \n     families, and our communities, that we speak out, and urge \n     you order an immediate health impact study and not authorize \n     a pipeline that will harm our planet and our health.\n           Sincerely,\n     Deborah Burger, RN,\n     Karen Higgins, RN,\n     Jean Ross, RN,\n       Council of Presidents, National Nurses United.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. The nurses concur with Senators Boxer and Whitehouse that \nwhat is known today about the health hazards associated with the \nexpansion of tar sands is just a sampling. They believe the \nconsequences of Keystone XL have been substantially ignored in the \nState Department's final EIS, and it needs to be addressed.\n  The American Public Health Association wrote a letter, and I ask \nunanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record as well.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         American Public Health Association, National Association \n           of County & City Health Officials,\n                                                   April 11, 2014.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Kerry: We write in support of the request of \n     Senators Barbara Boxer and Sheldon Whitehouse that the U.S. \n     Department of State conduct a comprehensive study of the \n     health impacts of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, \n     including a review of the available peer-reviewed research on \n     the health impacts from the processing of tar sands.\n       Our organizations support the concept of ``health in all \n     policies'' and the consideration of potential health impacts \n     in all decisionmaking. There is an increasing recognition \n     that the environments in which people live, work, learn and \n     play have a tremendous impact on their health. The \n     administration will certainly benefit by having a clear \n     understanding of how the proposed Keystone XL pipeline could \n     impact the public's health, including the health of our most \n     vulnerable citizens.\n       The full spectrum of health considerations are often \n     overlooked in important decisions and their omission can lead \n     to policies and practices that are unnecessarily harmful to \n     public health. We thank you for your consideration and \n     strongly urge you to respond positively to the senators' \n     request for a comprehensive study of the health impacts of \n     this proposed project.\n           Sincerely,\n     Georges Benjamin, MD,\n       Executive Director.\n     Robert M. Pestronk,\n       Executive Director.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. They say the same thing.\n  There is an increasing recognition that the environments in which \npeople live, work, and learn have a tremendous impact on their health. \nThe administration will certainly benefit by having a better \nunderstanding of how the proposed Keystone Pipeline could impact the \npublic health.\n  They go on to say: The full spectrum of health considerations are \noften overlooked, and their omission can lead to policies and practices \nthat are unnecessarily harmful to the public health.\n  Maybe Senators feel they know more than doctors and nurses. Maybe \nthey do. Good luck. They don't. We should listen to doctors and nurses \njust like we should listen to scientists when they talk to us about \nclimate change.\n  This whole thing of saying ``I am not a scientist,'' yes, that is \nright, you are not, Republicans. Listen to the scientists. This answer \nis perplexing to me. If you are not a scientist, then be humble and \nlisten to the peer-reviewed scientists. If you are not a doctor or a \nnurse, be humble. They don't have a special interest; they have an \ninterest in giving us information on which we should base our \ndecisions.\n  Now I am going to talk about the environment. This pipeline is going \nto go through the Ogallala Aquifer--one of the world's largest \nunderground sources of freshwater. It provides water to farms in eight \nStates, accounting for a quarter of the Nation's cropland as well as \nmunicipal drinking wells. Remember what I said before: When this oil \ngets into water, it is the most difficult oil to clean up because it is \nso heavy. Well, there are 2,537 wells within 1 mile of the proposed \npipeline, including 39 public water supply wells, and 20 private wells \nwithin 100 feet of the pipeline right-of-way. If the pipeline were to \nleak near the aquifer, the tar sands oil would quickly seep into the \nsandy soil and contaminate the water supply for millions of people. I \nhave already shown you a spill in Arkansas. These spills happen. If a \nspill occurred near any of these aquifers, it would be tragic.\n  Local residents know the harm the pipeline could cause. I will show \nyou pictures of locals objecting to the pipeline.\n  In April, a group of ranchers, farmers, and tribal leaders gathered \nin Washington, DC, for a rally. They wanted to send a strong signal to \nCongress that they want their way of life protected--their farms, their \ntribal lands, and their ranches.\n  You are going to hear from proponents of the tar sands who will say \nthe Keystone Pipeline will be a safe alternative to rail shipment of \noil, but experience tells us otherwise.\n  In 2010 that pipeline ruptured, spilled over 1 million gallons in \nMichigan. The local health department ordered the evacuation of 50 \nhouseholds, and approximately 100 families were advised not to drink \nwater. One resident living near the Kalamazoo River had to abandon her \nhome because the stench from the spill made her dizzy, nauseous, and \nsick--classic signs of acute exposure to tar sands. Another resident \nwho was pregnant said she could not breathe. She said:\n\n       My eyes were burning, and my nose was burning. It smelled \n     like a diesel tanker had turned over in the front of my \n     house.\n\n  You will not hear this from the proponents.\n  The Michigan spill was the largest inland spill in history, and more \nthan 4 years and $1 billion later, it is not cleaned up. This summer \nparts of the Kalamazoo River were closed as dredging efforts continued \nto remove oil from the bottom of the river.\n  Earlier I spoke about Arkansas. Residents were exposed to benzene--a \nknown carcinogen--and hydrogen sulfide. People suffered from dizziness, \nnausea, headaches, respiratory problems--all classic symptoms of \nexposure to the chemicals found in the tar sands.\n  There is a section of tar sands that has already been built in the \ngulf region, and it is already experiencing problems that could result \nin a pipeline spill, but you will not hear that from\n\n[[Page S6042]]\n\nthe proponents. According to Bloomberg Businessweek, the Pipeline and \nHazardous Materials Safety Administration, PHMSA, found a systemic \nproblem with substandard wells on a portion of the pipeline. In fact, \nduring 1 week when the pipeline was being monitored, regulators found \nthat over 70 percent of the wells were flawed and required repairs.\n  Senators should pay attention to the facts. People are sick around \nthe tar sands. When it spills, it threatens their way of life and \nphysically harms them. All you have to look to is the evidence to see \nthat ``XL'' stands for ``extra lethal'' and misery follows the tar \nsands.\n  Now I am going to talk about the climate. I wish to explain that once \nwe begin transporting the dirty tar sands oil through that pipeline, it \nwill unleash more carbon pollution and harm our Nation's effort to \naddress dangerous climate change. The State Department says a barrel of \ntar sands oil will create at least 17 percent more carbon pollution \nthan domestic oil. The State Department says that compared to average \ncrude oil, burning the amount of tar sands oil from the Keystone \n``extra lethal'' Pipeline could add an additional 27.4 million metric \ntons of carbon pollution each year. That is a fact. You don't hear the \nproponents talk about that.\n  (Mr. SCHATZ assumed the Chair).\n  The Senator from Hawaii has now taken over the Chair. He already \nknows what climate change is doing to Hawaii. I was in the State, and I \ntook a tour. I was at a conference that he organized, and we know we \ncan't afford this.\n  If we allow this to happen, we would see the carbon pollution that \nwould come from adding 5.8 million new cars to the road. It would wipe \nout the carbon pollution reductions we gained from the first round of \nfuel economy improvements for heavy-duty trucks--wiped out.\n  I believe this is a fact: If we do this, the damage to the \nenvironment will be the equivalent of eight new coal-fired plants, and \nthose are dirty. That is the equivalent of what we would be getting \nhere in terms of the carbon pollution every year.\n  In August 2014 a study in the peer-reviewed journal ``Nature Climate \nChange'' estimated that the increase in oil consumption caused by \nKeystone XL could result in up to 110 million metric tons of carbon \npollution each year. That is four times the State Department's high-end \nestimate.\n  I already talked about the eight coal-fired plants. This peer-\nreviewed study says it is 29. We have two estimates. One says it is the \nequivalent of building 8 new, dirty coal-fired powerplants, and another \npeer-reviewed study said it would be equal to building 29 new coal-\nfired powerplants here in the United States--29. Think about it in your \nmind's eye.\n  All you need to do is look at China to see what happens when you \nthrow the environment under the bus. Is this the kind of world we want \nto see for our kids? Is this the future? This isn't hyperbole; this is \na picture of the pollution in China.\n  I was in China on a fantastic trade trip for 10 days, and I never saw \nthe Sun except for one day when it sort of peaked out. The guide said: \nIsn't it a beautiful day? No, it was not at all a beautiful day. There \nwas a semblance of a little Sun behind the cloud.\n  Why do you think people love the Environmental Protection Agency in \nour country--70 percent strong? It is because they know this could be \nAmerica. If you throw the environment under the bus, this is what it \nwill look like here.\n  Some of my colleagues say they don't want to the act on climate \nchange--especially my Republican colleagues. I don't know of one who is \nready. They say: Well, China is building coal-fired plants. Well, the \nPresident just came back, and the President did have an agreement with \nChina to move forward because the Chinese people can't live like this \nanymore. The social unrest that is the big fear of Beijing that starts \nto bubble up has a lot to do with this. We have a breakthrough \nagreement. Is this the time, in the face of this progress, to approve \nthis pipeline? I say it is ridiculous timing. It is ridiculous.\n  I remember a time when saving the environment was bipartisan. I \nremember leaders such as John Chafee and John Warner. Now I don't see \none Republican ready to step forward and say: It is time to put a price \non this pollution and stop this pollution. My State has done it. My \nState is doing just great. We have new jobs, and I will put some \ninformation into the Record on that.\n  Canada's Natural Resources Minister said:\n\n       In order for crude oil production to grow, the North \n     American pipeline network must be expanded. So we know this \n     is just the start.\n\n  Now climate. Everyone can say what they will: I am not a scientist; I \ndon't know. Over the past few months we have seen everything from the \nhottest August, the hottest September on record, and the hottest \nOctober on record. We have seen historic droughts and extreme \nwildfires. I have seen them in my State. We have seen vanishing \nwildlife habitat in Alaska, toxic algae out of control and \ncontaminating drinking water supplies in Toledo, OH, because the water \nis getting hot and the algae that couldn't survive in the colder waters \nsurvives in the warmer waters. We see these wake-up calls every day. \nBut instead of confronting that crisis, we have the party of no saying: \nNo, I am not a scientist and, no, I will not listen to them, and we do \nnothing. This project does the opposite. It makes matters worse.\n  There is a lot of talk about how we need this oil to become energy \nindependent. Let me tell my colleagues, we are going to see gas prices \ngo up if this goes forward, and I will explain why. This is from \neconomists, not from me. This is not a win for America. Big Oil will be \nthe winner. We have to know that U.S. gasoline demand is on the \ndecline, and economists say it will continue to be through 2040. Since \n2011, the United States has exported more gasoline, diesel, and other \nfuels than it imported. So Big Oil will be the big winner now if this \nproject moves forward, not American workers or families filling up at \nthe gas pump.\n  The reality is Keystone ``extra lethal'' will increase the price \nAmericans pay for gas at the pump. It is cheaper to buy gas in the \nMidwest today than it would be if the pipeline were built. That is \nbecause moving tar sand oil to the gulf coast gives it access to \ninternational markets, which will increase the price Canadians can \ncharge for it. So right now that oil stays in America. Now it is going \nto be pumped out, they can get higher prices, and our prices are going \nto go up. The exports will reduce the supply of gasoline right here in \nAmerica and drive up the price.\n  As Bloomberg reported earlier this year, three separate studies have \nshown Keystone XL Pipeline could raise domestic prices by 20 to 40 \ncents because it would divert Canadian oil away from refineries in the \nMidwest where it is easier to export. Gulf coast refiners plan to \nprocess the cheap Canadian tar sands crude that would be supplied by \nthe pipeline into diesel and other products for export.\n  During a congressional hearing at the end of 2011, my Senate \ncolleague, then-Congressman Ed Markey, who is now a member of our \nenvironment committee--Senator Markey--asked TransCanada's pipeline \nhead if the company would commit to keeping the Canadian oil and refine \nproducts in the United States ``so that this country realizes all of \nthe energy security benefits your company had promised.'' Mr. Pourbaix \nsaid, No, I can't do that.\n  So the head of TransCanada is not promising to keep the oil here or \nthe products here. We know that. So all of this talk of energy \nindependence--let me tell my colleagues how we get energy independence. \nWe produce what we can here, and we have been doing that where it is \nappropriate, and we also utilize the Sun and the wind and the \ngeothermal and the clean energies of the future that, believe me, when \nwe embrace that clean energy agenda, we have far more jobs. We don't \nhave pollution. We have safer communities.\n  One refinery in Port Arthur owned by Valero is expected to be a major \ncustomer for crude oil. Let's show that picture of Port Arthur. Because \nthat refinery is in a foreign trade zone, Valero can operate tax free. \nIn the fist 9 months of this year, Valero has reported a net income of \n$2.475 billion. Today we will also hear from tar sands advocates that \nthe tar sands oil will just be shipped by rail even if the tar sands \npipeline is not built. It is very\n\n[[Page S6043]]\n\nexpensive to ship it by rail, and the truth is it is not a clear-cut \ncase. In fact, both the rail companies and tar sands producers that \npioneered transporting Canadian tar sands oil by rail are on the verge \nof insolvency because of the high transportation costs. So don't buy \ninto the argument that if we don't build the pipeline, we will just \nship it by rail. Then they say it is safer, and we know it is not \nsafer.\n  We just heard the operator of the pipeline say it is 35 permanent \njobs. I don't belittle the 1,900 construction jobs for 2 years we would \nhave. I don't belittle that. But I can truly tell my colleagues that \ncoming from my State--and later I will talk about the successes--we can \ndwarf that by the hundreds of thousands if we truly embrace a clean \nenergy economy.\n  The materials needed for the pipeline--that is not a domestic boon. A \n2011 analysis found 50 percent or more of the steel pipe would be \nmanufactured outside of the United States. We need clean energy \npolicies. As we know, it is appropriate to drill for oil in our country \nwhere it is safe, where it is appropriate, and if we can get to clean \ncoal, it is appropriate, and it is appropriate if we can get to safe \nnuclear. The fact is this pipeline is going to bring filthy, dirty oil. \nIt is going to bring misery all across the country.\n  Let's look at the wind industry which supports over 560 manufacturing \nfacilities and supported over 50,000 full-time jobs in 2013 alone. So \n50,000 full-time jobs compared to 35 full-time jobs for the pipeline? \nCome on. The solar industry in 2013 employed 142,000 Americans, an \nincrease of 24,000 additional jobs just last year. This is the future, \nnot the misery that follows the tar sands, not communities that have to \nsuffer with the filthiest of oils, dirtiest of oils, and not having \nthis petcoke stored all over the Midwest where it blows on kids so kids \nget asthma.\n  Here is the spill in Arkansas. They still can't clean it up. It \nhappened in 2013. This photograph isn't what we want the future to look \nlike--not this, having to wear masks. We want the air to be clean and \nthe water to be clean. This is China. This is what happens when we \nignore our people who are telling us they are having increased asthma \nattacks, increased respiratory disease. We are not going to hear a word \nabout it from my colleagues. They are going to make a jobs argument \nthat falls flat on its face.\n\n  Look. We know climate change is real. Whether someone says they are \nnot a scientist--we all know you are not a scientist. I am not a \nscientist. Climate change is real. Unleashing this filthy, dirty oil \nunleashes far more carbon and makes the problem worse. We are not going \nto hear any of that. We are going to hear claims that just aren't true. \nWe are going to hear about all of these jobs--35 permanent jobs \ncompared to tens of thousands in clean energy. We are going to hear \nabout how this is the greatest project. We are going to hear, Oh, it is \nbetter to transport it by pipeline than by rail, when in fact that is \nnot a fact in evidence that they would do that because it is so \nexpensive. They are not going to talk to us about the spills, as shown \nin this photograph.\n  We have a very important process to go through before this pipeline \nis approved. This legislation derails that process, and that process \nwas established by an executive order and was updated by President \nGeorge W. Bush. Before a finding is made as to whether this should go \nforward, the President must consult with experts in many Federal \nagencies to determine whether this pipeline is in the national \ninterest. This includes the Department of Defense, the Department of \nHomeland Security, and other agencies before a permit is granted. This \nbill before the Senate short circuits this review. It cuts off expert \nopinions of our military leaders and others when determining whether \nthe pipeline is safe. Is it in the interests of the country? Is it \ngoing to be another target? We need to know, and we don't have the \nanswers on the full public health implications.\n  What is also interesting is the tar sands supporters gloss over the \nfact that this bill tramples States rights--the rights of citizens in \nSouth Dakota to have a say in their State's ongoing proceedings \nconcerning construction of the pipeline. How about this fact. Here we \nsee it. These voices have to be heard. I will tell my colleagues, 2 \nmillion people submitted comments on the tar sands project, and passing \nthis bill now does not allow those comments to be given due \nconsideration by our country.\n  I am very surprised at this, given my colleagues who speak of States \nrights, public comments, local viewpoints. They want to bypass all of \nthis because they have decided they know better than 2 million people, \nmany of whom have to live side by side with this pipeline and many of \nwhom would have to breathe the kind of air they are breathing in Port \nArthur, TX, right now. I will guarantee my colleagues this: Not one \nSenator in this Chamber will live next to a refinery that refines this \nfilthy, dirty oil--not one. If I have not spoken the truth, please \ncorrect the Record. Tell me. I will apologize. We don't live near \nrefineries here. I will tell my colleagues who does: a lot of kids who \nget asthma, just ask the nurses.\n  If I told people that if we embrace a clean energy agenda we could \ncreate far more jobs, be far more healthy, and save this planet, \nwouldn't people say yes? I think people would. But, no, not in this \nChamber. They listen to Big Oil and the Koch brothers, and these are \nthe people who will profit. They are not going to live next to the Port \nArthur refinery. Their children aren't going to live there. Their \ngrandchildren aren't going to live there.\n  They brush aside that this is filthy, dirty oil--the dirtiest--with \nthe most dangerous pollutants, including lead, including sulfur. When \nwe meet with the citizens of Port Arthur, TX, as I have done, and the \nactivists there who want to protect the kids, they say: Please, we have \nenough of this stuff; we don't want any more. Misery follows the tar \nsands, and that is why I call this pipeline the Keystone XL ``extra \nlethal'' Pipeline.\n  The evidence is clear. The Keystone tar sands pipeline will be \nharmful to our family's health. It will hurt the environment. It will \nworsen the impact on climate change. It will raise the price of gas. \nThese statements are not made by me. I respect economists, and this is \nclearly the economists' view. It is just plain dangerous because it \nwill transport the dirtiest oil on the planet.\n  Forcing the approval of the Keystone when so many concerns remain \ndoes not allow for the kind of review our affected communities deserve.\n  I hope enough of my colleagues will vote no on this. I see the \nhandwriting on the wall. I do. I know what happens in this Chamber. I \nknow the votes will eventually be there. This is an issue which impacts \nthe health and safety of our families and our planet, so if it means I \nwill have to stand up here time and time again to tell the story of the \nKeystone ``extra lethal'' Pipeline, I will do it. I will do it for as \nlong as it takes. If I didn't think it was important, I wouldn't do it.\n  I just hope that if this body does pass this pipeline today, the \nPresident will veto this dangerous legislation. I feel so strongly that \nthe way to a prosperous job-producing future is the embracing of clean \nenergy. Yes, we will continue with our coal and make it as clean as we \ncan. We will continue with our drilling here. Yes, we will have an \n``all of the above'' where it is safe to do. We don't need a project \nthat is so harmful to our families and to our communities.\n  I talked to the people in Canada who live near there. You won't hear \nthat from my friends. It is all in the Record. I hope they read the \narticles I placed in the Record about the kinds of cancers we are \nseeing around this stuff.\n  I don't want to see a trail of misery extending from one end of the \ncountry that I love to another, so I hope we will vote no on this--\nenough of us will. But if we can't stop it today, then I hope the \nPresident will veto this and tell the story of why this trail of misery \nshould not be put upon the American people.\n  One of the biggest shocks I think I had when meeting those Canadians \nwho have been putting up with this and then meeting the Americans who \nlive around these refineries and hearing from them what happened and \nhearing from my friends from Chicago who remember that story--we will \nclose with this--of these kids sitting around getting ready to play \nLittle League Baseball when all of this petroleum coke that is stored \nall over the Midwest just blew, and it got into the mouths of\n\n[[Page S6044]]\n\nthese kids and it got on their clothes. They ran away. How can anyone \nbelieve this is what the future should look like when I can show you \ncase after case on the Record, substantiated by the numbers, that clean \nenergy produces far more jobs--far more jobs--and will lead us in the \nright direction in terms of our health.\n  People don't want to become like China. They don't want to look like \nthis. They don't want to have their air look like this.\n  I come from a State where before the Clean Air Act--by the way, it \nwas done by a Republican President; thank you, Richard Nixon--we had \ndirty, filthy air. You couldn't see a foot in front of you. We cleaned \nit up because we stood up to the polluters and said: You know what, we \nknow we want to work with you, and we want to have your product. Do it \nin a clean manner. Do it in a safe manner.\n  The EPA--again, created by Republicans--came in there and cleaned up \nthe air, along with the local people in our State.\n  We have rebounded in California from the recession, with clean energy \njobs leading the way. We are so proud of it. And our people can still \nsee the sky.\n  I will tell you, I am not going to go in this direction, if I have to \nstand on my feet until they hurt. As you know, I have to wear heels \nbecause I am very little, but I don't care--I am not going to let us go \nin this direction. No way.\n  I hope we defeat this today. If we don't, I hope the President will \nveto it, and I hope we can move to a positive, bipartisan clean-energy \nagenda that is really the future of this Nation and this planet.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I intend to speak under the time reserved by Senator \nHoeven. Could the Presiding Officer tell me how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 112 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Splendid. I intend to speak for about 8 minutes.\n  I admire the commitment, the perseverance, and the oratory skills of \nmy colleague from the State of California. I know how strongly she \nfeels about this issue.\n  I rise today without a portfolio. I do not have the charts my \ndistinguished colleague has. Senator Hoeven has six in the Cloakroom. \nThere are 12 over there. I thought at one time I would introduce \nlegislation to ban charts from the floor, but that didn't go very far.\n  I rise today in support of the bipartisan, bicameral legislation \noffered by Representative Cassidy from the House and Senator Landrieu \nfrom here in the Senate to approve the construction of the Keystone \nPipeline.\n  (Mrs. BOXER assumed the Chair.)\n  Simply put, my point would be that this project is long overdue. It \nhas been said time and again, but it is worth repeating: 6 years of \ndelays and five separate environmental impact statements, and finally \nwe are voting on this legislation--already passed by the House last \nweek--to grant approval of the project.\n  Let me repeat myself. Five environmental impact statements have been \nrolled out since the year 2010, all five concluding that construction \nof the pipeline would neither exasperate carbon emissions nor increase \ndevelopment of the Canadian oil sands.\n  Let's briefly take a look at the conclusion reached by each of the \nfive environmental impact statements to see what President Obama's own \nState Department had to say about whether construction of the Keystone \nPipeline is in the national interest.\n  In April 2010, after a 1\\1/2\\-year review of TransCanada's \napplication to construct the pipeline, the State Department published \nthe findings of its draft environmental impact statement, which \nconcluded that the pipeline's construction would have limited \nenvironmental impact and would help reduce U.S. reliance on crude oil \nimports from other less stable regions of the world. ``Less stable'' is \nan understatement as of today. Considering what is going on right now \nin the Middle East and Russia, it cannot be understated how important \nthis project is from a global security perspective and also from a \nnational security perspective.\n  A year later, in April 2011, the State Department issued a \nsupplemental environmental impact statement to consider alternatives to \nthe Keystone Pipeline and to address some of the concerns raised by \nagencies, groups, and individuals who submitted comments on the \nproject's construction. Keep in mind that the State Department did this \ndespite the fact that it believed the original environmental impact \nstatement sufficiently addressed all concerns.\n  Four months later, in August 2011, the State Department released its \nfinal environmental impact statement concluding yet again that this \nproject should be built. The State Department concluded that \nconstruction would ``result in a project that would have a degree of \nsafety greater than any typically constructed domestic oil pipeline \nsystem under current regulations.''\n  Despite this conclusion--which under law triggered a 90-day window \nfor the State Department to make yet another final national interest \ndetermination--the State Department decided to delay the final decision \nrather conveniently until after the 2012 elections.\n  After three earlier reviews, in March of 2013 the State Department \nissued its draft supplemental environmental impact statement to \nconsider potential impacts of the new route which would avoid the Sand \nHills region in Nebraska. Once again, the State Department concluded \nthat this project should be built.\n  Finally, on January 31, 2014--about a year ago--the State Department \nissued its fifth and final environmental impact statement. \nNevertheless, it concluded that the Keystone Pipeline poses no serious \nenvironmental dangers, would create thousands of jobs, and would \ndecrease our reliance on crude from despotic regimes--more of them \ntoday--around the world and expand trade with our closest ally, Canada.\n  We have two options. The first is to finalize construction of the \nKeystone Pipeline, which will immediately result in thousands of \nconstruction jobs all throughout the United States. The second option \nis we can reject construction of this pipeline and instead transport \nthe crude to the United States by rail or allow Canada to simply export \nthe crude to other countries, such as our good friend China. China is \nso concerned with the environmental standards that it may--it may, \naccording to the bargain so highly publicized by the administration--\nbegin reducing carbon emissions by 2030 if the leaders of China 16 \nyears from now feel like it or make that decision.\n\n  What is the big deal about China's carbon-reduction commitment, by \nthe way? It is meaningless.\n  There is simply no option available that would somehow prevent Canada \nfrom developing these oil sands. Despite what any Senator says or any \ncharts that may be used, it is happening and it will continue to \nhappen.\n  Facts are stubborn things. We either move this oil by pipeline, which \nis the safest way to transport oil, or we allow it to be exported to \nother countries that will refine it under far less stringent \nenvironmental regulations. If CO2 is a world problem, that \nis something you ought to really think about.\n  This project would support 42,000 U.S. jobs, hundreds of those in my \nhome State of Kansas; it would provide over 800,000 barrels of oil per \nday from our closest trading partner, Canada; and it would have a $3 \nbillion impact on the U.S. economy.\n  I have long supported this legislation. Now we need to hear from \nPresident Obama, yes or no. No waffling around any longer. If this bill \npasses today will the President sign it into law or will the President \nsimply continue to straddle the pipeline until after the runoff \nelection in Louisiana? It seems to me the President owes the American \npeople an answer as to whether he supports this project.\n  The question is--it is pretty obvious--if the President opposed this \nproject from ever being built, then why are we waiting? Why wouldn't \nyou just say from the get-go that you hold the views of a few above \nthose of most Americans, which includes everybody from labor unions, to \npro-energy trade associations, to manufacturing, et cetera?\n  I would ask the President: Why didn't you just come out in 2008 and \nsay, no, we are never going to build this as long as I am in the White \nHouse. Because I think that is exactly\n\n[[Page S6045]]\n\nwhat is happening. It is time to quit straddling the pipeline. Let's \nget on with it or get off.\n  I want to make myself clear. If we pass this bill and President Obama \nvetoes it, then that is his decision, that is his prerogative, but the \nresponsibility will lie squarely upon his desk. Because when we come \nback in January under a Republican majority, our task will be to not \nonly pass this legislation but, with a veto-proof majority, to override \nwhatever obstacles the President tries to put in its way.\n  Again, this project makes sense economically, environmentally, and \nfrom a national security perspective. I believe we should get this \nfinally moving.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I rise today to oppose S. 2280, a bill \nto approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. The Keystone Pipeline would carry \n830,000 barrels per day of tar sands oil bound for global markets from \nCanada to refineries along the gulf coast.\n  This is one of the most important points about Keystone, which is \nthat it does nothing for American energy security. It takes tar sands \noil from Canada, moves it through the United States, and makes it \navailable to global markets. It does nothing for American energy \nsecurity. But more than that, it represents a massive endorsement of a \nfossil fuel economy when we ought to be focusing on transitioning to \nclean energy.\n  There are many reasons to vote against this bill, but I will focus on \nfour. First, the oil from tar sands is exceptionally dirty. I think for \nthe American public out there, they have a basic instinct that oil is \nnot the cleanest of energy resources. But tar sands oils are really in \na special category. We do not need this oil enough to justify its \nimpacts on health and climate change.\n  Mining tar sands oil is nothing like setting up a rig and drilling a \nhole in the ground. Tar sands are dirty in terms of the land destroyed, \ndirty in terms of the water wasted and contaminated, and dirty in terms \nof the energy needed to mine, transport, and process the oil. Getting \nand using oil from tar sands puts far more carbon pollution in the \natmosphere than conventional oil.\n  When tar sands are near the surface, they are dug up along with all \nof the surrounding earth, including the forests that sit on top. Tar \nsands are a mixture of sand, clay, water, and a gooey form of petroleum \nthat resembles tar. Think of it as a mixture of dirt and molasses, and \nimagine trying to separate the dirt from the molasses. If you think \nthat sounds difficult, you are correct. After being mined, the thick \nsludgy mixture that remains is transported to facilities that separate \nthe oil using multiple water and energy-intensive rinse cycles.\n  The water used in this process becomes contaminated, of course, with \ntoxins, and is no longer suitable for other uses. Oil companies use \nmassive amounts of water to mine the tar sands. In 2011, tar sands \nmining in Canada used more water than the entire city of Toronto uses \nannually, representing a significant new strain on freshwater \nresources.\n  This is simply not the direction to go in. We need to fight climate \nchange and promote bold, clean energy solutions that do not present a \nconstant danger of harming our health, our drinking water, and our \neconomy. Why are we spending time today trying to approve something \nthat quite literally takes us in the wrong direction?\n  This brings me to the second reason this pipeline ought to be \nrejected. It will have a direct, negative impact on the people and the \ncommunities that live in its path. The 875-mile route of this proposed \npipeline has over 50 river crossings, including the Yellowstone River \nin Montana, which is still recovering from a major crude oil leak by an \nExxonMobil pipeline in 2011. That pipeline leak contaminated 85 miles \nof the river and its flood plain, placing an enormous burden on \nfamilies and the businesses that depend on it.\n  Pipelines transport oil, but they also leak regularly. The existing \nKeystone Pipeline system for Canadian tar sands leaked 14 times during \nits first year of operation, with one incident leaking 21,000 gallons. \nIn its environmental review, the State Department estimated that the \nproposed Keystone Pipeline would fail several times a year. In 2010, a \n6-foot break in a pipeline carrying oil tar sands spilled nearly 1 \nmillion gallons of crude oil into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan. This \nwas one of the largest inland oil spills in United States history and \nalso one of the costliest, with cleanup costs totaling over $1 billion. \nHouseholds in the area were evacuated and told not to drink the water. \nThirty-five miles of the river were contaminated, and the cleanup \ncontinued 4 years after the spill. One of the most troubling things \nabout this spill and any future spills from Keystone XL is that the \ncompanies who own the oil take advantage of a loophole in the law that \nlets them avoid paying their fair share into the national Oil Spill \nLiability Trust Fund. This trust fund has been in place for 30 years. \nThe money in it helps to respond to and clean up after oilspills. Every \nbarrel of oil produced or imported in the United States is charged 8 \ncents. The money goes into a trust fund. It is basically an insurance \npolicy for events when companies are unable to pay for spill cleanup or \nin an emergency response situation. It makes sense.\n  What does not make sense is that due to this loophole, the oil from \nthe tar sands in Canada is exempt from that 8-cent fee. Why would we \nvote for a bill that circumvents executive review of an international \npipeline carrying the dirtiest oil in the world, produced in Canada, \nand headed mostly for world markets, and a bill that does nothing to \nclose a loophole exempting oil from tar sands from having to pay a fee \nfor environmental cleanup? In other words, how can this bill ask so \nlittle of the oil companies while giving them so much?\n  A third reason to reject this bill and this pipeline is the impact on \nclimate change. The facts plainly show that we must reduce carbon \npollution, not add to it. To take care of our energy future and build a \nclean energy economy, we have got to go forward, not backward.\n  If we are serious about leaving our children a healthy world, we will \nvote no and reject this pipeline. We know a majority of the public \nsupports bold action to solve climate change. In recent years, no \nsingle issue related to fossil fuels and climate change has commanded \nthe level of civic engagement as the Keystone XL Pipeline. Countless \nrallies, public hearings in cities and towns across the proposed route, \nlawsuits and debates in Congress reveal how much passion there is about \nthis issue.\n  In fact, the pipeline was booed so loudly when advertised on the \nJumbotron at a Nebraska football game that the university cut ties with \nTransCanada, the owner of the proposed pipeline.\n  Finally, the bill is flawed in terms of its process not only because \nof what it seeks to do but also because how it seeks to do it.\n  The bill would circumvent existing executive branch review. Because \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline would cross international boundaries, the \nState Department is responsible for reviewing and deciding if a permit \nis in the national interest. The way it is currently written, this bill \npotentially limits State and local siting decisions, as well as some \nlegal challenges.\n  It attempts to approve a pipeline that does not even have a finalized \nroute, but does have lawsuits pending against it in the Nebraska \nSupreme Court. Congress should be focusing on the things that will have \na positive impact on the economy and jobs. We have got to pass \nimmigration legislation, we need to pass a defense authorization. Our \nCR expires on December 11. We need to move through the regular order in \nterms of appropriations. We should not be moving forward with Keystone \nXL.\n  In my view, this is about whether we are committed to the past or \ncommitted to the future. This is about whether we are going to double \ndown on fossil fuels or we are going to take bold action in terms of \nmoving forward with clean energy. I urge my colleagues to oppose this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Let me just state to all of my colleagues on all sides \nof this issue, I appreciate this very much. It is a great debate. It is \na great way for us to learn of our differences and try to find the \nmiddle, if you will.\n\n[[Page S6046]]\n\n  I come from the little State of West Virginia where basically the \npeople are pretty commonsense, if you will, oriented. They look at \nsomething from the standpoint--our greatest trading partner in our \nState of West Virginia is Canada. Thirty-five States in the United \nStates look at Canada as our favored nation to trade with. We have been \ndoing more trading than ever before. We will continue to do so.\n  I am coming at this from security. How do we remain secure as a \nnation? How do we become less dependent? If you look at what is going \non in the world, maybe it will give you a picture of what we are \ndealing with, the facts of life.\n  We all want to use the technology and we all can, through research \nand development, improve our technology to use the resources that are \ngoing to be used that the world has produced for us in a cleaner \nfashion. With that being said, I do not look at Keystone as being an \nexport pipeline. Even the State Department's environmental impact \nstatement states that export is unlikely to be economically justified \nfor any significant time. Cost-to-market conditions dictate that this \noil will go to domestic refiners and will be used in our country, the \nUnited States of America.\n  By getting more Canadian oil, we can displace oil that we currently \nget from less reliable and sometimes hostile countries. Let me read for \nyou how much oil we import right now; How dependent are we on this \nforeign oil? We should look at basically--of the 7.7 million barrels \nper day of crude oil imports--mind you, we are getting 7.7 million \nbarrels per day into our country. I understand the pipeline's capacity \nwould be about 870,000 barrels. That is the capacity--if they used the \nentire capacity. So we are getting 7.7 million barrels per day. Let's \nsee where it is coming from. When you look at that, 3.5 million barrels \nper day or 45 percent comes from OPEC countries. Of course, Saudi \nArabia is our largest OPEC supplier at 1.3 million barrels per day, 17 \npercent of the crude import total.\n  But our biggest supplier of crude continues to be Canada. It is \nalready our biggest supplier. We are afraid that this is somehow going \nto tip the balance? Let's look at some of the countries that we get \nthis oil from on a daily basis, the 7.7. Of course, we talked about the \nOPEC countries. But Venezuela, Colombia, Nigeria, Angola. These are not \nthe model citizens of how they treat their citizens in their country, \nthe humane treatment that goes on.\n  With that being said, those countries I just mentioned, the five \ncountries, that is 1.57 million barrels a day we buy from those \ncountries. So, yes, I am looking at it from the standpoint that this \nhas pulled us into conflicts around the world where we should not be.\n  We have all said we have been pulled into these countries, been \npulled into war because of oil. I think we all agree on that. This \ngives us a chance to be more secure as a nation and more independent \nfrom foreign oil. That is what we are talking about. The global supply \nof energy relies on oil producers in deeply unstable regions. I think \nwe all agree on that too. In West Virginia, it just makes common sense. \nWould you not rather buy from your friends than from your enemies? \nWould you not rather buy from people who basically help your economy \nand are not willing to do harm to your economy or harm to your people? \nThis makes sense to us in West Virginia. We would not be standing here \nhaving this debate right now if it had not been for your good Senator \nand our good friend from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu. It would not have \ncome up. It would have been moot. It might have gone in the next \nCongress. Who knows? I just appreciate so much Senator Landrieu \nbeing able to bring this to the forefront today. I really do. Whether \nwe win or lose it does not matter.\n\n  Basically the American people will lose if we do not pass this piece \nof legislation. If for whatever reason it is not passed, we are going \nto be more vulnerable, more insecure, more dependent than ever before.\n  It is one thing to live in a perfect world--Utopia. Some of my \ncolleagues have talked about that. I appreciate that. But the bottom \nline is, it is not the real world. The real world we are living in--I \nhave talked about coal too. There are 8 billion tons of coal being \nburned in the world. People say: Well, I do not want to use coal in \nAmerica. That is fine. If you quit using every kind of coal in America, \nyou are not going to change the environment that much. But on the other \nhand, there will be more coal burned than ever before. We do not want \nto build any more coal-fired plants in America. We are done. That is \nfine. Twelve hundred new coal-fired plants will be built around the \nworld in the next 3 to 4 years. Would not it be better to find the \ntechnology--would not it be better to have control of that, be able to \nhave a whole other industry around the technology that uses the coal \ncleaner not just in America but around the world?\n  Would it not be better to have control of this oil coming to the gulf \ncoast? If we have control of it, it will be used here. The fear tactic \nis that it is going to go somewhere else in the world. Markets will \ndictate where everything goes. But the bottom line is, we use most of \nCanada's oil now. They are the largest exporter to our country.\n  So all we are saying is to take a good, hard look at this. Think \nbefore you vote today, my colleagues, of what we are doing and what we \nare doing for the security of our Nation, what we are doing for the \nbest trading partner we have ever had. That oil is going to go \nsomewhere. It is being shipped now in a highly unstable type of \ncondition that is more vulnerable. It takes more oil to move that \nproduct today than ever before. Pipelines are by far the safest way to \ndo it.\n  I have said this: If we can move oil in the most demanding and \nprobably the most hostile, if you will, environmental conditions that \nwe have as far as nature produces in the Arctic, and we as the United \nStates benefit by that oil that is being produced in the Arctic by us \nin America, for all of us in the lower 48, if they are able to, do you \nnot think that it can be done here?\n  I look at it from the standpoint that they are saying enough is \nenough.\n  I thank Senator Landrieu for bringing the bill to the floor, for \nhaving a very informative debate that we can move forward on. I would \nhope that my colleagues would see fit that the United States of America \nwill benefit, the security of our Nation will benefit, wars could be \nprevented and conflicts around the world. Maybe we could use our might, \nif you will, to help other parts of the world without having to fight, \ndefend, and liberate from that standpoint.\n  But I do not believe that we should be in parts of the world where we \nare today because of the oil that we have been chasing. I believe that \nby having our own ability to work with the best trading partner we \nhave, which is Canada, that would definitely benefit the security of \nour Nation. I look forward to this vote this afternoon or later this \nevening, whenever it may come. I enjoy the debate that is going on and \nthe information I am gaining. I look forward to a more spirited debate \nfor the rest of the day.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am about to yield to Senator Cardin.\n  A point I want to make is this is an interesting debate. The \nproponents have said for years: Build the pipeline because we need the \noil here. Then confronted with the fact that the oil will not stay \nhere--it is going to go elsewhere--they say: Oh, what is the \ndifference. It is going elsewhere, but what is the difference. The \ndifference was your argument was to make us self-sufficient. You can't \nhave it both ways. The fact is this oil is going to be exported.\n  With that I yield 12 minutes to my colleague, a great leader on the \nenvironment, Mr. Cardin.\n  Mr. CARDIN. First, I thank Senator Boxer for her extraordinary effort \non this issue.\n  Let me get this straight. This debate is about giving competitive \nadvantage for the shipping of the dirtiest oil located in Canada \nthrough the United States for export. It is through the United States--\nnot through Canada. The environmental risks are in America, and it \ncircumvents our regulatory review process and attempts to deny property \nowners the right to challenge the route in court.\n  The Keystone Pipeline is a shortcut to an existing pipeline network \nto export some of the world's dirtiest crude oil from Canada to other \ncountries.\n\n[[Page S6047]]\n\nThe current pipeline network could handle this, but the operators want \na competitive advantage for the dirtiest oil by shortcutting the \npipeline that currently exists.\n  There is very little benefit to the United States. Certainly, as has \nbeen pointed out, the oil is not destined for the United States.\n  There are few permanent jobs. It poses significant environmental \nrisks. It eliminates appropriate executive review, tries to interfere \nwith judicial review, and should be rejected by this body.\n  First, let me talk about tar sands--exporting tar sand crude from \nAlberta, Canada, to other countries, through the United States rather \nthan through Canada. It could go through Canada, 700 miles west to the \nBritish Columbia coast. But the Canadians object. Why? Because they \ndon't want the environmental risk in their country. They are asking the \nUnited States to do bear their burden. It is not for U.S. energy use. \nIt is for the international market, and it poses significant \nenvironmental risk. We are talking about producing the dirtiest type of \nenergy sources that we know.\n  In 2010 there was a tar sands crude oil spill in the Kalamazoo River \nin Michigan. The estimated cost of the cleanup associated with that \nspill is $1.2 billion. Spills happen. We are adding tremendous risk to \nour country.\n  This is against a backdrop we see here in the United States and \nglobally where the price of oil is declining dramatically. Look at what \nwe are paying at the pump for gasoline today. In the United States we \nhave had a 70-percent increase in domestic oil production since \nPresident Obama took office. So we are getting all the oil that we \nneed. We don't need to add the dirtiest oil in the world.\n  The United States is more energy independent today than we have been \nin decades. Why? Because we use less energy.\n  Let me give one example. Fuel economy standards in automobiles are up \n25 percent since 2004. We are using less oil, less energy. We are \ndeveloping alternative and renewable sources. Our future is in clean \nenergy.\n  I am pleased we are having this debate on the floor of the Senate. We \nshould be having a debate about developing additional sources of clean \nenergy, which will help us be energy secure, add good-paying jobs, and \nbe friendlier toward our environment.\n\n  One example is Tesla Motors--an American company, unlike \nTransCanada--which recently chose Reno, NV, as the site of a $5 billion \n``gigafactory'' that could employ 6,500 workers on a permanent basis. \nTesla hopes to complete construction of the facility by 2020. It will \nproduce 50 gigawatt hours per year of lithium ion battery packs, more \nthan the entire global production in 2013 and enough for 500,000 \nelectric cars annually. Once the factory is in full operation, it could \nhelp lower the costs of battery packs by 30 percent in 2017 and by 50 \npercent in 2020.\n  Tesla expects to create 3,000 construction jobs, and that is \nimportant--construction jobs are important--and 6,500 permanent jobs \nupon completion, generating $100 billion in economic activity over the \nnext 20 years.\n  So let's compare that to what Keystone is advertised to produce. They \ntell us that Keystone will provide 42,000 jobs, but what they don't \ntell us is that the number of direct construction jobs is 3,950 and \nthat's just for one or two years. The rest of the jobs are indirect or \n``induced''--that is, induced activities from people getting paychecks, \nspending them on groceries, et cetera, and that's only during the \nconstruction period. Permanent jobs are 50. Look at the ratios: Tesla \nis over 2-to-1, with regard to permanent jobs-to-construction jobs. \nKeystone is 50 permanent jobs to 3,950 construction jobs. The number of \npermanent is so insignificant that this pipeline does not generate \neconomic progress in our country.\n  Why aren't we talking about the transportation bill? We want to talk \nabout jobs? Yes, we will get construction jobs. Thank you, Senator \nBoxer, for your extraordinary leadership on that bill. If we had a \nlong-term transportation bill, we would be helping the construction \nindustry by creating a lot of construction jobs. And guess what? At the \nend of the day, we would have a modern transportation system that would \npromote economic growth in America. Let me just give you one of those \nprojects as an example: the Purple Line in Montgomery and Prince \nGeorge's Counties, MD. We want to get that done. It will not only \ncreate construction jobs--it will not only create permanent jobs, it \nwill help people live longer because they won't be stuck in traffic. It \nwill really help our economy grow. That is the type of debate we should \nbe having.\n  Instead, we are talking about putting in a pipeline that poses \nincredible environmental risk not only to the United States but to our \nentire global community.\n  The Natural Resources Defense Council has shown how tar sand \nextraction methods are very dangerous to our environment and could \nrelease 11 million to 47 million metric tons of carbon dioxide \nequivalent into our atmosphere.\n  It is done in a way that--I was listening to my colleague from Hawaii \ntalk about it--that is destroying the Earth. They are in the process of \ndestroying the Boreal forest, which acts as a carbon ``sink,'' while \nproducing petroleum coke as well as tar sands crude. They are emitting \ncarbon dioxide just to produce the tar sands crude; they are emitting \ngreenhouse gases. Add transportation, refining, and consumption of the \nultimate product, the tar sands, and it is the worst form of a carbon \nfootprint that we could have in our environment.\n  The risks are real, including the danger to our environment from \nspills and come at a time when U.S. global leadership is so critical \nfor action on climate change.\n  According to the 2014 National Climate Assessment, the reality of \nclimate change is clear and apparent. I could give examples of the \ndroughts in California, of the increased wildfires in the West, or \nextreme weather conditions caused by polar vortexes in all parts of our \ncountry. Our sea level is rising from Miami, FL, to my own State of \nMaryland, where 70 percent of the population lives in coastal areas. \nThey are very concerned about what they are seeing as a result of the \nrising sea levels. So it is critically important to have U.S. \nleadership. This is what it is about--U.S. leadership.\n  President Obama demonstrated that leadership when he met with \nPresident Xi of China. The United States and China account for about \none-third of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. I have heard on this \nfloor many times: Why are we doing certain things if China doesn't do \ncertain things? Well, guess what. China is responding to our \nleadership.\n  Congratulations to President Obama for getting commitments from \nPresident Xi that China will reduce its carbon footprint. Specifically, \nChina pledged that non-fossil fuel sources will account for at least 20 \npercent of the country's energy use by 2030. That is U.S. leadership \nworking with China to help lead the global community. Let us show even \nmore leadership by rejecting the Keystone Pipeline.\n  Lastly, let me talk about process for a moment or two, if I might. \nThe regulatory protections should not be circumvented by congressional \naction. State courts in Nebraska should not be circumvented by \ncongressional action. We need to listen to the people from the region \nas they have expressed their concern about Keystone XL, and I quote \nfrom a person named Ben Gotschall from the organization, Bold Nebraska, \nwhich is part of the anti-pipeline coalition called the Cowboy-Indian \nAlliance:\n\n       The Cowboy Indian Alliance shows our cooperation and our \n     working together in mutual respect. That shared bond proves \n     that we pipeline fighters are not just a few angry landowners \n     holding out, or environmentalists pushing a narrow agenda. We \n     are people from all walks of life and include the people who \n     have been here the longest and know the land best.\n\n  We are talking about circumventing the regular order in order to have \na narrow result that affects real people's lives. We can do better than \nthat. We need to reject this ``pipeline by congressional action.'' \nCongress needs to act in a responsible way, and passing this bill is \nnot doing that. This pipeline travels through the United States so that \nCanada can get its dirtiest oil into the international marketplace. \nCanadians don't want the pipeline in their country for good reason, \nbecause they know the environmental risks of the pipeline and tar sands \ndevelopment are unacceptable.\n\n[[Page S6048]]\n\n  The energy will not have any major impact on the United States. It is \nfor export. It is not for the United States.\n  Why are we doing this? There are very few permanent jobs involved \nhere--fewer than 100. We already heard that. The risks to our \nenvironment--we have seen that. We have seen it happen before. We know \nwhat devastation tar sands oil spills can cause. We know what the \ncleanup cost are all about.\n  Why are we subjecting communities to this when they don't want it and \nthe environmental risks are so great? Why are we calling into question \nU.S. leadership globally when we are able to get progress that we have \nbeen asking for, and that Chairman Boxer has been asking for, to get \nChina to act? Why are we trampling on the appropriate role of the \nexecutive and judicial branches and local government by doing what we \nare attempting to do today?\n  I hope my colleagues will reject this bill. And I hope that we will \nwork together for an energy policy that makes sense for America and \nthat invests in clean energy, which will help our economy grow, help us \nbe energy secure, and be friendly to our environment. With that, I \nyield back the remaining time to Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I request 5 minutes.\n  I see the Senator from Wyoming, who is going to rebut the arguments \nmade by the Senator from Maryland. So I will take 5 minutes, and then \nthe Senator from Wyoming will have all the time he wants within the \nframework.\n  First, I will say that I have great respect for the Senator from \nMaryland. He is an excellent debater, and we just saw the skills of his \ndebating. But I want to put some things on the record that show he is \nabsolutely, completely wrong in his assessment and statements, as \nrespectfully as I can. He is completely wrong.\n  First of all, this is the environmental statement. It is printed, it \nis done, it is finished, and it was finished in January of this year. \nThis is the fifth environmental statement.\n  So anyone who comes to this floor on the Democratic side of the \naisle--because no one on the Republican side will say this because they \nare all in unity with a group of us to build this pipeline--they are \nwrong. It is factually incorrect that the environmental studies have \nnot been completed because I have it in my hands. This is the fifth.\n  Let me say what the result of this environmental impact statement by \nthe Obama administration--not by the Bush administration, not by a \nformer Republican administration, but the current, Democratic \nadministration--concluded. People at home who are listening can get out \ntheir computers and their pens. This is what this study says. If the \nKeystone XL is built, it will represent .015 of global greenhouse gas \nemissions--.015 of greenhouse gas emissions. That is the equivalent, if \npeople want to keep writing, to 300,000 passenger vehicles in America. \nSeems like a big number, except that we have 253 million cars on the \nroad.\n\n  OK. So think about this. The President's own environmental study, \nwhich is the fifth one, completed in January, has done its work. It has \nsubmitted this for the record. This is not subject to debate. The \nconclusion of this study is it will, taking everything into \nconsideration, increase greenhouse gases by .015 percent of global \ngreenhouse gas emissions, which is the equivalent of 300,000 passenger \nvehicles, which is .12 percent of total cars in the U.S.\n  So this is what we can do. We can build the Keystone Pipeline, \ncreating thousands of temporary and millions of permanent jobs, which \nare not created by the permanency of the pipeline itself but by the \nsignal that America is serious about energy independence. That will \ncreate millions of high-paying jobs. There is no disputing that fact.\n  It is not the jobs that build the pipeline we are fighting for so \nmuch--although the pipefitters and boilermakers and the unions are \nfighting for that, and I am fighting with them--it is the signal it \ngives that we are serious about energy independence, and that we honor \nand understand there are already pipelines in our country. There are \npipelines in our country. We have been building pipelines in this \ncountry since before most of us were born--all of us were born. That is \nwhat is so outrageous about this debate.\n  Yes, this pipeline comes from Canada, our best trading partner, our \nmost reliable ally, a country that is the most equivalent to us in the \nUnited States of America, and because it is a pipeline connecting \nCanada and the United States, it has all become this bogeyman that is \ngoing to wreck the world.\n  The environmental impact study, Senator Cardin, has been done. It is \nin.\n  The second thing I wanted to talk about is this. We pass a lot of \ncrazy bills around here. This bill is two pages--S. 2280. Here it is. \nThis is the first page, this is the second page. Everybody in America \ncan read it. I would strongly recommend to those who are listening, get \nit and read the bill. It will literally take 15 seconds. It is so \nsimple, and Senator Hoeven and I wrote it to be simple. As I have said \nbefore, we wrote it to go the distance. We wrote it to go the distance. \nIt is not complicated. It simply says this: After waiting 5 years, and \nafter acknowledging all environmental studies have been done, all \neconomic studies have been done, we direct the President of the United \nStates to give his approval.\n  We are not circumventing the President. Every report he has requested \nhas been turned in to him, every single solitary one. In addition, and \nthe Presiding Officer knows this, because at her request and Senator \nTester's request, Senator Hoeven and I added this language:\n\n       Private Property Savings Clause.\n       Nothing in this Act alters any Federal, State or local \n     process or condition in effect on the date of enactment of \n     this Act that is necessary to secure access from an owner of \n     private property to construct the pipeline and cross-border \n     facilities. . . .\n\n  In other words, this language says all private property rights will \nbe honored. That was not in the House bill. Senator Hoeven and I put it \nin this bill because we wanted to put that debate to an end. All \nprivate property rights are honored.\n  The environmental studies have been completely completed. Also in our \nbill is respect for Nebraska because we are not trying to run over \nNebraska. We say here--and I will point it out in just a minute--that \nsubject to the final decision by Nebraska about where this is going to \ngo, Nebraska can decide. As we can see, all the other States have said \nfine to their line. Nebraska has to decide. That is in the court. This \nbill says they can still decide this. There is nothing telling Nebraska \nwhere to build it.\n  I hope people who come to the floor to talk about this pipeline will \nbring their facts and not fear--facts, not fear. I am a fierce \nproponent of the pipeline and they are fierce opponents and I respect \nthem. There are two people I greatly respect: Barbara Boxer and Ben \nCardin. But we are on the exact opposite side of this issue.\n  So let's discuss facts, and let me just say one more thing and then I \nwill give this to Senator Barrasso, because this is more personal. I \nwas very disappointed in the Senator from Kansas when he came out and \nsaid something akin to he finds it strange--I think his words were he \nis kind of amused that we would be debating this because he thinks this \nis some kind of political opportunity.\n  I have a lot of respect for the Senator from Kansas. I worked with \nhim. I was his chair and he was my ranking member on emerging threats. \nWe have been through some pretty tough meetings together. When this \ncountry was under attack during 9/11, I was the chair of emerging \nthreats and he was the ranking member when the Twin Towers burned. He \nis a marine. I always joked: He is a marine and I am a Girl Scout, so I \nthink he has one up on me. Nonetheless, we both have a pretty good code \nof honor. So for him to come to the floor, after being in the foxhole \nwith me on that day, and to say he thinks this is some kind of \nconvenient opportunity for me is beneath the dignity of himself, the \nMarine Corps, and the State he represents.\n  This is a serious issue. We should have debated it months ago. The \nonly reason we didn't--and Harry Reid is now on the floor and he has \nheard me say this to him in private and I will say it in public--is \nbecause neither leader could get their caucuses in a position to have \nthis debate. There were\n\n[[Page S6049]]\n\nmany reasons for it, but all those reasons cleared up after this \nelection. That is why we are having this debate, because I asked for \nit.\n  I support and I appreciate the Members, no matter how they vote, in \nhaving this debate. If we had more debates like this, the American \npeople might be hopeful we could get something done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                          Attack in Jerusalem\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am going to use leader time for these \nremarks, and it will not interfere with any of the time that has been \nallocated to these gentlemen and ladies.\n  In far away Israel, during morning prayer, a horrific attack took \nplace. A number of people were having their morning prayer. Four rabbis \nwere savagely beaten, hacked to death, with a meat cleaver. Two \nPalestinian men entered the synagogue in Jerusalem and savagely \nmurdered these four rabbis in the midst of morning prayer. Three of \nthese victims were American citizens, the other, I am told, was a \nBritish citizen. One of them was a leading scholar, Hasidic scholar. \nMore than one dozen others were hacked, hacked with a meat clever, \nwhile they were there praying. A number of these people are in critical \ncondition as we speak.\n  Secretary of State John Kerry today said: ``Innocent people who had \ncome to worship died in the sanctuary of a synagogue.''\n  Places of worship have always been a refuge in times of peace and in \ntimes of conflict. Yet these terrorists hacked and brutally murdered \nworshippers in the midst of prayer.\n  This is not an isolated incident. Recently, Palestinian terrorists \nhave carried out shocking attacks all across Israel. Seven Israelis \nhave been killed in these horrible attacks, including a 3-month-old \nAmerican infant--a baby, 3 months old--an Israeli soldier, a border \npatrol officer.\n  These attacks are a direct result of incitement, and I call upon the \nPalestinian leadership to condemn these attacks unequivocally. This \nbutchery has no place in the modern world and they should stop it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank Majority Leader Reid for his \nremarks. Sometimes it does feel the world is falling apart and we have \nto speak out, as we are doing every time these terrorists rear their \nheads.\n  I know we have some time over here by Senator Barrasso, but I just \nwanted to make a point on the environmental impact statements, although \nit is hard to get back.\n  As I understand it, in the Hoeven- Landrieu bill, the EIS is \napproved. So if the Nebraska bureaucracy determines there is a new \nroute--and I think this is what my friend from Maryland was getting \nat--it doesn't matter what the new route is, the EIS is deemed \napproved. I have to say I don't think that is right. I think the people \nwho live along that new route have a right to have a new EIS if in fact \nnow the pipeline is being moved in a different direction.\n  I understand the bill calls for property rights to be respected, and \nthat is called eminent domain. I know a lot of my friends on the other \nside hate eminent domain, usually, but now they are embracing it \nbecause that is what is in this bill. But the fact is, if as a result \nof a court case brought by property owners the route changes, it is our \ncounsel's understanding the EIS is still automatically approved.\n  I wanted to get that on the record because my friend was in fact \nquestioned, and I think he was right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor to express my \nsupport for the approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline. This is \nbipartisan legislation. The House passed this bill with 31 Democrats \nvoting for it.\n  Last week, Senate Republicans welcomed the news that the outgoing \nSenate majority leader had finally decided to let the Senate vote on \nthis legislation and that vote is finally going to take place today. \nFor years House and Senate Republicans have been pushing legislation to \napprove the Keystone XL Pipeline, but until now the outgoing Senate \nmajority leader wouldn't even let the Senate vote on this measure. This \nwas all part of the majority leader's efforts to protect the President \nand the President's agenda.\n  The majority leader had hoped the American people would forget about \nthe Senate. He had hoped they would be satisfied with President Obama's \njob approval. Well, 2 weeks ago, the American people made it clear they \nhave not forgotten about the Senate. The American people made it clear \nthey are not satisfied with President Obama and his policies. Instead, \nthe American people want the President to work with the Senate to enact \nbipartisan legislation to grow our and economy and to create jobs.\n\n  President Obama and Senate Democrats can do that today by supporting \nthe bill we are approaching to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. This \npipeline is going to create thousands of jobs right here at home. It is \nnot just my view, it is the view of the President's own State \nDepartment.\n  According to the State Department, the construction of the Keystone \nXL Pipeline would support over 42,000 jobs--42,000 jobs. That is the \nreason many of the Nation's largest labor unions support the \nconstruction and approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline. In addition the \npipeline would facilitate American crude oil production. Specifically, \nthis pipeline will ship up to 100,000 barrels of oil each and every day \nfrom North Dakota and Montana. Currently there is insufficient pipeline \ncapacity to ship oil out of North Dakota. As a consequence, oil \nproducers must rely on railroads to ship oil out of State. Shipping \ncrude oil by rail is more expensive than shipping it by pipeline. The \nKeystone XL Pipeline would provide oil producers a cheaper shipping \nmethod and in turn encourage production of more American energy.\n  This pipeline will also increase our Nation's energy security. \nSpecifically, the pipeline will provide an additional access to \nCanadian oil. We should welcome access to Canadian oil. Canadian oil is \na far better alternative to oil from Venezuela, the Middle East or West \nAfrica, areas of the world which don't share our values and too often \nwork against our American interests. In contrast, Canada is a strong \nally, Canada is America's top trading partner, and Canada already \nprovides the United States with reliable and secure sources of energy.\n  Now is the time for President Obama to make a decision on the \nKeystone XL Pipeline.\n  As the senior Senator from Delaware, a Member of the President's own \nparty, said last week: ``We have waited not just months but years for a \ndecision on Keystone,'' he said. ``This is too long.''\n  In fact, the permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline has been pending for \nover 6 years. During this time the State Department has conducted five \nenvironmental reviews of the project. Each of the reviews has been \npositive. I say to President Obama: Time is up and the excuses have run \nout. It is time for you, Mr. President, to make a decision.\n  President Obama should once again acknowledge that elections have \nconsequences. Specifically, he should signal to the American people \nthat he has heard the message voters across this country sent just 2 \nweeks ago: their message of support for bipartisan legislation that \ngrows our economy, creates jobs, puts people back to work, their \nmessage of support for legislation such as the approval of the Keystone \nXL Pipeline.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, let me just say that at long last this \nweek we are going to be voting on the Keystone XL Pipeline. The vote \nhas been a long time coming--years, in fact. Republicans have been \ntrying to get this pipeline and the many jobs it will support approved. \nIt would have been at the top of our agenda in January when we take \ncontrol of the Senate, but we are happy to get a head start on that \nwork a little early. It is just too bad that it took an election defeat \nand a runoff election to finally motivate the Democratic leadership to \nallow a vote on the measure. It should have received a vote years ago.\n  In fact, the Keystone Pipeline, if there is such a thing, is a win-\nwin. It will create jobs. One can argue about how many jobs. The \nPresident's own\n\n[[Page S6050]]\n\nState Department said it would support over 42,000 jobs. It will \ndecrease our reliance on oil from dangerous countries. It will increase \nrevenues to State and local governments. It will free space on \novercrowded rail lines so the farmers can get their goods to the \nmarketplace, and it will do all of that without spending a dime of \ntaxpayer money.\n  Our economy has been limping along for years. The unemployment rate \nis still hovering at near recession levels and 9 million Americans are \nunemployed. More Americans are working part-time jobs because they \ncannot find full-time employment. Household income has fallen nearly \n$3,000 since President Obama took office while the price of everything \nelse, from food to health care, has risen.\n  Americans need jobs and economic opportunities, and the Keystone \nPipeline will help supply them. As I said, the State Department \nestimates that in my home State of South Dakota alone, construction of \nthe pipeline would bring 3,000 to 4,000 jobs and generate well over \n$100 million in earnings. It will also bring over $20 million in annual \nproperty taxes to South Dakota counties. I know some of the counties in \nthe middle of my State are counties that are struggling to keep up with \nthe cost of keeping the local governments going. School districts are \nstruggling to survive and property tax revenue that will come in as a \nresult of building a pipeline will help sustain many of those local \ngovernments and many of those school districts during some pretty \ndifficult times.\n  My State is just one of the States that benefits. Nationwide, the \npipeline will support more than 42,000 jobs--construction jobs from \nwelders to pipefitters, to those who work at local hotels and gas \nstations. It will invest $5.3 billion in the U.S. economy and bring \nStates a total of $5 billion in property taxes over the life of the \nproject. That is a lot of funding for local priorities such as schools, \nlaw enforcement personnel and roads and bridges. Opponents of the \npipeline like to cite environmental concerns as a reason for opposing \nthe pipeline and its jobs.\n  Five separate environmental reviews from the President's own State \nDepartment have found that the pipeline possesses no meaningful risk to \nthe environment. In fact, even the State Department admits the Keystone \nPipeline is the safest way of transporting the oil. It is safer than \nrail or truck. It is important to remember Canada will be extracting \nand transporting its oil regardless. The only question is whether we \nwant it to come to the United States along with the thousands of jobs \nit will create or whether we want to let Canada ship that oil overseas.\n  The American people have been very clear about their feelings about \nthis project. Poll after poll has shown strong support. Republicans \nsupport the pipeline. Democrats in both Houses of Congress support the \npipeline. Unions support the pipeline. The only people who seem to \noppose it are Members of the far leftwing of the Democratic Party. The \nreason we haven't had a vote in the Senate is not because a majority of \nSenators don't support the project, it is because Senate Democratic \nleadership refused to hold a vote despite having support from their \nside of the aisle.\n  While it is unfortunate it took the Democratic leadership this long \nto come around, I am glad we are finally here. I hope the Senate will \nfinally approve the pipeline. If this bill passes today it will have \none final hurdle to clear and that is the President of the United \nStates. I very much hope he will listen to the voices of American \nworkers and the bipartisan majorities in the Congress. Given his recent \ncomments, I am skeptical.\n  The President has demonstrated a disturbing commitment to holding the \nAmerican economy hostage to priorities of the far leftwing of his \nparty. Take his recent energy agreement with China which would force \nAmerican companies to implement costly new measures while China gets to \ndo nothing. The national energy tax that the President unveiled back in \nJune will put tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of \nAmerican workers out of jobs and devastate entire communities. The \npipeline's economic benefits to support the American people and five--\nfive--successful environmental reviews have yet to convince the \nPresident to approve this project. I am concerned this vote probably \nisn't going to help, but I hope I am wrong.\n\n  By signing this bill, the President could send a powerful message \nabout his willingness to work with Congress, and he can show the \nAmerican people he heard their demands for change in Washington and \nthat their economic priorities can be addressed.\n  I am sorry American workers have had to wait years for this project \nbecause, let's not forget, they are the ones who have been hurt the \nmost by the administration's refusal to approve the pipeline. I hope \ntoday marks the end of their waiting and I hope it marks the beginning \nof a new era in the Senate.\n  When Republicans take over in January, bills such as Keystone will be \nthe order of the day. We will take up jobs bills that passed the House \nwith bipartisan support but have been waiting for a vote in the \nDemocratic leader's Senate. We will take up legislation to create \neconomic growth here at home by opening new markets for American \nagriculture and manufacturing overseas. We will repeal the medical \ndevice tax which is opposed by Members of both parties thanks to the \nfact that it is eliminating thousands of jobs in the medical device \nindustry, and that will be just the start.\n  I hope that just as they did today, Democrats will work with us even \nmore on bills to create jobs and economic opportunities for the \nAmerican people because it is the people of this country for whom we \nought to be doing everything we can to help and to support. I can state \nthat the people in the Midwest, in the heartland whom I represent, \nalready spend--if they make $50,000 a year--20 percent of their income \non energy, either fuel or electricity. All these proposals, the \nnational energy tax, the deal with China, continue to drive up the cost \nof energy and make it more difficult and more expensive for middle-\nincome families who are increasingly squeezed by these policies.\n  I wish to close by quoting from a letter the leaders received from \nthe National Council of Farmer Cooperatives in which they urge Congress \nto support legislation to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline, and this is \nwhat they say:\n\n       The Keystone XL Pipeline also is part of a long-term \n     solution to alleviating the transportation pressures many in \n     agriculture have faced. This year, farmers around the country \n     experienced some of the largest harvests they have seen in \n     generations. For some, their successful year has come to an \n     alarming halt when trying to sell and transport their crop. \n     Farmer cooperatives in the upper Midwest are facing major \n     delays in getting their farmers' grain to market due to the \n     sustained shortage of rail equipment resulting from the \n     increased use of rail to transport crude oil. The Keystone XL \n     Pipeline will ultimately free up locomotives and track to \n     move more grain to market and improve our ability to handle \n     year after year record harvests.\n\n  Yet another reason to support this project and the jobs that come \nwith it, the energy independence that comes with it, the lessening--\nrelieving, if you will--of rail capacity issues that are plagued in \nmany areas of the Midwest and making it harder for farmers to come to \nthe marketplace.\n  This is a project that is a win-win, and I hope when the vote comes \nlater today, we will have not just the majority of the Senators but the \n60 votes that are necessary to move this to the President's desk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield to Senator Merkley, but before I do, I was \nso glad to hear a Republican say he wants to work on jobs. I would just \nsay to my friend before he leaves, the CEO who runs the pipeline says \nthere will be 35 permanent jobs. OK. I would like to suggest to my \nfriend that if he truly wants to help the middle class, he ought to \njoin with us first in raising the minimum wage, which is critical, and, \nsecondly, embracing a clean energy future while we still use, where it \nis safe, domestic oil production, clean coal, things we can do that \ndon't threaten the air our children breathe, pollute the water they \ndrink, and destroy the planet.\n  To hear a Republican stand and talk about jobs is music to my ears, \nbut I would like to put into the Record a report I just got from my \nCalifornia people at home who say:\n\n\n[[Page S6051]]\n\n\n       California's climate policies are reducing carbon \n     emissions, saving consumers at the pump, cutting oil use, and \n     cleaning our air.\n       California's economic recovery has outpaced the rest of the \n     country since the so-called ``great recession,'' while our \n     state has implemented the nation's strongest climate \n     policies. . . .\n       California can reduce greenhouse gas pollution while \n     growing the economy; we have been doing it for the last 35 \n     years. Innovative energy policies over the past three decades \n     have saved Californians $56 billion on household energy costs \n     and allowed them to reduce expenditures on imported fossil \n     fuels and redirect spending to create 1.5 million full-time \n     jobs.\n\n  And they go on to talk about the fact that they are looking toward \n1.5 million full-time jobs. I am just saying to my friend, if this is \ntruly about jobs, let's pass a transportation bill. Let's make sure we \ndo the things that help our people.\n  I am going to hold up a picture of the air in China. This is what it \nlooks like when you throw the environment under the bus. We know, \nbecause in California we had some bad air until a Republican President \npassed the Clean Air Act, signed it into law.\n  You want to know public opinion. I will tell you. The public supports \nthe EPA and they support clean air, clean water, safe drinking water. \nThis tar sands isn't about the building of a pipeline, it is what is \ngoing into it--the filthiest, dirtiest oil, and we have put in the \nRecord all the elements, the pollutants, that are in this oil. You can \nlaugh it away if you want. That is fine. But I have to tell you, when \nyou hear about the health impact that is going on in Canada from this \ntar sands, when you go down to Port Arthur, TX, or meet with the people \nhere as I did, what you will see there is a community suffering because \nthis is the dirtiest oil.\n  So, yes, jobs--that is where it is with this Senator. I come from a \nfamily which is first-generation American on my mother's side. We \nworked for everything we got. Education was key to it.\n  Hey, how about joining with us on that? How about reducing interest \nrates on student loans? But to stand here and say this is the absolute \njob producer is phony. It is phony baloney.\n  With that, I yield to my friend for 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to address S. 2280, which would \napprove construction of the Keystone Pipeline to transport tar sands \nheavy oil from Canada to the gulf coast.\n  The key consideration is whether this bill--by authorizing the \npipeline--would contribute significantly to global warming, which is \nalready damaging our rural resources and our future economic prospects \nwith profound consequences for families in America and around the \nworld.\n  Also, are there better ways to create jobs that would enhance rather \nthan damage our world? In the words of President Theodore Roosevelt:\n\n       Of all the questions which can come before this nation, \n     short of the actual preservation of its existence in a great \n     war, there is none which compares in importance with the \n     great central task of leaving this land even a better land \n     for our descendants than it is for us.\n\n  Let's start by addressing the vision that President Roosevelt put \nforward and examine the impact of the Keystone Pipeline on atmospheric \ncarbon dioxide pollution and global warming.\n  In this chart we see, going back 800,000 years, that the carbon \ndioxide has gone up and down. In recent years it has been quite steady \nuntil the start of the Industrial Revolution, and then it has soared--\nsoared above levels it has been at for hundreds of thousands of years.\n  In this second chart, we see that there is absolutely no question \nthat heat--put here in blue--correlates to the carbon dioxide in red. \nWhen the carbon dioxide level goes up and down, the heat of the planet \ngoes up and down.\n  By many estimates, to contain global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, \nhumans can burn only about an additional 500 gigatons of fossil carbon. \nThat is the fossil budget we have to work with to avoid catastrophic \nglobal warming. But currently, the world's top 200 fossil fuel \ncompanies have identified 2,800 gigatons trapped in their fossil fuel, \nand that doesn't include the carbon from tar sands and oil shale.\n  Here is the problem: To protect the planet from catastrophic global \nwarming, we need to leave four-fifths of the identified conventional \nfossil fuel reserves in the ground. Building the Keystone Pipeline, \nwhich would open the facet to rapid exploitation of a massive, new \nunconventional reserve--the tar sands--would make it much less likely \nfor human civilization to succeed in meeting that carbon budget that is \nso important to our future economic and environmental world, and that \nis why building the Keystone Pipeline is a grave mistake.\n  Global warming is not some imaginary foe embedded in some computer \nmodel with effects 50 years from now. It is here and we can see it at \nthis very moment. The warmest 10 years on record for global average \nsurface temperature has occurred in the last 12 years. Moreover, the \neffects can be seen in Oregon--and actually across the Nation. The \naverage forest fire season is getting longer. Across the Nation, since \nthe 1980s, the national season has grown by 60 to 80 days, and the \naverage acres consumed annually by wildfires has doubled to more than 7 \nmillion acres. This sight has become all too familiar in our home State \nof Oregon.\n  One study estimates that global warming, through the greater impact \nof greater pine beetle infestations and larger forest fires, will \ndecimate the western forest of the United States by the end of this \ncentury.\n  In addition, the snowpack in our Oregon mountains is decreasing, \nwhich means smaller and warmer trout streams--that is not a good thing \nif you love to fish--and less water for irrigation. The Klamath Basin--\na major agriculture basin in Oregon--has suffered through many dry \nyears and three horrific droughts since 2001, in substantial part \nbecause of lower snowpacks.\n  The red circles on this chart represent a significant decrease in the \nsnowpack. As we can see throughout the northwestern United States--\nOregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, and stretching into northern \nCalifornia--there is a huge decrease in the snowpack which is resulting \nin devastating consequences for agriculture.\n  As the high levels of carbon dioxide in the air are absorbed by the \noceans, the carbon dioxide becomes carbonic acid. That acid, as one \nwould expect, makes the oceans more acidic.\n  This chart, which presents the carbon dioxide and the pH time series \nfrom Hawaii, presents the challenge clearly. CO2 in the \natmosphere went up from 320 parts per million to about 380 parts per \nmillion over a period of about 50 years--a steady increase in carbon \ndioxide. We then see, with this blue set of data, that there is a \nparallel trend of the carbon dioxide that is in our ocean, and then we \nsee from the light blue data that the pH level is dropping, which means \nthat the ocean is more acidic. That is a 30-percent increase in the \nacidity of the ocean over a very short period of time.\n  The greater acidity is having an impact on sea life. One impact is on \ncoral reefs, which are the ocean's most diverse ecosystem and the base \nof the ocean's food chain. Fishing families around the world depend on \ncoral reefs as a foundation for livelihood.\n\n  Another impact is on the reproduction of oysters. The Whiskey Creek \nShellfish Hatchery in Oregon, which I visited a few weeks ago, started \nhaving trouble growing baby oysters--known as oyster seed--in the year \n2008. The hatchery almost went out of business, but a scientist from \nOregon State University was able to help identify and address the \nproblem. The problem, it turns out, stems from the increase in the \nacidity of the Pacific Ocean. If the oyster seed, or the canary in the \ncoal mine, is having trouble forming shells, what else is going wrong \nin the ocean due to rising acidity?\n  In summary, carbon pollution is having a direct and substantial \nimpact on the vitality of our forests, farming, and fishing. Our rural \nresources are being damaged now, and the problems will multiply with \nadditional carbon pollution. So as members of the human family on this \nplanet, with the moral responsibility to exercise wide stewardship of \nour resources for future generations, we must address this challenge of \ncarbon pollution, and we must do so now. Wise stewardship means we must \nleave four-fifths of the conventional fossil fuels in the ground.\n  Would this bill before us, which would open the facet to this massive\n\n[[Page S6052]]\n\nnew reserve of fossil fuels, advance such stewardship? The answer is \nclear. Stewardship demands that we not build infrastructure to unlock \ntar sands--the dirtiest source of oil on the planet.\n  The proponents of the pipeline have come to the floor and made \ninteresting arguments--arguments worth examining to see if they \nactually hold water. First, they argue that the pipeline would create a \ntremendous number of construction jobs. Here is a comparison of direct \nconstruction jobs created by the pipeline--the little tiny wedge down \nhere represents the pipeline jobs versus the jobs that would be created \nby the Rebuild America Act, which would create hundreds of thousands of \njobs. So just 4,000 or so jobs in construction of the pipeline versus \nhundreds of thousands jobs from the Rebuild America Act. If anyone on \nthis floor is actually serious about jobs, we would pass the Rebuild \nAmerica Act today.\n  The proponents have a second argument. They say that bringing this \nadditional oil into America would increase America's oil independence. \nWe heard that argument just a few moments ago by my colleague from \nSouth Dakota. The argument goes that this strengthens America's \nnational security by decreasing America's dependence on the Middle \nEast, but that argument overlooks a fact. This is not American oil, \nthis is Canadian oil. This is not oil destined for the United States, \nit is destined to be refined in the gulf coast so that it can be \nexported around the world. These tar sands will do no more for America \nthan if they were exported through Canada to the world market.\n  In fact, if you want the oil to be used in America, the best thing to \ndo is to not build the pipeline, because that means the area around the \ntar sands will be the area getting that oil. Shipping Canadian oil to \nthe world market via America adds nothing to America's security.\n  The next argument from proponents is that the pipeline has no \nenvironmental effect--indeed, we just heard this argument as well--\nbecause the oil from the tar sands, it is argued, will reach the market \nby rail if not by pipeline. This argument is demonstrably false. There \nis not enough rail capacity to substitute for the pipeline, and the \ncost of shipping oil by rail is much higher than pipeline, greatly \nreducing the economic incentive for rapid development of the sands. All \nthe while proponents say if the Keystone Pipeline is not built, \nalternative pipelines will be built through Canada, but that is \ncertainly not at all clear.\n  If it were easier and cheaper to build through Canada, TransCanada \nwould not be trying to build through the United States of America. \nMoreover, there is tremendous opposition within Canada to building such \npipelines, and that is part of the reason TransCanada wanted to build \nit through the United States. The opposition within Canada to \nadditional pipelines is just as fierce as it is in America for the same \nset of reasons--fundamentally important moral reasons--about the \nstewardship of our environment and our future economy. It turns out the \nKeystone Pipeline represents a real risk to our rural resources, our \nfarming, and our fishing. It represents a real risk to the future \nhealth of our economy needed to sustain middle-class jobs. The pipeline \nitself creates very few jobs compared to a serious investment in \ninfrastructure, and it adds nothing to our national security.\n  There are several other serious problems with this pipeline that have \noften been glossed over. For one, TransCanada is exempted from \ncontributing to the Oil Spill Liability Fund. That is outrageous. You \ncould call this bill the TransCanada protection act. Why are we doing a \nspecial deal for a Canadian company? Oilspills like this happen with \nthese pipelines all the time, and they will not contribute one slim \ndime to the Oil Spill Liability Fund that American companies have to \ncontribute to. Why would anyone vote for that sort of special deal for \na foreign company--that irresponsible failure to contribute a single \ndime to the Oil Spill Liability Fund?\n  In addition, we are giving a foreign corporation the ability to \nexercise eminent domain to seize the lands of American citizens. Since \nwhen do we give power to a foreign corporation to take land away from \nAmerican citizens without their desire? It is fundamentally unfair to \nAmerican landowners. The legal basis for eminent domain is that there \nhas to be a compelling public good. What is the compelling public good \nin this situation? Is it the generation of private profits for a \nCanadian corporation? That doesn't meet the test. Is it the damage from \nthe oilspills that will occur in communities across America? That \ndoesn't meet the test. Is it the contributory damage----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised that his time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for a minute \nand a half more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Is it from the damage from carbon pollution to our \nfarming, fishing, and forests? That doesn't meet the test.\n  Frankly, tackling carbon pollution is going to take an enormous \namount of international cooperation. Just a few days ago the United \nStates and China entered into an agreement to address the global \nclimate change crisis. The Chinese President announced that China would \ninvest heavily in renewable energy to generate 20 percent of China's \nenergy from nonfossil fuel sources by 2030, seeking to decrease China's \nCO2 emissions thereafter. That is the type of leadership the \nworld has been asking for.\n  We can't simply wish for nations to work together. We have to \nnegotiate and do our part. That is why today we should not be talking \nabout how to turn on the tap to the dirtiest oil on the planet, but how \nto meet the 2025 goals and how to create jobs by investing in energy \nconservation and renewable energy.\n  Let's remember the test that President Theodore Roosevelt gave us. \nThere is no more important mission than ``leaving this land even a \nbetter land for descendants than it is for us.'' This bill fails the \ntest.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I think we are going to take a recess \nshortly. I just wanted to thank everybody on both sides for their \nstatements.\n  To sum it up from my perspective, you have a situation here that, \nfrankly, I am very glad we are confronting because there are lots of \npeople who say: Oh, this is no big deal, it is just a little pipeline, \nand we have so many pipelines.\n  Senator Thune said: Oh, it is so much safer to transport this oil by \npipeline than other ways. Just try telling that to the people of \nMarshall, MI. There was a spill in 2010 in the Kalamazoo River. They \nare still trying to clean it up. It is not the pipeline that is the \nissue, folks, it is the dirty tar sands oil that is so much more \ndangerous, has more heavy metals, and more carcinogens. It is a \nproblem. By virtue of its weight, it sinks to the bottom, and they \ncannot clean it up. I can't believe the statement was made about how \nsafe this is. We have seen stories that there are problems with the \nwelding in the existing pipeline. We might want to speak to the people \nin Mayflower, AR. Do my colleagues know that Exxon had to buy back the \nhomes because they couldn't be lived in anymore because this stuff \nspilled and contaminated an entire neighborhood?\n\n  So I call this the extra lethal pipeline. The pipeline itself is \nbenign. It is what is going through it and what it will unleash in \nterms of 45 percent more carbon over time and 45 percent more tar sands \nthan we would otherwise have, so we figure that everything gets \nincreased by that amount. There is going to be more carbon, there is \ngoing to be more sulfur, more mercury, more lead.\n  This is important today. I am so glad we are having this debate. My \ncolleagues say we never allowed a vote. There was a lot of boxing \naround in the boxing ring on that one. We tried. I don't mind having a \nvote on this. I have never minded having a vote on this. I think it is \nan important debate. People disagree. It is OK. We should air it out. \nBut the bill before us would stop a process that is in place that is \nvery important, not because it is a ``process'' but because 2 million \npeople wrote comments about the Keystone Pipeline. We should not say to \nthem: Your voices don't matter; we are going to truncate the process; I \ndon't care what you said.\n  We already know there is a court case. This bill would approve the \nEIS.\n\n[[Page S6053]]\n\nEven if Nebraska moves the route to another route, guess what: This \nbill that is pending here--the Hoeven-Landrieu bill--would already say \nthe new EIS is approved. That is wrong. So only 35 permanent jobs. Most \nof this oil is exported. Economists say the price of gas in the \ndomestic market will go up. And we compare it to embracing a clean \nenergy agenda while we still develop oil where it is safe and sound, \nand we still develop all of the above when it is safe and sound. But if \nwe embrace clean energy, I have to tell my colleagues, the jobs will \ndwarf the 35 permanent jobs for sure that this pipeline brings us.\n  In California we are so excited with what is happening. And we don't \nwant to look like the people in China where they walk around in masks, \nand we don't want to have little girls and boys with those inhalers \nbecause they can't breathe the air. This is real. This is about health. \nYes, it is about jobs. Yes, it is about prices. And I find it really \nfascinating that a few years ago when this all came up, what did we \nsay? We said, Oh, this pipeline will make us energy independent. Now we \nknow that we are going to allow this oil to go right through the middle \nof our country. Misery follows the tar sands: spills. We have already \nhad spills. We know what happens when there is a spill. And what do we \nget at the end? The oil goes to the rest of the world.\n  Our friends say, oh, it is still good. It is good for prices. No, it \nisn't good for prices. Economists have told us it is not good for gas \nprices, and it doesn't help us become energy independent. It imperils \nour planet with large amounts of carbon going into the air. It imperils \nour families with pollutants that are very carcinogenic and very \ndangerous.\n  So I hope we will let the process continue. I don't know what happens \ntoday. I know the handwriting is on the wall. I know it is on this one. \nBut when we see the country we love going down a route that makes \nsense, following a procedure that makes sense, letting court cases \nresolve themselves, letting the people's comments be looked at, making \nsure we know exactly what we are doing, and we see that process \nshortcut by legislation and people who, by the way--and I am talking \nabout my Republican friends: Oh, we are not scientists. We don't know \nif there is climate change. That is right, they are not scientists and \nthey don't know, so they should listen to 98 percent of the scientists \nwho are telling us that the Keystone is a dangerous move for this \nplanet, because it is going to allow this oil that is far more carbon \nintensive.\n  I am a humble person. I am not a scientist; I do listen to them. I \nhave to say to go blindly down this path is a huge mistake. Yet, that \nis what we are facing, and it is fine with me that we are facing it. We \nwill stand and we will debate until there is nothing more to be said. \nWe are probably getting to that place right now, so I will stop and \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/18/senate-section/article/S6053-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Who yields time?\n  If neither side yields time, both sides will be equally charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak for up to 5 \nminutes in opposition of the bill presently on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I oppose this legislation to approve the construction of \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline. Again, I believe it is one more step in the \nwrong direction, one more capitulation to our fossil fuel habit, one \nmore accelerant to global warming that threatens our children's future. \nI know I have limited time. I just want to point out that we have had a \nnumber of studies done by the Department of Energy recently.\n  One study found that retrofitting residential and commercial \nbuildings had the potential to reduce consumer demand by 30 percent by \n2030 and reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.1 gigatons each year, saving \nover $680 billion.\n  The second study found the retrofits--I am talking about building \nretrofits in America--could save $1 trillion in energy spending over 10 \nyears and reduce CO2 emissions by 10 percent.\n  What would retrofitting do for jobs?\n  According to the Rockefeller Foundation, this type of retrofitting \nnationally would create 3.3 million new jobs.\n  So why are we talking about building a pipeline that is going to \ncause the development of more tar sands oil, which is the dirtiest oil \nin the world--the dirtiest--when it is going to create a few jobs for a \nvery short period of time, a couple of years and that is it.\n  Why aren't we focusing on what we know works and creates a lot of \njobs and saves energy and saves money; that is, retrofitting all of the \nbuildings in America to make them energy efficient--3.3 million jobs in \nthat 10-year period of time, saving us untold billions of dollars in \nsavings for consumers in America, of course reducing greenhouse gases.\n  I find this whole issue of this Keystone Pipeline to just--at this \npoint in time when the planet is warming up, when we may be at that \ntipping point where we can't do anything about it, I find this debate \nabout the Keystone Pipeline to be out of bounds, considering the impact \nit is going to have.\n  I would say this: After all my years here, serving 10 years on the \nscience and tech committee in the House, serving here on agriculture, \nthe Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee as chair, study \nafter study I have read, I have come to this conclusion on why I cannot \nvote for the Keystone XL Pipeline. I have come to this one conclusion: \nEvery dollar that we spend today on developing and using more fossil \nfuels is another dollar spent in digging the graves of our \ngrandchildren.\n  I don't want to dig that grave anymore. It is time to get off our \nfossil fuel habits. I am not so naive as to think we can do this \novernight. I understand that. What we ought to be on is a very steep \nglide slope down, understanding that by focusing on renewable energies, \nthe wind and solar, ocean thermal energy conversion, all of those \nthings, geothermal, and, yes, retrofitting buildings to be more energy \nefficient would create hundreds of thousands more jobs, millions more \njobs than the pipeline. It will make us more secure as a nation. It \ncould have the effect of getting us on that steep glide slope down of \nfossil fuel. The fossil fuel era comes to an end. That is what we have \nto do. Bring the fossil fuel era to an end. The sooner we do it, the \nbetter it is going to be for our grandkids and our planet.\n  I know the Keystone Pipeline is a small part of it. It is a small \npart, but they all add up and one step leads to another. There are \nthose that say they are going to develop the tar sands regardless. I \ndon't believe that.\n  I have seen a lot of studies that show Canada can't ship that west, \nand it is too expensive to ship it east on the railroads. The only way \nthey have to go is the pipeline through America. I don't know whether \ncutting off the Keystone Pipeline will slow down or stop the tar sands \ndevelopment, but I believe we have to do everything in our power to \nslow it down and to get our neighbors to the north----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Just 1 more minute to finish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. To get our good neighbors, the Canadians, to the north to \nstart moving away from the development of the tar sands, both for their \ngood and for the good of our planet.\n  I don't want to keep digging the grave for our grandkids. I cannot \nvote any longer for anything that would develop or use more fossil \nfuels anywhere in our country or globally.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Before the Senator from Iowa leaves the floor, I thank \nhim not only for his heartfelt remarks, because what we are doing \nhere--we are here a short period of time in essence, whether we are \nhere 6 years or 26 or 36 or even longer.\n  How long has the Senator been here?\n\n[[Page S6054]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Forty.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Forty years. When we look at the universe, we are here a \nvery short time. He always thought about our kids and grandkids because \nthat is what our job is.\n  We are so fortunate that we had a life in America that gave us the \nopportunity with policies that kept us healthy enough to do our work.\n  The tar sands are the dirtiest kind of oil there is. My friend makes \nthat point. We need to protect the health of our families and the \nhealth of the planet, as my friend pointed out.\n  I just want to say to him how much I think it means to all Americans, \nthe leadership the Senator has shown his entire career and the passion \nhe is still showing today.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I may respond in kind.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my dear friend and colleague, long-standing in \nthe Senate and in the House before, and to thank the Senator for her \nintellectual and energetic leadership on all issues concerning the \nenvironment and the health of our people and the health of our planet. \nSenator Boxer has been a stalwart. She has been a Rock of Gibraltar \naround here in making sense and making sense of our debate and the \nissues surrounding energy, energy use, energy efficiency, always \nkeeping in mind what it means for the future of our kids.\n  As I leave the Senate I am happy to note the Senator from California \nwill still be here.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so much.\n  I see that Senator Murkowski is here. We will reserve the balance of \nour time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Thank you, Madam President. I assure my colleagues \nfrom Iowa, California, my colleagues from around the country, that as a \nSenator from an oil- and gas-producing State, a State where we have \nfossil fuels in abundance, that I, too, am focused on that next \ngeneration of energy security.\n  I want to do what we can to develop those renewables, whether it is \ngeothermal, whether it is our amazing hydro capacity, whether it is \nwhat we have with our oceans or our tides, our winds, and our Sun.\n  I also recognize very cleanly that when we are talking about energy \nand energy security, we also need to think about the geopolitics and \nour national security when it comes to energy use and our \nvulnerability.\n  There is a lot of discussion on this floor right now about the \nKeystone XL Pipeline and the number of jobs it will bring.\n  I think we recognize that when we build something, there is that \nflurry of activity. There are those jobs that are very real, very good, \nvery promising but can stretching jobs--jobs come and they go. What do \nwe have left after they have completed Keystone XL Pipeline?\n  What we have is in a very real sense an energy lifeline, a lifeline \nthat connects our friend and neighbor, Canada, to the north, to our \nopportunities for refining capacity in the Gulf of Mexico, our \nopportunities within this country to be more energy secure, to be less \nenergy dependent.\n  I wanted to take just a few minutes this afternoon to not necessarily \ntalk about the jobs perspective of the Keystone XL Pipeline, as \npassionate as I feel about that, but I wanted to focus on just a couple \nof points. One is the artificial chokepoints that are created in North \nAmerica if we do not move forward with the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  Earlier this month, the Energy Information Administration, EIA, \npublished a report on world transit chokepoints for the global oil and \ngas trade.\n  There are about 90 million barrels a day of oil on that world market. \nOf that, 56.5 million barrels, about 63 percent, is transported by \nship. It is moving around on our oceans.\n  This maritime trade that we see is dependent on a few chokepoints. We \nhave heard of some of them--obviously, the Strait of Hormuz, 17 million \nbarrels a day go through the Strait of Hormuz. We have the Strait of \nMalacca, where there are 15.2 million barrels a day. We also have the \nSuez Canal and the Sumed Pipeline, and the Bab el-Mandab between Yemen \nand the Horn of Africa.\n  Effectively what we have are these very tight chokepoints where this \nflow of oil that comes around the world, around the globe, moves \nthrough.\n  Meanwhile, the Keystone XL would have the capacity of about 830,000 \nbarrels per day. These are barrels that are secure, both economically \nand strategically, from a reliable friend and ally.\n  When we talk about the pros and cons of approving this pipeline, I \nthink it is important that we think beyond just the benefit to our \ncountry, the benefit that Canada will have as a trading opportunity, \nbut think about it from a national security perspective, from a global \nsecurity perspective. By not approving the Keystone XL Pipeline, the \nPresident is creating an artificial chokepoint here. Other pipelines \nare full. We know the rail capacity is under severe constraint.\n  So think about it. We already have enough chokepoints out there in \nsome of the most volatile points of the world. So factor this into the \ndiscussion that we have at hand.\n  The other point I would like to make is the integration of Keystone \nas a source of supply when we are talking about North American energy \nindependence. We talk about that a lot on the energy committee. It is \nimportant when we talk about integration to understand how this piece \nfrom Canada fits into the source of supply for the Americas.\n  Again, EIA back in January published a report. This was on liquid \nfuels in the Americas. North and South America hold about 536 billion \nbarrels of proved oil reserves. Back in 2012 the crude production was \n19 million barrels a day. In North America, Mexico, Canada, and the \nUnited States, this is the lion's share of the Western Hemispheric \nproduction that we have right here.\n  So integrating our markets between the U.S. and the Canadian side \njust makes sense. In fact, it is the economic reality that is already \non the ground. Last week I came to the floor talking about Keystone XL. \nI said: Why? Why is it such an issue, such a dilemma when we have 19 \nexisting cross-border oil pipelines between Canada, Mexico, and the \nUnited States? They have been operating. They have been providing a \nresource to the benefit of both nations for years, for decades. Now we \nare twisted in knots, arguing for 5 years about whether or not the \nKeystone XL should proceed. I think we are going to look back on this a \ngeneration from now and we are going to wonder why and how we blocked \nthis historic integration of our energy markets.\n  Then, the last thing I want to raise here is how the U.S. \nrefineries--particularly those in the Gulf--are truly best prepared for \nthe Canadian crude and thus bringing great benefits to Americans as a \nresult of the pipeline. We have the total refinery or distillation \ncapacity here in the Americas of about 27.7 million barrels per day. \nThis was last year's number. Roughly one-third of the world's refining \ncapacity is here in the Americas. In North America nearly onethird of \nthat capacity, 17.8 million barrels per day, are here in the United \nStates. Specifically, for heavy crude, we have over half of the world's \nchoking capacity here in this country.\n  The largest refineries in the Americas are down in the gulf coast as \nwell as in Venezuela. There are others on the west coast, in the \nMidwest, and some on the east coast. But if you look at the map of \nwhere the refineries are--in the Americas and really globally--it is \nobvious the destination for the Canadian oil is in the gulf coast area.\n  This is a debate on Keystone XL that has generated a lot of emotion \nand a lot of discussion about how, if you are opposed to it, what we \nneed to do is cut off this Canadian supply and somehow or other we will \nbe at a new phase in our energy production and consumption. Our reality \nis the Canadians will continue to produce. The good news, I think for \nall of us, is that the Canadians are utilizing technologies and \ninnovation in the industry that have come a remarkably long way in how \nthey access the crude in Alberta and how they are able to process it in \na way that truly is better for the environment.\n  So for those who are concerned that we must stop this pipeline dead \nin its tracks now, and if we do so, we will be a nation that has moved \non beyond oil, I think that belies our reality.\n\n[[Page S6055]]\n\n  I am one who wants to make sure we are pushing ourselves always to \nutilize our smarts and our technology to do better as we access our \nresources and do so in an environmentally responsible way. But I also \nwant to make sure that as a nation we have energy policies which are \ndirected toward resources that are affordable, abundant, clean, \ndiverse, and secure. The security aspect of it is something I do not \nwant my colleagues to forget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am going to yield Senator Sanders 10 minutes.\n  I heard ``clean energy.'' Just for the record, let's be clear. The \ntar sands oil is one of the dirtiest known on the planet. Heavy \nmetals--we went through it chapter and verse. The hardest to clean up--\nit is a nightmare. So if my friend wants clean energy, she should vote \nno.\n  With that I yield 10 minutes to Senator Sanders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. The issue that we are dealing with today is of enormous \nconsequence for our country and, in fact, for the entire planet. For \nthat reason I rise in very strong opposition to the legislation on the \nfloor and to the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  I strongly oppose this legislation and this project for a number of \nreasons. First and foremost, at a time when the scientific community is \nvirtually unanimous in telling us that climate change is real, that it \nis caused by human activity and carbon emissions, that it is already \ncausing devastating problems not only in the United States but all over \nthe world in terms of drought, forest fires, flooding, extreme weather \ndisturbances, and rising sea levels, at this moment when the scientific \ncommunity is so clear about the dangers inherent upon a further \ndependance on fossil fuels, it is absolutely imperative for the future \nwellbeing of this country that we listen to the scientists and we begin \nthe path forward to break our dependency on fossil fuel, not accelerate \nmore drilling for the dirtiest oil on the planet.\n  The scientific community is telling us that we have a narrow window \nof opportunity to address the crisis of climate change. We do not have \nyears and years. There are some people who think, in fact, that the \ngame is already over, that the problem is irreversible. But be that as \nit may be, clearly our job now is to move as dramatically, as \nforcefully, as aggressively as we can to transform our energy system \naway from fossil fuel to energy efficiency, to weatherization, to \nsustainable energy such as wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, and other \nsustainable technologies.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline would move us exactly in the wrong \ndirection. More dependance not only on fossil fuels but on some of the \ndirtiest fossil fuels imaginable--the dirtiest fossil fuels imaginable. \nThat is crazy. To reject what the scientific community is telling us \nand then to add insult to injury by going forward aggressively and \naccelerating the drilling of dirty oil is something that is almost \nbeyond comprehension.\n  I wonder what our kids and our grandchildren will think years and \nyears from now when they have to deal with the damage we have caused, \nwhen they have to deal with the floods and the extreme weather \ndisturbances and the droughts and the wars that are fought by people \nover limited resources. I wonder what they will think about a Congress \nwhich was told by those who know the most to move away from fossil \nfuels, and, in fact, moved in exactly the wrong direction by \naccelerating drilling for the dirtiest oil on the Earth?\n  That is the major point. But furthermore, this legislation is being \nreferred to by some as a ``jobs program.'' Well, in my opinion, we do \nneed a jobs program. We need a major jobs program. Real unemployment in \nthis country is close to 11 percent. Youth unemployment is 20 percent. \nUnemployment in the construction trade industries is very high. We need \na real jobs program.\n  That is why we have to invest a substantial sum of money into \nrebuilding our crumbling infrastructure--our roads, our bridges, our \nwater systems, our rail, our airports. In doing that we improve life in \nthis country. We make our Nation more productive, more efficient. That \nis very different than creating jobs through the Keystone Pipeline, \nwhich damages the future of our planet and the lives of our kids and \nour grandchildren.\n  Furthermore, when people talk about this being a jobs program, let's \nunderstand that there is no debate that what we are talking about are \nless than 50 permanent jobs--less than 50 permanent jobs. So to suggest \nthis is some kind of big jobs program is nothing more than a cruel hoax \nand a misleading hoax to workers in this country who need decent-paying \njobs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield without losing his time?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the time I use in this \ncolloquy be taken off the time I have left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to the Senator, your point is so well taken. I just \nwant the Senator to know that this morning I said that the CEO of \nKeystone commented that there will be only 35 permanent jobs with the \npipeline. I stand corrected. I went back and looked: 50 jobs--50 jobs.\n\n  The reason I want to take a minute to engage in this colloquy is that \nmy friend has been, I think, one of the strongest and most effective \nvoices for job creation and building a middle class that we have in the \nSenate. I was just looking at the numbers and wanted to go through a \ncouple of things without my friend losing any time. In 2012 the U.S. \ninstallation of solar panels grew at a rate of 27 percent. I know my \nfriend is trying desperately--and we work together on a lot of issues--\nto get us to put more of these solar panels on. In 2013 the solar \nindustry employed 142,000 Americans in good-paying jobs. In 2013 the \nU.S. solar industry added 24,000.\n  So just looking at solar--and wind is another great story. At the end \nof 2013 the U.S. wind industry supported 560 manufacturing facilities \nand supported 50,500 full-time jobs in development, siting, \nconstruction, transportation and manufacturing, operation and \nservices--direct jobs.\n  When we look at putting 50,500 full-time jobs, 142,000 jobs from \nsolar, and you compare it to 50 full-time jobs, I think the Senator was \nso right to make the jobs argument what the Senator is making of it. It \nis not 50 jobs to do something that is going to make life better for \nour people. It endangers the planet, and it has these terrible \npollutants which cause respiratory illness, cancer, and the rest.\n  But I just wanted to thank the Senator for bringing up the issue of \njobs because it is the biggest phony-baloney argument when you have the \nCEO of the company itself--of the pipeline--admit that it is 50 full-\ntime jobs permanently. I think we have to shatter this illusion and \ncontinue to talk about clean energy future and really good jobs. I \nyield to my friend.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator. I would mention that several years \nago we worked together to pass the Energy Efficiency Block Grant \nProgram, which pumped billions of dollars into weatherization, into \nsustainable energy.\n  I can tell you that in the State of Vermont right now work is being \ndone weatherizing homes, saving substantial sums of money on fuel bills \nfor working people, seeing a 30-, 40-percent reduction in fuel bills \nand equivalent reductions in the emission of carbon into the air. That \nis what we should be investing in all over America. Let's create those \njobs. Let's create jobs building the wind turbines and the solar panels \nthat we desperately need.\n  We need to be aggressive in that area and above that and beyond that. \nEverybody knows that bridges in Vermont, in California--the Senator is \nchairman of not only the environmental committee but the public works \ncommittee. She knows that as well as anybody. We need to rebuild our \ncrumbling infrastructure. I understand why the construction workers \nwant these jobs, with high unemployment in construction industry.\n  We have to put these guys to work and we can do that. We can do it by \ntransforming our energy system. We can do it by rebuilding our \ncrumbling infrastructure. We are talking about millions of decent-\npaying jobs, not 50 permanent jobs or a few thousand construction jobs. \nWe are talking about millions of permanent jobs.\n\n[[Page S6056]]\n\n  I would further add, when we heard this discussion during the caucus \ntoday--and I would ask the Senator of California, the chair of the \ncommittee, if my Republican friends are so concerned about jobs, please \ntell me where we are going with the wind tax credit and the solar tax \ncredit, which have been so very important to creating jobs in the wind \nand solar energy.\n  Clearly, our friends who talk about the ``all of the aboves'' are \nenthusiastically supporting these tax credits.\n  Will my friend from California enlighten us?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am so pleased the Senator made the point.\n  Today we had Senator Thune make an eloquent statement about jobs--\neloquent--and I thought he was going to change his position on minimum \nwage. How about that. Try raising a family on that.\n  These wind tax credits and these solar tax credits, this is creating \na boom. I will say in my State, as in yours, I put something in the \nRecord today, we have bounced back from this recession better than \nalmost any State because of clean energy. It is such a win/win.\n  But our friends on the other side, when it is something the oil \ncompanies want--oh, they are out there, oh, yes, yes, jobs. But we know \nthis is 50 jobs. This is the CEO of this pipeline company admitting \nthat is it, 50 jobs. So it is not about the jobs, it is about their \nview of energy, which is the old way, which is the going backward. This \nwas not embracing the clean energy future so that we can, in fact, \ncreate many more jobs and keep the planet clean.\n  Mr. SANDERS. If I may reclaim my time and wind down and finish my \nremarks, there are two basic issues. No. 1, I know many of my \nRepublican friends deny what the overwhelming majority of scientists \nare telling us; that is, not only is climate change real, that it is \ncaused by human activity, that it is already causing devastating \nproblems. To continue to deny that reality is to endanger the lives of \nour kids, our grandchildren, and the planet on which they will live. To \nsay to people all over the world that we Americans are concerned about \nclimate change and yet vote for a project which will encourage and \naccelerate the excavation of some of the dirtiest oil in the world will \nmake all of us look like fools and hypocrites throughout the world and \nwill make future generations wonder what we were thinking about on that \nvote today.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, it took an election on November 4. It \ntook an election, but here we are at long last, some 6 years after the \ninitial application for the Keystone XL Pipeline was filed and, as you \nknow, for a long time now, I think at least since 2012, we have been \ntrying to get a vote, the very same vote that is now scheduled for this \nafternoon. We have been trying to get a vote on the Senate floor so we \ncould see whether there was a bipartisan majority, a supermajority of \n60 or more, who would join our colleagues in the House and pass this \nbill authorizing the Keystone XL Pipeline and send it to the President.\n  We know the Keystone XL Pipeline would be good for our economy. We \nknow it would be good for job creation, and I know there has been some \nquibbling, perhaps, about how many jobs, but the Department of State \nhas said about 42,000 jobs would be created as a result of this \nproject.\n  We also know this would be good for U.S. energy security to have a \nsource of safe energy from Canada--one of our best allies and partners \nto the north--as opposed to shipping it in from troubled regions like \nthe Middle East. It makes sense from an energy security standpoint, and \nit would be good for national security as well. It would also be good \nfor our strategic interests overseas.\n  I have heard my colleagues, mainly on the other side say that, well, \nwe are concerned about the environmental impact, and I am too, but \nPresident Obama's own State Department has once again found that the \nKeystone XL Pipeline would have a negligible impact on the environment.\n  In short, even in a moment of intense polarization in Washington, \nthere is a strong consensus on Keystone, and if we get 60-plus votes \ntoday I think that consensus will be demonstrated.\n  Will we all agree? No. We have strongly held beliefs on both sides of \nthis issue. But the way we function in the Senate is by actually \nscheduling votes--as we are going to have today--and letting the \nmajority carry the day. And that, I predict, will happen today.\n  This is a day that I know my colleague, the senior Senator from North \nDakota, Senator Hoeven, has been working for a long time, again, across \nthe aisle. He has been our No. 1 leader on this issue for years now and \nhe has consistently explained the benefits of the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  He comes from North Dakota, the second most productive State in the \ncountry when it comes to oil and gas. I come from the No. 1 State. I \npoint that out often when it comes to producing oil and gas, and this \nhas been a renaissance for the American economy and for American \nenergy, what has happened in America, thanks to private investment and \ninnovation in the oil and gas industry.\n  Senator Hoeven has constantly worked with people across the aisle to \nrally the kind of support that has led us to this day, and he has \nrepeatedly pressed the majority leader, Senator Reid, to allow a \nbinding vote on the floor such as we are going to have today, and then \nthe next step will be to send it to President Obama for his signature.\n  Well, we haven't had that kind of vote before the November 4 \nelection. That is why I said elections can change things and indeed, \napparently, it has changed the majority leader's mind to allow this \nvote, which at long last we will have this afternoon.\n  Why has there been a change of attitude on the part of the majority \nleader to allow us to hold this vote this week? I will leave that to \nthe pundits, but I will say our collective decision on Keystone should \nbe determined by what is in America's national interests, not the \ninterest of a single political party or the interest of a single \nSenator. The interests of our country as a whole should be our guide.\n  For that matter, it is time for our President to put his cards on the \ntable. I know once this vote was scheduled, the President's press \nsecretary and the President himself made some ambiguous remarks, \nleaving in doubt whether he would actually sign or would ultimately \nveto this legislation. I hope we don't see a continuation of the \ngamesmanship we have seen until this point, and that once this bill \npasses--if it does this afternoon--the majority leader will send it \npromptly to the President so the President can make that decision.\n  What I mean by I hope the gamesmanship doesn't continue is I know \nthere is the flexibility the majority leader might have to actually \nhold the bill here and to wait until after the December 6 runoff \nelection in Louisiana before sending it to the President. But I hope we \ndon't have that kind of gamesmanship.\n  The American people deserve the truth, they deserve accountability, \nand it has been more than 6 years since this application first came \nthrough. The proponents of this project deserve this vote today, as do \nthe American people.\n  As a matter of fact, back in March of 2012, before his reelection, \nthe President traveled to Cushing, OK, to champion the Texas leg of the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. He didn't have any real role to play in \nauthorizing that, because that was within the continental United \nStates. The President's role, and the one that this bill would force \nhis hand on, literally, is what would authorize this international \npipeline between Canada and the United States. That does require his \napproval. This legislation would require it or, in fact, mandate it.\n  But he went to Cushing, OK, to champion the Texas leg of the Keystone \nPipeline project, and it did not need his approval, but at the time he \nsaid he would work to expedite that portion. However, that portion \ndidn't require his approval and it was already up and running at the \ntime. So you will have to determine why the President would go there \nfor a project that did not need his approval and said he would expedite \nit--what his real motivation is. But he said:\n\n       And as long as I'm President, we're going to keep on \n     encouraging oil development and infrastructure and we're \n     going to do it in a way that protects the health and safety \n     of\n\n[[Page S6057]]\n\n     the American people. We don't have to choose between one or \n     the other, we can do both.\n\n  I actually agree with what the President said, the words I just \nquoted. That is a good statement of what our policy should be. But I \nhave been around Washington long enough to know that we can't just \nlisten to what people say, we have to watch what they actually do, \nbecause sometimes those are diametrically opposed.\n  In this case, notwithstanding what the President said in Cushing, OK, \nhe has continued to delay, delay, and delay, making a final decision on \nthe portion of Keystone XL Pipeline that requires his approval.\n  But we are here this afternoon to say enough is enough. Regardless of \nhow this vote turns out, it is time for the President to explain his \nviews on the project that his own State Department has said would \ncreate 42,000 jobs in America. He can choose to endorse the Keystone XL \nPipeline and thereby deliver a significant boost to America's economy, \nAmerica's security, and America's relations with our largest trading \npartner in Canada.\n  Alternatively, the President can choose to oppose Keystone and \nthereby miss a golden opportunity to promote a richer, stronger, and \nsafer American future. I can only hope he makes the right choice.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 51 minutes for the opposition.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Hoeven controls 67 minutes and Senator \nLandrieu controls 32 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. While we are waiting for Senator Whitehouse--he is on his \nway--I want to focus the attention of those who are watching this \ndebate on truly what we are talking about. If this was about building a \npipeline that was carrying something that didn't hurt anybody, I \nwouldn't be standing here. But this is about building a pipeline that \nis going to carry the dirtiest oil we know of, and this dirty oil is \nalready causing lots of problems.\n  Where it is refined in Port Arthur, TX, I met with the people there. \nI met with the people there. Senators don't live near refineries. \nAgain, if I am wrong on that, I would like to be corrected. People live \nnear refineries sometimes because it is where affordable housing is, \nand this is what it looks like. They do not want this stuff.\n  With all the talk of jobs, jobs, jobs, let's be clear. The CEO of the \ncompany said 50 jobs. So if you want to lay this kind of misery on \npeople who live in this community, vote aye. That is fine. But just \ntake a look at this. We don't see many kids playing on this playground \nbecause this pollution is vicious. It adds more heavy metals. It causes \nasthma. The pollutants cause cancer. We are talking about lead and we \nare talking about sulfur in very heavy quantities.\n  So let's be clear. We don't see my friends who support this talking \nabout what happens when you refine, but that is what happens. If this \nwas the only thing we could do to make ourselves energy independent, \nthat is one thing, but I have already shown, with the Senator from \nVermont, Mr. Sanders, how many incredible jobs are being produced \nacross this Nation in clean energy: solar, wind, geothermal. We are \nlooking at a potential of millions. In California, those clean energy \njobs have led us out of the darkest recession we have seen since the \nGreat Depression, and I have put those statistics into the Record.\n  I have to say this. In all the years I have been in public life, \nstarting when I was a county official, not one constituent ever came up \nto me and said: Barbara, the air is too clean. Oh, God. My air is so \nclean. The water I drink is so pure. Please don't get in the way of \nmaking it dirty. I have been in office for a very long time. No one has \never said that. On the contrary, what they say is: Please, my child has \nasthma. Please don't back off. Don't let Big Oil or big coal or the \nKoch brothers or whoever it is stand in the way of my family having a \ngood quality of life.\n  We can take a look at a country where they have thrown the \nenvironment under the bus. Here it is. This is what it looks like. That \nis what it looks like in China. I am sure you have heard a lot of the \nspeeches in China that we will be hearing here: Oh, we need the jobs \nand we need the energy. They realize now they are in trouble. The \nPresident just made a pact with the leader of China to cut back on \npollution. But this is what happens when you throw the environment \nunder the bus. People can't breathe. Kids have to wear masks. That is a \nfact.\n  Go to any school and ask the kids--and I know my friend, our great \nPresiding Officer--ask the kids: How many of you have asthma or how \nmany of you know someone who has asthma? Honest to God, more than half \nthe class will raise their hands.\n  We need clean energy. We need clean energy. We need clean energy \njobs. And if we can clean up our coal, I will be right there. If we can \ndo safe nuclear and not build these plants on earthquake faults, as \nthey did in my State, fine. But don't unleash the dirtiest oil known to \nmankind when the CEO of the company says it means 50 jobs.\n  We all know that oil is going to be pumped right out of here. We all \nknow it is the toughest oil to clean up because we have seen the spills \nin Kalamazoo, MI. We have seen the spills in Arkansas. Because of the \nnature of this oil, the heaviness of this oil, they are still cleaning \nup that oil 3 years later.\n  It is now my pleasure to yield to Senator Whitehouse for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the Senator for her constant leadership on \nthis issue. I am going to start on a somewhat unusual note because I \nwant to compliment my lead adversary here, Senator Landrieu, who has \nfought so hard to bring this bill to the floor. She is passionate about \ngetting this done, and it is because of her efforts that we are here.\n  I have to say I am just as passionate as she in opposition to this \nbill. Many of us come from coal States or oil States or natural gas \nStates. Rhode Island doesn't have coal--at least it hasn't in \ngenerations. We used to mine coal in Portsmouth, in Cumberland, but \nthat has been a long time ago. We don't have natural gas sources. We \ndon't pump oil.\n  What we do have is a coastline, and at that coastline what coal and \noil and natural gas are doing to all of us through the operation of \nnatural laws, through the operation of the laws of science--stuff we \ncan't get around because this isn't opinion--is very harmful to our \nisland.\n  Naval Station Newport has a tide gauge. My friend Senator Manchin was \nkind enough to come and visit from West Virginia and we started out \nbright and early in the morning and our first stop was with the Navy \nfolks down at the tide gauge. At that tide gauge what they show is that \nsince the 1930s the water levels are up 10 inches.\n  We had something very big happen in Rhode Island. In the 1930s we had \nthe hurricane of 1938. If anybody wants to take 2 minutes and Google \nhurricane of 1938 and hit images, they will see terrific destruction. \nThey will see our capital city flooded to the top of the buses. They \nwill see houses smashed to flinders and boats thrown up onto the land. \nThat was with a sea 10 inches below what we have now, and every \nresponsible scientist tells us the risk of worse and bigger ocean \nstorms has increased because of the emission of carbons.\n  So I have a very clear perspective on this, and that is that we have \nto address our carbon pollution problem before it comes home to roost \nin very dangerous ways in my State. It is there already. As the Senator \nfrom West Virginia saw, we have fishermen who say this is not my \ngrandfather's ocean. Their world has changed because of the way we have \nchanged it. This pipeline, because of the filthiness of the fuel that \nit brings into the market, will add additional carbon dioxide in the \namount of nearly 6 million cars per year on the roads--6 million cars \nper year on the roads--and that comes home to roost in Rhode Island. \nThat comes home to roost in warming waters.\n\n[[Page S6058]]\n\n  Narragansett Bay is nearly 4 degrees--mean winter water temperature--\nwarmer than it was 50 years ago. I can remember driving over the \nNewport Bridge and Jamestown Bridge and looking down in the winter and \nseeing trawlers out at work--trawlers at work fishing for the winter \nflounder. The winter flounder is gone. It has had more than a 90-\npercent crash, largely because, as the scientists have told me, the \nwarmer Narragansett Bay is no longer hospitable to the fish. Four \ndegrees doesn't seem like a big deal to me. It probably doesn't seem \nlike a big deal to any human, for whom the water is kind of an alien \nplace, but for the fish that live in it, 4 degrees is an ecosystem \nshift. My wife, a major professor at the University of Rhode Island \nSchool of Oceanography, explained that to me several decades ago for \nthe first time.\n  The argument is that this is going to bring jobs. I am all for those \njobs. But let us not be selective about when we are for jobs. If we are \nonly for jobs when it is oil pipelines, then something else is going on \nthan the concern about jobs. Where was the concern about jobs when a \nbipartisan piece of legislation called Shaheen-Portman for energy \nefficiency was on the floor and was estimated to create not 42,000 \ntemporary jobs, not less than 4,000 direct temporary jobs, not less \nthan 50 permanent jobs, but 190,000 jobs? That bill got nowhere. It \ndied here, and it died here for reasons that were very open on the \nfront of the paper.\n  Jeanne Shaheen's opponent, who is a former colleague of ours, asked \nto have the bill die so she would not have a legislative accomplishment \nto her credit. So the agreement that the bill was going to pass got \nreworked, and the folks came back to Majority Leader Reid and said: \nActually, we are not ready to support this bill. We need a vote on \nKeystone Pipeline. We need a sense of the Senate on Keystone Pipeline. \nSenator Reid said: OK. We can have a sense of the Senate on Keystone \nPipeline. Agreed. Then they came back again--moved the goalpost again--\nand said: Well, we need more than a sense of the Senate now. We \nactually need a hard vote on the Keystone Pipeline. Leader Reid checked \naround and said: All right. I don't like this much, but sure. Fine. In \norder to move Shaheen-Portman, a 190,000-job bill, go ahead and have \nyour vote. Then they came back and moved the goalpost a third time. \nThey said: We don't just need a vote on the Keystone Pipeline, we need \nto win the vote, and if you can't give us a win on the vote, then you \ndon't get Shaheen-Portman.\n  When the goalposts get moved that often, you can pretty much figure \nout there is something more going on than the merits of the bill. They \ndidn't want the bill to pass. They didn't want it to come up. But where \nwas the concern then about 190,000 jobs, when everybody is in an uproar \nabout these 40,000 indirect temporary jobs?\n  I will stop right now and do anything to get infrastructure \nlegislation passed and put people to work rebuilding America's roads, \nrebuilding America's water pipes, and rebuilding America's bridges. We \ncan put hundreds of thousands of people to work doing that. But when we \nhad the chance to do that, when Chairman Boxer brought a 6-year \nenvironment bill out of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nwhere every billion dollars we invest in highway infrastructure \nsupports 13,000 jobs, and this was a multibillion--multibillion--dollar \nbill, did they pass it? No, they filibustered it, stopped it, and gave \nus a 3-to-5-month stopgap bill, during which nobody is going to enter \ninto any big contracts, depressing employment, and moving the bill into \nthe next Congress where they thought they would have a majority and in \nfact they will.\n  If you want to do something about jobs, we can take your 42,000 dirty \npipeline jobs and we can raise that by a factor of 5 just by doing \nShaheen-Portman. We can raise it by a factor of 10 or 15 with \ninfrastructure legislation. We can do big jobs bills, and we are ready \nto do them, but not when it is only dirty oil pipelines. Because there \nare two sides of the ledger. There is the side that says jobs, and \nthere is the side that says harm. My problem with this is that our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle will not look at the second \npage. They pretend the second page doesn't exist.\n\n  Even in coastal States where I have been, down to Georgia, to Sapelo \nIsland, where the University of Georgia has a terrific marine science \nundertaking that has been going on for decades now, they are very \nclear. Carbon pollution is doing real harm to the coast. It is raising \nthe Georgia sea level at a rate that is challenging the ability of the \nfamous marshes to keep up. If they cannot keep up, they flood. If they \nflood, they get washed away and you lose that entire infrastructure \nthat supports clammers and oysterers and fishermen and tourism and all \nthe things that are important for Georgia. I say that because I see my \nfriend Senator Isakson on the floor.\n  You could use an example of everything that stays in the country, and \nour colleagues will never ever look at that other page. If you were the \nCFO of a corporation and you only looked at one side of a ledger, you \nwould go to jail for that.\n  It shouldn't be asking too much to ask our colleagues to reflect on \nthe fact that there are benefits to this pipeline and there are harms \nto this pipeline. From my State's point of view, it is all harm. From a \nnet point of view, the harm vastly outweighs the value by I think \nvirtually any State's measure--perhaps not South Dakota. There is real \nharm that this will cause. Six million cars' equivalent of \nCO2 added every year is more than we need.\n  So I think we need to turn the corner. More importantly, it is not \nwhat I think that matters; the American people understand we need to \nturn the corner on climate change and carbon pollution. It doesn't \nmatter whom you ask. If you ask independent voters, it is better than 2 \nto 1. If you ask all voters, it is about 2 to 1. If you ask young \nvoters, it is more like 4 to 1. There is a poll that shows that among \nyoung Republican voters, self-identified Republican voters under the \nage of 35, when asked about a politician who denies that climate change \nis real, they say that politician--they are asked to check off the box, \nand what they checked off was ``ignorant, out of touch, or crazy.''\n  So it is time to make this turn, and there is no better moment to \nmake this turn than on this pipeline that would bring the filthiest \nfuel on the planet into circulation and hurt even more those of us who \nare already being hurt by carbon pollution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, my oldest son graduated from Tulane \nUniversity in New Orleans with a master's degree in economics. He wrote \na paper for his master's thesis called ``The Dutch Disease.'' I had \nnever heard of the Dutch disease, but, him being my son, I read the \nthesis because I thought it would be important. What is the Dutch \ndisease about? The Dutch disease is about a country that has an \ninfinite supply of wealth--i.e., resources--but doesn't ever use that \nmoney to reinvest in its people. They buy what they need. It was about \nthe Middle East, and if you look at the Middle East, every country over \nthere that has a tremendous supply of oil and petroleum--what do they \ndo? They buy their doctors and bring them over. They don't build \nuniversities. They don't make investments in themselves, and they give \nmoney to their people. The country's people suffer from the Dutch \ndisease because the money is not reinvested to expand the wealth of the \ncountry.\n  There is another disease called the dumb disease. The dumb disease is \nwhen you don't have a natural resource and have the opportunity to get \nsome of it, but you turn it away for reasons that don't make any sense.\n  I have tremendous respect for the gentleman from Rhode Island and the \ndistinguished lady from California. In fact, I traveled with the \ndistinguished lady from California to go to Disko Bay in Greenland to \nlisten to Dr. Alley talk about climate change and climatology. While I \ncompletely realize that carbon is something we need to reduce in the \natmosphere, I don't completely buy into the fact that it is the be-all \nand end-all destructor of the environment. I think it is good politics \nfor all of us to reduce carbon everywhere we can but not by stopping \nprogression, not by stopping jobs and not developing.\n  On the Keystone XL Pipeline, let's be realistic. You are going to \nhave up to\n\n[[Page S6059]]\n\n500,000 barrels of oil a day traveling from the tar sands in Canada to \nHouston, TX, and the South of the United States to be refined, and it \nis not going to generate one single isotope of carbon because it is \ngoing to be underground. It is not going to be burned. It is not going \nto be carried in a tanker truck that is going to be burning diesel in \ntransport. So you have less generation of carbon by building the \npipeline than you would have otherwise.\n  Secondly, as another alternative, that oil is going to go somewhere. \nIf we don't allow the TransCanada pipeline to be built by the Keystone \npeople in the United States, they are going to build a pipeline to \nVancouver, and they are going to ship, on ships, the oil from the tar \nsands to China. In other words, it is going to get somewhere where \nthere are not good standards and more carbon will go into the \natmosphere. Just because you burn it in America doesn't mean it is not \ngoing to get to China and vice versa.\n  We have estimates from the people of expertise that this would \ngenerate 42,000 jobs. That is a lot of jobs. I think that is important. \nThat is No. 1.\n  No. 2, it will give us a diversified supply of petroleum in the \nUnited States and help continue the United States on the track of being \nan energy-independent country--the most important thing we can possibly \ndo for our national security.\n  The only reason the Russians went into Ukraine and Crimea was simply \nbecause they held the gasoline and petroleum to hold those countries \nhostage and there wasn't another source from which to take it.\n  Every time we improve our access to petroleum, every time we improve \nour access to energy, we are improving our national defense and the \nnational security of our country, and we maintain ourselves as a \nsuperpower not just by name but by economic force as well.\n  So I am all for reducing carbon isotopes in the atmosphere, and I \nthink running that pipeline does exactly that because it moves it \nwithout burning it. And I am for jobs. I am for 42,000 jobs in America \nanytime we can get them. I am for expanding our access. Sure, some of \nthe petroleum that is refined will be sold in the world market. It will \nbe refined in the United States. If we had a shortage somewhere else, \nwe could help make up that shortage. We could take that money and raise \nthe supply and reduce the price of petroleum in the world marketplace.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline just makes good sense. Let's not do \nsomething dumb and reject an asset our country has sitting there. We \nwould be sitting on a ham sandwich and starving to death. Looking at \nour food and not eating it would be crazy, and we have the access to do \nit.\n  The State Department on five separate occasions--five separate \noccasions--has approved it. We have tried for 6 years to get this vote. \nRegardless of how we get it, I hope we get it and I hope we get 60 or \nmore votes here.\n  I hope the President will rethink his position on vetoing the bill \nbecause the American people are for it, the petroleum industry is for \nit, the automobile industry is for it, it generates revenues and jobs \nin the United States of America, it diversifies our energy supply, and \nit makes us more energy independent than we would otherwise be.\n  Just as the Dutch disease afflicts countries that don't take \nadvantage of the wealth they have in terms of natural resources, the \ndumb disease is when you have access to natural resources and you pass \nthem up because of reasons that are political and not practical.\n  I am going to cast my vote in favor of the Keystone XL Pipeline. I \nwill cast my vote for jobs in America, for common sense, and for not \nsuccumbing to the dumb disease in the United States of America and \ninstead investing in our petroleum and our ability to refine and our \nability to use it.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Before my friend leaves, since he said those of us who \nvote against this have the dumb disease--and I think it is funny. I am \nnot insulted in any way, shape, or form. But I just feel very \ndifferently because I don't think it is dumb to say no to a resource \nthat you think is going to hurt the people because it is such dirty, \nfilthy oil.\n  The CEO of the pipeline company says it means 50 permanent jobs, when \nyou could have so many more millions of jobs if you embrace clean \nenergy.\n  Also, I don't think it is dumb at all to say what the economists are \nnow saying, which is that it is going to raise gas prices at home \nbecause it is going to be exported.\n  So I think ``dumb'' is in the eyes of the beholder. And I think my \ncolleague is very smart, but I don't think those of us who say no to \nKeystone are dumb. I think we are smart. I think we are looking at the \nfuture. I think we are standing up for the health of the American \npeople. I think we are standing up for jobs and a clean energy economy, \nand I feel very strongly about that. And what we are talking about is \nthe dirtiest, filthiest oil on the planet.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. This debate is really about some simple fundamental \nprinciples. Keystone is a Canadian export line. That is what the oil is \ngoing to do. It is going to travel from the dirtiest tar sands fields \nin Canada through a pipeline like a straw through the United States, \ndown to the Gulf of Mexico, and then be exported out of the United \nStates of America.\n  How do I know this? I know it because I made the amendment on the \nfloor of the House of Representatives saying this oil stays in America. \nDo you know who opposed it? The American Petroleum Institute and the \nCanadian Government. This is the Canadian Keystone export pipeline. We \ntake all the environmental risk and this oil goes out of our country.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, we still import approximately the same amount \nof oil in 2014 as we imported in 1975 when we put the ban on \nexportation of oil on the books. We are still exporting young men and \nwomen overseas into the Middle East to protect tankers coming into our \ncountry, and we are going to build a pipeline for the Canadians down to \nthe Gulf of Mexico so they can use us as a straw to send it down and \nthen export it out of our country? Where is the American angle on this?\n  I keep hearing that it is about American security. Do you want to \nknow what this is all about? I will tell you what it is all about. The \nCanadian companies want to make more money. They want to take the oil \nfrom Canada, bring it down through the United States, bring it to the \nGulf of Mexico, and then send it to Europe, Latin America, and China. \nWhy? Because they will pay more for this oil than the United States \nwill pay for this oil. They will make billions of extra dollars once \nthey can get it on a ship because the price for world oil is set at a \nprice, which is called Brent, but it is the global price.\n  Well, in the United States, because of fracking, because of our rise \nin domestic energy production, and because of our dramatic increase in \nfuel economy standards, we are producing more oil and consuming less \nsimultaneously, and the price of oil at the gasoline pump for people \nwho use home heating oil as a way of heating their home is going down \ndramatically.\n  What does that translate into? Well, every time the price of a barrel \nof oil goes down just 1 cent at the pump, it is $1 billion into the \npockets of the American consumers--$1 billion. So from July of 2008 \nuntil today, it has dropped from $4.11 to $2.88 at the pump, and \nAmericans all across America are not afraid to go to a gasoline station \nright now and fear that they are going to be tipped upside down and \nhave money shaken out of their pockets because they can pay $2.88 and \nit is dropping.\n  If we keep the Canadian oil in the United States, that price is going \nto drop even more because we will have to import even less than we do \nnow from the Middle East. That helps consumers. That helps our economy. \nThat should be the plan, not taking all these environmental risks and \nnot getting the economic benefits.\n  The lower the price is, the greater the economic activity in our \ncountry. Manufacturers start to say: I will build my plant here. The \nprice of energy is much lower. There is much greater economic activity \nbecause people have more money in their pockets to buy other American \nproducts other than\n\n[[Page S6060]]\n\noil, and they buy them in their neighborhoods, they buy them in their \ncommunities. That is what this should be all about.\n  What is this debate not about--I mean decidedly not about? It is not \nabout solar, it is not about wind, and it is not about energy \nefficiency. It should be. If we are going to debate an energy future \nfor our country, it should not be oil above all; it should be all of \nthe above.\n  So right now what we are hearing from the other side is that they \njust might not support the extension of the wind tax break, even as \nwind has now created 80,000 new jobs in the American economy. They are \nnot talking about extending the solar tax break for another 5 years, \nwhich they should be. That has creating 142,000 new jobs in the \nAmerican economy. And I will tell you why. Because this is an agenda to \nmake sure the oil industry gets what they want on the one hand, and \nthey can starve their competitors on the other--wind, solar, energy \nefficiency.\n  Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman had a bill that addressed energy \nefficiency. It has been dying here on the floor of the Senate for the \nlast 2 years. What is its biggest problem? I will tell you what it is: \nIt creates 190,000 new jobs in energy efficiency which would reduce the \nneed to use fossil fuels to generate the same amount of electricity \nbecause the single wisest way to consume energy is to not consume it in \nthe first place so you don't have to take the money out of your \npockets. That is energy efficiency. That is working smarter, not \nharder. Shaheen-Portman, dead. The Republicans killed it. The wind tax \nbreak, dead. The solar tax break is not going to be extended.\n  If we are going to have a debate in our country, if we are going to \ntalk about job creation, if we are going to have something that really \ndeals with the future of our country, let's put solar, wind, energy \nefficiency, biomass, and geothermal--let's bring them all out here. \nLet's have a big debate and not just something that has the Canadians \nuse America as a conduit--as a straw--to get their oil out of our \ncountry so they can make an extra $5 or $10 or $15 for every barrel \nthey sign. You don't have to go to Harvard Business School to see this \nbusiness plan on a 3-by-5 card. If you get it out of America, you make \n$10 to $15 more per barrel. It is simple. There is no thinking required \nhere.\n  What is in it for us? The dirtiest oil in the world goes through the \nUnited States so that Canadian oil companies can make money. It makes \nno sense, not if America is generating hundreds of thousands of new \njobs with wind and solar and the tax breaks in those industries are on \nthe table to be killed. We should be trying to use this as a debate \nabout the big issues. Yes, reducing greenhouse gases, but it is job \ncreation and it is national security. If that oil stayed in America--\nthis Canadian oil--and if wind and solar and biomass and geothermal \nwere given those incentives, we could tell those Arab nations that we \ndon't need their oil any more than we need their sand. That is what we \nshould be talking about out here, that plan. That is not what we are \ntalking about, however. We are talking about something that is very \nnarrow and only creates jobs in the short run. Once the pipeline is \nbuilt, it takes almost a handful of employees to run that pipeline. \nRather than creating the permanent jobs in wind and solar, the \npermanent jobs in energy efficiency, the permanent jobs in solar panel \nmanufacturing--how do you possibly expect the American people to think \nthis institution is serious if we are not going to be having that kind \nof a debate?\n  Ladies and gentlemen, don't kill the production tax credit; don't \nkill the solar tax breaks in 2 years. Let's have the big discussion \nabout where America is going. Let's do it in a way that has a \ncomprehensive plan which is ultimately put together.\n  I say to you right now: Do not build this Canadian Keystone \n``export'' pipeline. Don't build it until we have the debate, which \nthis country expects. Young people in campuses all across the country \nexpect a debate on wind and solar; they expect a debate on using \ntechnology. We are the brain country; we are the technology country. We \nare the country that can invent our way into this new world--into \nreducing greenhouse gases and breaking our dependence on imported oil. \nThat is who we are as a nation.\n  We put a man on the Moon in 8 years. We were challenged, and we did \nit. We invented new metals and new propulsion systems. We are the can-\ndo Nation. We invent the new technologies that young people want. We \nare not doing that here today. We are just helping the Canadians take \noil and send it right out of our country.\n  If they would accept an amendment to say this oil stays here in \nAmerica, that would change the debate a little bit. If they were \nwilling to add wind and solar tax breaks and efficiency incentives, \nthat would change the debate. But they are not going to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask for one additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. By the way, I just served over in the House in the last 4 \nyears when the Republicans--the tea party--took over the House of \nRepresentatives. What did they do on an ongoing basis? Cut incentives \nfor renewables, cut the energy efficiency budget, kept passing bills \nthat stripped the Environmental Protection Agency of its ability to \nregulate pollution and its ability to increase the fuel economy \nstandards, not just for cars but for boats and planes. That is not the \ndirection our country should be going in.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.\n  I also have to say at the same time that I have the highest respect \nfor Senator Landrieu. She is a passionate and dedicated and articulate \nforce fighting for her State and fighting for her beliefs. There is no \none in this entire institution whom I respect more than her and her \npassionate belief and the cause she is championing out here on the \nSenate floor, but at the same time, I respectfully urge a ``no'' vote \non the Keystone Pipeline.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. He calls it the \nKeystone ``export'' pipeline, and that is exactly right. I call it the \nKeystone ``extra lethal'' pipeline given the type of pollutants that \ncome with this oil.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent to propound a UC request on an \nissue that is completely different and ask that it not count against my \ntime. It is a 60-second UC. I believe Senator Vitter is here to oppose \nit, but I don't want it to count against any debate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n  Unanimous Consent Request--Committee On Environment and Public Works\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee \non Environment and Public Works be authorized to meet during the \nsession of the Senate on November 18, 2014, to conduct a business \nmeeting where we would have three votes for two TVA members and one \nNuclear Regulatory Commission member. All three nominees have had \nextensive hearings. In the case of Mr. Baran, he has had 88 written \nquestions and answers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Reserving the right to object. There are major concerns, \nparticularly about the NRC nominee. He has no technical or scientific \nbackground. He visited his first nuclear plant this summer.\n  Given that, and given that there is no precedent anywhere that I can \nfind for a 4-year nomination to the NRC not to have a nomination \nhearing before the committee, all we are asking for is a normal, \nroutine nomination hearing.\n  Given all of that, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask that we continue the agreement that \nthis not count on Keystone time.\n  I need to make the point that Mr. Baran, who is the subject of Mr. \nVitter's complaint, has already been confirmed. What we are doing is \nputting him in a different seat on the same commission that has a \ndifferent expiration date. He has already had a hearing, and Senator \nVitter asked 56 questions.\n\n[[Page S6061]]\n\n  I think it is sad--the Republicans have won the election. Yes, they \ndid. And they said: Oh, we are going to get busy and we are going to \nwork.\n  All I want to do is have a meeting so we can do our work off the \nfloor on people who have had extensive hearings. Now they say: Oh, no, \nwe can't possibly do that. And then my friend talks about the nominee's \nlack of experience when, in fact, he was already confirmed. When \nRepublican Commissioner Spinickey was nominated, she had never even \nvisited a powerplant. Nobody ever said anything about that, and we all \nlet it go.\n  Sadness is in my heart. Really. This is our work. We are here to \nwork. I thought that is what the Republicans said they wanted to do--\nthey wanted to work. Oh, no. They come here and object to a meeting off \nthe floor of the Senate so that we can move forward.\n  I wish to make a point: The TVA, Tennessee Valley Authority, is a \nvery important authority. They deliver electricity, and they do it in a \ngood way, they do it in a cheap way, and they do it in an \nenvironmentally sound way. That is their job. They need commissioners.\n  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission--my God, after Fukushima, you would \nthink people would want to work together. We have a great nominee who \nworked over in the House for years. He has already been confirmed.\n  Let it be known to the world, as I stand here today, after an \nelection where I admit we lost and they won, and they said they were \ngoing to be good soldiers and cooperate, but we can't mark up the first \nthing that happens.\n  So now I will have to use another technique that I have in my rules, \nand I will, but I don't want to do it. I wanted to have a bipartisan \nmeeting, but if they force me to just do it with the majority, which we \nnow have, so be it. But I will not allow these vacancies to continue.\n  In the case of the NRC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, it is \nactually dangerous. I have nuclear powerplants sitting on earthquake \nfaults and in tsunami zones. I want to have an NRC that is functional.\n  In any case, I will calm down and get back my Keystone Pipeline \nvoice, and I say to my friends who are not here: They blocked this now, \nbut unfortunately we will have to use the rules to get this done \nbecause that is our job. We have to fill these slots.\n\n  I thank my colleagues very much.\n  Senator Walsh is here and wishes to speak under the time of Senator \nHoeven, and I will get out of the way and allow him to proceed.\n  How much time remains on the opponents' side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 29 minutes remaining in opposition.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How many remain on the proponents' side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They control 62 minutes. The Senator from \nLouisiana still has 32 minutes, so they have a total of 94 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. WALSH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Keystone XL \nPipeline, a critical infrastructure project that has been delayed by \npolitical games for far too long. Just recently the American people \nhave said they are tired of political games. They want action in \nWashington, DC.\n  The Keystone Pipeline will provide good-paying construction jobs to \nAmericans--including hard-working Montanans--at no cost to the American \ntaxpayer. As the Bakken region continues to boom, this pipeline will \nprovide an important onramp for Montana oil which will boost local \neconomies.\n  This year the Bakken formation produced its billionth barrel of crude \noil. That means hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in \nlocal economies to support good-paying jobs in the United States \ninstead of being sent abroad. It also means 1 billion barrels of oil \ndid not come from places such as Iran and Russia.\n  A few weeks ago, I got to see firsthand the remarkable development \nthat is happening in eastern Montana and the work that is being done to \nhelp secure our energy independence. I have seen firsthand the costs of \ndependence on oil from hostile places.\n  During the Iraq war, I commanded the largest deployment of Montanans \nto war since World War II. In World War II, our strategic interest in \nthe Middle East has been oil. Our dependence on foreign oil should \nnever again be a reason for war.\n  By carrying Canadian and American oil to American refineries, the \nKeystone XL Pipeline will play a vital role in making us more energy \nsecure and prosperous while insulating our economy from price shocks \ncaused by foreign conflicts.\n  The continued delay in approving and building the pipeline is also \ncosting Montana and other States along the route millions in lost tax \ndollars each year. I say again, millions of lost tax dollars each year \nto those States where that pipeline is going to come through. As \nresponsible domestic energy production continues to boom, we must also \naddress the serious infrastructure limitations to safely transporting \nAmerican oil to the marketplace.\n  In March, I commissioned a report from the Government Accountability \nOffice to study recent rail traffic trends, especially those patterns \nassociated with the oil boom in the Bakken. The report identified \nseveral safety concerns as a result of rail traffic. The increase in \nrail congestion has also impacted Montana's farmers who rely on rail to \nbring their crops to the market.\n  These challenges are not going to go away. In fact, the Department of \nTransportation expects freight traffic to rise by 51 percent between \n2007 and 2040, in part due to limited oil pipeline capacity. Any \nfurther delays in approving this project present serious threats to the \nhealth and safety of our people, as well as our economy.\n  By building this pipeline with proper precautions taken to guarantee \npipeline safety and reliability, we can provide energy producers with \nthe infrastructure they need to deliver their products to consumers in \na safe and efficient manner.\n  I wish to make clear that building this pipeline does not distract \nfrom our responsibility to address climate change across our economy. \nComing from a State such as Montana, where we cherish our clean air, \nour clean water, and our beautiful public lands, it is very important \nto maintain our environment. But we won't solve global problems by \nstopping individual projects. We need more comprehensive solutions that \ntransition us toward a cleaner economy.\n  The excessive delays in approving this project is another example of \nhow Washington is broken. The State Department has finished the \nenvironmental impact study required before approving the Keystone XL \nPipeline. This project enjoys strong bipartisan support here in \nCongress, and the American people have spoken that they want bipartisan \nsupport and they want action from the representatives they send to \nWashington, DC. This is our opportunity to act on behalf of the \nAmerican people.\n  It is time to build this pipeline, and build it right, with the best \npossible materials, while preserving protections for landowners and \nimplementing effective energy response plans. We can do it, and we can \ndo it safely. Today we have an opportunity to show the American people \nthat Congress is still capable of meaningful action to promote a strong \nand stable economy while reducing our reliance on countries who wish to \ndo harm to us.\n  Today, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote yes on this vital \nproject.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       China's Energy Challenges\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nChina's inability to keep its promise with the United States. We had \nsomeone go over\n\n[[Page S6062]]\n\nthere. Of course, the President went over and talked to President Xi, \nand they gave assurances that certain things were going to happen. I \nhave always said for quite some time--I have had occasion to visit with \nthe Chinese, and a lot of them were hoping the United States would \nrestrict development here at home so that the only place our \nmanufacturers could go would be places such as China, India, Mexico, \nand so on.\n  One of the statements made by the President of China was that they \nwould stop increasing their emissions by 2030. But it is impossible to \naccomplish this goal because of its current domestic energy mix and \nheavy reliance on coal for affordable electricity for its economy.\n  Now, even if that statement were accurate--that they will eventually \nstop increasing emissions--what they are also saying is that they are \ngoing to continue increasing their emissions from where they are today \nuntil 2030. That is a long ways from now.\n  Nonetheless, I made a speech last week in which I said that China has \nno known reserves of natural gas. I was wrong. I was wrong due to some \nof the misinformation we got. The fact that they are not able to \nrealize these reserves is very significant. That shouldn't distract \nfrom the fact that China has a difficult road ahead in developing \naffordable sources of fuel to meet its energy demands.\n  According to a Forbes article dated August 19, 2014, ``China is not \nthe United States and faces technological, geological, technical and \ntopological hurdles in developing its shale gas resources.''\n  That is a quote from Forbes magazine.\n  China announced in August that it had to lower its natural gas \nproduction forecasts significantly. In 2012 the Chinese projected they \nwould produce 60 billion to 100 billion cubic meters of natural gas \nfrom shale by 2020. In August of this year they cut that forecast to \nonly 30 billion cubic meters, and an additional 30 billion cubic meters \nof production is expected to come from coal field sources. Now, all \ntold, this would meet 1 percent of China's total electricity generation \nneeds by 2020. That is 1 percent. That is all we are talking about \nhere, if all of these assumptions are right, and this is by their own \nadmission.\n  As the New York Times reported on August 21 of this year, China's \nability to extract sufficient natural gas is in serious doubt and its \nnatural gas production is ``growing at a slower pace than its \ndecelerating economy.''\n  China's problem is that its shale deposits are much different than \nours. The formations are deeper and they are more laden with clay, \nmaking it more difficult to extract the natural gas and more expensive \nto get it out through the hydraulic fracturing process.\n  I am very familiar with this. Hydraulic fracturing actually started \nin my home State of Oklahoma in 1948. So we are familiar with this.\n  Chinese companies have had a difficult time bringing online the \nnatural gas they have found. One company, Far East Energy, recently \nshut a quarter of its wells for a number of technical and \ntransportation problems, including a lack of gas-gathering pipelines. \nThis underscores that China simply doesn't have the deep technological \nknow-how that we do in this country, which made the shale revolution \npossible that we have all enjoyed so much in the last 5 years. It was \nbuilt on the back of 100 years of successful oil and gas development \nand technological advances in this country, which obviously they \nhaven't had.\n\n  China will continue to rely heavily on coal for its electricity \ngeneration, and we see this happening today. China continues to build \nthe equivalent of one new coal-fired powerplant every 10 days.\n  Just think about that. In the last 7 years--in a speech I made on the \nfloor, we had analyzed and calculated the number of coal-fired plants \nthey have, and they are going to continue that into the future. Another \noption for producing electricity with lower CO2 emissions is \nnuclear. However, the country's nuclear plants have stalled following \nthe Fukushima disaster in Japan. Renewables are also an option, but we \nall know these alone can't affordably power the world's largest \neconomy.\n  I doubt China will stick to any agreement to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions if it puts at risk the country's economy.\n  Meanwhile, the United States has agreed, by the President's \nstatement, to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions from 26 to 28 percent \nby 2025, so that the President can solidify a legacy on climate change \nthat will be at the cost of the American people. We are handcuffing our \neconomic future to the President's policies, which fail by their own \nmeasure. Acting unilaterally, the President's greenhouse gas \nregulations would reduce global temperatures by only 0.018 degrees \nCelsius by 2100. That is 86 years from now. We have been doing this for \nquite some time--ever since they started the United Nations meetings to \nget together all of these countries that make all kinds of promises and \nprojections. China has always been there with tongue-in-cheek, just \nwondering if we were really going to do that in this country. We should \nstop and think about what China is doing right now in its development, \nin its growth, and the fact that they are just cranking out these coal-\nfired plants at a rate that is hard for us to understand. Nonetheless, \nthey are doing it and will continue to do it, by their own admission, \nuntil 2030.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the bill mandating \napproval of the Keystone Pipeline. I oppose the project because I \nbelieve accelerating the development of tar sands oil is contrary to \nour national interests, economic interests, national security \ninterests, and environmental interests.\n  I believe there is no way to fully analyze this question without \ngrappling with another question: Is carbon pollution from human \nactivity affecting the world's climate in a negative way? Because if \ncarbon pollution doesn't affect climate, then tar sands or this \npipeline would not be a significant issue for me. But if we accept the \ngeneral scientific consensus--and Virginians do--that carbon pollution \ndoes cause negative changes in climate, stopping or even slowing \ndevelopment of the tar sands is good for the United States and the \nworld.\n  Some of the people who encourage me to support this project duck when \nI ask them this question: Do you think manmade carbon pollution affects \nour climate? One Virginia CEO, whose company is filled with scientific \ntalent, basically told me, ``I don't know, I am not a scientist.'' And \na representative of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce testified similarly \nbefore the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this year. But \nthose of us who take an oath to serve here have a responsibility to \nconsider the scientific evidence.\n  In Virginia, the second largest region is Hampton Roads, comprised of \n1.6 million people in numerous cities and counties along the Chesapeake \nBay and Atlantic Coast. Hampton Roads is a thriving economy as well as \nthe home of the largest concentration of naval power in the world. It \nis also, next to New Orleans, the region most directly affected by \nrising sea levels, and all agree that rising sea levels are caused in \npart by carbon pollution. Climate changes are not a tomorrow issue in \nVirginia, they are a today issue.\n  Throughout Hampton Roads, rising sea levels are causing significant \nchallenges, flooding roads, homes--with neighborhoods damaged and some \neven unmarketable--and causing economic harm to families and \nbusinesses. At current projections, the main access road into the U.S. \nNavy's principal base in Hampton Roads will be flooded and impassable 3 \nhours a day by 2040. With an economy so dependent upon the naval \npresence, anything that threatens this military investment is \npotentially devastating.\n  I sponsored a symposium on sea level rise in Hampton Roads this \nsummer attended by hundreds, with bipartisan representation from local, \nState, and Federal officials and Members of Congress. The concern is \nreal and virtually all estimates of sea level rise in this\n\n[[Page S6063]]\n\ncommunity pose staggering challenges to every aspect of life here for \nyears to come.\n  It is not just Hampton Roads. Virginia's largest industry is still \nagriculture and forestry--very affected by climate. Tourism is a major \nindustry which is very affected by climate. Aquaculture is an important \nindustry and climate affects it. So to those who want to duck the \nquestion of climate change or challenge the scientific evidence, I say \nto them, come to Virginia with me and talk to people whose lives are \nbeing seriously affected today by climate changes caused in part by \nescalating climate pollution.\n  So what is the answer to this problem and how does it relate to the \nKeystone Pipeline?\n  We have to continue to move toward a cleaner energy economy. We can't \nthrow the brake on the use of fossil fuels. That would be unrealistic \nand hurt our economy.\n  As Governor of Virginia, I supported building a state-of-the-art coal \nplant in exchange for converting a plant that predated the Clean Air \nAct from coal to natural gas.\n  I support development of offshore energy. We can use a phased \napproach to produce energy cleaner tomorrow than today, reducing \npollution caused by our energy sources through innovation and creating \njobs. Guess what. As you know, that is exactly what we are doing.\n  Wind power involves no carbon pollution, and it is the fastest \ngrowing energy source in America. Cleaner tomorrow than today.\n  Utility scale solar electricity output increased 23-fold in the last \ndecade. Cleaner tomorrow than today.\n  The revolution of natural gas production in the United States has \nturned our country into the world's leading energy producer and helped \nus reduce carbon pollution. Cleaner tomorrow than today.\n  Innovation driven by smart regulation in the American auto industry \nmeans we are producing cars that go much farther on gas than ever \nbefore. These developments help reduce demand for oil, thus dropping \nprices to consumers. Cleaner tomorrow than today.\n  Virginia ratepayers supported nuclear investments over the years that \nhave enabled us to generate 40 percent of our power through noncarbon \ntechnology. Cleaner tomorrow than today.\n  And just as new technologies helped us make coal plants cleaner in \nthe 1980s to battle acid rain, there are ways to make our existing and \nfuture coal plants emit less carbon pollution. Cleaner tomorrow than \ntoday.\n  With the United States taking significant leadership steps, it is \nmore likely that other nations will do so as well. I believe our \ninnovative path is one of the reasons why China was willing to announce \nrecently they will take similar steps. Cleaner tomorrow than today.\n  The United States is now becoming a global leader in reducing carbon \npollution, and we are there because of smart regulations and, \nespecially, American innovation. We always have to make sure \nregulations strike the right balance. But by becoming cleaner tomorrow \nthan today, we are creating jobs, protecting the environment, reducing \nour trade deficit, and ending our overdependence on energy from foreign \nnations. As members of the Armed Services Committee, the Members here \non the floor, this reduced energy dependence is great for American \nnational security.\n  This is why I oppose the Keystone project. Tar sands oil is dirty \nenergy, producing significantly more carbon pollution than petroleum. \nAfter all we have done to be cleaner tomorrow than today, why would we \nembrace the technology that is a huge backslide that produces more, not \nless, carbon pollution than conventional sources? Embracing a dirtier \nenergy technology moves us in precisely the wrong direction.\n  Keystone as a single project is neither the environmental game over \nsome would suggest nor the energy panacea others would promise. But \nwhether we embrace the tar sands oil development does send a message \nabout how we intend to meet American and global energy needs. We can \neither send the message of cleaner tomorrow than today or send a \nmessage anything goes. Because U.S. innovation is helping us lead the \nworld to a ``cleaner tomorrow than today'' energy future, we should not \nturn back now.\n  There are those who say that the tar sands fields of Alberta will be \ndeveloped anyway so why doesn't the United States just go along? The \nowners of the resource may well develop it and find alternate routes to \nship it through Canada. They can make their decision on their own, \nalthough falling oil prices may make the relative cost noncompetitive. \nEven if the owners of those fields decide to move forward in this \ndevelopment, the official policy of the United States should not, in my \nview, be to embrace, promote, and accelerate tar sands oil. Our \nofficial policy should be ``cleaner tomorrow than today'' and not \n``anything goes.''\n  For these reasons, I oppose the bill to force approval of the \nKeystone Pipeline project and make accelerated tar sands oil \ndevelopment the official policy of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, this is what the American people have \nbeen waiting to see. They want Washington to work together to grow our \nNation's economy. Sometimes that takes debating what some consider a \ntough vote.\n  I personally don't see the authorization before us as a difficult \nvote, by any stretch of the imagination. To me, this is a no-brainer. \nHere is why. Keystone is a job creator. This project will bolster the \nAmerican economy and Arkansas's once we move forward.\n  In my home State of Arkansas, Nucor Steel in Blytheville and Welspun \nTubular in Little Rock are two companies that should be employing \npeople to work on the pipeline for the project right now. These are two \ncommunities in my home State that would have already benefited from the \nproject if the President had not been stalling the approval of the \nKeystone Pipeline.\n  In fact, Welspun had been producing pipe for the Keystone XL project. \nHundreds of miles of pipe, produced for the project, are just sitting \nat their facility. Unfortunately, due to the administration's delay the \ncompany was forced to lay off employees.\n  The Keystone Pipeline proposal has been studied to death. Every box \nhas been checked. Our friends to the north are moving ahead with or \nwithout us. Canada will develop their oil resources whether or not we \napprove the pipeline. Where the refining is done depends on the \nPresident's decision on Keystone. Right now, Canada is currently using \nother methods of transportation such as railroads to ship their oil.\n  Without Keystone, they most likely will build their own pipelines to \nship their crude oil to Asian markets and refineries in China. They \nhave lax environmental standards.\n  Instead of working with us to avoid that scenario, the President has \nunnecessarily prolonged the process, giving Canadian officials more \nreason to seek opportunities in China.\n  The Senate majority provided cover for the President's delay tactics \nfor 6 years, simultaneously putting the brakes on thousands of \nemployment opportunities for Americans.\n  During that time the project has received approval in every study the \nState Department has conducted. The review process has been exhaustive.\n  There is no reason for additional delays. The pipeline is ready to go \nand my colleagues have tried to move it forward. But until now, the \nSenate majority prevented us from having an up-or-down vote on \nauthorization. Meanwhile, the House voted nine times to approve the \nKeystone Pipeline. The most recent of these votes came last week.\n  Now we finally have a chance to send something to the White House \nthat forces the President to make a choice once and for all.\n  Without congressional activity, the President sees no reason to make \na decision. The American people delivered a reason on election day. \nThey want to see Washington work. We can start by passing the Keystone \nPipeline. The President claims he heard that message. Let's pass this \nauthorization and give him a chance to approve that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. I rise today----\n\n[[Page S6064]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Could I ask the Senator to yield? I want to ask whose \ntime is the Senator taking at this point?\n  Mr. DONNELLY. I believe this would be Senator Landrieu's time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is fine. Thank you.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. I rise today in support of the Keystone XL Pipeline. \nThe strong energy economy is critical in both my home State of \nIndiana's economy and our country's economic success. It is critical to \nour national security.\n  I support this project because it would promote economic \ncompetitiveness and energy security for both Indiana and the United \nStates. The Keystone XL Pipeline is about creating jobs, investing in \ninfrastructure and going all in on American energy.\n  Put simply, it is about opportunity. It is an opportunity to \nstrengthen our economy, to strengthen our national security, and to \nbecome more energy independent. Energy security and national security. \nIt means all in. Don't be for Keystone and then be against solar and \nwind. All of those are part of the equation of making our nation \nstronger. From solar and natural gas, from nuclear to clean coal, from \nbiofuels such as ethanol made of Indiana corn and biodiesel made of \nIndiana soybeans, all renewable, to wind and oil, we should pursue \nevery resource possible to increase our energy independence while also \nrespecting our environment and using the most advanced technologies \npossible.\n  Developing energy sources makes sense for American business. It makes \nsense for American families. It makes sense for America's national \nsecurity.\n  We should take every smart opportunity to stop sending billions of \nAmerican dollars overseas and begin to continue to develop homegrown \nenergy sources that help provide affordable energy in the future and \nput more Americans to work today.\n\n  This is about investing in pipefitters and ironworkers and plumbers \nand steelworkers and electricians and all kinds of building trade folks \nand many other people who then have a chance to make their American \ndream come true. This is about investing in our energy infrastructure \nand cutting redtape so stalled projects can move forward.\n  Earlier this year, in April, I joined 10 of my Senate colleagues in \nsending a letter to the President asking him to make a final decision \non Keystone. Facing an indefinite extension of the review, I joined \nmany colleagues in cosponsoring legislation to approve it. We are still \nat this point stalled. We are still waiting to move forward.\n  I am glad we have the chance to vote on this commonsense legislation \nthat authorizes the pipeline. This product is already being shipped by \nother means today. I stand here to support the Keystone Pipeline \nbecause it creates jobs, has support in both parties, makes America \nenergy independent, and helps increase our national security.\n  This is the kind of investment we can and should make in energy that \nDemocrats and Republicans can support, going all in on energy, and that \nmeans wind and that means solar and that means ethanol and that means \nbiodiesel and so many other things. It makes our country stronger and \nit creates more jobs right here. It is good for America. It is good, as \nhas been said, for our national security.\n  That is why I urge my colleagues on both sides to vote yes.\n  I want to thank my colleagues Senator Landrieu and Senator Hoeven for \nbringing this bipartisan bill forward.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I rise today again to respond to some of \nthe concerns that have been expressed on this floor regarding the \nKeystone XL Pipeline, to urge my colleagues to move this important, \nshovel-ready project forward. I had a chance earlier this afternoon--I \nguess it was this morning--to listen to a fair amount of the debate as \nI presided. A lot of what we are hearing over and over again is the \nsame messages, in some ways confused messages, because I do not know if \nwe are talking about stopping the oil sands in Canada or if we are \ntalking about approving a pipeline; I do not know if we are talking \nabout doing the State's work in siting a pipeline within their State, \nor if we are talking about making a determination as directed by \nlegislation from this body to the President to make a determination on \nwhether approval, which is to take that pipeline across the border of \nthis country, is in the national interest.\n  I think we have confused a lot of the dialog here. I just want to \ntake a moment to start from Ground Zero. That is that we have a \nrequirement that when a pipeline--a legislative requirement--that when \na pipeline is going to come across a border, the State Department has \nan obligation to determine whether that is going to be permitted. The \ndetermination is whether it is in the national interest. I do not think \nanyone anticipated that a pipeline would take 6 years--6 years of \ndialogue, 6 years of study, millions and millions of dollars and \nactually billions of dollars of stranded investment--waiting for \napproval of this pipeline.\n  So anyone who says, let's wait for the process to work is not facing \nthe reality that the process is broken. This process has not worked. \nThis process has not brought this project to some kind of finality, yes \nor no. Yes or no. People say: Well, we need to wait for the Nebraska \nSupreme Court. Nothing is going to go through Nebraska until the people \nof Nebraska, through their representatives, actually approve a route.\n  That is an issue, in my opinion, that belongs to the people of \nNebraska and to their elected representatives and to their people. When \nthey say: Look, the EIS may have said that, but it is not reality. When \nthe EIS, commissioned by the State Department, says there will not be a \ncarbon impact as a result of this pipeline, but we are not going to \neven talk about that because we do not agree with that fact. We do not \nagree with that fact in the EIS, that this is not about stopping the \noil sands in Canada, the oil sand development. This is about a pipeline \nand whether it is in the national interest to bring that pipeline \nsouth.\n  Now I want to tell you why I think it is in the national interest. I \nthink it is in the national interest because when I talk about energy \nindependence for our country, when I talk about energy independence for \nour country and looking at how we can deploy our resources for the good \nof the world, I am talking about North American energy independence, \nwhether it is collaborating with our great friends to the north, \nCanada, or whether it is, in fact, building relationships and building \ninfrastructure with our neighbors to the south, Mexico, that has a--\nMexico is holding a huge amount of oil and gas reserves.\n  I also find it kind of curious, because there has been a lot of \ndiscussion about gasoline prices and how--you know, see, we do not need \nKeystone XL development or production because look at what is happening \nwith gas prices, and they are going down. This is classic supply-and-\ndemand economics. You know why gasoline prices are going down? Because \nwe are producing more oil in North America, because we are adding to \nthe supply. The supply obviously is meeting world demand, meeting the \nconditions. We have a discussion in OPEC, I will acknowledge that. But \nfundamentally it is economics at work. When you have a greater supply \nand you have reduced demand, the price goes down. That is why we are \nseeing lower gasoline prices.\n\n  So when so many people say we will not benefit from the Keystone XL \nPipeline, and they talk about deployment of that pipeline, and they \ntalk about what it means to have this system be deployed, I will tell \nyou that we can thank what is happening in Canada in energy production \nfor gasoline prices that now are, for the first time in a long time, \nbelow $3 in many parts of our country--below $3--because we are \nproducing more domestic and North American crude oil.\n  So I think we need to be honest about what we are talking about here. \nI frequently say the pipeline has taken a role in American politics \nthat is way disproportional to what it is. It is a pipeline. There are \nover 2 million miles of pipeline in America today. This is going to be \njust another one of those.\n\n[[Page S6065]]\n\nIt is going to be state of the art. Can I predict a perfect world? Can \nI predict that there will never be any kind of consequence? No, I \ncannot, anymore than I can predict what is going to happen tomorrow \nwith any kind of natural resource or any kind of transportation \ninfrastructure. But I can tell you that I have seen the extra \nprecautions.\n  I want to report on some of those things that TransCanada has done, \nthe pipeline company that would build Keystone XL, to respond to the \nconcerns. They have agreed to 57 special safety conditions that go \nabove and beyond what is required in Federal regulation, including the \ninstallation of automatic shutoff valves not only every 20 miles but in \nspecific spots that cross waterways. There are over 2.3 million miles \nof pipe in the ground, and around 160,000 of those miles are being used \nfor crude oil transport. Think about that. Think about the need for \nthis infrastructure. There was a lot of discussion today about how this \noil will fly out of the country magically. I will tell you the reason \nwhy, contrary to what you have been told today, that this pipeline is \ndestined to go south into the United States--you have been hearing that \nthe pipeline did not go east and west because Canada did not want it.\n  That pipeline went to the south because that is where heavy crudes \nare refined. A lot of the heavy crudes that are refined in Texas and in \nthe South--the Gulf States--is crude that is imported from Venezuela. \nIt is imported from Venezuela. Who would you rather buy your crude oil \nfrom, from Venezuela, or would you rather buy it from our friends to \nthe north in Canada?\n  We have so politicized, for lack of a better word, something that \nshould be a clear economic position. We have made this an important \ncause on both sides. I will call out both sides. This is a pipeline. It \nis a pipeline that will transport an important commodity that will be \nused in our refineries in our country to produce gasoline and diesel \nfuel that drives the engine of our economy, certainly our \ntransportation economy.\n  We are buying it from our friends to the North, Canada. Canadian \nofficials have years of responsible investment, responsible development \nof their infrastructure. They are people we should want to do business \nwith. Instead of simply making the decision based on, yes, \nenvironmental considerations, that, yes, we cannot ignore that the EIS \nsays there are not any environmental impediments to this pipeline. \nPeople say: Well, what about if it changes in Nebraska? Do you honestly \nbelieve if there is a change in Nebraska, there is going to be a change \nthat will put more of the Nebraska environment in harm's way? Do you \nhonestly believe that is the outcome of the Nebraska Supreme Court \ndecision? No.\n  So when we look at this, we need to begin to focus on what this is. \nIt is a pipeline. It is a critical piece of energy infrastructure. It \nis something that has languished too long because of a failed process. \nSix years. Six years. There are young people here, the pages. What if I \ntold you that you could not get your driver's license for 6 years? What \nif I told a business: We are not going to permit you for 6 years? What \nif we told anyone down the road who needed some kind of license or \napproval from the Federal Government, 6 years? That is what it is going \nto take--6 years. There is no one who thinks that is appropriate.\n  So if this process today, which was started by my great friend, Mary \nLandrieu from Louisiana, spurs a further discussion that resolves this \nissue one way or the other--one way or the other--we have accomplished \na great deal today. We have accomplished a great deal by having this \nimportant discussion, on which obviously there are heartfelt opinions \non both sides.\n  In fact, my colleague from California has described it as a vote of \nconscience. I will tell you from my perspective it is a vote for common \nsense. It is a vote for common sense in moving this piece of \ninfrastructure forward and making sure we are doing everything that we \ncan to provide affordable energy that drives this economy.\n\n  That is the new dynamic, the new energy renaissance. I believe we \nwill approve this pipeline. I am hoping it is today. But we will \napprove this pipeline. At the end of the day, all we have done has \nresulted in incredible frustration and incredible delay that has cost \nmoney for not only the pipeline but for the taxpayers of this country. \nIt is time to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining as a \nproponent who was originally given 1 hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would like to take 1 minute now and then we are going \nto ask for some additional time.\n  I want to thank the Senator from North Dakota for her really clear \nand direct explanation of this and her practical approach to what we do \nhere. It is so refreshing. It is so wonderful to hear her knowledge and \nthe depth of her knowledge about this.\n  I put this up again just to remind the American people that what she \nsaid is absolutely true. We already have 2.6 million miles of pipe \nmoving oil and gas from where it is produced to where it is needed. \nThis pipeline, which I have outlined in blue here, is just one of many \npipelines that is going to be in our country. Our country needs this \nenergy. We need oil. We need gas. We need clean coal. Yes, even when we \nbuild huge solar operations out West, where we have a lot of sun--we do \nnot have sun down South--or we build windmills off of Massachusetts' \nborder, you still have to move that power to the places that need it.\n  This infrastructure is absolutely essential to the economic power of \nthe United States of America. If the middle class is telling us \nanything, they want more economic power in America.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is also right. When I speak about \nenergy independence, I like to talk about Canada and Mexico as well, \nNorth American independence. We might be able to do it in just the 50 \nStates and territories of the United States, but I am confident we can \ndo it with Canada and Mexico.\n  The added benefits are these: We do not have to be dictated to by \nRussia and China. Hooray. We can also create jobs not just in the \nUnited States but in Mexico. Hooray. You know, people who can work in \nMexico and have good jobs in Mexico might stay in Mexico--hooray for \nthat--instead of desperately looking for work in the United States. It \ncan help to solve some of our immigration problems. What is wrong with \nthis? We can create technology transfers from the United States to \nMexico. So this is a win-win.\n  I am sorry people have taken this Keystone Pipeline to be the \nbeginning and end. It is just another pipeline. But it is a symbol of \ncommon sense. It is a symbol of infrastructure necessary for us to be \nenergy independent. I do not want to hear one Senator coming down here \nto the floor to say: We are going to be energy independent without \ninfrastructure. All they say is ``wind'' or ``gas'' or ``oil'' or \n``coal'' or ``solar.'' Those are all the words people use. Lovely \nwords. But unless you are talking about pipes, transmission lines, \nrights of way, highways, roads into rural areas, you are not talking \nabout energy, you are just talking nonsense, absolute nonsense.\n  This is an infrastructure bill, an important pipeline. It should have \nbeen built and given permission years ago. As I have said, people say: \nWell, Mary why are you circumventing the process? How long could the \nprocess possibly be?\n  Six years is a long time. It should have taken 1 year or 2, and we \nhave the report that is finished. We are not circumventing the process \ntrying to shortchange it as some people have claimed. This is a final \nreport. It was issued in January. I got this report in January. I got \nit, Senator Hoeven read it, and then we filed the bill in May. January, \nFebruary, March, April, May--we drafted the bill carefully, giving 6 \nmonths after the report was given, thinking surely that is enough time \nfor people to read this report. Someone could read it in one sitting, \nbut we gave them 6 months.\n  When it didn't happen, Senator Hoeven and I dropped our bill--not the \nHouse bill that had all sorts of bells, whistles, and a lot of \nmessaging that wasn't going anywhere. We dropped a bill--clean \nKeystone.\n  Now I would have liked to have tied it with something else. I tried \ntying it\n\n[[Page S6066]]\n\nwith energy efficiency, thinking that would maybe get us to a debate on \nthe floor. We could maybe tie it to the minimum wage and get some votes \non it. You could tie it to something else that might make sense but \nnever could get the other side to agree to a piece to tie it to.\n  I only have 2 minutes left, and I ask unanimous consent for another 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, could that be off my \nfriend's time?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I don't have any additional.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then we need to add 5 minutes to our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. We waited for 6 months after the final report was done. \nSo the final report has been done. It has been 6 years. It is clearly \nin America's interests. We have labor unions, business organizations--\nthe Association of Petroleum Institute, the American Chemical \nAssociation.\n  Let me talk just 1 minute about their letter. Cal Dooley signed this \nletter to me today and said on behalf of the American Chemistry \nCouncil--which is all over this country, in Delaware, Michigan, \nMinnesota, Illinois, New Jersey: This project could add 407,000 \npermanent new jobs by 2023.\n  He was not talking about the specific pipeline, but what Cal is \ntalking about in the Chemical Council is the symbol that America is \nready, willing, and able to be energy independent and all the blessings \nthat would bring to our country and to our economy. We don't have to \nrely on China and Russia, and we can clean it as we go. We can make it \ncleaner as we move.\n  So that is why I brought this debate to the floor today. I am excited \nfor this debate--whatever side you are on. I think it has been a breath \nof fresh air for the Senate to actually talk about something that \npeople can understand, and may we have the vote at the time allowed.\n  I thank my dear colleague from California for allowing that 5 minutes \nand, of course, for our side I am the only one on the floor. So we will \nbe happy to give those additional 5 minutes.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, how much time do the Republican \nproponents have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have 52 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. We only have 5 minutes remaining.\n  How much time do the Democratic opponents have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have 27 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Senator Hoeven is on the floor. Senator Boxer is also. \nI know our vote is at 6:30, and it is 4:30. Should we divide the time \nequally or how do we think this would work? If Senator Hoeven would say \nwhat he thinks, we could do one-third, one-third, and one-third or \nwhether the Senator from California perhaps wants to do half and half.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I would respond to the question of the Senator from \nLouisiana. My understanding is we were targeting to maybe have the vote \nat 5:30. I would be certainly pleased to work through that with the \nSenator and Senator Boxer, finishing up, maybe with me at 5:45 or \nwhatever we work out within that timing.\n  Mrs. BOXER. A question through the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think it would be very helpful if the three of us could \nget together for 1 minute to work out the details of how to close out, \nand then we could make a unanimous consent request so Senators would \nknow exactly what to do.\n  May I suggest that we go into a quorum call and that it come off of \nall three sides and have a couple of minutes to discuss this. Is that \nall right?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, that seems to be the right way to go. I \nhave no objection.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We rethought this situation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we take no time off of anybody's time at \nthis point and that we just meet and discuss how we are going to close \nthis debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 5 minutes to my friend from Washington State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \ntalk about the legislation we are considering regarding the proposed \nKeystone XL Pipeline.\n  As with too many controversial issues, we have lost track of the \nfacts and the basic process for moving a project such as this one \nforward. So let's be clear. The legislation we are voting on today \nisn't just a bill to say yes or no to the Keystone Pipeline. This is \nlegislation that would have us skip the established process for \ndetermining whether a major infrastructure project, with potential \nimpact to millions of Americans, our economy, and our environment, \nshould be approved. We are still in the middle of that process. But if \nthis bill passes, it would mean we are bypassing all the scientists and \nengineers and experts who are evaluating the proposal. It would put an \narbitrary, manufactured timeline on a project whose evaluation is \nincomplete and would short-circuit the process for the public to weigh \nin on this project.\n  Regardless of how different Members feel about this, we should all \nagree that this is no way the U.S. Government ought to approve a \nproject of this scope. So that is one reason I will be voting against \nthis legislation. When it comes to protecting our environment, we \nshould rely on facts, patience, and a fair process.\n  There is no denying that the proposed Keystone Pipeline project has \nbecome larger than the sum of its parts. I understand the desire of my \ncolleagues to expedite the projects they support, and I understand \ncutting through redtape to get things done. But when we are considering \na project that could have significant impacts on our economy and our \nenvironment, making a decision before we have all the facts could be \nreckless and it could be dangerous.\n  The Keystone Pipeline proposal is a great example of why our process \nfor evaluating the potential consequences of projects such as this one \nis not only important, it is absolutely necessary. We simply cannot put \nexpediency ahead of scientific facts regarding climate change because \nas a country we have done that for far too long and now we are paying \nthe price.\n  Earlier this year, as chair of the Budget Committee, I held a hearing \non the impact of climate change on our country. We heard testimony from \nbusiness leaders, from environmental experts, from industry leaders, \nand even from military officials. Their message was clear: The \nconsequences of climate change are not hypothetical and they are not \nexaggerated. The impacts of human activity on our planet are real, they \nare significant, and they are happening right now.\n  The Federal Government, for example, spent three times more on \ndisaster relief in the past decade than it did in the previous decade. \nIf we do nothing, continued climate change will result in more frequent \nand more intense episodes of extreme weather, just as we saw with \nHurricanes Katrina and Sandy.\n  The U.S. Department of Transportation today sends about $22 billion a \nyear to State and local governments just to help them keep their \nexisting transportation infrastructure in good repair. But hotter \ntemperatures and\n\n[[Page S6067]]\n\nmore frequent flooding will wash out roads and will put added stress on \nbridge supports and public transit systems and will require substantial \nadditional Federal investment.\n  We know an uptick in temperature and heat waves will reduce annual \nyields of major crops and cause more livestock deaths. It will hurt \nfarmers and agribusinesses, cause consumer food prices to rise, and \nreally create a ripple effect that will increase costs to U.S. \ntaxpayers.\n  Our military experts say that climate change will act as a catalyst \nfor instability and conflict around the world, creating additional \nthreats to our country and adding to the cost of protecting our \nNation's interests.\n  So, Mr. President, with all we already know about the impacts of \nclimate change, how can we possibly move this project forward before we \nhave a thorough understanding of the environmental impacts that will \nresult from building the Keystone Pipeline? How can we force the \ndecision that could very possibly make the impact of climate change \neven worse?\n  As a Senator from the State of Washington, I am very proud of my work \nto protect the environment, and I am proud of my State's leadership in \ncombating climate change. Even though the Keystone Pipeline will not \nrun through my State, Washingtonians know well that the pipeline's \nimpacts could quickly reach our communities, from Seattle to Spokane.\n  So I come to the floor today to oppose this legislation, and I will \ncontinue to oppose any efforts in Congress that ignore or brush aside \nthe environmental consequences of our actions. For far too long we have \nput short-term interests ahead of our environment and long-term \nrealities, and that has to stop.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the previous order with respect to debate time on S. \n2280, the time until 5:45 p.m. be equally divided between Senators \nHoeven, Landrieu, and myself, or our designees, and that at 5:45 p.m., \nSenator Hoeven be recognized for up to 2 minutes for closing remarks; \nthat upon the conclusion of his remarks, Senator Landrieu be recognized \nfor up to 2 minutes; that upon the conclusion of her remarks, Senator \nBoxer be recognized for up to 4 minutes; that upon the conclusion of \nSenator Boxer's remarks, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of S. \n2280, with all other provisions of the previous order with respect to \nthe bill remaining in order; and finally, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time used by Senator Murray count toward Senator Boxer's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I call on my \ncolleague from California as she gets herself ready to speak to this \nissue. Senator Feinstein and I represent a State that is creating so \nmany clean energy jobs, and I am very proud to yield to her 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, and I wish to \ncongratulate her on her leadership on this issue. We clearly have had a \nvery extensive debate in our caucus on this. There are varying views, \nand I have thought a lot about it. I have had 120,000 California \nconstituents write and call, of which about 93 percent are strongly \nopposed. I would say to the chairman of the committee that one of the \nthings that interested me from reading these constituent letters was \nreally how informed individuals were about this pipeline.\n  Let me lay out some of the environmental concerns. You have heard \nthis, but perhaps you haven't heard it in entirely this way. The \nKeystone Pipeline was proposed to accommodate increased extraction of \noil from the tar sands of Alberta. These tar sands cover an area of \n54,000 square miles. That is roughly the size of New York, so it is \nhuge.\n  I first came upon this by reading a March 2009 issue of National \nGeographic, and in that they showed part of the desecration to the \nland--forests down, tar sands. It looked like a Moon face. A huge \nportion of these deposits can only be accessed through open-pit surface \nmining, which destroys natural forests and bogs. Then the oil sands are \nmixed with heated water, chemicals are added, and it is driven up with \nsteam in order to separate it from the sand. These methods are costly, \nthey are energy-intensive, they are carbon-intensive, and they leave \nbehind a significant amount of toxic waste. And that is just the \nextraction process.\n  Transportation of the oil poses additional risks to the environment--\nnamely, the risk of pipeline spills. The first Keystone Pipeline, which \nis already operating in our country, had to be shut down several times \nfor safety concerns. It leaked 14 times during its first year of \noperation. Across the border in Canada, the same pipeline spilled 21 \ntimes in its first year of operation. These pipeline spills are \ndangerous and difficult to clean up. The danger from spills is even \ngreater since the new leg of the pipeline would run over Nebraska's \nOgallala Aquifer, which is a critical source of drinking water for \nmillions and an irrigation source for farmers.\n  Beyond degrading our environment, this project also runs against our \nefforts--as has been said many times on this floor--to combat climate \nchange. According to the National Energy Technology Laboratory, by the \ntime oil from Keystone makes it to a car in the form of gasoline, it \nhas already produced 80 percent--80 percent--more greenhouse gas \nemissions than typical crude oil.\n  Here is how the math works out. Producing, refining, and combusting \noil from Keystone will release up to 27 million metric tons more carbon \ndioxide every year than would be produced from burning the same volume \nof crude oil. Those additional emissions are equivalent to the \nemissions of 5.7 million cars on the road or 8 coal-fired powerplants. \nI think that is pretty impressive as to the totally negative impact of \nthis. So this would be a poor way to begin meeting the President's \npledge in Beijing to dramatically reduce our emissions, if the first \ntime we do something it creates 27 million metric tons more carbon \ndioxide every year and is equivalent to the emissions of 5.7 million \ncars.\n  On the economics of the pipeline, there is simply not enough benefit \nto outweigh the environmental damage. The project is not going to lower \ngasoline prices for American drivers. The oil is intended to be sold on \nthe global market, not for the benefit of American motorists. The \nState Department has concluded that the pipeline would have little \nimpact on the prices U.S. consumers pay.\n\n  So I believe this project has terrible environmental hazards and \nrisks, it is not necessary, and it certainly is not helpful to our \nenvironment.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum call be taken off \neverybody's time here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I would like to take 5 minutes to respond \nto some of the comments the Senator from California made in regard to \nthe environmental impacts.\n  First, if we look at the environmental impact statements--actually, \nthere were five environmental impact statements done. And what they \nfound and said very clearly is that the Keystone XL Pipeline will have \nno significant environmental impact. Let me repeat that--no significant \nenvironmental impact. That is from the environmental study done by the \nObama administration.\n\n  Again, that is not me saying it. That is the State Department for the \nObama administration saying no significant environmental impact, \naccording to the environmental impact statement.\n  In addition, I would point out that if we don't build the Keystone XL \nPipeline, this 830,000 barrels of oil a day moves by railroad. Now \nthink of that.\n\n[[Page S6068]]\n\nWhat is going to produce more greenhouse gas emissions? Moving all this \noil by rail--which by the way takes 1,400 railcars a day--or moving it \nin tankers across the ocean to China where it will be refined in \nrefineries that have much higher emissions or you putting it in the \npipeline? So again, just common sense, what is going to produce more \ngreenhouse gas emissions, having the pipeline or 1,400 railcars per day \nor sending it in tankers to China to be refined in their refineries \nthat have much higher emissions? Not to mention the fact that what are \nAmericans going to think about that we are going to make Canada send \ntheir oil to China so we in America can import oil from the Middle \nEast. That is a pretty tough sell. Again, with the pipeline you have \nlower greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the heavy crude we import \nfrom Venezuela now has higher emissions than the oil that will be \nprovided by the Keystone. I am not even including the fact that it is \nnot just Canadian crude that comes in. It is also light sweet Bakken \ncrude from my home State of North Dakota and our neighbor to the west, \nMontana. We are not just moving Canadian. We our moving our own crude, \nand if we don't, we are going to continue to get that oil from \nVenezuela, which has as high or higher greenhouse gas emissions. As a \nmatter of fact, the heavy crude in California, the good Senator's own \nState, has greenhouse gas emissions that are equal to or higher than \nthe crude that would come through the pipeline. That is produced in \nCalifornia.\n  The final point I would like to make on the environmental aspects is \nthat 80 percent of the new production in Canada--in the Canadian oil \nsands--80 percent of the new production is being done by what they call \nin situ drilling. So instead of excavating, which is what is being done \nnow with much of the production at the oil sands, they are drilling. \nThey would drill down similarly to the way they would drill for oil \nwith conventional drilling and then put steam down in the hole and have \nthat bring up the oil. So the carbon footprint is reduced using this in \nsitu method, and 80 percent of the production in Canada will be with \nthis in situ method. That will reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and \nthe footprint, similar to conventional drilling in the United States.\n  When you look at the environmental track record in Canada, the \nCanadians care about their environment too. We all want to find ways to \nproduce energy and do it with good environmental stewardship. I submit \nto you that the way to do that is to empower and enable the deployment \nof new technologies that not only produce that energy more cost-\neffectively, more independently but also do it with better \nenvironmental stewardship because you are using the latest, greatest \ntechnologies. Instead of moving the product through railcars, you are \nmoving it through the latest pipeline with the latest safeguards. So I \nwanted to take 5 minutes to respond to some of those environmental \nissues, and I thank the Senator from California and turn the floor now \nback to her.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, could the Presiding Officer tell us who \nhas how much time at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from North Dakota has \n14 minutes, the Senator from Louisiana has 19 minutes, and the Senator \nfrom California has 8 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, Madam President, I will take three minutes of that \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As we get ready to have a vote here in a while, what \nmakes me very sad about this debate is that if we would all actually \nembrace an ``all of the above'' energy future, we wouldn't have to have \nthese arguments. But we cannot get any support over there for clean \nenergy. We just cannot. Let's just call it what it is.\n  It is sad because when I look at my home State, we are booming. We \nare booming because our State has always been an environmental leader \nand with it comes jobs and, as Jerry Brown has shown, balanced budgets. \nPeople are smiling.\n  I don't want it to look like what it looks like in China. We have a \nphoto here. This is what it looks like in China. I know you have been \nthere. People are walking around with masks on their faces because they \ncannot breathe the air and you cannot see. Yet still we go down this \npath. The heaviest polluting oil is what the tar sands oil is--the \nheaviest polluting oil.\n  I stood with doctors and nurses. They joined in my call for a health \nreview. My colleagues say: Oh, well, this project has been studied up \nand down, up and down, and down and up. Well, I don't think so, neither \ndoes Senator Whitehouse and neither do the nurses who all joined with \nus. They are the most respected profession. So don't listen to me, \nbecause I am in one of the least respected professions, I am sad to \nsay. Listen to the nurses. They say we need more studies on the health \nof the people. We don't want our people walking around like this. I \nremember the days in Los Angeles when the air looked like this. I don't \nwant to go back to that. This is the filthiest, dirtiest oil. That is \nwhy I call XL ``extra lethal.''\n  The pipeline itself is a pipeline. It is what you are putting in it, \nit is what you are unleashing that is going to mean a 45-percent \nincrease in the tar sands oil into our Nation, and there will be \nconsequences.\n  I've got news for you. Senators don't live near refineries. Take a \nlook at what that looks like. Senators don't live near pipelines when \nthere are spills. This is what it looks like--lovely, isn't it--in Port \nArthur, TX. I stood with the community leaders. This is what it looks \nlike. This is filthy, dirty oil with pollutants that kill, and that is \nthe truth.\n  Yet it is all: Oh, how many jobs? I will tell you how many jobs. The \nCEO of the pipeline company says it is 50 jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has taken 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much. I will yield 1 more minute.\n  So the CEO of the company itself said 50 jobs. This is why we are \nrisking the health of our children? The fact that they have to run away \nfrom the playground because they cannot breathe--this is worth it? This \nis supposed to be in the national interest? And the kicker is, as \nSenator Markey pointed out, all of the oil is going to be exported. It \nis going to drive up the price of gasoline here at home. I know this is \ncounterintuitive, but it is a fact. The oil is going to come in here, \nit is going to go straight out, and all of this stuff that is refined \nhere is going to move out of this country and our gas prices are going \nto go up so that kids have to suffer this because oil companies want to \nmake more profit? Not in my world.\n  So I reserve the balance of my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum and ask unanimous consent that the time be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  First of all, let me associate myself with the remarks of my \ncosponsor, Senator Hoeven, who before he had to slip out the door to \ntake a call relative to this vote was really very clear on so many \nimportant points that he made.\n  The first and most important point I think in this debate--and I \nrespect the opponents of this--but the most important point, the basic \nfact is this. This resource will be developed by Canada no matter what \nanyone in the United States and the House or the Senate of either party \ndoes. That is a fact. It is indisputable. How do we know that? Because \nthe Prime Minister of Canada and the Premier of the Province have told \nus that--of all the different parties. It is the unquestioned truth. \nThey are going to develop this resource, and they are going to send \nthis resource through their avenues out to either China--\n  Excuse me. Could I get order?\n  They are going to develop this resource. This debate isn't going to \nstop them or start them.\n  No. 2, we have to develop partnerships for progress because no \ncountry, even as powerful as the United States\n\n[[Page S6069]]\n\nis, can hardly do anything completely by themselves. We do lots of \ngreat things and have since the moment we were formed, but we have \nalways had partners. Even in the Revolutionary War, France came to help \nus and the Netherlands lent us money--a tiny little country that could \nfit inside of Louisiana. We have always had partners.\n  So the question for this debate is--the first point--this resource \nwill be developed and will go on the market to the world--period.\n  The second point is America needs partners in our energy production. \nWho is the best partner we could possibly have--the one that is close \nto us geographically, closest to us in terms of our democratic outlook, \nclosest to us in environmental standards? Even the Senator from \nCalifornia would admit if I asked her--she is standing right here next \nto me--which country has one of the highest environmental standards in \nthe world besides the Netherlands and besides one or two Scandinavian \ncountries, it would be Canada. In some ways you can argue that their \nenvironmental standards are higher than our own.\n  So I am sure they are feeling very offended being lectured to by U.S. \nSenators about a process where they have tighter environmental \nstandards than we do.\n  No. 3, contrary to the ranting of some people that this is for \nexport, it is contrary to the facts. I am going to read from \nTransCanada, the pipeline. It says: ``Comments were received throughout \nthe review process speculating'' whether this heavy crude oil carried \nby the proposed pipeline which passes through the United States would \nbe loaded onto vessels ultimately for sale in markets such as Asia.\n\n       As crude of foreign origin, Canadian crude is eligible for \n     crude export license as long as it is not commingled with \n     domestic crude. However, such an option appears unlikely to \n     be economically justified for any significant durable trade \n     given transport costs and market conditions.\n\n  Keystone is not for export. It is actually to come to the refineries \nin the gulf coast which is why I know a lot about this and why I have \nbeen a supporter from the very beginning--because this is my home. \nLouisiana and Texas are kind of the epicenter for refining heavy crude. \nWe transformed our refineries from light crude when we were kind of \nrunning out of it, when Venezuela was discovering its heavy crude. I \ntook a trip down with Frank Murkowski 18 years ago when I was a \nfreshman on the committee. He said: ``Go with me to Venezuela.'' I \nwent. He said: ``You've got to see this heavy crude. This is what our \nfuture is.'' Our country doesn't have much. We would rather get it from \nVenezuela and the Middle East. I went to Lake Maracaibo. I went to \nVenezuela years and years ago. They don't need permission from us. \nThese are business people making business decisions. They transformed \ntheir refineries to heavy crude.\n\n  The heavy crude that comes from Canada has a great partnership with \nthe refineries in the gulf coast. This is business, not politics, and \nbusiness is good for this country, contrary to popular opinion. This \nwas a business deal--a good deal for Canada, for the United States, for \nour economy, for jobs, and because it has a negligible impact on the \nenvironment.\n  I know Democratic Senators will come down here and talk about the \nenvironment. This is the last of five environmental studies. It has \nbeen published since January of this year. Senator Hoeven waited to \nintroduce our bill. He kept coming to me and asking: Should we \nintroduce our bill? I kept going to him and asking: Should we introduce \nour bill? We decided to give them a little more time. We didn't want to \nrush it. It has been going on for 6 years. We tried to be patient.\n  Finally, by May, after this had been published, it clearly says there \nis negligible environmental impact from President Obama's own State \nDepartment and EPA. They said it is much easier, safer, and cleaner to \ntransport this oil by pipeline than it is to put it on barges going \ndown the Mississippi River--and since we are at the end of it, we would \nknow about this. It is safer than putting it on railcars that go \nthrough towns and could potentially blow up. That is what they say in \nhere. I know people don't want to read it, but that is what this says.\n  It is not for export. This is a partnership with one of our best and \nlongest allies in the world, Canada, with the highest environmental \nstandards. It is a high-tech, state-of-the-art pipeline that is going \nto put thousands of people to work, but more importantly than the \npeople, building it is the signal it is going to send to chemicals, to \nour manufacturing base that has seen an extraordinary renaissance, and \nnot just in the gulf coast. In some places, our unemployment rate is \n2.5 percent.\n  It is also in other States, such as Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, the \nMidwest, and, yes, the west coast and the east coast. That is the third \nmajor argument.\n  The fourth major argument is this has absolutely nothing to do with \nclimate change. It simply has to do with smart partnerships--economic \nbusiness partnerships to produce the resources North America has in the \nmost environmentally friendly way.\n  If we could vote on this today--which we finally will. We have been \nworking for years to finally get a vote, and hopefully to passage--we \ncan then move on to a broader discussion which should take place about \nclimate change. I am not a denier of climate change. I am not. I \nunderstand there are impacts to the environment. This doesn't happen to \nbe one of them. This does not happen to be one of them.\n  This resource is going to be produced, either with Canada and the \nUnited States doing it in the cleanest, most efficient way possible, or \nit is it going to go in an inefficient way to partners that do not have \noversight, do not have an EPA, and do not have standards. It is a no-\nbrainer. After we finish with this, we can then get on with the big \ndebate I have had with Senator Boxer, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, and \nothers about what to do with the human impacts of the environment and \nstart talking about real issues that can move us one way or the other \nby also maintaining our commitment to economic growth. That is why I \nhave been fighting for a debate and a vote on the Keystone Pipeline.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I wish to call attention to the bill itself. We talk \nabout many bills, but we don't really debate many bills, so this has \nbeen a refreshing day on the floor of the Senate. I have not really \nseen a day like this in 8 years.\n  I am encouraged by what the outcome will be, but I am really \nencouraged by the debate we are having on the floor of the Senate.\n  There are a lot of businesses in America that are focused on this \ndebate. There are a lot of labor unions and their leaders who are \nwatching this. The pipefitters are watching, the boilermakers are \nwatching, the engineers are watching, and the operating engineers are \nwatching. They have been fighting for this pipeline for their members \nfor 5 years, and their cries for help and support have fallen on deaf \nears on this side of the Chamber. So they are watching.\n  Unlike a lot of bills that we debate, this bill is a page-and-a-half. \nThis is the bill. It is S. 2280. It was drafted to be very simple. The \nbill basically says that over the course of 6 years every study that is \nrequired by law has been completed. Every study has been completed, \npublished, and made public. Since the process is finished and over \nwith, the Congress is directing the President to build this pipeline \nbased on his own studies that have green-lighted it time and time and \ntime again.\n\n  There is no study to be turned in. The only issue outstanding--and it \nis important--has to do with one portion of the State of Nebraska. \nThere is an aquifer in Nebraska, and the people there did not want the \npipeline to go through it, and so the leaders in Nebraska moved the \npipeline away from the aquifer. When they did that, a small and vocal \nenvironmental group, which is against the Keystone Pipeline, filed suit \nto say that the way they did that was wrong, the process was wrong.\nThey are in court now, and that is going to be resolved. The Supreme \nCourt has already taken arguments. It will happen any Friday. It could \nbe this Friday or next Friday or the next Friday. That is it. It is \ndone. We could start building parts of it and eventually get to \nNebraska because they have\n\n[[Page S6070]]\n\nalready approved it to go through the State. It is just a matter of \nexactly who had the authority to do it, and that will be resolved by \nNebraska. Our bill acknowledges that and says nothing shall step on \nprivate property rights.\n  As I have said over and over, Senator Hoeven and I carefully drafted \nthis bill after consulting with Senator Tester from Montana about \nprivate property rights and talking to the Senators from Nebraska about \nrespecting Nebraska.\n  Enough is enough. Six years is long enough. Just like the Senator \nfrom North Dakota said, if a business wanted to get a permit to dredge \na channel or build a dock or put up a big store in a mall and walked \ninto city hall and they said, that is lovely, but you have to wait 6 \nyears, no one in America can function that way. It is not right. It is \nwrong.\n  It is so clear to the people of Louisiana that this pipeline should \nbe built, and it is so clear to the people of Texas. Many Democrats in \nour part of the country--strong members of the Black Caucus have voted \nfor this pipeline. Cedric Richmond, my Congressman, has voted for this \npipeline, as has Bennie Thompson, the Congressman from Mississippi, and \nJames Clyburn. The coalition is broad and diverse. The Republicans, \nDemocrats, Black Caucus, labor, and business community are saying: What \nis wrong with the Members of Congress that they cannot understand that \n6 years is long enough? The reports are in. The facts are what they \nare. This pipeline needs to be built for many good reasons.\n  I wish to reserve my last 2 minutes.\n  This is America's hour to become energy independent. We don't have to \nkowtow to Russia. We don't have to be held up by the politics of Putin \nand his bullying in Eastern Europe. We can help Japan, a strong ally of \nours, to stand with us. We can help Europe, and most importantly, we \ncan help ourselves and build a new energy renaissance that is all of \nthe above--that is the cleanest and most environmentally sensitive that \nwe can. Let's get on with doing this.\n  I am so proud to have literally kick-started this debate. I hope this \nis the beginning of many important debates that take place. No more \ntheater, no more positioning, and no more chess games that nobody \nunderstands, because if you are not at the chessboard, it is really \nhard to follow. Even when you watch chess on television, it is a real \nhard game to get excited about.\n  Let's get back to what we do best: debating bills that have impactful \noutcomes. In my opinion, this bill does that in a positive way for the \npeople of the United States.\n  Let us build a middle class again. Most importantly, let's listen to \nthem. Let's pay attention to them and use our common sense.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has just under 4 \nminutes. The Senator from North Dakota has 13 minutes, and the Senator \nfrom Louisiana has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And that is before we get to the final debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I want everyone who is watching us from \nLouisiana to know that without Mary Landrieu, we would not be having \nthis debate. She makes a point when she says it is good to have this \ndebate. It is really good to have debates. We have had debates before \non war and on health care. I put them in a bit of a different category, \nbut this is an important debate.\n  I do want to cover a little ground here. First of all, it is \nimportant to note we Democrats are under a big umbrella. We have \nSenators who agree with the Big Oil philosophy. We have Senators who \nagree with the ``all of the above'' philosophy, and we have Senators \nwho are pushing for clean energy. This is true about our caucus, and I \nam proud.\n  Mary Landrieu and I worked hand-in-glove on Katrina. She asked me to \ndo something for her in my capacity as chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee that I had to say no to. She is a great Senator. \nThe way I feel about Keystone is not the way she feels about it, and \nthat is the beauty of our party.\n  I want to make it clear for the Record, I met with Canadians who live \nnear the extraction of the dirty tar sands oil, I have met with the \npeople in Port Arthur, TX, who live near the refineries of the dirty \ntar sands oil, and I have talked to community activists who saw a \nLittle League team that had to flee a field in Chicago because the \npetcoke--petroleum coke, which is so filled with particulates that you \ncan't breathe around it--started to fly all over the Little League \nfield.\n  The Canadians I met with were not happy with their government. I am \nnot here to pass judgment, but I will put in the Record:\n\n       In October 2014, the Canadian Office of the Auditor General \n     issued a scathing report detailing the Canadian Government's \n     failure to adequately protect the environment during the tar \n     sands development.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have this summary printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Poor Canadian Environmental Oversight of Tar Sands Industry\n\n       In October 2014, the Canadian Office of the Auditor General \n     issued a scathing report detailing the Canadian Government's \n     failure to adequately protect the environment during tar \n     sands development.\n       The report found that:\n       The Canadian federal government has no firm plan to monitor \n     the oil sands beyond 2015; and\n       The 2012 Canada and Alberta Joint Oil Sands Monitoring \n     (JOSM) program set to be in place by 2015 has met delays--\n     including on monitoring one of the key pollutants--PAHs \n     (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Numerous peer reviewed \n     studies have found high levels of PAHs--carcinogens--\n     downstream from tar sands production.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I can't get into how good Canada is on a daily basis, but \nI can tell you that when it comes to the tar sands, they don't have a \ngood record.\n  I have stood with doctors and nurses from America, and they all said: \nThis is dangerous, dangerous stuff because it has heavy metals, sulfur \ndioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, carcinogens, and all of \nthese things.\n  So welcome, tar sands oil, to America to cut through our country and \nthen be exported to other countries. I have to say that it leaves me in \namazement.\n  Senator Markey laid it out. We are going to see higher gas prices \nbecause of this bill. They will just unleash more of their oil and get \nit out of here because they get a higher price abroad than they do in \nAmerica.\n  When you stand with the people who live along the excavation route, \nwhen you stand with people who live right near the refineries, when you \nstand with people who had their kids playing Little League and soccer \nright near the petroleum coke, you have to say, what is in the national \ninterest?\n  Madam President, I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would add 1 minute to Senator Landrieu's time as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. To me, all of these health reasons are reason enough to \nsay let's not interrupt what the administration is going through now, \nwhich is careful study of whether this is safe for our people. Two \nmillion people sent in their comments. Don't shortcut that.\n  Then there is the whole issue of the climate. We know this tar sands \noil is far more carbon intensive and it is going to hurt our planet, \nand we want to have a planet that is habitable for our children and our \ngrandchildren and generations to come.\n  I embrace this debate. I think it is an important debate to have. But \nwe really have to ask ourselves the question: Is it worth exposing our \npeople to these risks, with whom I stood shoulder to shoulder, and is \nit worth exposing the planet to these risks when we can create millions \nof jobs in a clean energy economy as we are doing in my State? And we \nare going gangbusters.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I say to the people from Louisiana, they \ncould not have a better fighter. We are in the ring together and it is \ntough, but that\n\n[[Page S6071]]\n\nis the beauty of the Democratic Party, that we are an inclusive party.\n  I yield my time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to commend Senator Landrieu for \nher work on the bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  Since coming to the Senate in 1997, Senator Landrieu has worked \ntirelessly to reach across the aisle and get things done for her \nconstituents. She has been by my side as a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee as we rolled up our sleeves to break through the gridlock to \nkeep the government open and functioning. She has done outstanding work \nas chairwoman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, along with \nher Ranking Member Senator Murkowski, and I am so proud to have her as \na colleague and a friend.\n  I am a blue-collar Senator. I grew up in a blue-collar neighborhood \nin Baltimore during World War II where my father had a small \nneighborhood grocery store. We were the neighborhood of mom-and-pop \nbusinesses and factories. We made liberty ships. We put out turbo steel \nto make the tanks. Glenn L. Martin made the seaplanes that helped win \nthe battle of the Pacific. We were in the manufacturing business. So I \nknow the value of good, blue-collar jobs.\n  Estimates show that the Keystone XL Pipeline could create 3,900 \ndirect construction jobs over its 2-year construction period. But only \nfewer than 50 would be permanent.\n  I recognize the need for jobs in construction, but I can't ignore the \nenvironmental and legal concerns surrounding the pipeline that still \nwon't be resolved if we pass the bill today.\n  First, I am worried about the safety of our water supply. The \ncorrosive, thick sludge that would travel through Keystone makes the \npipeline more vulnerable to leaks and accidents and endangers the \ndrinking water of the more than 1.8 million Americans who get their \nwater from the Ogallala Aquifer.\n  Second, I am worried about the increased carbon in the air as a \nresult of this project--the equivalent of Americans driving their cars \n60 billion more miles per year. This means more of the devastating \nimpacts of climate change which could harm jobs in aquaculture and \nseafood that are so important to the coastal economy of Maryland.\n  Finally, there is a lawsuit pending in the Nebraska Supreme Court on \nthe route of the pipeline. The route cannot be finalized until this \nlawsuit is complete, and no construction will begin before then.\n  For these reasons--at this time--I will oppose the approval of the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. There are too many environmental concerns that \nstill need to be addressed, and the pipeline cannot be constructed \nuntil the lawsuit in Nebraska is decided. We should take this time to \nwork on addressing the environmental concerns, and come back to make a \ndecision once we have all of the facts.\n  In the meantime, there are plenty of other jobs bills Congress can \npass that will put people back to work. I am for creating a national \ninfrastructure bank to finance new construction projects. I am for \nclosing the loopholes that allow businesses to make money off of moving \njobs overseas--let's pass the Bring Jobs Home Act. And finally, I am \nfighting to pass an omnibus appropriations bill that funds TIGER grants \nthat support State and local construction projects. All of these bills \nwould create good jobs and would have real and lasting benefits on \nAmerican workers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The time will be charged equally to both sides.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I would inquire as to the remaining \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 13 minutes \nand the Senator from Louisiana has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I would inquire of the Senator from Louisiana if she \nwould like to use her 3 minutes in addition to the agreement for the \nfinal 8? Would the Senator from Louisiana like to use her 3 minutes at \nthis time?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I just need 3 minutes to close.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Would the Senator from Louisiana like to do that now? \nThen she would still have 2 minutes to use after I finish as well. I am \ntrying to find out how the Senator would like to use her remaining \ntime.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator from North Dakota can do his closing and \nthen I will yield to the Senator from California. Would that be OK?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Sure. That is fine.\n  Madam President, I am going to go through a series of charts here. \nThey are actually getting a little worn because I have used them now \nfor a number of years. I am very hopeful that after today, or certainly \nafter the first part of the next year, I can retire these charts, \nbecause it is long past time to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  This is an effort that started in September of 2008. The TransCanada \ncompany applied for a Keystone XL Pipeline permit. They started this \nprocess in September of 2008. I wasn't in the Senate then. I was \nGovernor of North Dakota at that time. I worked on it for 2 years as \nGovernor, and now I have worked on it for almost 4 years here in the \nSenate--not building the project, but trying to get approval for this \nproject. The irony is--one of the many ironies--is that the TransCanada \ncompany actually built the Keystone Pipeline. A lot of people say, \nwhat? What do you mean? I thought that is what we are talking about. \nNo, what we are talking about is the Keystone XL Pipeline. The Keystone \nPipeline has already been built.\n  In 2006, the company applied for a permit to build a pipeline from \nHardisty, which is in Alberta, down to Patoka, IL, for the Keystone \nPipeline. They applied in 2006. They were granted a permit in 2008. By \n2010 they had the pipeline built and operating, bringing about 640,000 \nbarrels a day, going down from Canada, through my State, through South \nDakota, through Nebraska, and over to Patoka, IL. Permitted in 2 years, \nbuilt it in 2 years, and 4 years from start to finish, all done. That \nis the Keystone Pipeline.\n  What we are talking about here now is the Keystone XL Pipeline. It is \na sister project, and the company has been trying for 6 years to get a \npermit.\n  Here we see the route. It is very similar, but it also goes down to \nCushing and to the Gulf of Mexico. It is hard to believe it has been 6 \nyears in the making.\n  We passed legislation to try to get a decision out of the \nadministration. Not only is this not the first pipeline, which is the \nKeystone XL Pipeline, after we already built the Keystone Pipeline, but \nthis is not the first bill to approve it. In fact, we have passed other \nbills to approve it.\n  As a matter of fact, in 2011 I introduced a bill which we passed in \n2012 attached to the payroll tax holiday so the President wouldn't veto \nit, and what that bill said is: Mr. President, you need to make a \ndecision on the Keystone XL Pipeline. If we are going to have an energy \nplan for this country, if we are going to make this country energy \nsecure, energy independent, we have to have the infrastructure to move \nthat energy to market. We have to have this vital infrastructure. So \nall that bill said in 2012 is: Mr. President, make a decision. It has \nbeen years in the permitting process. Make a decision. And he did. He \nturned it down. He turned it down because he didn't like the route in \nNebraska. So what did we do? We went to work with the good people of \nNebraska and set up a different route. We addressed the concerns the \nPresident said he had. We rerouted the pipeline and we came back. Still \nno decision. Still no decision, making it very clear--the President \nwon't turn down the project. We have to ask, why isn't he turning it \ndown? Because it is about jobs and energy and economic growth. It is \nabout energy security, therefore national security, and the American \npeople overwhelmingly want this project--60, 70 percent every time it \nis polled. That is why he doesn't want to turn it down, because the \nAmerican people want it but he won't approve it. So what is his \nstrategy? His strategy is defeat through delay. Defeat through delay. \nDon't take my word for it. Actions speak louder than words. We are now \nin year 6 of the permitting process.\n  What does this bill do, Senate bill 2280? We have 56 sponsors on this \nbill--56. It is a bipartisan bill. We already have a majority of the \nSenate. Now we just need to get to 60. What does it do? If the \nPresident won't make a decision, then Congress needs to. What this bill \ndoes is that under the commerce clause\n\n[[Page S6072]]\n\nof the Constitution, Congress has the authority to oversee trade with \nforeign powers. We have the authority and the responsibility to oversee \ntrade with foreign countries. So we have the authority to approve the \ncross-border approval for this pipeline. We have that authority under \nthe commerce clause. So this bill simply says, all right, Congress \napproves the cross-border authority for this pipeline. That is it. The \nStates still have their right to the route and the oversight in their \nrespective States. We honor, we respect, and we protect. We protect \nproperty rights. We are just saying under the commerce clause of the \nConstitution that we can bring this pipeline across the border, just \nlike the many other pipelines that have come across the border. This \npipeline will have the latest, greatest technology, and it will be part \nof the more than--the millions of miles of pipelines that we already \nhave, except this one will be newer with safety features the other ones \ndon't even have.\n  That is what this bill is about, and that is what we are working on \ntoday. It really comes down to a very simple decision. Do we make a \ndecision for the American people, or do we make a decision for special \ninterest groups that oppose the project?\n  I wish to thank my colleagues for this very vigorous debate on the \nKeystone XL Pipeline today. It is very appropriate that we debate it. \nAnd it is very appropriate that we vote on it. I had not anticipated \ngetting to a vote until the new Congress, but I am pleased to get a \nvote today. It is certainly past time that we approve the Keystone XL \nPipeline--as I say, 6 years. Six years in the permitting process. How \nin the world are we going to build an energy plan for this country that \ntruly makes us energy secure and energy independent if we can't build \nthe infrastructure to move that energy around the country--to move the \nenergy we produce and that our closest friend and ally Canada produces \nfrom where we produce it to the refineries and to the markets around \nthe country? We can't build an energy plan for this country if we don't \napprove and build the infrastructure to make it work.\n  A lot has been written and a lot has been said over these 6 years. \nBut I go back to the most important point, and that is let's make this \ndecision on the merits and let's make this decision on the facts. It is \nabout energy, jobs, and economic growth, and it is about national \nsecurity through energy security.\n  On the environmental issues, after five environmental impact \nstatements, the Department of State says there is no significant \nenvironmental impact. Look, this isn't me saying it. Read the \nenvironmental impact statement. It is not as though we just did it \nonce. It is not as though we just did it twice or even three times. \nFive of them. Five environmental impact statements. Think about it. \nWhere is the common sense here? Five environmental impact statements. \nVerdict: No significant environmental impact.\n  On the jobs issues, the Department of State, again, in the \nenvironmental impact statement, says 42,000 jobs. Some say, those \naren't good jobs, those are construction jobs. Really? If they are not \ngood jobs, why are all the major national unions strongly supporting \nthe project? Ask them if these are good jobs.\n  Furthermore, energy is a foundational industry. Low-cost, dependable \nenergy helps all of the other industry sectors in our economy go and \nmakes us more competitive in a global economy.\n  On the export issue, I think we have heard our President say, oh, it \nis just all going to be exported. Well, that is interesting, because \nhis Department of Energy says otherwise. If we look at the report from \nthe Department of Energy, it says we are going to use that oil here in \nthe United States. We are going to refine it and use it here in the \nUnited States. Interestingly enough, in order for the oil to be \nexported, we have to get approval from the Department of Commerce--from \nthe Obama administration's Department of Commerce.\n  One other interesting point: It is not just oil from Canada, it is \noil from my great State of North Dakota and oil from Montana--light, \nsweet Bakken crude that we have to find a way to get to our refineries \nin the United States. Right now North Dakota produces almost 1.2 \nmillion barrels of oil a day, and it is going up. The only State that \nproduces more oil than North Dakota is Texas. Of that almost 1.2 \nmillion barrels of oil a day that we produce, 700,000 right now is \nmoving on rail--700,000 barrels a day. That is a problem. This pipeline \nalone will take 1,400 railcars of oil--1,400 railcars to move that \namount of oil. So if we don't have Keystone, we are going to have 1,400 \nrailcars a day moving that product. We already have a problem. We \nalready have our agriculture products backlogged in the Midwest because \nwe are trying to move all of this oil.\n  Look, we need infrastructure in the right balance. We need pipelines, \nwe need rail, and we need roads. Without it, we have more congestion on \nthe rail as well as more risks for accidents.\n  For all these reasons and more, as I said a minute ago, the American \npeople have spoken clearly. They have said that it is time to approve \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline. I hope that today that is exactly what we do.\n  We are here now, and we agreed to have a vote at 5:45 p.m. I know \nthat my colleagues from Louisiana----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I have 2 minutes remaining to start the final portion of \nthe debate prior to the vote. So without objection----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. So I turn to my colleague from California and my \ncolleague from Louisiana. The time has come to vote. We have had the \nvigorous debate. I would go back to what I said on this floor \nrepeatedly and will continue to say until we get this project approved. \nThis is about what the American people want. We work for the American \npeople.\n  I have gone through the merits. I have gone through the arguments. I \nlaid out how the bill works. I talked about the history. But at the end \nof the day, this is about our job representing the people of this great \ncountry and listening to them and doing what they want us to do. The \nAmerican people overwhelmingly support this project and want it \napproved. So I ask for an affirmative vote today to approve the \nKeystone XL Pipeline.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wanted to ask the Senator to yield so \nI can personally thank him for his leadership. It has been a pleasure \nworking with him to build the Keystone Pipeline. He and I have worked \ntogether now for several years. We have negotiated every step of the \nway--when to introduce the bill, what the bill should say.\n  I want to personally thank him for his leadership. I have been \npleased to work with him on it as an individual Member of the body as \nwell as the chair of the energy committee, and I look forward to \nworking with him on many projects in the years to come.\n  Let me close by making a couple of points. First of all, I wish to \nread from a statement from the mayor of Port Arthur, Deloris ``Bobbi'' \nPrince, who is strongly in favor of Keystone. I know you thought there \nwas some hesitation on the part of the mayor. She says: Our \nunemployment is very high. She represents the city of Keystone. The \nunemployment rate is 15 percent and a poverty rate of 25 percent.\n  These are my closing points. One, to the opponents of this that have \nstopped it and installed it every step of the way, I will say this \nagain. This resource will be produced. Nothing that we do on this \nfloor, what they do in the House or what the President of the United \nStates does will stop this resource from being produced.\n  Two, this product will move to these refineries. It will move by rail \nor it is going to move by car or it is going to move by barge. The \nstudies are in, done, signed, sealed, and delivered. It is less \nefficient and it is more dangerous to the environment, and we should \nuse a pipeline that is state of the art.\n  Number three, these heavy oils will not be exported. This is for \nenergy to Florida, which doesn't produce an awful lot. This is energy \nto California. They do a great job of conservation--I will give it to \nthem--not a great job of production. We actually do very well at both \nin Louisiana.\n\n[[Page S6073]]\n\n  This is for Americans, for American jobs, and to build an American \nmiddle class. It will immediately create 40,000 jobs. If the people of \nthis Congress have not noticed, there are long unemployment lines in \nsome parts of the country. The people at the very top might be doing \nreally well, but the people in rural America, the people in smalltown \nAmerica, and the people who don't have $1 million in their 401(k) plans \ncould use a job. According to the American Chemistry Council, it is \ngoing to create 407,000 jobs in the next 9 years, and that is just the \nbeginning.\n  Finally, let us do more than send a message. Let us do more than \ntalk. By our actions, let us send hope to the middle class.\n  I wish to conclude by thanking Senator Mark Begich, who will no \nlonger be with us, Senator Donnelly, Senator Hagan, who will no longer \nbe with us, Senator Heitkamp, Senator Manchin, Senator McCaskill, and \nSenator Pryor, who will no longer be in our next Congress.\n\n  I wish to also recognize Senator Tester, Senator Walsh, Senator \nPortman, Senator Carper, Senator Casey, and Senator Bennet for their \ngreat leadership. In the 30 seconds I have left, I specifically wish to \nthank the Industrial Union of Operating Engineers, who have fought for \n6 years, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the \nLaborers' International Union of North America, the pipefitters and \nplumbers, and the North America's Building Trades Union, which \nrepresents all of them and has fought every day for 6 years to try to \ntalk this administration and this Congress into acting on their behalf.\n  The time is now to build the infrastructure necessary to make America \nenergy independent. We can spend $6 trillion in wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and we can't give a green light to a pipeline that has \ngotten five environmental reviews? The comment period is over, and the \ntime to act is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I wish to make a point of personal \nprivilege. We would have voted on this bill a long time ago if my \nRepublican friends had not blocked the Shaheen-Portman bill from being \npart of the unanimous consent agreement. Let's stop the hypocrisy that \nis going on here.\n  We would have had a vote, but it is only about Big Oil and the Koch \nbrothers and all of that--fine. I am looking for this vote--win or \nlose--because we had to have it at some point. I was for having it a \nlong time ago. If we want to grow this energy economy with good jobs, \nif we want to protect our families and protect our planet from \ndevastating climate change, the vote is no on the Keystone XL Pipeline, \nwhich I call ``extra lethal.''\n  I will tell you, if the President vetoes this, I hope we will sustain \nthe veto if it passes today.\n  We should work together for the future of clean energy which will \ncreate far more jobs than the 50 permanent jobs even the CEO of the \nKeystone Pipeline says is the right number. That is how many permanent \njobs will be created.\n  I come from a State that is booming with hundreds of thousands of \njobs, with balanced budgets, and clean energy future. I come from a \nState that embraced cleaning up the environment and building the \neconomy and jobs. They go hand in hand. Anyone who tells you they don't \nreally doesn't understand anything.\n  I can tell my friend--he talks about polls. I want to talk to him \nabout another poll he won't like. That poll says that huge majorities \nof Americans want the EPA to clean the air, clean the water. They want \nthem to do the job.\n  It is very popular even though some of my colleagues have tried to \nundermine the work of the EPA. So why don't we work together on a clean \nenergy future, and if you want to know the way, come to my State.\n  We are looking at millions of jobs all across this nation in clean \nenergy.\n  Why vote against this pipeline?\n  We know misery follows this pipeline. That is not rhetoric. Here is \nPort Arthur, where my friend says the mayor is all for this. Fine--I \ndidn't meet with the mayor. My friend didn't understand. I met with the \ncommunity leaders who live around here and breathe this stuff. Senators \nand mayors, with all due respect, don't live in these communities. What \nis in all of this black smoke that goes into your lungs if you happen \nto live there? It is huge amounts of pollution--more sulfur dioxide, \nfar more nitrogen oxide, far more lead--and this is serious stuff. It \nis not rhetoric. It is fact. There is something called PAHs which are \ncancer-causing pollutants. That is proven. We put a peer-reviewed study \ninto the record. I will show you a picture. This is what happens after \nyou refine this tar sands oil. It goes to these holding areas.\n  I will tell you what happened in this particular case in Chicago. \nThere was a little league baseball game going on right near this \npetcoke. The wind came up. The petcoke blew around, and this is a \ndirect quote from the newspaper: Kids that were playing ball just had \nto get the heck out of there because all this stuff was going into \ntheir eyes and their mouths. For what? Fifty jobs? Fifty jobs and a lot \nof profit in the pocket of the people who own the tar sands oil? What \nis in the national interest?\n\n  I will just close with this.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds additional.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to show you a picture of a little girl. She has an \noxygen mask on over her face. I am telling you, as sure as I am \nstanding here, the nurses stood with me and the public health doctors \nstood with me and they said, you know what, let's be very careful here \nbecause this pipeline is going to unleash 45 percent more of the \ndirtiest, filthiest oil. That is why I call it the Keystone ``extra \nlethal'' Pipeline, and I hope we won't vote it up today. I hope we vote \nit down. I hope the President will veto it if it passes, and I will be \non my feet because I came here to protect people like this.\n  I yield floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nthe engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Senators, please \ntake your conversations outside the Chamber.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We have confirmed three judges from Georgia and I want to \ncompliment the two Senators from Georgia for their hard work, both in \nthe Judiciary Committee and the White House. And in that, I am sorry \nthey had to wait so long. On this side of the aisle we cleared every \none of those for a voice vote months ago. I am sorry that your side \nwanted to delay it, but I see a 100-0 vote, and the voice votes are \naccurate. But I compliment the two Senators from Georgia for sticking \nwith their nominees.\n  Madam President, I would like to yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah, Senator Lee, for 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, in 2013, the country learned that the \ngovernment, specifically the NSA, had been collecting and storing \nenormous amounts of information about American citizens, and that the \ndata collection at issue was not limited to those who were actually \nsuspected of terrorist activity or even necessarily to those who were \nconnected to those suspected of engaging in terrorist activity. Many \nwere understandably very concerned about how much and what kind of data \nwas being collected and whether this information could be or had been \nabused by government officials.\n  Today proponents of the metadata program claim it cannot be used to \nidentify ordinary American citizens. But earlier this year researchers \nat Stanford University proved that the very type of metadata collected \nunder Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act could be used to uncover a lot of \ninformation, including information about a person's politics, what kind \nof medications they might be taking, about where they go to church, and \nso on and so forth.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act is a bipartisan piece of legislation that would \nend bulk collection of metadata currently gathered by the NSA, and it \nwould help address the problem of the American government spying on its \nown citizens without cause. It also would improve transparency for the \ndata that NSA does collect. It has the support of leaders in our \nintelligence community, the Department of Justice, civil liberties \ngroups, the National Rifle Association, and several tech companies.\n  Opponents of this bill say it will impair our national security. They \nsay the bill will keep our intelligence community from protecting us. \nBut what opponents of this bill fail fully to appreciate is that most \nAmericans are deeply concerned about the collection of their own \npersonal information. This bill is an opportunity to strike a \nreasonable commonsense balance between protecting Americans' privacy \nand at the same time protecting our national security.\n  While I believe there are honest, decent people working in our \nintelligence community, and while I think this has been overwhelmingly \nthe norm, it is important to heed a warning given to us centuries ago \nby James Madison. In Federalist 51, Madison wrote:\n\n       If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If \n     angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal \n     controls on government would be necessary. In framing a \n     government which is to be administered by men over men, the \n     great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the \n     government to control the governed; and in the next place \n     oblige it to control itself.\n\n  Congress should address this issue now. The provision of the PATRIOT \nAct authorizing this kind of data collection expires just after \nMemorial Day this coming year, and it is important to adopt a \ncompromise well ahead of this deadline that all interested parties can \naccept.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the junior Senator from Utah who has worked so \nhard on this.\n  It has been more than a year since Americans first learned that the \ngovernment had been secretly sweeping up the telephone records of \ninnocent Americans, regardless of whether there was any connection \nwhatsoever to terrorism or criminal activity. I introduced the original \nUSA FREEDOM Act last October with Republican Congressman Jim \nSensenbrenner, and the Senate Judiciary Committee held six public \nhearings to address these issues.\n  During those hearings, we learned that the bulk phone records \ncollection program had not, as previously advertised, thwarted 54 \nterrorist plots, or even dozens, or even a few. In fact, we learned \nthrough our public hearings that after all the talk about why we needed \nthis program, we learned that the number was maybe one. That is an \nimportant fact for these who argue that the NSA's bulk phone records \nprogram is somehow essential to our fight against ISIL or other \nterrorists. It did nothing to stop ISIL from starting in the first \nplace.\n  Our bill protects Americans. It enhances privacy protections and ends \nindiscriminate data collection by the NSA, but also keeps the essential \ntools our intelligence community needs to protect our Nation. That is \nthe simple truth and important to remember. That is why our \nintelligence community strongly supports this bill.\n  As someone who worked in law enforcement, and as a native of Vermont \nwhere the right of privacy is cherished, I know we can have both \nliberty and security. The USA FREEDOM Act provides for commonsense \nreforms to government surveillance, and promotes greater accountability \nand transparency of the government's surveillance programs, and it \nimproves the FISA Court.\n  This is a carefully crafted bill that builds on the work of the House \nof Representatives. It has the unprecedented support of the Director of \nNational Intelligence, the Attorney General, the Director of the NSA, \nAmerican technology companies, and privacy and civil liberties groups \nacross the political spectrum, ranging from the ACLU and EFF to the NRA \nand TechFreedom. Lawmakers from all parts of the political spectrum, \nfrom the right to left, support the USA FREEDOM Act. They know it is a \nreasonable and responsible compromise. There is no reason why we should \nnot proceed to a debate on this important bill.\n\n  I understand that there are some Members who want votes on parts of \nit, and that is fine. Let's have the votes. Let's not block this bill \nand say: Well, we want something better. That means you don't vote yes, \nyou don't vote no, you vote maybe. Let's have some relevant amendments, \nand let's vote on them. Don't let this get bogged down in procedural \nnonsense that the American public hates. Senators should allow us to \nget onto this bill and help us reach an agreement on a limited list of \ngermane amendments to be considered. Let's have germane amendments and \nvote them up or down. If we work together, we can finish the bill by \nthe end of the week.\n  We cannot afford to delay action on these reforms until next year. As \nboth the ACLU and the NRA pointed out yesterday in a joint op-ed in the \nWashington Times, ``every day that the Senate fails to vote on these \nreforms is a day in which law-abiding citizens have reason to fear that \nthe constitutional protections so dear to the Founders and so crucial \nto the functioning of a free society no longer apply.''\n  I echoed the words we heard from the Senator from Utah. Every day \nthat we fail to act is another day that American businesses are harmed. \nOne conservative think tank estimated that the ``mistrust engendered by \nthe NSA's programs could cost the U.S. technology industry between $35 \nbillion and $180 billion over the next three years.'' That is a \nstaggering amount.\n  Senators should listen to the intelligence community professionals \nwho protect our nation every day, and who are calling for swift passage \nof this bill. Ask the Director of National Intelligence. Ask the \nAttorney General. They will tell you that it is better for our national \nsecurity, and better for our fight against terrorism if we pass the USA \nFREEDOM Act.\n  This is a reasonable compromise that all Senators should support, and \nI thank the Majority Leader for bringing this bill to the floor. And I \nthank Senators Dean Heller, Mike Lee, Dick Durbin, Al Franken, and \nRichard Blumenthal for their steadfast work on this bill.\n  Our bill is good for privacy and civil liberties, and upholds our \nConstitution. It is good for American business. It is\n\n[[Page S6077]]\n\ngood for national security. And most importantly, it is the right thing \nto do on behalf of Vermonters and the rest of the American people. I \nurge all Senators to vote in favor of the cloture motion pending before \nus.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Statement of Administration Policy \nin support of the USA FREEDOM Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was orered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administrtion Policy\n\n\n                        S. 2685--USA Freedom Act\n\n          (Sen. Leahy, D-VT, and 18 cosponsors, Nov. 17, 2014)\n\n       The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. \n     2685, the USA FREEDOM Act. In January, the President called \n     on Congress to enact important changes to the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) that would keep our \n     Nation safe, while enhancing privacy and better safeguarding \n     our civil liberties. This past spring, a broad bipartisan \n     majority of the House passed a bill that answered the \n     President's call. S. 2685 carefully builds on the good work \n     done in the House and has won the support of privacy and \n     civil liberties advocates and the private sector, including \n     significant members of the technology community. As the \n     Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence \n     stated in a letter dated September 2, 2014, the bill is a \n     reasonable compromise that enhances privacy and civil \n     liberties and increases transparency.\n       The bill strengthens the FISA's privacy and civil liberties \n     protections, while preserving essential authorities that our \n     intelligence and law enforcement professionals need. The bill \n     would prohibit bulk collection through the use of Section \n     215, FISA pen registers, and National Security Letters while \n     maintaining critical authorities to conduct more targeted \n     collection. The Attorney General and the Director of National \n     Intelligence have indicated that the bill will retain the \n     essential operational capabilities of the existing bulk \n     telephone metadata program while eliminating bulk collection, \n     based on communications providers' existing practices. The \n     bill also authorizes an independent voice in significant \n     cases before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \n     (FISC)--the Administration is aware of the concerns with \n     regard to this issue, as outlined in the letter from the \n     Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence, \n     and the Administration anticipates that Congress will address \n     those concerns. Finally, the bill will enhance transparency \n     by expanding the amount of information providers can disclose \n     and increasing public reporting requirements.\n       In sum, this legislation will help strengthen Americans' \n     confidence in the Government's use of these important \n     national security authorities. Without passage of this bill, \n     critical authorities that are appropriately reformed in this \n     legislation could expire next summer. The Administration \n     urges Congress to take action on this legislation now, since \n     delay may subject these important national security \n     authorities to brinksmanship and uncertainty. The \n     Administration urges the Senate to pass the USA FREEDOM Act \n     and for the House to act expeditiously so that the President \n     can sign legislation into law this year.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Rubio.\n  Mr. RUBIO. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  God forbid tomorrow morning we wake up to the news that a member of \nISIL is in the United States and Federal agencies need to determine who \nthis person is coordinating with to carry out a potential attack within \nthe homeland. One of the tools they will use is a tool that allows them \nto see the people they have been calling and interacting with so we can \ndisrupt that cell before they carry out a horrifying attack that could \nkill millions of American people.\n  Today we are able to do that because of a program that collects those \nrecords and keeps them--not in the hands of anyone who is looking at \nthem on a regular basis but keeps them readily available for the \ngovernment so the government can access those records and disrupt that \nplot. What this bill would do is take that apart. In essence, it would \nask the companies to keep those records--at least in the hopes that \nthey would. Under this plan, if this were to pass, if suddenly we were \nto go target these members of ISIL and find out whom they are \ncoordinating with, those records may not be there and that plot may \nindeed go forward. That would be a horrifying result.\n  Here is why this doesn't make sense. First of all, we are rushing \nthis to the floor of the Senate in a lameduck session, on an issue that \ndoesn't even expire until next year, on a bill that was not listened to \nor heard in a committee, and they cannot cite a single example of this \nprogram ever being abused--not one simple example of this specific \nprogram being abused by anybody intentionally. So we are dealing with a \ntheoretical threat.\n  The second thing is that even as we speak, law enforcement agencies \ninvestigating a common crime don't even need to go to a court to access \nthese very same records. They can just issue an administrative subpoena \nand get ahold of them. We are actually making it harder to go after a \nterrorist than it will be to go after a common criminal.\n  This is happening at a time when homegrown violent extremism is the \nsingle fastest growing threat to the United States, people here at home \nwho have been radicalized--even on the Internet--and people who have \ntraveled to the Middle East and been radicalized in the hopes of \nreturning and carrying out attacks here.\n  I hope this body would take more time to study an issue of this \nmagnitude because this program was specifically designed to address the \nintelligence gaps that existed after the 9/11 attacks. I promise you, \nif, God forbid, any horrifying event like that were to happen, the \nfirst question we will be asked is why didn't we know about it and why \ndidn't we prevent it. If this program is gutted, we potentially will \nnot be able to know about it, and we will not be able to prevent it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this program does not gut it; it actually \nenhances it.\n  Secondly, if this was important to stop ISIL, ISIL never would have \nstarted. The fact is that we had this program way beyond anything \nanybody is talking about today, and it didn't slow up or eliminate ISIL \none iota. That is a straw man which we should not even have here. It \nhas no effect on that, and everybody who has read the intelligence \nknows that.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to begin by thanking our very \nesteemed colleague, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nLeahy, for his leadership on this issue and my colleagues whom he has \nnamed who have helped in drafting and crafting this very important \npiece of legislation.\n  I also wish to thank my friends and colleagues across the aisle, such \nas the Senator from Utah, who have supported and helped to make clear \nthat this bill advances the cause of safeguarding our Nation without in \nany way detracting from its essential operational intelligence \ncapabilities.\n  In fact, National Intelligence Director Clapper said:\n\n       The bill will retain the essential operational capabilities \n     of the existing bulk telephone metadata program while \n     eliminating bulk collection.\n\n  This bill increases trust and confidence and credibility of our \nintelligence system. It advances that trust and confidence in the \ncapability of government surveillance to do its job but at the same \ntime protect our vital privacy interests. It advances the cause of \nconstitutional liberty and the appearance and perception of trust in \nthat system. It does so by making the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt look and function like the courts we are accustomed to seeing \nissue search warrants in the criminal process and protect essential \nliberties. It does it by strengthening and, in fact, installing an \nadversarial process so that more than just the government's version of \nthe facts and law are presented to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court. It does it by providing for appellate review, just \nas we have in normal civilian court. It does it by increasing the \ntransparency and accountability of the FISA Court system.\n  Our Founders would have been astonished and appalled to learn that we \npermit warrants to be issued by a court that is operating in secret, \nissuing secret opinions, and making secret law much like the Star \nChamber did, and that is why this reform is so profoundly and \nhistorically important--because we made the FISA Court one that we can \nmore aptly and abundantly trust and one that will have credibility and \nconfidence.\n  I support this bill.\n  I thank my colleagues for showing that we can work together in a \nbipartisan way to safeguard the essential\n\n[[Page S6078]]\n\nrights of Americans at the same time we protect and preserve our \nnational security.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Presiding Officer. I wish to speak to \nthis bill, and I have to say that this is one of the few times that the \nvice chairman, the distinguished Senator from Georgia, and I have a \ndisagreement.\n  I very much support this 215 metadata program. I think the \nIntelligence Committee had approximately 12 hearings on the subject \nlast year.\n  Many people believe that the NSA is using this program all the time. \nIn fact, in the year 2012 there were 288 approved queries, and 12 of \nthem eventually led the FBI to obtain a probable cause warrant for the \ncontent of the communications. In fact, you cannot obtain content in a \nquery; a query just searches the phone metadata.\n  Then the next criticism we have heard has been, well, the government \nshould not hold the metadata. And that is essentially the big change \nthis bill makes.\n  In October 2013, we voted out of our committee--by a vote of 11 to \n4--a FISA reform act; however, in my judgment, that bill is not going \nto pass in this Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is up.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that my time be extended, \nplease.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I recently talked with Members of the House, and here is what they \ntold me: If we didn't pass the House bill, there were Members who \nwanted to end the whole metadata program. I do not want to end the \nprogram. I am prepared to make this compromise, which is that the \nmetadata will be kept by the telecom companies.\n  Senator Chambliss and I wrote a letter to the four big telecoms, and \nwe asked them if they would hold the data. The answer came back from \ntwo ``yes,'' and the answer that came back from the other two was \ninconclusive. Since that time the situation has changed--not in writing \nbut by personal testament from officials with the two other companies \nthat they will hold the data for at least 2 years.\n  Here is the problem: Although there is no mandate to hold the phone \nmetadata, the fact is that the telecoms have agreed to hold the data \nfor a sufficient period of time.\n  The President himself has assured me that he is comfortable with this \nbill. And I believe that if we do not pass this bill, the metadata \nprogram is at risk because the 215 program sunsets next year.\n  Senator Rubio sits on the intelligence committee. I listened to him \nwith interest. I agree with what he said about ISIL and other terrorist \ngroups. They will come after us if they can, and the only protection we \nhave is essentially to disrupt a plot before it becomes a reality in \nthis country.\n  The metadata program is not as widely used as the 288 approved \nqueries in a given year would indicate.\n  Additionally, in this bill--and I think this should be of \nsatisfaction to a number of people--the FISA Court would have to \napprove a query before that query takes place.\n  I am prepared to support this bill, and I do so for very practical \nreasons because without it, I believe we will not have a metadata \nprogram.\n  This is hard for me because I have tried to be supportive of the \nlegislation that comes out of our committee. I have talked to Senator \nLeahy. I have said that the one big problem I have with his bill is \nthat the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is upset with the \nlanguage on the special advocate. Senator Leahy said he would change \nthe language on this part of the bill.\n  Senator Blumenthal has an amendment--which I assume will pass--which \ndoes change the language on this part of the bill to accommodate the \nobjections of the FISA court. If that is the case and the telecoms \nagree to hold the data, I believe that solves what is a very practical \nproblem.\n  In any event, I have agreed to support this legislation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. How much time on the other side has been used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six and a half minutes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I only had one speaker and I had 15 minutes. Did he \nuse 7\\1/2\\, 8 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair was instructed that the Senator from \nCalifornia spoke on the time of the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nthe Senator from California used be added to my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will not \nobject. I was going to yield the remainder of my time to the Senator \nfrom Texas, Mr. Cruz, and I ask unanimous consent that he be allowed up \nto 4 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I object to that. He can have your 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will not object to the request, and I will yield the \nremainder of my time to the Senator from Texas. I am sorry the Senator \nfrom Georgia would not offer me the courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I yield to the Senator from Maine for 2 minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, we need reform of the NSA program but not \nin this manner. Let's remember why this intelligence tool was put into \nplace. It was enacted in the wake of the worst terrorist attack in our \ncountry that took the lives of nearly 3,000 people. We have testimony \nfrom the former Director of the FBI and from the former Deputy Director \nof the CIA telling us that had this tool been in place, it is likely--\nmost likely--that the plot that killed nearly 3,000 people would have \nbeen uncovered. Why would we weaken the ability of our intelligence \ncommunity at a time when the threats against this country have never \nbeen greater?\n  Let me address to my colleagues the privacy issue that has been \nraised--an issue that all of us care about. These data are far more \nsafe, far more subject to privacy protections if they are held by the \nFederal Government where only 22 vetted and trained government \nemployees have access to them instead of nearly 150 telecommunications \ncompanies that employ thousands of workers, and the government is going \nto have to go to those companies and ask for the data. That greatly \nexposes the privacy of individual Americans far more than the current \nsystem.\n  So for both of those reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill \nof the distinguished Senator from Vermont. It is a mistake. It would \nmake us less safe, and we have expert testimony telling us that.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I regret that I just have 2 minutes. It is \nunfortunate that a bill with this amount of consequence for Americans \nis being debated in such a limited amount of time.\n  We have 2 bills, one produced by the intelligence community, written \nand supported by the chairman, a Democrat from California, and by the \nvice chairman, the Republican from Georgia, and it passed on a \nbipartisan basis with more than a 3-to-1 ratio. Here we are trying to \ngo forward, allowing only one vote on one different bill.\n  Why do we have to rush this through in a lameduck session when it has \nsuch consequences and when the director of the agency that oversees \nthis, when asked by me what are the ultimate consequences of this, his \nanswer was: A compromise of our ability to detect terrorist attacks--\nand the consequence will be Americans will die. And when that happens, \nand when those of us who go everyday to the Intelligence Committee know \nwhat the threat is--the threat is greater than it has ever been--we \nneed to understand that eventually something will happen here, and \npeople will turn to us and say: Did you have every possible tool in \nplace to try to stop this from happening? If you\n\n[[Page S6079]]\n\ndidn't, why didn't you? Let's not have a repeat of 9/11 when the \ncommission then comes to us and says get the tools that you need.\n  This program has been so mischaracterized in terms of what it does \nand doesn't do. Even as I talk to my colleagues, they don't have a full \nunderstanding of what it doesn't do. It has more oversight than any \nother Federal program in our committee's jurisdiction. We have enhanced \nit through our committee with hours and hours of discussion, and here \nwe have a bill that wasn't even taken up by the Judiciary Committee and \nwas just brought here to the floor.\n  So I urge my colleagues to think this through before we come to a \nconclusion we are going to regret.\n  I thank the vice chairman for the time.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, in closing, let me say there are any \nnumber of reasons why the substance of this bill is totally flawed. We \nlive in a dangerous world today. We all know and understand that. While \nthe provisions in this bill wouldn't have prohibited ISIL from being \nformed--it didn't prevent ISIL from being formed--the provisions in the \nunderlying FISA bill give the Intelligence Committee all the tools they \nneed to make sure that when ISIL recruits individuals to go to Syria to \nfight, if they are trying to recruit Americans, we can find out about \nthat. We have under surveillance today any number of individuals, whom \nwe think have been committed to jihad, who live in America.\n\n  Secondly, there is another part of their recruiting that is even more \ndangerous than asking young men and women to come to Syria to fight for \nISIL. They want people to go into the Parliament in Canada and start \nkilling people. They want people to walk the streets of New York and \npull out a gun or a hatchet or whatever it may be and start killing \npeople.\n  If we eliminate this program--and that is basically what the Leahy \namendment does--then we are going to take a tool away from our \nintelligence community that is not going to allow them to be able to \ninterrupt and disrupt those types of terrorist attacks.\n  Now, with respect to our privacy, folks, gosh, we need to be really \nprotective of privacy issues in this country. We live under a \nConstitution that has survived for in excess of 200 years. It has lots \nof privacy protections in it, and all of us want to see that happen. \nBut let me tell my colleagues what is going to happen if this amendment \ncomes to the floor and should happen to pass today. The metadata that \nis collected by the NSA can be accessed by 22 individuals--22. That \nmeans there is an opportunity for leaks to occur or for individual \nprivacy rights to be breached by 22 people. If this amendment ever \nbecame law, all of a sudden, all of the telecoms are going to be \nholding this metadata information as opposed to the NSA holding it. All \nof those telecoms have thousands of employees, lots of whom have \naccess--will have access to this metadata. So instead of having the \npotential for 22 people to breach the privacy rights of American \ncitizens, all of a sudden we are going to have thousands of \nopportunities for the privacy rights of Americans to be breached.\n  Let me close by saying that this program has been criticized an awful \nlot simply because of the leaks that Mr. Snowden made because of his \ntheft of government property. But the fact is there cannot be one \nsingle case pointed to by anybody who can show that as a result of the \ncollection of metadata under 215, any American has had their privacy \nrights breached. It simply has not happened. It will not happen if we \nkeep this program in place.\n  Do we need to modify it? You bet. And Senator Feinstein and I did a \ngood job of that, considering 10 amendments within our committee, \nvoting on all 10 of them. Some of them passed. Some of them didn't. The \nbill came out of our committee on a bipartisan vote.\n  The Leahy amendment has not even gone to the Judiciary Committee to \ngive the members of the Judiciary Committee the opportunity to review \nit, to file amendments on it, to debate it in committee, and vote on \nit. That is not the way this institution has ever worked, and it is not \nthe way it should work here in a lameduck session with time running \nout, and particularly on a controversial and sensitive and important \nprogram as is the 215 FISA amendment program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute remaining.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, many months ago the American people were \nastonished to learn the Federal Government was collecting bulk metadata \nfrom personal cell phones of millions of law-abiding citizens. This \nlegislation protects the Constitutional rights of privacy under the \nFourth Amendment while maintaining important tools to protect national \nsecurity and law enforcement.\n  This is bipartisan legislation that enjoys the support of the \nintelligence community as well as the tech community. The bill is not \nperfect, but in my view we should take it up and consider reasonable \namendments on the floor to make it better. But it is imperative that we \nstand together, united, protecting the Bill of Rights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Georgia has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I yield back the remaining time, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote the yeas are 58, the nays are 42. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, obviously I am disappointed by tonight's \nvote, but I am not new to this fight. We have had six public hearings \non this issue. We heard interesting testimony by the head of the NSA \nwho talked about 50-some-odd terrorist activities that have been \nthwarted by the bulk collection program. When he had to testify in \npublic, it came down to possibly one.\n  I mention that because people asked whether we had hearings. We had \nsix. But the reason I say I am not new to this fight is the very first \nvote I cast as a Senator in 1975 was in favor of the Senate resolution \nthat created the Church Committee. I have worked ever since to ensure \nstrong oversight of surveillance authorities.\n  We found in the Church Committee that administrations of both parties \nhad so badly misused the tools they had in the intelligence community. \nWe tried to put in restrictions that would balance our constitutional \nrights and the security that we needed as Americans. We tried to do \nthat. I think we did.\n  That is why over the past decade I have consistently opposed \nexpanding the USA PATRIOT Act and FISA Amendments Act sunsets without \nincluding meaningful reforms. The first sunsets were put in place by \nthe Republican leader in the House, Dick Armey, a conservative \nRepublican, and myself in the Senate. We joined together for the same \nreason: If you do not have an ability to look at these issues on a \nperiodic basis, then they will get out of hand.\n  I fought the status quo every step of the way in these efforts. The \nbroad coalition of those in favor of the USA FREEDOM Act shows we are \ngaining ground. While I am critical of those Republicans who failed to \nanswer the call of the American people who elected them to stand up and \nwork across the aisle, those who reverted to scare tactics rather than \nworking productively to protect America's basic privacy rights and our \nnational security--I acknowledge the hard work and principled stance of \nseveral Republicans: Senator Heller, Senator Lee, and Senator Cruz, as \nwell as other Republicans in the other body, including my initial \npartner in this effort, Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner. There have also \nbeen two important partners on the Democratic side in this reform \neffort: Senators Franken and Blumenthal who worked with me on \ntransparency and the FISA Court reforms.\n\n  We Vermonters fight to protect our privacy rights. Every Vermonter \ndoes. They mean a great deal to us. Every Vermonter feels that way, and \nthis lifelong Vermonter will not give up the fight. I owe that to the \nVermonters I serve and to the Constitution I swore an oath to defend.\n  I would say to those both in this Chamber and outside who approached \nthis issue by fomenting fear, fomenting fear stifles serious debate and \nconstructive solutions, like the carefully drawn reforms in this bill. \nDoing it at the last minute is all the more regrettable. This Nation \ndeserves more than that.\n  This Nation should not allow our liberties to be set aside by passing \nfears.\n  America will always face the threat of terrorist attacks, both \noutside our borders and inside. We didn't do away with all our civil \nliberties after the Oklahoma City bombing. It was an American who did \nthat, somebody who served in our military, churchgoing, and so forth. \nNo more should we do it if the attacks come from outside our country. \nWe talk about 9/11. We had all the evidence necessary to stop 9/11 \nbefore it happened.\n  Everybody who has looked at that now agrees that if we had bothered \nto translate the material we had, if we had bothered to listen to \npeople in Minnesota who tried to warn us about it, we could have \nstopped it.\n  But because mistakes were made then, let's not take away the \nliberties of 325 million Americans.\n  I felt this way when I was a prosecutor. We even had people escape \nfrom prison with the intent to kill me.\n  I said: OK. We will get them, but we will follow the law in doing it, \nand we did.\n  Mr. President, 13 years ago this week a letter was sent to me. The \nanthrax in it was so deadly that the one person who touched the \nenvelope--that I was supposed to open--died. They died from it. We \nstill haven't caught all of the people involved.\n  But notwithstanding that, when people came to me and said: Well, \nmaybe we should do away with some of our search and seizure laws, maybe \nwe should do way with some of our laws for wiretaps, after all somebody \ntried to kill you. And if you had touched that envelope you would have \ndied.\n  I said: No, this is more than one Senator, more than one person, more \nthan one individual. This is the Constitution of the United States. If \nwe, 100 Members of this body, do not protect our Constitution, we do \nnot protect our country, and we do not deserve to be in this body.\n  I will continue to fight, and whatever years I have left in this \nbody, I will continue to fight to preserve our Constitution and our \nrights as Americans.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/18/senate-section/article/S6080-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF PAMELA PEPPER TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                     EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, Christ the King School of Burlington, VT, \nwill soon celebrate its 75th anniversary, and it remains one of the \nmost distinguished educational hubs in the Green Mountain State. Begun \nas a school to accommodate the overflow of students from the Cathedral \nSchool, three-quarters of a century later it continues to offer young \nVermont students the educational foundation on which to build \nsuccessful futures.\n  The school has undergone a considerable transformation since it \nopened its doors to the community of Burlington and beyond in 1940, but \nits commitment to education has been constant. Its curriculum helps \nstudents experience learning through real-world experiences. Recently, \nstudents traveled to Ausable Chasm in New York. Students, their \nteachers, and many parents hiked the chasm, collecting foliage for a \nfuture science lab where students will use paper chromatography to \nseparate the components in leaves. By giving students opportunities to \ntake their learning outside of the classroom, they early on come to \nunderstand the importance of engaging with the surrounding community.\n  In addition to expanding their curriculum to include this \nexperiential learning, Christ the King School's recent partnership with \nthe Tarrant Institute for Innovative Education at the University of \nVermont will help give students access to technology and professional \ndevelopment resources that might not otherwise be available.\n  Christ the King School has a long history of commitment to excellence \nin education. I commended the School in the Record as the school \ncelebrated its 50th anniversary, and I am pleased to again commemorate \nanother milestone. Our young people deserve the best in their \neducational development. Christ the King School continues to provide \nthe academic and spiritual guidance it has delivered for the last 75 \nyears, and I hope will do so for decades to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/18/senate-section/article/S6082-2", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6082-S6083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO KATHERINE PATERSON\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Katherine Paterson is a treasure to \nVermont. She is also a close friend to Marcelle and me. And today, at \nthe age of 82, she continues to write with the grace and talent that \nhas made her a two-time National Book Award winner and twice a Newbery \nmedalist.\n  I have had the honor and good fortune to know Katherine for many \nyears. Her humble and soft-spoken nature belie the power of her writing \nand her myriad contributions to children's literature.\n  In announcing that she would be last year's winner of the Laura \nIngalls Wilder Medal, the committee noted: ``Katherine Paterson has \nbeen writing books that have made a profound difference in children's \nlives for 40 years. Her work acknowledges life's challenges and \ndifficulties, yet she always leaves her readers with hope.''\n  I ask that this recent profile of Katherine Paterson, from the \nBurlington Free Press, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From The Burlington Free Press, Nov. 16, 2014]\n\n                  Katherine Paterson's Life in Stories\n\n                           (By Sally Pollak)\n\n       Montpelier Author's Memoir is a Set of Stories, Many Could \n     Serve as a Manual for Loving and Raising Kids\n       In her new book, ``Stories of my Life,'' Katherine Paterson \n     tells a set of wonderful stories that span her eight decades.\n       She writes about her young childhood in China, where she \n     was born, and the mountain resort where she stayed with her \n     mother and siblings (including a newborn sister) during \n     wartime in the summer of 1937. Paterson tells about a family \n     friend who was kissed by Robert E. Lee, and her distant \n     cousin named Mark Twain. Yes, that Mark Twain. Paterson \n     writes about taking her sixthgrade class on a field trip to \n     the Washington zoo; the widow she lived with when she worked \n     as a missionary in Japan, and her sons' adventures in places \n     unknown to their mother.\n       Paterson doesn't write about her first fall in Barre, where \n     she and her husband moved 28 years ago. The youngest of \n     Paterson's four children went off to college, and Paterson \n     had left behind friends in Virginia and Maryland.\n       ``It rained a lot,'' Paterson said. ``I ate Ben and Jerry's \n     Coffee Heath Bar Crunch, and read.''\n       Paterson, who turned 82 on Halloween, is an awardwinning \n     author who started to write books in the bits of time when \n     her young children were all asleep. She was able to devote \n     more time to writing when her four kids were old enough for \n     school. Paterson's books have won the most prominent honors \n     in literature, including two Newbery Medals (``Bridge to \n     Terabithia'' and ``Jacob Have I Loved'') and two National \n     Book Awards (``The Master Puppeteer'' and ``The Great Gilly \n     Hopkins.'') Before the Patersons moved to Vermont for John \n     Paterson's work as a minister, the Patersons knew Vermont as \n     the place they celebrated their wedding anniversary. They \n     would drive north from New York's Lake George, where they \n     spend summers, to eat at Dog Team Tavern. The restaurant in \n     Middlebury, known for its sticky buns, burned down in 2006.\n       The ice-cream eating phase in the big brick house in Barre \n     would give way to book-writing, including books set in \n     Vermont. Paterson had barely unpacked when she met a woman at \n     a book signing in Shelburne who began a conversation: ``Now \n     that you're a Vermonter. . . . '' The woman went on to \n     inquire if Paterson had an interest in writing a book that \n     would be meaningful for children of Vermont migrant farm \n     workers.\n       This involved getting to know her new home state by \n     visiting farms and homes, and completing a book on a six-\n     month deadline (a first). In order to meet the deadline, \n     Paterson proposed writing an I Can Read Book. ``The Smallest \n     Cow in the World,'' with illustrations by Burlington native \n     Jane Clark Brown, was Paterson's first book for new readers.\n       Decades later Paterson attempted another genre for the \n     first time: memoir, or memoir-ish.\n       ``Stories of my Life'' is lively, interesting and generous \n     of spirit. Its stories are warm and humorous, and connected \n     to a larger sphere: literature, religion, history. Certain \n     stories could serve as a manual, a valuable one, for loving \n     and raising kids.\n       Still, writing a memoir wasn't part of Paterson's plan.\n       ``It just seems like such a me, me, me thing to do,'' \n     Paterson said recently at her home in Montpelier, where she \n     moved last spring. ``I didn't think people nearest and \n     dearest to me would want to play minor roles in the stories \n     of my life.''\n\n\n                          kitchen sink stories\n\n       The illness of Paterson's late husband, John Paterson, was \n     a kind of catalyst for Paterson's recently published book. \n     During his sickness, Katherine Paterson was somehow unable to \n     start a novel, she said. Instead, she began to write down \n     stories drawn from her life, what she calls in her book \n     ``kitchen sink stories.''\n       These are stories she heard from her mother as a child, \n     when she washed, dried and put away dishes with her mother \n     and sister. Paterson's children grew up in a house with a \n     dishwasher, and some stories went untold in the absence of \n     that evening chore.\n       ``I realized there were family stories that my children \n     didn't know and I should write them down,'' Paterson said. \n     ``It would be a good thing for the kids and for the \n     grandchildren.''\n       The stories are a fascinating collection that take in \n     family history (great uncles who died in the Civil War); \n     Paterson's work and travel in Asia; her chance meeting while \n     at graduate school with the man she would marry; raising a \n     family with accompanying menagerie--and writing books.\n       In ``Stories of my Life'' Paterson draws connections \n     between significant events and people in her own life, and \n     aspects of her books: a story line, a character, a scene.\n       She explains that she discovered the ``emotional heart'' of \n     her first novel, ``The Sign of the Chrysanthemum'' in a \n     conversation with her oldest daughter, Lin.\n       Lin was born in Hong Kong; she was two years old when the \n     Patersons adopted her. There were times when Lin was young \n     that it was difficult for her parents to get through a \n     ``curtain'' and reach their daughter, Paterson writes.\n       From her memoir: ``Lin,'' I yelled, ``how can I help you if \n     you won't tell me what's the matter?''\n       She jerked to life, her eyes wide open. ``Why did that \n     woman give me away?''\n       Paterson would go on to write a novel built around this \n     question: ``What must it be like, I wondered, to have a \n     parent somewhere whom you do not know?''\n       Later, at a time she was idea-less for a book, she asked \n     her four children what to write about.\n       The kids voted for a mystery. Paterson was certain she \n     wasn't capable of writing one. She describes this in her \n     memoir: ``Do you think,'' I asked my eager children, ``that \n     anyone who is regularly beaten at chess by a six year-old has \n     the kind of brain it takes to plot a mystery story?''\n       Yet her kids' choice helped Paterson find her way to a \n     story that involved Japanese puppet theater.\n       ``So the children and I compromised,'' Paterson wrote. ``I \n     would try to write an adventure story with as much suspense \n     as possible.'' The resulting book, ``The Master Puppeteer,'' \n     won the 1977 National Book Award.\n\n[[Page S6083]]\n\n       Her beloved novel, ``Bridge to Terabithia,'' grew out of \n     the accidental death of her son David's close friend at age \n     8. In ``Stories of my Life,'' Paterson discloses that \n     confronting a different death--her own--made writing \n     ``Terabithia'' a particular challenge.\n\n\n                              a love story\n\n       The story of a strong and loving marriage runs through \n     Paterson's new book, a partnership that formed in a matter of \n     months. When John Paterson proposed to Katherine Womeldorf, \n     he made a promise to always help and support her.\n       ``John said that he knew I was a strong woman with many \n     gifts, and he wanted to promise me that he would never stand \n     in the way of my exercising those gifts,'' Paterson writes in \n     her new book.\n       ``It was very memorable,'' Paterson said of the proposal, \n     talking about the conversation more than half a century \n     later.\n       ``I had no idea that I was going to be a writer,'' she \n     said. ``I had no idea what I was going to do. John thought I \n     was going to be something.''\n       John Paterson was a Presbyterian minister who collected \n     art, played tennis and co-wrote books with his wife. His \n     death at age 80 in September, 2013, was the central aspect of \n     the ``most extraordinary'' story of Paterson's life, she \n     wrote.\n       The experience, including conversations with \n     ``compassionate and honest doctors,'' suggested to the \n     Patersons that a person needn't fight death with the full \n     arsenal of modern medicine, Paterson said. John Paterson \n     sought the advice of his wife, and chose to die at home.\n       ``In our society we have to come to it,'' Paterson said. \n     ``Death is not the enemy.''\n       The artist that John Paterson saw in his future wife is \n     still at work. Paterson is writing a play with a friend, and \n     awaiting the 2015 release of the film adaptation of ``The \n     Great Gilly Hopkins.'' The screenplay was written by her son \n     David Paterson.\n       ``I had a good life,'' Paterson said. ``Let's face it.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/18/senate-section/article/S6083-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. JIM TAYLOR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Jim \nTaylor as he ends his 35-year stint as president of the University of \nthe Cumberlands. Dr. Taylor is an educator of the highest degree and \ndeserves the praise of this body for his unremitting devotion to his \nstudents and his community.\n  When Dr. Taylor retired last month, he ended the longest tenure as \npresident of any college or university in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. \nHe led the university for so long, however, because he continued to get \nresults from his students and contribute positively to his community--\nyear after year.\n  Over the course of his tenure, enrollment in the school rose from \n1,885 to over 5,500, the endowment rose from $6 million to $79 million, \nand numerous campus renovations were made including the construction of \nhundreds of handicap access ramps.\n  Dr. Taylor's impact did not stop at the boundaries of campus, \nhowever. He worked tirelessly to better his community--raising money \nfor scholarships for Appalachian students and overseeing clothing and \nfood drives for area families.\n  For now, Dr. Taylor and his wife of 46 years, Dinah Louise Taylor, \nwill move to their home in Florida. However, Dr. Taylor could not \nseparate himself from the institution for which he had worked for so \nlong in one fell swoop. He will remain involved with the university in \nhis new position of chancellor, where he will help with fundraising and \nprovide counsel to his successor in order to provide for a smooth \ntransition.\n  Dr. Jim Taylor's life of service to his students and his community \nprovide a shining example of excellence for us all. Therefore, I ask \nthat my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in honoring this exemplary \ncitizen.\n  The Times-Tribune of Whitley County, KY, recently published an \narticle detailing the life and career of Dr. Jim Taylor. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                 [From the Times-Tribune, Oct. 8, 2014]\n\nThe Ending of an Era: University of the Cumberlands President To Retire\n\n                          (By Kristina Smith)\n\n       Boxes filled the large rectangular room where Dr. James \n     Harold Taylor usually sat and carried out his day-to-day \n     business as president of the University of the Cumberlands.\n       Each box was marked with bold, white letters--``mover.''\n       Until Oct. 16, that's exactly what Taylor will be doing--\n     moving.\n       Taylor's 35 years as president comes to an end next week as \n     he officially retires and Dr. Larry Cockrum takes over the \n     top position. His retirement also means the end of the \n     longest tenure of a Kentucky college or university president.\n       So for now, Taylor prepares to move to his Florida \n     residence with his wife of 46 years, Dinah Louise Taylor.\n       ``I'm telling everybody goodbye and expressing my \n     appreciation,'' Taylor said of his last week as president. \n     ``This job is too big for one working alone. It takes a team, \n     and we have a great one here. We have great faculty, staff \n     and students.''\n       Taylor and his team have molded the university into the \n     largest private college or university in the state of \n     Kentucky during his time as president.\n       ``We're also the only Baptist university in the state,'' \n     Taylor quickly pointed out. ``Well, except for Clear Creek \n     Bible School.''\n       Taylor is proud of the university and the over 5,000 \n     students he is leaving behind. He mentions that he is \n     especially happy with the developing physician's assistant \n     program, nursing program and health programs.\n       However, he is most proud of the impact within the \n     community that he leaves behind.\n       ``What I'm pleased about is that we've been able to build \n     145 homes for people. Distributed tons of food and clothing. \n     We've built hundreds of handicap access ramps, done \n     insulation projects, roofing. We have a toy program for kids \n     at Christmas who normally wouldn't get toys. Then we have \n     Thanksgiving, where we do vouchers for people,'' Taylor said.\n       The list goes on and on.\n       ``I've had a lot of fun,'' Taylor said with a grin.\n       But Taylor isn't boasting on his accomplishments. Once \n     again, he points to the team of people surrounding him.\n       ``When I'm talking about this, I'm just talking about how I \n     hire smart people who are really good,'' Taylor said. ``And I \n     just get out of their way and let them work.''\n       Running a university that spans over 100 acres is a lot of \n     work, and Taylor acknowledges that his predecessor will have \n     no easy task before him.\n       ``This school is so much bigger than people think,'' Taylor \n     said. ``See, our operating budget is $50 million a year. The \n     fiscal plan here is around $200 million. You have to maintain \n     all of it. So we raise probably around $300 million, and \n     spend around $305 million. It takes a lot to keep it going.''\n       So Taylor will provide some help to Cockrum going forward. \n     He hopes to help make the transition as smooth as possible.\n       For about a week of every month, Taylor will assist in \n     raising money and identifying friends for the college as \n     chancellor.\n       ``No one does anything alone. It takes many heads, hearts \n     and hands,'' Taylor said. ``Dr. Cockrum will take us to \n     stellar heights and allow us to do things we've never done \n     before.''\n       Taylor believes that choosing Cockrum to follow in his \n     steps will help the university continue to flourish after \n     he's left campus and moved to the Sunshine State. He notes \n     that Cockrum has been with the university for nearly a \n     decade, and has seen firsthand the work Cockrum is capable \n     of.\n       ``You know, this profession is filled with talkers. But, he \n     delivers. He's about the best I've seen,'' Taylor said of \n     Cockrum. ``I feel like all we've done is built the foundation \n     and he's going to let this rocket ship fly.''\n       While Cockrum is preparing to blast off into his new \n     presidential role, Taylor will take the time to ponder upon \n     his years with the university.\n       ``It's time for relaxation and reflection,'' Taylor said. \n     ``I'm grateful for my wife who has allowed me to do what \n     needed to be done in terms of promoting the institution. It's \n     fulfilled this opportunity to serve. It's been a blessing. \n     It's fulfilled our lifelong dreams. Few people get to live \n     out their dreams--I was fortunate to be able to do that.''\n       Taylor has already thought of a few words of advice to the \n     university he leaves behind, though.\n       ``You have to have a moral compass, a true north.

But he will be back to visit; he's not ready \n     to leave Williamsburg completely behind.\n       ``I'll come back some because our son is buried here, and \n     we'll have a home here,'' Taylor said. ``But we'll come in \n     for the holidays and things like that. We'll come in for some \n     ball games.''\n       As a final note, Taylor quotes a line of Shakespeare to sum \n     up his time with the university and his pending retirement.\n       ``The crown rests heavy on the head of the king,'' Taylor \n     said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/18/senate-section/article/S6083-2", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6083-S6084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING MARK PRATER\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Mark Prater, \ndeputy staff director and chief tax counsel for the minority staff of \nthe Senate Finance Committee.\n  Later this week, the Tax Foundation will award Mark their Exemplar of \nExcellence in Public Service Award for his many years of service on the \nFinance Committee. He will be only the second congressional staffer to \nbe honored by the Tax Foundation in their 77-year history. And, I can \nsay without\n\n[[Page S6084]]\n\nany reservation that no staffer is more worthy of such an honor.\n  After several years in private law practice in his native Oregon, \nMark came to work for the Finance Committee in January 1990. At that \ntime, Mark thought he would stay for just 2 years and return home. \nFortunately for all of us, Mark has been on the Finance Committee staff \nfor nearly 25 years now.\n  Over these years, he has served with great distinction and has come \nto be one of the most trusted and respected staffers on Capitol Hill. \nIndeed, it seems that everyone in Washington knows Mark Prater and \nseeks him out for advice on tax policy.\n  Perhaps most importantly, Mark is a kind person who treats everyone \nwith respect. Honestly, he would be the last person to seek out this \ntype of honor, usually opting to share credit for his successes with \nthose he works with.\n  Mark has worked for a number of prominent chairmen and ranking \nmembers on the Finance Committee, including Bob Packwood, William Roth, \nand Chuck Grassley. But, while he is always worked for Republican \nMembers, Senators on both sides of the aisle have come to rely on \nMark's experience and expertise. This was never more evident than in \n2011 when Mark was tapped to serve as the staff director for the Joint \nSelect Committee on Deficit Reduction.\n  For the past 4 years, I have had the privilege of having Mark on my \nFinance Committee staff and I have been a direct beneficiary of his \nknowledge and understanding of not only the Tax Code but of how things \ncan and should work in the Senate. You see, Mark is one of the few \nstaffers who have been around long enough to remember a time when \nthings used to get done around here. In fact, Tax Notes recently \npublished the results of their survey about congressional tax staffers \nin which Mark was named the best dealmaker and the top Republican tax \nstaffer. I have no doubt that, in the future, his work will be \ninstrumental to helping restore the traditions and productivity of this \nChamber.\n  I want to congratulate Mark for this tremendous honor from the Tax \nFoundation, along with his wonderful family--his wife Lori and his son \nJames--who should enjoy this honor along with him.\n  Selfishly, I hope that Mark has many more years of honorable service \nhere in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/18/senate-section/article/S6084-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, today, I wish to recognize and honor the \nextraordinary service and ultimate sacrifice of Indianapolis \nMetropolitan Police Officer Rod Bradway. Dedicated, loyal, and above \nall compassionate to those in need, Officer Bradway had served with the \nIndianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, IMPD, since 2007.\n  On Friday, September 20, 2013, Officer Bradway responded to a \ndomestic disturbance call at Eagle Pointe Apartments in Indianapolis. \nUpon arriving, he heard a woman screaming for help from inside her \napartment, where she was being held against her will. Officer Bradway \nquickly called for backup, and without hesitation, forced his way into \nthe apartment. Upon entering, he was immediately shot twice by a \nperpetrator who waited in ambush. Although severely wounded, Bradway \nreturned fire and injured the shooter before assisting officers \narrived. This courageous effort disabled the shooter, avoiding a second \nambush. In addition, the woman whom Officer Bradway was rushing to aid, \nalong with her 10-month-old child, emerged safely, largely due to his \nimmediate response and selfless action. Sadly, despite the best efforts \nof his fellow officers, EMTs, and medical personnel, Officer Bradway, \n41, succumbed to his wounds.\n  ``When I heard he was the first in, I wasn't surprised,'' said \nMelissa Watkins, a friend and colleague. According to many of his peers \nand IMPD family members, Officer Bradway always wanted to be the first \nthrough the door, ready to help.\n  An Indiana native, Officer Bradway grew up in Nappanee, where he \nattended NorthWood High School. Known for his outgoing, gregarious \npersonality, athleticism, and concern for others, Rod participated on \nboth the track and football teams. Many of his high school coaches \nremembered Rod as athletic and willing to help others. Former coach Jon \nAndrews said, ``I think he loved people and loved athletics, and both \nof those traits showed up in the way he built his life.'' Rod graduated \nfrom NorthWood High School in 1991.\n  Following college, Officer Bradway moved to the Indianapolis area \nwhere he joined the Wayne Township Fire Department. He served for 10 \nyears, and while there, he met the love of his life, Jamie, who worked \nat the Department as an Emergency Medical Technician. They married and \nhad two children, Jonathan and Sierra.\n  Officer Bradway was a highly decorated policeman who served on the \nIMPD for 5 years. In February 2012, he received the Medal of Bravery, \nwith which he was honored for apprehending a man who was wielding a \nknife and threatening others.\n  In addition to his service to his fellow citizens, Rod was an active \nsupporter of animal rescue efforts. He and his wife traveled to Moore, \nOK, following the deadly tornado of May 2013 to help locate and gather \ndisplaced pets. Together, they delivered hundreds of pounds of pet \nfood, crates, leashes, and other supplies for pets or local animal \nshelters.\n  Officer Bradway is survived and deeply missed by his wife Jamie; his \nson Jonathan; daughter Sierra; his parents Thomas and Sheri Bradway; \nbrother Chip (Shelley) Bradway; mother and father-in-law Teresa and \nRonald Gentry; sister-in-law Jaclyn (Donald) Gentry; nieces Ella \nBradway and Kaylee Millard; nephew Conner Millard; as well as many \nother relatives and friends, the IMPD family, the Wayne Township Fire \nDepartment family, and Hoosiers throughout the State.\n  Officer Bradway loved his work, and he gave his life to serve and \nprotect the Citizens of Indianapolis. Although he would have never \nthought of himself as a hero, Officer Bradway demonstrated his \ncharacter daily by conducting himself with courage, bravery, \ncompassion, honor, and integrity. Thus, he was a true American hero--in \nhis everyday life as a police officer, husband and father--and in his \nfinal call to duty. Let us always remember and emulate the shining \nexample this stalwart, modest yet brave man set for us and honor him \nfor his selfless commitment to serving his fellow citizens. May God \nwelcome him home and give comfort to his family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/18/senate-section/article/S6084-3", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6084-S6085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING SIGNATURE SCHOOL\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY.

Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating the 2014 World Series champions, the San Francisco \nGiants. By defeating the Kansas City Royals in a fiercely contested and \nexhilarating World Series, the Giants became the second team in the \nstoried history of the National League to win three World Series in a \nfive-season span.\n  Led by manager Bruce Bochy and general manager Brian Sabean, this \noutstanding roster of all-stars, unflappable veterans, and exciting \nyoung talent showed great resolve, determination, and character as they \nbattled a tough National League Western Division to emerge with 88 wins \nand a spot in the playoffs.\n  The Giants began their title march by shutting out the Pittsburgh \nPirates 8-to-0 in the one-game National League Wildcard game. In the \nNational League Division Series, the Giants showed their championship \npedigree by winning several tightly contested games against the \nWashington Nationals that included a thrilling 18-inning marathon, the \nlongest in postseason history. In the National League Championship \nSeries, the Giants captured the pennant by defeating the St. Louis \nCardinals, four games to one.\n  Driven by the historic performance of pitcher Madison Bumgarner, \nWorld Series MVP, and with contributions from every player on the \nroster, the Giants triumphed over the Kansas City Royals in a hard-\nfought, seven-game series. This team battled to win a game seven that \ncame down to the last pitch of the ninth inning when third baseman \nPablo Sandoval caught the final out--making the Giants the first team \nin 35 years to win game seven on the road.\n  With a combination of excellent pitching, great defense and clutch \nhitting, the Giants are bringing the World Series trophy back to China \nBasin for the third time in five seasons. They have evolved from the \n2010 championship team that was fondly described as ``a band of \nmisfits'' to a team that has etched themselves into baseball history. \nWith this eighth World Series title--their third in five seasons--the \nSan Francisco Giants have taken their rightful place among the nation's \ngreatest franchises and chief executive officer Larry Baer and the \nentire Giants organization should be very proud.\n  I also want to congratulate the loyal San Francisco Giants fans, who \nhave supported their team through good years and bad, and from the \nwindy Candlestick Park to the picturesque AT Park. Whether it is \nnearly 42,000 fans turning the stadium into a sea of orange on an \n``Orange Friday'' or wearing panda hats for Pablo Sandoval or bringing \nfunny Hunter Pence signs, Giants fans have created an electric \natmosphere at AT Park and provided its team with one of the most \nformidable home park advantages in all of baseball.\n  As the San Francisco Giants and their fans celebrate the 2014 \nchampionship campaign, I congratulate them on their unforgettable \nseason and look forward to their continued success in 2015 and \nbeyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/18/senate-section/article/S6085-3", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6085-S6086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ALAN DERSHOWITZ\n\n Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nhonor a great teacher today.\n  His name is Alan Dershowitz. For half a century he was a professor at \nthe Harvard Law School. He retired in December of 2013.\n  From all those students who were so fortunate to learn from him, \nincluding myself, let us say thank you.\n  Professor Dershowitz joined Harvard Law in 1964--at the tender age of \n25--and during his time there, he trained more than 10,000 students in \nmore than 100 semesters to be critical thinkers, lawyers, judges, and \nleaders.\n  Aside from being an incredible teacher, he is known as many things: \nadvocate, columnist, novelist, and intellectual.\n  He is a passionate liberal, and yet he pressed all his students--\nconservative and liberal alike--to make the very best arguments they \ncould, based on logic, reason, and precedent.\n  Like Professor Kingsbury in ``The Paper Chase,'' he didn't suffer \nfools. If you couldn't back up your position in his class, if you \nemoted rather than reasoned, you were in trouble.\n  He and I became friends, ironically, because we disagreed so much. In \nclass, he would offer withering critiques of opinions authored by \nconservative Justices, Scalia and Thomas especially, and I was often \nmoved to disagree. Heated arguments followed, which Professor \nDershowitz always seemed to relish.\n\n[[Page S6086]]\n\n  I am grateful for his patience and indulgence. As with countless law \nstudents before and after, Professor Dershowitz made me a much better \nlawyer.\n  He didn't just teach; he also practiced, in trial courts and the \nSupreme Court, taking on ``impossible'' cases and winning one after \nanother. Truly, it was a privilege to learn from someone practicing at \nthe very top of his field.\n  Although a man of the left, he did not shy away from disagreeing with \nhis liberal colleagues when principle compelled it. A passionate \nadvocate for free speech, he fearlessly took on the political \ncorrectness of campus speech codes. No conformist, he.\n  And there has been no fiercer advocate for Israel. His passion, his \npersuasiveness, his willingness to take on all comers, has made him an \nincomparable voice for the Jewish State.\n  Professor Dershowitz is an intellectual powerhorse who could have \ndone anything in his life, and he made the deliberate decision to \nteach. He chose to share his brilliance and pass it on. He chose to \ninvest in the future of others instead of only himself.\n  I am so grateful that I could be among the thousands of students \nProfessor Dershowitz taught. He has made and continues to make a real \ndifference.\n  Courage and principle are rare today. Professor Dershowitz has them \nboth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/18/senate-section/article/S6086-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING MIKE CARRIGAN\n\n Mr. HELLER.

It gives me great pleasure to congratulate him on \nhis retirement after many years of hard work and dedication to the City \nof Sparks and the Silver State.\n  Councilman Carrigan stands as a shining example of someone who has \ndevoted their life to serving their country and community. Graduating \nfrom the Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD, he went on to serve in the \nU.S. Navy for 20 years as a naval aviator around the world. I extend my \ndeepest gratitude to Councilman Carrigan for his courageous \ncontributions to the United States of America and to freedom-loving \nnations around the world. His service to his country and his bravery \nand dedication earn him a place among the outstanding men and women who \nhave valiantly defended our Nation. I am both humbled and honored by \nCouncilman Carrigan's service to the community and am proud to call him \na fellow Nevadan.\n  After his many years of service, Councilman Carrigan moved to Nevada \nin the early 1990s with his wife Cora and their two daughters Ashley \nand Molly. He attended the University of Nevada, Reno and earned his \nmaster's degree in journalism and soon began work as a newspaperman in \nFallon. With his experience and expertise, Councilman Carrigan began \nteaching part-time in the Reynolds School of Journalism at his alma \nmater, where he taught journalism courses for several years. His desire \nto make positive changes in his community soon led to his first run and \nsubsequent win in office on Sparks' City Council.\n  Upon being elected to the Sparks City Council in 1999, he has worked \non numerous projects for the City of Sparks and has always strived to \nensure that Sparks stayed family-oriented. Councilman Carrigan has \nremained committed to being a voice for the people of Sparks and has \nbeen a constant advocate for initiatives that meet the needs of Sparks' \nfamilies. Among his many accomplishments, one of his proudest was the \nconstruction of Golden Eagle Regional Park in his ward, which was built \nwithout the use of taxpayer funds.\n  I am grateful for his dedication and commitment to the people of \nSparks and to the State of Nevada. He exemplifies the highest standards \nof leadership and community service and should be proud of his long and \nmeaningful career. Today, I ask that all of my colleagues join me in \ncongratulating Councilman Carrigan on his retirement, and I offer my \ndeepest appreciation for all that he has done to make Nevada an even \nbetter place.

Steve Baccus is a native Kansan, a \nveteran, a husband, a father of five, and a grandfather whose fourth-\ngeneration family farm in Ottawa County continues to produce wheat, \ncorn, soybeans, and occasionally sunflowers and sorghum.\n  For the past 17 years, Steve has served on the board of directors for \nKansas Farm Bureau, including the last 12 as its president. Kansas Farm \nBureau is our State's largest general farm organization, with nearly \n105,000 members. Under his leadership the organization has successfully \ninfluenced State and national agriculture policy, promoted rural \nvalues, and worked to show an increasingly urban populace how food is \ntruly produced.\n  In addition to his service as president of the Kansas Farm Bureau, \nSteve Baccus has been a true partner in government. He has led trade \nmissions, presented testimony before Congress and State legislative \ncommittees, and told the complex story of agriculture for much of his \nadult life.\n  Steve Baccus embodies many traits we can all admire: a deep love for \nthe great State of Kansas, gratitude for the many hard-working families \nwho provide the food, fuel, and fiber Americans rely on, and the \nrespect of his peers across the Nation.\n  I personally am grateful for Steve's many years of wise counsel to me \nand for his service to Kansas and agriculture. I wish him and his wife \nPatricia all the best in their next chapter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/18/senate-section/article/S6086-4", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6086-S6087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TREATY OF 1864 ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, 150 years ago, on October 14, 1864, \nthe Federal Government signed a treaty with the Klamath, Modoc, and \nYahooskin Indian Tribes in the Klamath Basin establishing these tribes \ncollectively as ``The Klamath Tribes'' and designating the Klamath \nReservation in Southern Oregon.\n  I would like to recognize this historic event and acknowledge the \ngreat contributions made by the Klamath Tribes\n\n[[Page S6087]]\n\nto the State of Oregon. As we commemorate the anniversary of the Treaty \nof 1864, it is also important to recognize the strained relations and \nbroken promises that dot the history of the Federal Government's \nrelationship with the tribes. This is a time to reflect on the Federal \nGovernment's obligation to these sovereign nations and celebrate the \nrich history and promising futures they bring to this great country.\n  The Klamath, Modoc, and Yahooskin Tribes have a rich history in my \nState. Today the Klamath Tribes contributes significantly to Oregon's \nhistory, cultural diversity, and economy. Oregon tribes are active in a \nvariety of industries, with positive economic impacts felt far beyond \nthe reservation boundaries.\n  Recently, Oregonians had the opportunity to learn first-hand the \nhistory and culture of the Klamath Tribes. To recognize and celebrate \nthe anniversary of the treaty, the Klamath County Museum provided free \ntours, giving visitors a unique opportunity to visit the historical \nsite near Fort Klamath where the treaty was signed and to learn about \nthe rich and storied past of the Klamath Tribes.\n  I am pleased to recognize the anniversary of the signing of the \nTreaty of 1864 and to ensure that this historic event is remembered as \nan important part of Oregon's past, and a lesson for the Nation's \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/18/senate-section/article/S6087-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:57 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 885.

A bill to require the president of the Federal Reserve Bank \nof New York to be appointed by the President, by and with the advice \nand consent of the Senate; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould require the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to be \nPresidentially appointed and Senate confirmed.\n  In 2010, I worked to include similar language in the Senate version \nof the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, but this \nprovision was ultimately not included in the final version of this law.\n  At the time, I noted that, ``if the Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem in Washington are required to be confirmed by the Senate, then \nthe President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who played a \npivotal and perhaps more powerful role in obligating taxpayer dollars \nduring the financial crisis, should also be subject to the same public \nconfirmation process.''\n  As the response to the financial crisis showed, the New York Fed is \nunlike any of the other eleven regional Federal Reserve Banks.\n  For instance, along with the seven Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem who each require Senate confirmation, the president of the New \nYork Fed is not only a permanent member of the Federal Open Market \nCommittee, FOMC, but also acts as the FOMC's Vice Chairman. This is an \nimportant distinction because the FOMC establishes the Federal Reserve \nSystem's monetary policy, which in the wake of the financial crisis \nresulted in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet growing to almost five \ntimes what it was before the crisis in an attempt to reduce long-term \ninterest rates.\n  Additionally, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is solely \nresponsible for implementing an aspect of monetary policy known as open \nmarket operations through which U.S. Treasury securities are purchased \nand sold on a secondary basis to influence the levels of bank reserves. \nIn other words, this means that the New York Fed is in a position to \npick and choose its counterparties in these secondary market\n\n[[Page S6097]]\n\ntransactions, giving significant advantages to one market maker over \nanother, which raises the potential for conflicts of interest.\n  Also, the New York Fed is entrusted with protecting the U.S. dollar \nin foreign exchange markets.\n  According to the New York Fed itself, ``though it serves a \ngeographically small area compared with those of other Federal Reserve \nBanks, the New York Fed is the largest Reserve Bank in terms of assets \nand volume of activity.'' Indeed, the New York Fed in its regulatory \ncapacity is not only in charge of supervising some of the largest banks \nin the country, but also some of the most active financial \ninstitutions.\n  While this is not an exhaustive list of the New York Fed's unique \nresponsibilities, these examples demonstrate the extremely powerful and \npivotal role the New York Fed plays in implementing our Nation's \nmonetary policy and enforcing our banking laws. As such, we should have \nevery expectation that the New York Fed has the public interest in mind \nto the fullest extent when it conducts its duties.\n  Unfortunately, these expectations have not been met. Last month, the \nOffice of Inspector General, OIG, of the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System described the New York Fed's oversight efforts \nwith respect to one large banking institution that eventually suffered \nbillions of dollars in trading losses as a ``missed opportunity.'' On \ntop of this, a report aired in September on the public radio program \n``This American Life'' cast doubt on whether changes the New York Fed \nmade after the financial collapse to address regulatory capture were \nsufficient to ensure the New York Fed would be a more proactive banking \nregulator and could prevent a future financial disaster.\n  All of this is disturbing, and it is past time that we add meaningful \nlayers of accountability in order to prevent another problem from \nsnowballing into a crisis because of the New York Fed's continued \nunwillingness to address potential financial pitfalls in advance.\n  By subjecting the president of the New York Fed to the confirmation \nprocess, an important check and balance will be added. The Senate will \nhave a vital opportunity to evaluate whether a nominee has the \nexperience, character, judgment, and skills to serve effectively as one \nof the most powerful banking regulators in the country, if not the \nworld. In addition, this legislation requires the New York Fed \npresident to testify before the Senate Banking Committee and the House \nFinancial Services Committee at least once a year, so that Congress no \nlonger has to negotiate about whether and when the New York Fed \npresident will appear before Congress for oversight hearings. Simply \nput, this legislation is about holding the New York Fed accountable. \nThe New York Fed is just too powerful to be left unchecked.\n  I thank Americans for Financial Reform, Public Citizen, and the AFL-\nCIO for their support, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in \nmoving this legislation forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/18/senate-section/article/S6097-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 581--HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF THE LATE STAFF \n                     SERGEANT ROBERT HENRY ANDERSON\n\n  Mr. McCAIN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Armed Services:\n\n                              S.
