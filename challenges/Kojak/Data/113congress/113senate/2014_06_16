It says a lot. It was written by Emma Lazarus.\n\n     Give me your tired, your poor,\n     Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\n     The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\n     Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me.\n\n  Those words encapsulate what is good about America. Those few lines \nrepresent the very makeup of this great country.\n  Over its history our Nation has welcomed the tired and poor of the \nworld and made them strong. We have opened our doors to the best the \nworld has to offer, and the United States has become better for it. Our \ncountry is a melting pot. Every aspect of our society reflects that, \nespecially our athletes and soccer in particular.\n  I can remember when my middle son came home one night--he was just a \nboy; I assume he was maybe 10 years old--and he said, ``I want to play \nsoccer.''\n  I said, ``What?''\n  ``I want to play soccer.''\n  Soccer was not much of a sport in Nevada at that time. I thought, you \nknow, if you are going to be an athlete, you have to play football, \nbasketball, baseball, run track, high jump, long jump.\n  ``I want to play soccer,'' he said.\n\n[[Page S3676]]\n\n  OK. And play soccer he did. That began for me a great education, and \nit was so good for my son Leif, my middle boy. They had a great team. \nMy wife and I started going to the games and learning about soccer. It \nwas so much fun. When we moved back here, he was a freshman in high \nschool and suffered a very badly broken leg playing soccer, so his \ncareer ended there.\n  My next boy was a baseball player.\n  My youngest boy was a gifted athlete. I boasted about him for many \nyears. He was a soccer player, and he also played basketball. He played \nsoccer on two national championship teams for the University of \nVirginia. By the time he went there, I had watched hundreds of soccer \ngames. For him to play at this premier school with great athletes, \nplaying soccer across the country, was really an experience and, again, \nan education.\n  For example, one of my son's teammates was the famous Claudio Reyna. \nClaudio was so good. It was a team of many great athletes. My son was a \ngifted athlete and everybody on the team was good, but Claudio Reyna \nwas better than anyone.\n  Claudio's dad emigrated from Argentina. His mom was from a Portuguese \nfamily. They lived in New Jersey, where he was recruited to play for \nthe University of Virginia. My son came from a different background. \nHis grandfather was born in Russia, emigrated to the United States. His \ngrandmother on my wife's side had Lithuanian blood. My grandmother \nemigrated from England.\n\n  So he and Claudio were on that team, and it would be hard to find two \nyoung men with more different backgrounds than they. They were \nteammates.\n  Their other teammates had backgrounds that were similarly unusual, \ndifferent--a young man from Spain, one from Jamaica. An All-American \nnamed Damien Silvera was from Jamaica. These young men, 11 players--and \nsome who didn't play all the time--came from different cities and \ndifferent cultures, but they were one. They were a team. They were in \nrhythm, always united in purpose.\n  They were coached by the great Bruce Arena, a famous coach who \ncoached the Olympic team--in fact, coached one of the first \nchampionships here, playing for the Washington professional team here. \nHe is now coaching for L.A. They won the championship there many times. \nHe was good with a diverse group of men and women playing in sync. It \nwas really beautiful to watch. I guess that is why they call soccer the \nbeautiful game.\n  Tonight our men's soccer team will play Ghana in its first game--\nsince being twice knocked out by Ghana--in the 2014 World Cup.\n  The World Cup is special, watched by more people than the Olympics. \nIt comes around every 4 years, and Americans from all walks of life and \nall backgrounds watch together in support of our Nation's soccer team. \nBut our support for Team USA comes from more than just athletics. It is \nmore than just competition. I think we see a bit of ourselves in the \nteam. Our unique connection to the U.S. men's soccer players stems from \nthe team's composition. The roster is a reflection of America itself. \nIt is diverse, yet it is united. It is a reflection of us.\n  Our head coach Jurgen Klinsmann was a legendary soccer player. I can \nremember his playing in the World Cup. He was from Germany and played \nfor West Germany. He has lived in the United States for a number of \nyears.\n  One of the team's defenders is a man by the name of Omar Gonzalez--\nTexas-born, Mexican American--who played professionally in Los Angeles \nfor Bruce Arena.\n  Our striker, Aron Johannsson, is a 23-year-old Alabama-born Icelander \nwho plays in the Netherlands.\n  DaMarcus Beasley is the team's 32-year-old veteran defender from \nIndiana, who plays professionally in Mexico.\n  Jermaine Jones, who plays midfield, is the German-born son of an \nAmerican soldier and plays professionally in Turkey.\n  These are just a number of examples. There are so many more. The \nentire roster is an illustration of America's diversity. We are, after \nall, a nation of immigrants.\n  Under Klinsmann's direction, these players will bring their unique \ntalents and experiences from across the world and coalesce under one \nflag--the American flag. I wish the team all the best tonight against \nGhana. I will be watching and cheering on the team.\n  Another reason I love soccer: You don't have all those advertisements \ninterrupting the game. It is a free-flowing athletic contest. There is \nthe background of announcers talking about what just took place, and \nsometimes we don't fully understand it, but the game goes for 45 \nminutes and then another 45 minutes, for a total of 90 minutes, plus \nwhatever penalty time they get--an extra 3 to 5 minutes after the 45 \nminutes is up--not interrupted by commercials.\n  So I admit I will be watching and cheering on the game. I hope our \ncolleagues do the same, and I have confidence they will. When we do \nwatch this team out there, watch what our team represents, what America \nstands for. See what makes this great country of ours so special. The \nUnited States really has given refuge to the tired, the poor, the \nhuddled masses of the world, and they have become strong Americans, and \nwe as a nation are better for it.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  Mr. President, I would ask the Chair to announce the business of the \nday.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I hope the Presiding Officer and my \ncolleagues had a great Father's Day this past Sunday. I had maybe the \nbest Father's Day you can imagine because I got to spend part of it \nwith my two sons and my father. We all went out to dinner with my wife, \nand it was a really special day.\n  I come to the floor with both a light and heavy heart, light because \nI got to experience Father's Day in a way I wish thousands of other \npeople across the country could experience it. The statistics of the \nnumber of people who are killed by guns every year is pretty stunning. \nThere are tens of thousands of people all across this country who are \nlosing their fathers and sons, in part because the Senate doesn't do \nanything to try to stem the scourge of gun violence across the country.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, I try to come to the floor every week \nfor about 10 minutes or so to try and give voice to the victims of gun \nviolence.\n  Today, 24 hours having passed Father's Day, maybe we can talk a \nlittle bit about those who have lost their fathers and their sons--\nlittle boys such as Logan Soldo.\n  Logan is about to turn 1. He certainly doesn't know what happened to \nhis father Igor, but when he is old enough, unfortunately he will hear \na pretty horrific story. His father--having fled war-torn Bosnia as a \n13-year-old to settle in the United States--was killed in a shooting at \na Walmart, which got a lot of attention about a week or so ago.\n  Jared and Amanda Miller--fairly well-known radicals in the Las Vegas \narea--walked into a Walmart and shot Igor Soldo, a police officer, \nwhile he was eating at a restaurant.\n  People talked about Igor and his journey. As I mentioned, he came \nhere from the Balkans when he was 13 years old and graduated from \nSoutheast High School in Lincoln, NE. Following high school, he studied \ncriminal justice at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and worked part \ntime as a corrections officer for 3 years in Lincoln where he met his \nwife Andrea. The couple were married in 2009. They were planning on \ncelebrating their son's first birthday. His birthday will be on July 7. \nThey\n\n[[Page S3677]]\n\nwere going to return from Las Vegas to Lincoln to celebrate it with \nfriends and family, but instead Igor's family ventured and journeyed \nfrom Lincoln to Las Vegas to bid farewell to their son, who was a \npolice officer killed in this episode of horrific violence which killed \ntwo others and eventually also led to the death of the two shooters.\n  One of his fellow officers, who was one of Igor's close buddies, told \nthe story at his funeral about how close Igor was to his son. He said, \nthrough tears, to the crowd:\n\n       I started getting pictures of Igor and Logan. I would see \n     him with Logan over at the house and it was clear . . . our \n     once epic romance was being replaced.\n\n  Logan Soldo will never know his dad, but there are thousands who lose \ntheir sons every year.\n  Over the weekend some of my colleagues might have had a chance to \nread an op-ed in the Washington Post written by Mark Barden and David \nWheeler. Mark and David lost their sons, Daniel and Ben, in Sandy Hook. \nThey talked about what Father's Day has become. They said:\n\n       We know Father's Day is meant to be a day when fathers sit \n     back on their couches, watch sports and take it easy. But \n     this Father's Day, we ask you to do one thing differently. \n     Look at your children, your beautiful, growing, pesky \n     children who bring you so much joy and sometimes cause you so \n     much heartache, and ask yourself--really ask yourself--this: \n     Am I doing everything I can to keep them safe? Because the \n     answer to that question, if we all answer honestly, clearly \n     is no.\n\n  Of course, that is the answer here in the Senate because we have \nwitnessed over 70 school shootings since Sandy Hook. There were 35 \nschool shootings this year alone, and we are not even halfway through \nthe year. There are 31,000 people a year--2,600 people a month, 86 \npeople a day--who are killed by guns, and we do nothing.\n  We tried to pass a pretty simple bill that would expand the number of \nsales that would be subjected to a background check--supported by 80 \npercent of the American public--on the floor of this Senate, but \nbecause of a Republican filibuster, we could not get it to a final \nvote. The numbers are clearly not moving people, so hopefully the \nstories will, stories such as that of one particular father who has \nbecome the face, in many ways, of the Sandy Hook tragedy, Neil Heslin.\n  Many people have heard Mr. Heslin talk because he probably talks in \nthe most poignant, open, soul-baring terms of any of the parents.\n  Twenty-four hours removed from Father's Day--which many of us got to \nspend with our dads and our kids--I will leave you with the words from \nNeil Heslin's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee:\n\n       On December 14, Jesse got up and got ready for school. He \n     was always excited to go to school. I remember on that day we \n     stopped by Misty Vale Deli. It's funny the things you \n     remember. I remember the hug he gave me when I dropped him \n     off. He just held me, and he rubbed my back. I can still feel \n     that hug.\n       And Jesse said, ``It's going to be alright. Everything's \n     going to be okay, Dad.'' Looking back it makes me wonder. \n     What did he know? Did he have some idea about what was going \n     to happen? But at the time I didn't think much of it. He was \n     just being sweet.\n       He was always being sweet like that. He was the kind of kid \n     who used to leave me voice messages where he'd sing me happy \n     birthday even if it wasn't my birthday. I'd ask him about it, \n     and he'd say, ``I just wanted to make you feel happy.'' Half \n     the time I felt like he was the parent and I was his son.\n\n  Taking a break from Neil's testimony for a second, this was Neil's \nonly family. He was separated from his wife. Neil has been unemployed, \nbopping between different housing situations. His entire family--his \nentire life--was his son Jesse.\n  Neil went on to say:\n\n       Jesse just had this idea that you never leave people hurt. \n     If you can help somebody, you do it. If you can make somebody \n     feel better, you do it. If you can leave somebody a little \n     better off, you do it.\n       They tell me that's how he died.\n       When he heard the shooting--at Sandy Hook Elementary School \n     that day--he didn't run and hide. He started yelling. People \n     disagree on the last thing he said. One person who was there \n     said he yelled ``run.'' Another person said he told everybody \n     to ``run now.''\n       What I know is that Jesse wasn't shot in the back. He took \n     two bullets. The first one grazed off the side of his head, \n     but that didn't stop him from yelling. The other hit him in \n     the forehead. Both bullets were fired from the front.\n       I hate to say it but even when you know your community has \n     been hit, you hope and pray it wasn't your boy. They had us \n     all to go to a fire station to wait and see if our kids would \n     make it out of the school. By 3:30, maybe 4 o'clock, they \n     told us there were no more survivors. I should have realized. \n     They'd basically told me my son was dead, but I waited. I \n     told the people what to look for, what he'd been wearing that \n     day. He had this striped shirt and Carhartt jacket, and these \n     pants that fit him in September, but then he hit a growth \n     spurt. I gave the description and I waited some more. I \n     waited and I hoped, until 1:30 in the morning. That's when \n     they told me he wasn't coming.\n\n  Breaking away from his testimony again for a second, I was at that \nfire house, and I will never forget the scene of Neil Heslin sitting by \nhimself hour after hour.\n  Returning to his testimony, he concludes by saying:\n\n       Before he died, Jesse and I used to talk about maybe coming \n     to Washington some day. He wanted to go to the Washington \n     Monument. When he talked about it last year, Jesse asked if \n     we could come and meet the President.\n       I said earlier that I can be a little cynical about \n     politicians. But Jesse believed in you.\n\n  This is Neil talking to us.\n\n       He learned about you in school and he believed in you. I \n     want to believe in you, too. I know you can't give me Jesse \n     back. Believe me, if I thought you could I'd be asking you \n     for that. But I want to believe that you will think about \n     what I told you here today. I want to believe you'll think \n     about it and then you'll do something about it, whatever you \n     can do to make sure no other father has to see what I've \n     seen.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, when I first exercised congressional \noversight of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program in 2010--at that \ntime I was the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee--I \nsaw a program in turmoil. Perhaps the most significant indication of \nthat was that while the program had exploded from its original overly \noptimistic development cost estimates by more than $15 billion and was \ndelayed by 5 years, without the prospect of delivering needed \nwarfighting capability anywhere on the horizon, the program's prime \ncontractor consistently received most of those award fees that were \navailable to it under its contracts with the government. Let me repeat. \nThe contractor continued to receive award fees that were supposed to be \ngiven in case of the program meeting certain milestones. In fact, it \nexceeded the cost estimates by $15 billion and was delayed by 5 years.\n  Since 2010 major challenges have continued to arise. Just days ago \nthe Department of Defense grounded the entire F-35 fleet because of an \nin-flight emergency involving a leak of engine oil. This is the second \ngrounding of the F-35 fleet due to engine problems in the last 16 \nmonths.\n  Much work remains to be done in the program, including validating \ndesign and operational performance; installing state-of-the-art flight \nand combat software programs--those programs are still being written--\nand making the F-35 affordable, with life-cycle costs estimated at more \nthan $1 trillion--the first weapons system in the history of this \ncountry that is estimated to cost $1 trillion. While the Government \nAccountability Office has said the program is ``moving in the right \ndirection,'' this is clearly a program that has had and continues to \nhave major problems.\n  With this in mind, I was greatly concerned when I read an article \nlast week entitled ``Carter: JSF Program Manager Based F-35 Award Fees \non Desire to Protect Lockheed Exec.'' It was on InsideDefense.com. The \narticle describes comments made by former Deputy Secretary of Defense \nand Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and \nLogistics Ashton Carter--a man I admire a great deal--in a speech at \nHarvard University on May 16, 2014. He revealed that while the Joint \nStrike Fighter Program was suffering from massive cost growth and\n\n[[Page S3678]]\n\nscheduling delays, the government's program manager for JSF \nconsistently awarded prime contractor Lockheed Martin most of its \navailable award fees due to concern about the job security of his \nLockheed Martin counterpart.\n  Appropriately, the Department of Defense fired its program manager, a \nMarine Corps two-star general, in February 2010. While that official \nhad been giving away millions of taxpayers' dollars to his friend in \nthe industry, regardless of how exceedingly poor the Joint Strike \nFighter Program was performing, independent cost estimates were \nbriefing the Pentagon that the Joint Strike Fighter Program might \nexceed its original budget estimates by as much as $60 billion.\n  To understand why the cost to procure these fighters exploded, then-\nDeputy Secretary of Defense Carter requested a breakdown of F-35 costs \nand challenged the program manager as to why he had been giving \nLockheed Martin upward of 85 percent of the maximum award fee it could \nhave earned. As Secretary Carter recounted, that official said:\n\n       I like the program manager on the Lockheed Martin side that \n     I work with. And he tells me that if he gets less than an 85-\n     percent award fee, he is going to get fired.\n\n  This is totally unacceptable. It is the kind of cronyism that should \nmake us all vigilant against, as President Eisenhower warned us over 50 \nyears ago, the ``military industrial complex.'' In this case, it \nappears taxpayers paid a massive premium for the friendship between the \ngovernment's and the contractor's program managers. As disturbing as \nthese recent revelations are, this incident also raises a few other \nquestions. For example, why were award fee criteria that exposed those \nJoint Strike Fighter Program contracts to the risk of being abused in \nexactly this way originally negotiated into that contract? Why would \nthe contract allow such a thing?\n  Where was this program manager's superiors, the Service Acquisition \nExecutive, and particularly on the Joint Strike Fighter Program the \nUnder Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Technology and Logistics? \nWhat about his superiors. Were they not supposed to be overseeing how \nand why he was awarding Lockheed Martin fees throughout the relevant \nperiod?\n  This whole episode underscores the importance of ethics in government \ncontracting. If the program manager or the program executive officers, \nsenior officials in the acquisition chain of command do not recognize \nthe fiduciary responsibility they have to the taxpayer in their \nstewardship of defense dollars, any attempt to reform the defense \nprocurement process or otherwise exercise vigilance vis-a-vis the \nmilitary industrial complex will fail.\n  This episode also emphasizes the importance of the trade craft of \ngovernment procurement contracting. Those skills and judgment that \ncomprise the trade craft of government procurement contracting provide \ngovernment acquisition managers with the tools he or she needs to keep \nthe ``unwarranted influence'' of the military industrial complex at bay \nand make sure the product or service to be delivered into his or her \nwatch will be delivered on time, with the required capability, and at a \nreasonable cost.\n  That starts with structuring government procurement contracts \nproperly so that given the nature of the work and the deliverables \nbeing placed on contract, one, exactly the kind of performance that is \nimportant to the government in a given program is being incentivized, \nand, two, the government is incentivizing its industry partner to \nrender that performance effectively. If in a given program the \nperformance that is important to us is cost control, as it should have \nbeen in the case of the Joint Strike Fighter Program development \ncontracts, why were we even using an award fee as opposed to an \nincentive fee contract?\n  By their very nature, incentive fee contracts provide that the cost \nof overruns be shared between industry and government and therefore \nincentivizes prime contractors to minimize them. This, of course, has \nnot been a problem that has been limited to the Joint Strike Fighter \nProgram. For years we have seen a widespread use of award fee \ncontracts, including those that support major defense acquisition \nprograms with subjective measures of award fees not clearly tied to \ncost control.\n  Any internal Department of Defense guidance that simply prescribes \nthe use of ``appropriate'' contract types that are not accompanied by \neffective guidance and training on exactly how contract types should be \ntailored to a given product or service should be viewed with \nskepticism.\n  This matter, and indeed the broader possibility that the episode that \nDr. Carter alluded to in his speech may be more pervasive throughout \nthe whole of government than we realize and should concern all \ncongressional committees of jurisdiction, inspectors general, and \nAmericans who value how their taxpayer dollars are being used.\n  I repeat: As a proud supporter of our Nation's defense, as an \noutspoken opponent of sequestration and the damage it is doing to our \nNation and our ability to defend it, when we look at a program such as \nthis, where it exceeded its original cost estimates by more than $15 \nbillion and more than 5 years of delay and there are still problems \nwith the most expensive weapons system in history, and the first time \n$1 trillion is being spent on one weapons system, we need to do a lot \nbetter.\n  One of the actions that has to be taken, which has not been taken, is \nholding people accountable. I remember talking at a hearing and asking \nthe Chief of Naval Operations about the USS Gerald R. Ford, their \nbrandnew aircraft carrier. It had a $3 billion cost overrun. I asked \nthe Chief of Naval Operations who was responsible. The Chief of Naval \noperations said he did not know. That is absolutely unacceptable.\n  So what we are doing by these terrible cost overruns--and the list \ngoes on and on. I will come to the floor one of these days with a long \nlist of programs that did not even reach fruition, that were canceled, \nsuch as the Future Combat System Program that the Army was touting for \nmany years, for which we got zero return at a cost, as I recall, of \nover $3 billion.\n  Unless we fix this cost overrun problem, the American people will \nstop supporting spending money on defense. That is just a fact. It is \ntime we in Congress exercised much greater oversight, much greater \nscrutiny, much greater questioning, both before, during, and after the \nacquisition process. I strongly recommend the work of inspectors \ngeneral. I strongly recommend using the Government Accountability \nOffice, which is one of our most important tools. I strongly recommend \nusing committee staffs and sending them to the places where these \nweapons systems are being assembled to get detailed briefings because \nthis has to stop. I am getting a little bit repetitious over the years \nsaying it has to stop, but when we look at the strains and the \nchallenges around this globe that are taking place now, from the China \nSea to Iraq, we are going to have to have a strong national defense. We \ncannot have that with these outrageous and unacceptable cost overruns.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I previously filed budgetary aggregates \nand committee allocations for budget year 2015 pursuant to section 116 \nof the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Today, I am adjusting those \nlevels.\n  Section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \nof 1985 establishes statutory limits on discretionary spending and \nallows for various adjustments to those limits, while sections 302 and \n314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act allows the Chairman of the \nBudget Committee to establish and make revisions to allocations, \naggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. On May 22, \nthe Committee on Appropriations reported one bill that is eligible for \nan adjustment under the Congressional Budget Act: the Agriculture, \nRural Development, FDA, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which \nincludes $100 million in budget authority and $43 million in outlays \nthat is designated as disaster funding.\n  Consequently, I am revising the budgetary aggregates for 2015 by a \ntotal of $100 million in budget authority and $43 million in outlays. I \nam also revising the budget authority and outlay allocations to the \nappropriations committee for 2015 by $100 million in nonsecurity budget \nauthority and $43 million in total outlays.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the \nchanges to the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations and the \nbudgetary aggregates be printed in the Record.\n  There being no

Mr. President, last week the Senate passed H.R. 3230, \nVeterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and \nTransparency Act. Today, I rise to address some concerns my colleagues \nraised about whether veterans will be able to choose their own \nproviders. Some may read section 301 of this bill to mean that VA is \nstill in the driver seat. Specifically, that VA will be able to pick \nand choose which provider to contract with under this section and not \noffer veterans a true choice of where and from whom they receive their \ncare. However, that is not our intent.\n  Our intent is to give veterans the choice of where and from whom they \nreceive their care without interference from VA. Beyond that, H.R. 3230 \nprovides that if a doctor or hospital approaches VA and states they \nwant to help alleviate the current access problems, VA would be \ndirected to contract with that doctor provided they participate in \nMedicare. Because this legislation requires VA to pay these providers \nat the Medicare rate, VA would be able to implement a standard contract \nfor the care and services veterans receive and would allow VA to \nexpeditiously implement a contract with that doctor and get veterans \nthe care they need as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/16/senate-section/article/S3681-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I wish to state for the record my strong \nsupport for S. 2450, the Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, \nAccountability, and Transparency Act of 2014. I also wish to state for \nthe record that, though I was unfortunately already traveling to my \nson's high school graduation in Oregon at the time the vote was called, \nI would have voted aye on this legislation had I been present.\n  I was among the original cosponsors of this bill because I believe \nstrongly that the VA system must do right by our veterans. Our veterans \nhave stood up for us, and we must stand up for them.\n  Recent reports highlight the urgent need both for greatly increased \naccountability within the VA health system and for greater resources to \nmeet the needs of increasing numbers of veterans who are turning to the \nVA for health care. The current situation of extremely long wait \ntimes--and in some cases, secret waiting lists--is 100 percent \nunacceptable and must be fixed. Those who are responsible for these \nfailings or any efforts to cover them up should swiftly lose their \njobs. If they broke the law, then they should be prosecuted as well. \nGoing forward, we must ensure that the VA system has the doctors and \nthe resources it needs to give our vets the timely, top-notch care they \ndeserve.\n  This bill gives the VA the power both to fire the administrators who \nneed to be held accountable and to hire the additional doctors and \nnurses needed to improve the system. In addition, it contains a \nbipartisan provision I have worked on with Senator Heller to expand \neducation benefits for spouses of servicemembers who die in the line of \nduty. These are important improvements for our veterans and their \nfamilies, and I am proud to support them.\n  I am very pleased to see this legislation move forward. I wish to \nonce again state again my strong support, and I urge the House to take \nup and pass this bill without delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/16/senate-section/article/S3681-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             2014 WORLD CUP\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n\n[[Page S3682]]\n\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and \nresidents of Clinton County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to secure funding in Clinton County worth over $25 \nmillion and has successfully acquired financial assistance from \nprograms I have fought hard to support, which have provided more than \n$26.5 million to the local economy.\n  Of course, my favorite memories of working together include working \ntirelessly with local law enforcement, particularly with regard to \nfunding to combat the scourge of drugs in the community, as well as \nnumerous major projects to improve infrastructure and transportation in \nthe community.\n  Among the highlights:\n  Investing in Iowa's economic development through targeted community \nprojects: In Eastern Iowa, we have worked together to grow the economy \nby making targeted investments in important economic development \nprojects including improved roads and bridges, modernized sewer and \nwater systems, and better housing options for residents of Clinton \nCounty. In many cases, I have secured Federal funding that has \nleveraged local investments and served as a catalyst for a whole ripple \neffect of positive, creative changes. For example, working with mayors, \ncity council members, and local economic development officials in \nClinton County, I have fought for more than $13.3 million to redevelop \nLiberty Square, more than $2.6 million for the 19th Avenue Connector, \n$2.1 million for trails between Clinton and Comanche, and more than $4 \nmillion for sewer infrastructure, helping to create jobs and expand \neconomic opportunities.\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Clinton County has received more than $1.6 million in Harkin \ngrants. Similarly, schools in Clinton County have received funds that I \ndesignated for Iowa Star Schools for technology totaling $145,000.\n  Disaster mitigation and prevention: In 1993, when historic floods \nripped through Iowa, it became clear to me that the national emergency-\nresponse infrastructure was woefully inadequate to meet the needs of \nIowans in flood-ravaged communities. I went to work dramatically \nexpanding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's hazard mitigation \nprogram, which helps communities reduce the loss of life and property \ndue to natural disasters and enables mitigation measures to be \nimplemented during the immediate recovery period. Disaster relief means \nmore than helping people and businesses get back on their feet after a \ndisaster, it means doing our best to prevent the same predictable flood \nor other catastrophe from recurring in the future. The hazard \nmitigation program that I helped create in 1993 provided critical \nsupport to Iowa communities impacted by the devastating floods of 2008. \nClinton County has received over $2.5 million to prevent tragedy \nassociated with natural disasters.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Clinton County has received more than $1.5 \nmillion from a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as, \nfor instance, the methamphetamine epidemic. Since 2001, Clinton \nCounty's fire departments have received over $3.1 million for \nfirefighter safety and operations equipment, and the law enforcement \ncommunity has received more than $77,000 in Byrne Justice Assistance \ngrants, $75,000 for drug free communities, $185,000 in funds dedicated \nto methamphetamine hot spots, and $15,000 to assist drug endangered \nchildren.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities.

Nearly a quarter century since \npassage of the ADA, I see remarkable changes in communities everywhere \nI go in Iowa--not just in curb cuts or closed captioned television, but \nin the full participation of people with disabilities in our society \nand economy, folks who at long last have the opportunity to contribute \ntheir talents and to be fully included. These changes have increased \neconomic opportunities for all citizens of Clinton County, both those \nwith and without disabilities. They make us proud to be a part of a \ncommunity and country that respects the worth and civil rights of all \nof our citizens.\n  This is at least a partial accounting of my work on behalf of Iowa, \nand specifically Clinton County, during my time in Congress. In every \ncase, this work has been about partnerships, cooperation, and \nempowering folks at the State and local level, including in Clinton \nCounty, to fulfill their own dreams and initiatives. And, of course, \nthis work is never complete. Even after I retire from the Senate, I \nhave no intention of retiring from the fight for a better, fairer, \nricher Iowa.

Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa \nlies in its vibrant local communities, where citizens come together to \nfoster economic development, make smart investments to expand \nopportunity, and take the initiative to improve the health and well-\nbeing of residents. Over the decades, I have witnessed the growth and \nrevitalization of so many communities across my State. And it has been \ndeeply gratifying to see how my work in Congress has supported these \nlocal efforts.\n  I have always believed in accountability for public officials, and \nthis, my final year in the Senate, is an appropriate time to give an \naccounting of my work across four decades representing Iowa in \nCongress. I take pride in accomplishments that have been national in \nscope--for instance, passing the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nspearheading successful farm bills. But I take a very special pride in \nprojects that have made a big difference in local communities across my \nState.\n  Today, I would like to give an accounting of my work with leaders and\n\n[[Page S3683]]\n\nresidents of Worth County to build a legacy of a stronger local \neconomy, better schools and educational opportunities, and a healthier, \nsafer community.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, the creative leadership in your community has \nworked with me to successfully acquire financial assistance from \nprograms I have fought hard to support, which have provided more than \n$95 million to the local economy.\n  Of course my favorite memory of working together has to be the \ncommunity's success in obtaining more than $93 million from funds made \navailable through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to build \nthe Barton Wind Power Project.\n  Among the highlights:\n  School grants: Every child in Iowa deserves to be educated in a \nclassroom that is safe, accessible, and modern. That is why, for the \npast decade and a half, I have secured funding for the innovative Iowa \nDemonstration Construction Grant Program--better known among educators \nin Iowa as Harkin grants for public schools construction and \nrenovation. Across 15 years, Harkin grants worth more than $132 million \nhave helped school districts to fund a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools. In many cases, these Federal dollars have served as the needed \nincentive to leverage local public and private dollars, so it often has \na tremendous multiplier effect within a school district. Over the \nyears, Worth County has received $234,876 in Harkin grants. Similarly, \nschools in Worth County have received funds that I designated for Iowa \nStar Schools for technology totaling $10,000.\n  Agricultural and rural development: Because I grew up in a small town \nin rural Iowa, I have always been a loyal friend and fierce advocate \nfor family farmers and rural communities. I have been a member of the \nHouse or Senate Agriculture Committee for 40 years--including more than \n10 years as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Across the \ndecades, I have championed farm policies for Iowans that include \neffective farm income protection and commodity programs; strong, \nprogressive conservation assistance for agricultural producers; \nrenewable energy opportunities; and robust economic development in our \nrural communities. Since 1991, through various programs authorized \nthrough the farm bill, Worth County has received more than $740,000 \nfrom a variety of farm bill programs.\n  Keeping Iowa communities safe: I also firmly believe that our first \nresponders need to be appropriately trained and equipped, able to \nrespond to both local emergencies and to statewide challenges such as \nthe methamphetamine epidemic. During the mid-to-late 1990's, cities in \nWorth County received $186,512 in Community Oriented Policing Services \ngrants. Also, since 2001, Worth County's fire departments have received \nover $764,000 for firefighter safety and operations equipment.\n  Disability rights: Growing up, I loved and admired my brother Frank, \nwho was deaf. But I was deeply disturbed by the discrimination and \nobstacles he faced every day. That is why I have always been a \npassionate advocate for full equality for people with disabilities. As \nthe primary author of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the ADA \nAmendments Act, I have had four guiding goals for our fellow citizens \nwith disabilities: equal opportunity, full participation, independent \nliving and economic self-sufficiency.

Each Presidential Scholar \nwill receive a medallion at a ceremony on June 22 in Washington, DC.\n  This young man's academic accomplishments serve to reinforce the \nimportant role of education in our State. As the father of four and \nhusband to a lifelong teacher, ensuring that all of Nevada's students \nhave access to a high-quality education is important to me. I strongly \nbelieve higher education opens the door to more job opportunities and \nprofessional fulfillment, as well as increased earning power. For this \nreason, I will continue working to support educators and students to \nensure that Nevadans are well prepared to enter the workforce and begin \nsuccessful careers.\n  On behalf of the residents of the Silver State, I am proud to \nrecognize Karthik for his accomplishments and contributions to our \nState. He undoubtedly represents Nevada's best and brightest. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in congratulating this exceptional young Nevadan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/16/senate-section/article/S3683-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EDEN, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.

Eden itself was founded after residents of Eden Park \ndecided to relocate near the new railroad in 1914. Known for its \nfertile soil, Eden is surrounded by vibrant farmland and is home to \nseveral successful businesses.\n  Eden exemplifies the hometown community spirit of South Dakota. After \n100 years Eden is still thriving, and it is my honor to publicly \ncongratulate its residents on reaching this commendable \nmilestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/16/senate-section/article/S3683-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3683-S3684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING EPIFANIA ``EPPIE'' ARCHULETA\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I wish to honor the \nlifetime contributions of Dr. Epifania ``Eppie'' Archuleta to the \ncultural heritage of the San Luis Valley of Colorado and Northern New \nMexico. An internationally recognized weaver of the Rio Grande, Navajo, \nand Chimayo weaving traditions, Dr. Archuleta passed away on April 11 \nat age 92.\n  Born in Santa Cruz, NM, in 1922 to Agueda and Eusebio Martinez, Dr. \nArchuleta came from a long line of Northern New Mexico weavers. In \n1940, she married Francisco Archuleta and moved north to the small town \nof Capulin in Colorado's San Luis Valley, where she and Francisco \nfarmed, ranched and raised eight children.\n  After the age of 60, Dr. Archuleta was able to focus on her weaving \nfull time. Her passion for her craft extended to teaching the art of \nwool spinning, dying, and weaving to family, friends, community \nmembers, and eager students from distant States. She held classes in \nthe small San Luis Valley\n\n[[Page S3684]]\n\ntowns of Capulin, Alamosa, and Center, at the San Luis Valley Area \nVocational School, and 5 hours away in Denver. Through the years, she \ntaught hundreds of eager students. Many of her students went on to \nestablish their own weaving classes and schools throughout the \nSouthwestern United States.\n  By passing on the weaving tradition, Eppie empowered people--\nespecially women--through teaching a valuable trade they could practice \nat home and remain with their children while making a decent living. \nWhen she was nearly 70, she opened a wool mill in Capulin, employing \nlocal citizens who could work close to home. Unfortunately, when her \nhusband passed, Eppie closed the mill.\n  In 1985, Dr. Archuleta received the National Heritage Fellowship \nAward from the National Endowment for the Arts. She was the first \nHispanic woman to receive this prestigious national award. A year \nlater, she spent a 2-week residency at the Smithsonian Institute \nFestival of American Folklife in Washington DC, during which four \ngenerations participated: Eppie, her mother Agueda Martinez, her \ndaughter Norma Medina and her granddaughter Delores Archuleta. In 1991, \nshe was featured in National Geographic Magazine, and in 1995, was \nawarded an honorary doctorate in art from Adams State University. Her \nweavings are on permanent display at the Smithsonian Institute.\n  A devout Catholic, Eppie donated pieces to churches including a \nweaving of the Sacred Heart of Jesus to the church in Medanales, NM, \nand a woven cape depicting Mt. Blanca to the statue of the Virgin \nConquistadora in Santa Fe, NM.\n  Eppie's passing leaves a great loss to all who knew her. Whether \npicking up a lone traveler walking along the highway and taking them \nhome, providing shelter, meals, and money in exchange for domestic \nchores and errands, volunteering at local fairs, festivals, and \nclassrooms, or starting a wool mill or weaving school to employ a \ncommunity, Eppie gave of her time and resources to assist many. She \nwill not be replaced.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/16/senate-section/article/S3684-1", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RICHLAND COUNTY, MONTANA\n\n Mr. WALSH. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Richland County \nin eastern Montana as a testament to the strength of the American \nDream.\n  This year, Richland County celebrates its 100th year anniversary. 100 \nyears of ingenuity, 100 years of prosperity, and 100 years of history.\n  Throughout the years, Richland County has undergone many changes. The \npast century has seen booms in agriculture, the discovery of oil, the \narrival of fracking, and a nation in peacetime and wartime. Through it \nall, the people who call the county home share the core values of \nservice, honesty, and the willingness to help a neighbor in need.\n  When pioneers first settled in eastern Montana they were not \nguaranteed prosperity, but they brought with them a strong work ethic. \nThat resilience was instrumental in the construction of the Lower \nYellowstone Irrigation Project canal that brought water to the area and \nallowed the pioneers to irrigate crops and develop the plains. The \nfarmers were taming an area of the country many thought could not be \ntamed.\n  Today, agriculture producers from Richland County continue to grow \nthe crops and raise the cattle that feed the world--working the land \nthe same way those before them did.\n  In the 1970s, in a world hungry for oil, Richland County was eager to \nhelp supply the country with its resources. Through the decade to \nfollow, the county boomed with energy through an age of prosperity. \nNow, hydraulic fracking and the development of the Bakken Formation \nbring Richland once again to the center of an energy boom unmatched \nanywhere in the United States.\n  Perhaps the greatest quality of the county is its kind citizens who \nare always willing to lend a hand to a neighbor. Despite their fast-\npaced lives, they still exhibit the same generosity, diligence, and \nspirit the pioneers brought to Richland County 100 years ago.\n  I congratulate Richland County for its contributions to our State, \nour Nation, and the world. We look forward to the next century being as \nexciting as the last.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/16/senate-section/article/S3684-2", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/16/senate-section/article/S3684-3", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/06/16/senate-section/article/S3684-4", "month": "06", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4453.

A House joint resolution adopted by the General \n     Assembly of the State of Colorado urging and requesting \n     members of Congress to increase the federal minimum wage and \n     thereafter tie it to inflation to help ensure that hard-\n     working Americans can earn a fair wage and afford to care for \n     their families; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \n     and Pensions.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution 14-1012\n\n       Whereas, The federal minimum wage was established through \n     the ``Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938'', in response to the \n     Great Depression, to ensure that workers earned enough to pay \n     for necessities and minimum monthly expenses; and\n       Whereas, Since then, the cost of living has steadily \n     increased while the federal minimum wage has generally \n     remained stagnant; and\n       Whereas, Congress has only raised the minimum wage twice in \n     the past 20 years; and\n       Whereas, The federal minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, \n     has declined from its peak of $10.72 in 1968 to $7.25 today, \n     a 33% decrease in purchasing power; and\n       Whereas, Under the current minimum wage, it is possible to \n     work full time and still be under the minimum federal poverty \n     line; and\n       Whereas, It is virtually impossible for a minimum-wage \n     worker to afford a two-bedroom apartment in any state while \n     working a 40-hour week; and\n       Whereas, Raising the federal minimum wage would decrease \n     American dependency on public assistance programs, such as \n     Section 8 housing vouchers and food stamps, in order to pay \n     for living expenses and raising families; and\n       Whereas, The majority of those who would benefit from a \n     minimum wage increase are full-time workers who are \n     supporting their families in moderate- to low-income \n     households; and\n       Whereas, For the vast majority of low-skilled or unskilled \n     workers, the minimum wage should be simply a starting salary \n     that gets them employed and gives them a chance to advance; \n     and\n       Whereas, Increasing the minimum wage would immediately \n     boost the wages of about 15 million low-income workers; and\n       Whereas, Raising the federal minimum wage is projected to \n     significantly boost the economy at large by increasing \n     purchasing power of workers, thereby increasing the United \n     States' gross domestic product; and\n       Whereas, In 2006, Colorado voters decisively voted to \n     approve Initiative 42, which raised the state minimum wage \n     and tied it to inflation in order to preserve the purchasing \n     power of Colorado workers and help ensure that they can \n     support themselves and their families; and\n       Whereas, Colorado raised the minimum wage in 2011 and 2012 \n     over the federal minimum, which contributed to a decrease in \n     the unemployment rate from 8.73% to 7.2% during that two-year \n     period; and\n       Whereas, Several other states have notably raised their \n     minimum wages during times of high unemployment, including \n     Washington, Oregon, Ohio, and Arizona, and those states all \n     experienced decreases of at least 1.5% in unemployment during \n     the same two-year period; and\n       Whereas, Raising the minimum wage not only will stimulate \n     the economy but will also lift millions of Americans out of \n     poverty: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Sixty-ninth \n     General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the Senate \n     concurring herein, That we, the Colorado General Assembly, \n     urge and request members of Congress to increase the federal \n     minimum wage and thereafter tie it to inflation to help \n     ensure that hard-working Americans can earn a fair wage and \n     afford to care for their families; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Joint Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the Vice \n     President of the United States, the Speaker of the United \n     States House of Representatives, the President Pro Tempore of \n     the United States Senate, the Majority and Minority Leaders \n     of the United States House of Representatives and Senate, and \n     the Majority and Minority Whips of the United States House of \n     Representatives and Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-257. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the General \n     Assembly of the State of Illinois urging Congress and the \n     President of the United States to reauthorize the Terrorism \n     Risk Insurance Program; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \n     and Urban Affairs.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 1124\n\n       Whereas, Insurance protects the United States economy from \n     the adverse effects of the risks inherent in economic growth \n     and development while also providing the resources necessary \n     to rebuild physical and economic infrastructure, offer \n     indemnification for business disruption, and provide coverage \n     for medical and liability costs from injuries and loss of \n     life in the event of catastrophic losses to persons or \n     property; and\n       Whereas, The terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, \n     produced insured losses larger than any natural or man-made \n     event in history; claims paid by insurers to their \n     policyholders eventually totaled some $32.5 billion, making \n     this the second-most costly insurance event in United States \n     history; and\n       Wheres, The sheer enormity of the terrorist-induced loss, \n     combined with the possibility of future attacks, produced \n     financial shockwaves that shook insurance markets, causing \n     insurers and reinsurers to exclude coverage arising from acts \n     of terrorism from virtually all commercial property and \n     liability policies; and\n       Whereas, The lack of terrorism risk insurance contributed \n     to a paralysis in the economy, especially in construction, \n     tourism, business travel, and real estate finance; and\n       Whereas, The United States Congress originally passed the \n     Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107-297 (TRIA), \n     in which the federal government agreed to provide terrorism \n     reinsurance to insurers and reauthorized this arrangement via \n     the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005, Pub. L. \n     109-144, and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program \n     Reauthorization Act of 2007, Pub. L. 110-160 (TRIPRA); and\n       Whereas, Under TRIPRA, the federal government provides such \n     reinsurance after industrywide losses attributable to annual \n     certified terrorism events exceed $100 million; and\n       Whereas, Coverage under TRIPRA is provided to an individual \n     insurer after the insurer has incurred losses related to \n     terrorism equal to 20% of the insurer's previous year earned \n     premium for property-casualty lines; and\n       Whereas, After an individual insurer has reached such a \n     threshold, the insurer pays 15% of residual losses and the \n     federal government pays the remaining 85%; and\n       Whereas, The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program has an annual \n     cap of $100 billion of aggregate insured losses, beyond which \n     the federal program does not provide coverage; and\n\n[[Page S3686]]\n\n       Whereas, TRIPRA requires the federal government to recoup \n     100% of the benefits provided under the program via policy \n     holder surcharges to the extent the aggregate insured losses \n     are less than $27.5 billion and enables the government to \n     recoup expenditures beyond that mandatory recoupment amount; \n     and\n       Whereas, Without question, TRIA and its successors are the \n     principal reason for the continued stability in the insurance \n     and reinsurance market for terrorism insurance to the benefit \n     of our overall economy; and\n       Whereas, The presence of a robust private/public \n     partnership has provided stability and predictability and has \n     allowed insurers to actively participate in the market in a \n     meaningful way; and\n       Whereas, Without a program such as TRIPRA, many citizens \n     who want and need terrorism coverage to operate their \n     businesses all across the nation would be either unable to \n     get insurance or unable to afford the limited coverage that \n     would be available; and\n       Whereas, Without federally provided reinsurance, property \n     and casualty insurers will face less availability of \n     terrorism reinsurance and will therefore be severely \n     restricted in their ability to provide sufficient coverage \n     for acts of terrorism to support our economy; and\n       Whereas, Unfortunately, despite the hard work and \n     dedication of this nation's counterterrorism agencies and the \n     bravery of the men and women in uniform who fought and \n     continue to fight battles abroad to keep us safe here at \n     home, the threat from terrorist attacks in the United States \n     is both real and substantial and will remain as such for the \n     foreseeable future: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the Ninety-eighth General \n     Assembly of the State of Illinois, That we urge Congress and \n     the President of the United States to reauthorize the \n     Terrorism Risk Insurance Program; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be \n     delivered to the President of the United States, the Speaker \n     and Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, the \n     President Pro Tempore and the Secretary of the United States \n     Senate, and the members of the Illinois congressional \n     delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n
