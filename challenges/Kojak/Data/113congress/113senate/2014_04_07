Mr. President, NASCAR fans can easily find their favorite \ndrivers simply by looking at the cars as they fly by because of \ncorporate emblems on the hood of the car. In fact, they are all over \nthe car. For our clothing here in the Senate, we don't bear any \ncommercial logos. Many Republican leaders these days may as well wear \nthe Koch Industries insignia, but as Members of the Senate, there \nshould never be any doubt as to our sponsors--the American people.\n  We are in the Senate for one reason: To give Americans a fair shot at \nproviding for their families and having their voices heard, but \nRepublicans seem more willing to identify themselves by their \nbillionaire sponsors. While they don't wear Koch Industries ties and \njackets, they display their sponsors proudly through their actions in \nthe Senate. So it comes as no surprise Republican Senators stood on the \nSenate floor and voiced their support for Charles and David Koch. \nSenate Republicans depend on the Koch brothers to make their job \neasier.\n  I appreciate the forthrightness of those who expressed their support \nof the Koch brothers. The chairman of the National Republican \nSenatorial Campaign Committee came to this floor praising the richest \nbrothers in the world. If Charles and David Koch helped Republican \nMembers in this Chamber, they should not be ashamed to defend the \nKochs' power. If the Koch brothers have bankrolled efforts to keep \nSenators in their seats, those Members should publicly acknowledge \ntheir providers.\n  If my Republican colleagues find my criticism of the Kochs' shadowy \ninfluence unjust, they should take their case to the American people. \nSenate Republicans should come to the Senate floor and take up the \ncause of the persecuted multibillionaires, but Senate Republicans \nshouldn't expect Americans to be easily fooled into ignoring the fact \nthat the Koch brothers are trying to sweep middle-class families under \nthe rug.\n  Regardless of the words Charles Koch espouses, for example, in his \nWall Street Journal op-ed last week, he and his brother don't have the \ninterests of average Americans in mind. They have in mind increasing \ntheir wealth and hiding their efforts behind words such as dignity, \nrespect, equality, and freedom. That ran throughout the column they \nwrote.\n  Dignity? What about the dignity of struggling, long-term unemployed \nfamilies? The Koch brothers continue closing plants and laying off \nemployees in Alaska, Arkansas, North Carolina, and other places, \ndevastating the economies in those communities. Americans need a fair \nshot at getting back on their feet and finding work, but Koch-backed \ngroups are actively opposing the extension of benefits for the long-\nterm unemployed.\n\n[[Page S2170]]\n\n  What about the dignity of a single mother from Las Vegas, Christina, \nwho is stuck living in her elderly grandmother's living room because \nshe and her son were evicted when Christina's benefits were cut off? \nPerhaps Charles and David Koch should spend their nights sharing one \nair mattress, as Christina and her son do, and see what dignity there \nis living as Christina and her boy do. The Koch brothers want Americans \nto be dignified as they lose their cars and homes and security.\n  The Koch brothers hide behind words such as ``respect.'' What about \ntreating the American voter with respect? Instead, the Koch brothers \nhave dumped hundreds of millions of dollars in dishonest ads about \nhealth care reform, trying to fool American families into thinking that \naffordable health care is bad for them. It is good for them. If the \nAffordable Care Act was so awful, why did Koch Industries use it to \ntheir advantage? Koch Industries applied for and participated in the \ntemporary program called the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program, part of \nthe Affordable Care Act. This program helped the company Koch \nIndustries pay health insurance costs to retirees who were not covered \nby Medicare. In other words, the government helped subsidize health \ncare which Koch Industries promised to its retiring employees. So it is \nOK for Koch Industries to save money through ObamaCare, but if an \nAmerican family wants a fair shot at health care, they risk being \nlabeled as collectivists. That was all through the article, the op-ed \npiece, ``collectivists.'' Is that the new rightwing buzz word for \nCommunists? That doesn't sound like respect to me.\n  The Kochs throw around phrases such as ``equality under the law.'' \nWhat about equality for hard-working American women? Yet the \nRepublicans in Congress who carry water for the Kochs are actively \ncampaigning against legislation that will ensure that women are paid \nequally with their male counterparts for doing the exact same work.\n  I have a daughter. I have four sons. My daughter, if she does the \nsame work as any of my four boys, should be paid the same as they are, \nbut that isn't how it is in America. She is paid only 76 or 77 cents on \nthe dollar for what men make doing the same work.\n  One of the Koch organizations is ironically called the Independent \nWomen's Forum. They do this all the time. They fund money for the \nChamber of Commerce, many other organizations, but one of their \norganizations is called the Independent Women's Forum, which is making \nthe argument that the disparity between men's and women's salaries is a \nmyth. But this tactic shouldn't surprise anyone, given the Republicans' \nutter disregard for women that is on display here in Washington.\n  We are going to vote on Wednesday on a fair pay piece of legislation, \nsimply saying women should get the same amount of money a man does \ndoing the same work--not too absurd, not too radical. That is what we \nare trying to do. I repeat. This tactic shouldn't surprise anyone, \ngiven the Republicans' disregard for women that is on display here in \nWashington.\n  For example, on one of the Sunday shows yesterday comments were made \nby former Director of the CIA Michael Hayden, who was there for a long \ntime. In responding to the Senate Intelligence Committee's attempts to \nshed light on the CIA's questionable interrogation methods, General \nHayden condescendingly accused Dianne Feinstein of being too emotional. \nHow about that--Dianne Feinstein being too emotional. This woman has \nbeen an outstanding leader of the Senate Intelligence Committee. She \nhas been fearless. She has been thorough and fair. For this man to say \nthat because she criticizes tactics led by General Hayden as torture \nshe was too emotional--I don't think so. Does this sound like a person \nor a party who respects women? So much for equality under the law as \nseen by the Koch brothers.\n  Finally, the Koch brothers claim they are fighting to restore a free \nsociety--also some buzz words: ``Free society.'' Free in what way? They \nsingle-handedly turned the American electoral process into a pay-to-\nplay scheme. The Koch brothers' endgame is to elect officials, to elect \npeople who will help overhaul our system of government and replace it \nwith something more to their liking to increase their wealth. Even \nthough they are the richest people in the world, they want to be \nricher.\n  So I again extend the invitation to my colleagues, if you bear the \nlogo of the Koch brothers, come on down and announce your affiliation \nopenly. The Koch brothers' agenda is an agenda that is not my agenda, \nit is not our agenda, but is it your agenda, my Republican friends? If \nit is, come and tell your constituents that is the case. Let this \nNation know where you stand. As for we Democrats, we will continue to \ndefend American families from these oil baron bullies who want nothing \nmore than to enrich themselves. We will continue to oppose their \nefforts to buy our democracy because we work for America, not just rich \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/07/senate-section/article/S2170-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to \ndiscuss the opportunity we have as a nation to truly take a leadership \nrole when it comes to responsible development of the Arctic region. As \nwe discuss the great opportunities and the challenges that face us, I \nthink it is fair to say that I will also be expressing some \ndisappointment with the general lack of resources our Federal \nGovernment has invested in this important issue, including, just most \nrecently, through the President's annual budget request.\n  Back in May 2013 the Obama administration released its ``National \nStrategy for the Arctic Region.'' The national strategy was really \ndesigned to set forth this government's strategic priorities for the \nArctic--pretty important to recognize what our priorities are going \nforward. While that might sound impressive--a national strategy for the \nArctic region--what we ended up seeing was just an 11-page document, \nand it is really hard to describe it as strategic. Perhaps a more \naccurate description is that it was a glorified memo, a general \noutline, but there were a lot of gaps that needed to be filled.\n  Recognizing that this is a new area for us in terms of opportunities \nand, really, for vision, I was prepared to sit back and listen to what \nthe administration had to say and work with them as they built this \nstrategic vision. So when they released their implementation plan for \nthe national strategy in late January, I was looking forward to it. I \nwas looking forward to what had been gathered in meetings not only in \nAlaska--the State of Alaska is what makes the United States an Arctic \nnation--but it was broader than just Alaskans' input; it was input from \nso many of our agencies, so many of our departments. Yet, when the \nimplementation of our national strategy was released, I have to admit \nthat, again, I was underwhelmed.\n  I made certain the President and members of the administration knew \nmy concerns, and I told him--these were my words when I wrote to him--\nmy concern was that his plan does not offer a vision to make the United \nStates a leader in the Arctic, particularly as we prepare for the \nchairmanship of the Arctic Council in May 2015, nor does it suggest \nthat the Arctic is a national priority. Instead, the plan provides a \nsnapshot of existing Arctic-related programs and projects with numerous \nassessments to be undertaken but no real path of action.\n\n[[Page S2171]]\n\n  It was important to me as someone who cares very deeply about our \nrole as an Arctic nation and our role not only within the confines of \nthe Federal Government but our role going forward in the world among \nthe other Arctic nations and truly all of the nations throughout our \nplanet in terms of where the United States sits when it comes to our \nvision and our view for the Arctic.\n  The administration's plan would maintain our rather meager status quo \nin the Arctic while the other Arctic nations--the rest of the \ninternational community--seem to be devoting increasing amounts of \nresources to the region.\n  It would also leave the residents of the Far North--U.S. citizens up \nthere in Alaska--out in the cold when it comes to the U.S. Government's \nown priorities. Rather than advance an agenda that will benefit those \nwho live in the Arctic, they are, instead, regulated to being part of a \nscience project for observation and conservation.\n  Let me give you an example of that.\n  One of the proposed initiatives within the implementation plan is to \n``Improve Arctic Community Sustainability, Well-being, and Cultural and \nLinguistic Heritage.'' I have to say, that is a pretty laudable goal. \nWe certainly want to maintain, we certainly want to pass down the \nculture of our indigenous populations to future generations. We \ncertainly want to improve their quality of life. Yet within this \ninitiative, the administration has designated the Smithsonian \nInstitution to be the lead agency for this particular initiative. It is \nas if the people of the Far North--it is as if the Inuit, the Eskimo, \nthe Aleut, the Yupik--are somehow or other people to be observed as \npart of a museum exhibit or perhaps placed under a glass bubble.\n  Combine this with the implementation plan's heavy emphasis on \nconservation, research into climate change, and preemption of \ndevelopment on State Native and Federal lands, and it is difficult for \nme to see any support by this administration for economic development, \nfor job creation, or really for a better quality of life for the people \nwho live in the Far North.\n  So again, when we talk about the ``Implementation Plan for the \nNational Strategy for the Arctic Region,'' climate is absolutely an \nissue that needs to be discussed and addressed--absolutely. Development \nissues clearly need to be addressed. Conservation clearly needs to be \naddressed. But we have to remember there are people who live and raise \ntheir families and work up in the Arctic. So making sure we are \nthinking about them as we advance an implementation plan is key.\n  But even with the implementation plan being rolled out in January, I \nthought: OK, there is still not enough meat on the bones here for me to \nunderstand how we move forward with a set of priorities, a real vision \nfor the Arctic. But I knew the President's budget was going to be \ncoming out in March, and that is the opportunity for any President to \nestablish his or her priorities when it comes to the budget.\n  So I held out hope that when we saw the fiscal year 2015 budget \nrequest that was where we would finally start to see some kind of a \ncoherent strategy come together. I expected it would at least \ndemonstrate the administration's desire to show some level of \nleadership in the Arctic. My office was told that part of the purpose \nof the implementation plan and the designation of lead and support \nagencies was to gain an ability to propose jointly supported Arctic \nprojects that OMB would then deem important enough to be included in \nthe budget request.\n  But, again, we looked through the budget, and I am disappointed, \nsorely disappointed. My immediate reaction to the budget request was we \nare seeing so much spending here through the budget proposal, but yet \nso very little attention paid to our needs and our opportunities in the \nArctic.\n  A search of the 1,400-plus page detailed appendix for the \nadministration's budget reveals only 5 requests--5 requests--for \nArctic-related activity. Two are for longstanding programs that have \nbeen funded for many years. One is the U.S. Arctic Research \nCommission--very important--and then, of course, the North Pacific \nResearch Board. Another is for international fisheries work done \nthrough the Arctic Council. And the last two are for climate change-\nrelated activities. That is it. Five references--five references--out \nof a 1,400-plus page appendix for the budget speak to any Arctic-\nrelated activity.\n  Now, you may ask why I am disappointed, underwhelmed, perhaps a \nlittle bit agitated about where we are with advancing an implementation \nplan, a strategic vision for the Arctic. Well, in about a year from \nnow, the United States will take over the chair of the Arctic Council. \nThat chairmanship is currently held by Canada.\n  I have had opportunities to sit down with the chair of the Arctic \nCouncil, Leona Aglukkaq, who is from the Nunavut area, and talk about \nwhat Canada is doing to really lead in so many different areas when it \ncomes to Arctic policy and Arctic strategy--not only for their nation \nbut all the Arctic nations and beyond.\n  I look with a little bit of longing at how Canada has truly embraced \ntheir leadership role as an Arctic nation, not only with statements of \nintention that are backed up by real resources, but an appreciation for \nwhat the future can hold for the Arctic.\n  So over the last several weeks we have had our Appropriations \nsubcommittees that are really starting to kick into gear here, and I \nhave had the opportunity to ask several Cabinet members--Secretary \nJohnson from the Department of Homeland Security and Secretary Jewell \nfrom the Department of Interior--I have had a chance to ask both of \nthem about their Departments' budget priorities for the Arctic and, \nspecifically, the programs for which their Departments have been \ndesignated as the lead agency within this implementation plan for \nfiscal year 2015. And both Cabinet members have assured me, they have \nsaid, yes, the Arctic is a priority, it is important to the United \nStates. But neither one of these Cabinet members could tell me what \ntheir Department's budget request contained for the Arctic. They have \nassured me they are going to be going back and seeing if they cannot \nfill in those details for me, but, to me, that is symbolic of the \nArctic's overall standing within the administration. There are lots of \ngood words when asked about it. Everyone is saying, yes, it should be a \npriority. But yet it does not seem to be important enough to be \nproactive on or to even be familiar with without prompting.\n  We all know that any President's budget request, regardless of party, \nis not likely to be enacted word for word, and, quite honestly, \nrecognizing politics, more likely than not it is not going to be \nenacted at all. But if a budget request does signify something, it is \nthe message, it is the signal of what the administration's priorities \nfor that fiscal year and beyond are.\n  So it is apparent, at least in my view, that this administration is \nnot willing to devote the resources necessary to make the Arctic a true \npriority. That, to me, is very shortsighted. I think it is a failure of \nleadership, a failure to think ahead and to take the long view.\n  I recognize, as we all do, that we are at a time of budget constraint \nand restraint, that there is competition for all dollars, as we look to \nmake wise decisions here. But as we are setting priorities, as we are \nthinking toward the future and a longer term view, we have to ensure--\nwe have to ensure--that the Arctic is placed as a priority. Some people \nwould ask why we should care about it. Is this just an Alaska-specific \nissue? Are these just Alaska projects we are talking about? Why should \nthe Arctic really matter to the United States?\n  First, the reality is that the Arctic is a relatively blank slate \nright now. It is not presently an area that is subject to longstanding \ndisputes or entrenched views. Think about the significance of that. \nWhen you look at the Arctic, you have your eight Arctic nations around \nit, but whether it is Finland, Norway, Canada, the United States, \nRussia, the area that occupies the Arctic is not one that is known for \nconflict.\n  Think about the role Secretary Kerry has. He does not have to worry \nabout hotspots in the Arctic in the sense of political hotspots. You \njust do not have those longstanding disputes. It is not a hotspot for \npotential conflict. It is, however, a region that is garnering \nincreased international attention and recognition because of its \ntremendous potential, and it is generating cooperation amongst Arctic \nnations. Now,\n\n[[Page S2172]]\n\nisn't that a concept--that something is actually generating \ncooperation?\n  Let me give you an example. I was at the 2013 Arctic Council \nMinisterial Meeting in Sweden, and I was there with Secretary Kerry. \nWhen you think about the issues in front of our Secretary of State, at \nthat time back in May, there was no shortage of differences and \ndisagreements with the Russian Government at that moment. Yet at that \nministerial meeting, we had Secretary of State Kerry and Russian \nForeign Minister Lavrov side by side signing a binding agreement on \noilspill preparedness and response capabilities in the Arctic. But this \nwas all going on while differences over Syria and U.S. Embassy spy \ncharges were hanging over their heads. So despite all the other issues \nthose two gentlemen were dealing with, they were able to come together \nin Sweden and join on to a joint document of cooperation among Arctic \nnations as it related to oilspill preparedness and response \ncapabilities. From a foreign policy perspective, the Arctic is an area \nfor cooperation and relationship building, and that is a good and a \npositive that we should look to build on.\n  From an economic perspective, our neighbors--Russia to the west and \nCanada to the east--continue with aggressive national plans that \ninclude state investment to develop northern resources and advance \ncommerce in the region. They know--they know all too well--that this \nwill help create jobs and economic growth in areas that face \nextraordinary challenges.\n  A recent report by the Norwegian Shipowners' Association shows that \nthe regions bordering the Arctic Ocean are experiencing higher annual \neconomic growth than the rest of their respective nations on average \nand are considered drivers for economic growth in the Arctic countries.\n  Russia's territorial claim to a large swath of the Arctic seabed \nreceived a boost when an area in the Sea of Okhotsk was recognized as \npart of its extended continental shelf by the same commission examining \nits Arctic claims. These are territorial claims that Russia is able to \nmake because they are a party to the Convention of the Law of the Sea, \nwhile the United States is not.\n  I will just make a particular aside at this point in time that I have \nlong been a proponent of the U.S. Senate ratifying the Convention on \nthe Law of the Sea. As we engage in the Arctic, as we not only work on \nareas of cooperation, I think we need to ensure that we, as an Arctic \nnation, have a seat at the table on the issues that face the Arctic. \nWhile we sit on the sidelines, because we have failed to ratify the law \nof the sea, we miss out. We miss out.\n  Even non-Arctic nations are embracing the opportunities that come \nwith diminished polar sea ice representing the transit benefits, \nconducting scientific research and moving ahead with resource \nexploration and development activities. Nations such as China, South \nKorea, and Japan each have icebreakers. China is in the process of \nconstructing a second larger icebreaker. It is even India's intention \nto have an icebreaker by the end of 2016. Think how far India is from \nthe Arctic.\n  You may ask the question: Well, where is the United States when it \ncomes to its number of icebreakers?\n  We have one heavy icebreaker, the Polar Star. We have a second, the \nPolar Sea, which is going to effectively be mothballed. We have a \nmedium breaker, the Healy, which is primarily used for research \nmissions, and the useful life of the Polar Star is expected to be \nconcluded in less than 10 years.\n  Right now, as I talk to those within the administration about the \nplans to move forward on a polar icebreaker, it is pretty dismal. The \nproposal thus far in the President's budget is that there will be $6 \nmillion to advance, as far as studies go. We know we need a heavy \npolar-class icebreaker. In fact, we know we need three heavy \nicebreakers and three medium icebreakers. But it is a big capital \ninvestment. It has not been made a priority. It is yet one of those \ninitiatives that I think we look at from a shortsighted perspective by \nfailing to place an imperative on it now.\n  Even Singapore--not exactly synonymous with the Arctic--has \ndesignated an Arctic ambassador and is actively participating in the \nArctic Council and other Arctic-related forums around the globe.\n  So there are non-Arctic nations that are building ice-capable ships. \nThere are non-Arctic nations that are asking to be observers in the \nArctic Council. There are non-Arctic nations stepping forward and \nsaying: We want to have an Arctic ambassador, somebody who is there as \npart of the discussions on issues in an area of the globe that is \nevolving so quickly; where there are so many opportunities; where there \nare challenges, yes, but where there are so many opportunities. We want \nto be part of that.\n  You would think the United States would not only jump in and say ``me \ntoo,'' but that we would be leading as one of the eight Arctic nations. \nThis activity by other nations is going to continue--in fact, \naccelerate--regardless of whether the United States engages. But if we \ndo engage, we will also benefit and we will also be in a better \nposition to ensure that any development, that any commerce, that any \nactivity is carried out safely and responsibly.\n  There is a lot of discussion about the energy potential, the \npotential for natural resource wealth and what that might bring to the \nArctic. This is a map that shows the extent of the yearlong ice in the \nArctic. Setting aside the natural resource potential, which is in the \nrange of 30 billion barrels of oil and 220 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas in the United States Arctic OCS alone--we recognize that \nthe natural resource potential is significant, but it is not just about \nthe natural resources. Let me give an example of the activity that is \nalready underway in the Arctic, its impact on us here in the United \nStates, and the opportunity our Nation has to embrace that potential.\n  With the decreasing amount of sea ice in the Arctic, we are seeing a \ncorresponding increase in maritime activity.\n  So, again, this is a chart that shows the extent of the sea ice in \nthe year 2000. So your sea ice is the whiter area, with your \nopportunities for maritime activity limited as you are moving through \nCanada here and even through Russia there.\n  This next chart shows the extent of the sea ice and vessel activity \nin the Arctic in 2011. So you can see increased activity is taking \nplace where the sea ice used to be. So here is the sea ice now, but \nnotice the passage you have transiting through the Bering Strait, over \nthe top of Alaska, through the Northwest Passage, and out over to \nEurope.\n  Notice also going through the Northern Sea Route from Russia over to \nthe Baltic States. The colored lines you see are not necessarily oil \nand gas exploration ships; they are cargo ships, they are tankers, and \nthey are icebreakers. They are fishing vessels, research vessels, \npassenger vessels, cruise ships, and others. So in a decade, what you \nare seeing is a level of maritime traffic that is really \nunprecedented--and unprecedented because we have not had the ability to \ntransit in these waters because they were locked by ice for almost the \nfull extent of the year.\n  So here is a closer look at the vessel activity in the Bering Strait \nregion in 2013. So this is going to look like this amazing blur of \ncolor. But here we have Alaska. This is Russia. Where all of these \nlines seem to be converging, at the center here, is where we have \nLittle Diomede and Big Diomede. Big Diomede is owned by Russia, Little \nDiomede is held by the United States, and 2.5 miles separates the two \nislands. In truth, we can see Russia from Little Diomede. I was there \nlast summer.\n  But when you appreciate that the distance between Alaska and Russia \noutside of the very narrow area between Big and Little Diomede is just \n57 miles--we have a 57-mile choke point here in the Bering Strait where \nwe have incredible amounts of maritime commerce coming through: \ntankers, cargo ships, tugs, towing ships, passenger vessels, fishing \nvessels, search and rescue, military, law enforcement, and others. This \nis what we are seeing in the year 2013. Transits have doubled in the \npast 5 years.\n  The next chart comes from the recently released U.S. Navy Arctic \nRoadmap. This map shows the predicted sea ice coverage by the year \n2030. So here we were at 2012 with the sea ice covering all of this. By \n2020 it is shrinking. Here it is by 2025, by 2030. This is the\n\n[[Page S2173]]\n\npredicted model for our sea ice coverage by 2030. We can see an even \nlarger portion of the Arctic is expected to be open to maritime \ncommerce.\n  The Navy predicts that the traffic through the Bering Strait will \ndouble again in the next 10 years. Again, that is going to happen \nwhether or not the United States participates. Foreign vessels, if not \nAmerican vessels, will be traveling across Alaska's western and \nnorthern coast. That is a given.\n  The last chart I have shows the Bering Strait as the gateway between \nthe Pacific and the Arctic Oceans. Again, when we talk about Alaska, we \nare talking about its strategic geographic location, where it is on the \nglobe. We are very proud of the military opportunities we have for \namazing training ranges in Alaska when it comes to our assets in the \nair and on the ground.\n  But look at where Alaska sits in terms of its strategic location to \nnot only Asia--we are sitting literally halfway between Nagoya, Japan, \nand Seattle, Washington, when you are at Adak. It is just as easy for \nme to get to Japan as it is to get to Seattle if I go as the crow \nflies. Unfortunately, I do not have anything that will take me as the \ncrow flies.\n  But I think it is important for us to recognize this: That whether it \nis passage over the Northwest Passage, which is still relatively \nproblematic, the increased traffic we are seeing from the Northern Sea \nRoute coming over Russia, or potentially the transpolar route at some \npoint in time, everything funnels through the Bering Strait here--the \n57 miles between Russia and the United States--and then has to exit or \ncut through the Aleutian chain here.\n  So when we think about where Alaska sits, we truly are the gateway \nbetween the Pacific and the Arctic Oceans. With the predicting of a \ndoubling of vessel activity in the Arctic via the Bering Strait in the \nnext 10 years, the time to develop the infrastructure and support \ncapacity to handle this growing amount of traffic is now--actually, it \nwas yesterday.\n  This is not a region that is devoid of activity, but it is a region \nthat lacks adequate levels of investment, government resources, and \nattention. Deepwater ports, navigational aids, search and rescue \ncapabilities, and icebreakers are all needed now and, in addition, the \nbasic charting of many of our Arctic waters, which some of us have \nrecognized is seriously lacking. This is going to take a very \ncollaborative effort across all of our agencies and working with our \nArctic neighbors to achieve that.\n  With a vision, it is not difficult to see how we could have a \ntransshipment facility developed in the Aleutian chain to capitalize on \nthe intersection between the North Pacific great circle route and the \nthree Arctic Sea routes. Imagine you have cargo that is transiting the \nArctic from Europe, coming from the Northwest Passage or coming over \nthe Northern Sea Route.\n  Imagine that cargo then being offloaded at Adak. Adak is a former \nNavy base and, quite honestly, the infrastructure that is there is--\nwell, it is a little bit old--pretty amazing. You could then offload in \neither Adak or Unalaska and load that cargo onto ships transiting the \nNorth Pacific and to the west coast--and vice versa.\n  Ice-strengthened ships could be used entirely within the Arctic, \nrather than traveling all the way to Singapore or Hong Kong. It would \nsave time, it would save money, and it would allow for an increased \nnumber of transits. I am looking at it and saying: This could be a real \nwin, a win for consumers, a win for business, and a win for national \nsecurity by being able to keep a closer eye on commerce traveling to \nthe United States.\n  It is clear--I hope it is clear--that people recognize that we have \nsuch opportunity, we have such capacity for opportunity and growth \nwithin the Arctic. But we have to be careful, we have to be \nconsiderate, and we have to be sure that the necessary resources and \ninfrastructure necessary are there.\n  The United States has never been last in a race to the future, but \nabsent visionary leadership and meaningful resourcing, we will continue \nto take a back seat and fail to capitalize on all that the Arctic has \nto offer. We will miss out on resource development and shipping \nefficiencies and, in turn, new opportunities to create new jobs and \ngenerate needed economic growth.\n  I don't believe that we can afford to sit idle any longer, which \nmeans that it is time for our Federal Government and this \nadministration to really start taking the Arctic seriously and dedicate \nthe necessary resources to the region.\n  I don't mean to suggest that the efforts that have been made to date \nare not important. We have come quite far in the past few years, but \nyou have to remember, we were starting from ground zero. There was \nnothing, really. We have made some strides, and it is important that we \nhave these documents coming out of our agencies, and it is important \nthat we have framework because it is on these that we will build. But I \nfeel like I need to lend an air of urgency that it is not just about \nmethodically chipping away year by year with yet another document--\nanother strategy plan that will sit on the bookshelf.\n  I have a lot of those on the Arctic. I think many do. It is how we \nare a true participant in a level of engagement in a region that holds \nsuch excitement and such potential that nations around the world are \nturning their eyes northward with excitement and enthusiasm.\n  The United States should be leading with equal enthusiasm about what \nour opportunities hold.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King).

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the \nvote that is about to occur on the unemployment benefits extension act. \nI have repeatedly said that the Senate should have a full and open \ndebate on this important issue and that debate should include the \nopportunity for those of us in the minority--and perhaps those in the \nmajority--to offer amendments and changes that would represent the view \nof the people they represent in Congress. Those amendments could \nstrengthen the bill, make it better, and perhaps make it something that \nthe House could consider, since they have not taken up this \nlegislation.\n  Clearly, for those who are truly in need and for those who have \nplayed by the rules, the issue of extended unemployment benefits is a \nlegitimate issue for debate--and for many here, for passage. I have not \nonly worked with my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle, but \nalso with my Democratic colleagues, to secure two items which would \ngive me a better sense of where we are going and would provide for \nbetter legislation--legislation that could perhaps work its way through \nthe Congress and onto the President's desk.\n  One of those two items was a legitimate pay-for. We clearly have a \nfiscal situation where, if we can't offset new spending with spending \non programs that have not proven their worth, then we are going to \ncontinue to spend more than we take in, continue to add to our national \ndebt, and continue to trot down the precipitous road to a fiscal \ncrisis--$17 trillion-plus and counting, an ever-accumulating debt and \ncontinued unbalanced budgets. You can only run a business, a family or \na government for so long when you do not make ends meet by having your \nrevenues there to pay for your expenses. So having a legitimate pay-for \nwas one of the criteria that I was trying to address along with my \ncolleagues.\n  Secondly was reforms to the program. It was the President himself who \npublicly acknowledged that the unemployment insurance program needed \nreforms. There were abuses in the program. It was not reaching all of \nthe people it was intended to reach. It had some flaws and needed to be \nfixed. Once again, all of those attempts for reasonable reforms--not \nonly by me, but by a number of my colleagues--were to provide what I \nbelieve is deemed, even on a bipartisan basis, as reasonable, but they \nhave been rejected. They have been rejected not because we had a debate \nand voted and didn't achieve the requisite number of votes for passage, \nbut they were rejected because the majority leader simply used \nprocedures,\n\n[[Page S2174]]\n\nonce again, to deny the minority any opportunity--and, of course, that \nalso includes the majority--to stand on this floor, to offer an \namendment, to debate that amendment, to have a vote on it, to accept \nthe result, and then move to forward.\n  The two reforms I had mentioned--and that I thought made eminent \nsense--didn't really have much opposition to them. One was to simply \nend a process that resulted in a waste of taxpayers' money by violation \nof the law. The law requires that if you apply for unemployment \nbenefits, you must prove you are able to work and that you have been \nseeking work--but most importantly, you are capable of working.\n  The Social Security Disability Insurance Program requires, by law, \nthat you are unable to work. Therefore, you cannot be eligible for \nthose benefits unless you can prove--through a medical process or \nevidence--your inability to work. Yet the Government Accountability \nOffice has found a significant number of folks in our country who are \nreceiving checks from both programs. You can't have it both ways. You \ncan't say you are not able to work and therefore receive a disability \npayment, and at the same time--and in the same mailbox--receive a \ngovernment check for unemployment insurance where you have to prove you \nare willing to work. I don't know what provision might be more logical \nthan that in terms of reforming the program. It saves the taxpayer \nmoney, it eliminates fraud, and it simply puts the program on better \nfooting. Given our fiscal plight today, it is the least we can do. Yet \nI have been denied--and my colleagues who have tried to offer the same \namendment have been denied--the opportunity to do just that.\n  Had we had the opportunity to come down here and offer that \namendment, we could have had a debate. Those who saw it another way or \ndidn't agree with what we were saying would have had every opportunity \nto vote no and turn down that amendment. They would then be accountable \nfor their no or yes when they went back home--one way or another. There \nare people on both sides of the reform issue, and that is how the \nSenate is designed to work.\n  The Senate is not designed to simply shut off a debate and deny the \nminority the opportunity to offer amendments. We are not asking for \npassage. We are simply saying: Give us a chance to make our case, and \nwe will have to accept the outcome. That way every Member of this body \nwill be responsible for how they voted and will go home and tell folks: \nThis is why I did such and such. That is how the system is designed to \nwork.\n  Yet we find ourselves in a dysfunctional situation where there is no \nopportunity to have a debate and no opportunity to vote and to let \npeople know where we stand. Maybe it is designed that way. Maybe we \ndon't want people to know where we stand. I don't think anyone in this \nbody can go home and tell the people they represent--their \nconstituents: We are not going to tell you how we feel about that. I \ndidn't want to put my vote on the record, and therefore, we are not \ngoing to have an opportunity to do that.\n  It is a black mark on the Senate. It is a dysfunctional situation. It \nis no wonder that the American public holds us in such low regard. This \nbody, which was created by our Founding Fathers, enshrined in the \nConstitution, and labeled as the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld has simply turned into something totally different and totally \nopposite from that. We are a rubberstamp Senate, depending on what the \nmajority leader decides he wants or doesn't want. I think that is a \ngreat disservice to the American people, and it is a great disservice \nto this institution.\n  Having had the opportunity to serve here on two different occasions, \nthe contrast between my two tenures in the Senate could not be more \nstark. When I first came, the rights of the minority were recognized by \na variety of majority leaders who simply said: This is the Senate. You \ntake tough votes, you have the debate, and you allow the minority their \nrights. As a consequence, the Senate has functioned as the world's \ngreatest deliberative body for more than 200 years.\n  Suddenly, we are now in a situation where that is not the case, and \nwe have turned this simply into somewhat of a fiefdom where the \nmajority leader has the full power to deny the minority their rights.\n  I think we will come to rue the day when this practice was first \ninitiated and rue the day when it has been accepted because it denies \nthose of us who have had the great honor and privilege of representing \nour States the opportunity to do just that.\n  Along with the amendment that I had for suitability, which simply \ngives States more flexibility in terms of providing suitable work for \nthe unemployed--if it is provided to them, they have to accept it or \nthey don't receive the unemployment checks. Those two amendments are \ntwo of the many suggested reforms that I think would make sense. But \nwhether you agree with that or not, shouldn't we have the opportunity \nto present to the American people an honest, intellectual, rational \ndebate on legislation--whether it fails or passes--so we can have a \nfull understanding and they can have a full understanding of how to \nmeasure us in terms of whether we are true representatives of those who \nsent us here?\n  Having said that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I hope for and expect a strong bipartisan \nvote today for legislation to extend emergency unemployment benefits \nthrough the end of May and applies retroactively from the point \nemergency benefits expired in December.\n  This is an important victory I wish had come much sooner--sooner for \nthe 80,000 Michiganians who already have gone without unemployment \nbenefits and for the thousands more who stand to lose them if Congress \nfails to act.\n  These benefits keep food on the table and a roof overhead for \nfamilies affected by job loss through no fault of their own. The idea \nthat some of our colleagues have advanced--that unemployment insurance \ngives workers an excuse not to find a job--is as inaccurate as it is \ninsulting. For all but a handful of recipients, unemployment benefits \nare not a free pass from working but the economic lifeline that keeps \nthem going while searching for the job they so desperately want and \nneed.\n  I wish to commend Senators on both sides of the aisle who have not \ngiven up on this issue and who worked so hard to forge a compromise, \nled by Senators Jack Reed and Dean Heller. Republicans have joined with \nDemocrats on the procedural votes necessary to move this bill forward, \nand I hope the bipartisan support for this measure in the Senate will \nprompt Speaker Boehner to bring it to a vote in the House. There is a \nstrong bipartisan majority for passage in the House. It is now up to \nSpeaker Boehner to respond to the will of the American people who \nunderstand that people who are unemployed don't want to be unemployed. \nThere may be a few exceptions and a few stories and a few anecdotes, \nbut that is about it. The unemployed in this country are suffering. \nThey have suffered for too long. The job growth that has come following \nthe recession has been weak, and the least we can do is respond.\n  There is a bipartisan majority to do that here. It will be strong. My \nhunch is it will be well over 60, perhaps over two-thirds of the \nSenate, and there is no excuse for Speaker Boehner not to bring this \nbill to the floor of the House. I hope he does so. It is just in all \nconscience essential that he do so.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that all time be charged equally \nduring quorum calls.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \ndiscuss the unemployment insurance extension bill currently being \nconsidered. There is little question that the job market remains tight \nproviding few job opportunities for those who are currently unemployed. \nThe unemployment rate remains at historically high levels of around 6.7 \npercent. However, the unemployment rate only tells part of the story. \nMillions of Americans have become discouraged and left the labor market \nentirely or are underemployed. When you consider these Americans, the \nunemployment rate isn't 6.7 percent, but a much starker 12.7 percent.\n  It is obvious from these numbers that many Americans continue to \nstruggle in the face of a historically tepid recovery. Republicans and \nDemocrats agree that there are things we can and should do to help the \nmillions of Americans who are out of work and struggling to make ends \nmeet. However, we have conflicting views on the best way to achieve \nthis goal.\n  In 2008, Congress established the extended Emergency Unemployment \nCompensation program that provided Federal funded unemployment \ninsurance benefits to the long-term unemployed. This benefit was on top \nof the 26 weeks of unemployment compensation ordinarily provided by the \nStates. This program was never meant to go on forever. It is a \ntemporary program that was designed to provide relief while we were in \nthe depths of a recession.\n  This program has since been extended 11 times and we are now debating \nextending it for the 12th. There are reasonable arguments that at this \ntime the emergency unemployment benefits should be extended once more. \nBut if we are to extend the emergency unemployment program it should be \ndone in a fiscally responsible way.\n  While the majority argues that the extension is fully offset, this is \nonly true through a budgetary sleight of hand. The largest offset used \nto pay for the unemployment program is a so-called pension smoothing \nprovision. This provision essentially allows sponsors of pension plans \nto underfund their pensions over the next few years. This raises \nconcerns that pensions could be underfunded in future years, hurting \npensioners, and potentially putting taxpayers on the hook for these \nplans should they need be taken over by the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation, JCT, estimates that over the long \nterm the provision will actually cost the Treasury billions of dollars \nin revenue. As a result, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, and JCT \nestimate that overall the bill before us would increase deficits by \nmore than $5 billion between 2024 and 2033.\n  Moreover, while an extension of emergency employment benefits is well \nintentioned, it serves only to treat the symptoms of unemployment, \nwhile doing nothing to address its cause. Instead of the debate we are \nhaving on extending unemployment benefits we should be focused on what \ncan be done to ensure those who want to work are able to find good \npaying jobs.\n  Republicans have offered such an approach with the Good Jobs, Good \nWages, and Good Hours Act, which was filed as an amendment to the \nunderlying unemployment insurance bill.\n  This amendment is targeted at job creation be providing small \nbusinesses who are responsible for creating 70 percent of jobs in our \neconomy with permanent tax relief aimed at incentivizing new \ninvestments. It would further cut red tape that imposes unnecessary \nburdens on job creators and would modify or repeal provisions of \nObamacare that are proven job killers. Moreover, the amendment would \nspur job creation by increasing energy development by, amongst other \nthings, authorizing the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. I ask \nunanimous consent that a summary of this amendment be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Unfortunately, the majority leader filled the amendment tree, thereby \nblocking all amendments. This prevented us from having an up-or-down \nvote on the jobs amendment I just described as well as several other \namendments that sought to improve the underlying bill. As a result, the \nunderlying bill is not fiscally responsible and would do nothing to \naddress the causes of weak job creation. As such, I cannot in good \nconscience vote in favor of extending unemployment insurance at this \ntime.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Good Jobs, Good Wages, Good Hours Act--Omnibus Alternative to UI\n\n\n                      Title I--Energy Development\n\n       Approve Keystone XL and LNG Exports: This provision would \n     approve the Keystone XL pipeline by removing the requirement \n     of a presidential permit. It would also require the \n     Department of Energy to automatically approve LNG export \n     applications to Ukraine, Japan, and other NATO countries. \n     (Hoeven UI Amdt. #2891)\n       The Saving Coal Jobs Act: This provision would block EPA \n     regulations of greenhouse gas emissions for new and existing \n     power plants. It would also streamline the mine permitting \n     process and automatically approve permits the EPA has not \n     acted on after a certain period of time. (McConnell UI Amdt. \n     #2955)\n       Prohibit a Carbon Tax: This provision would create a point \n     of order against any legislation that would establish a \n     carbon tax.

(S. 1188--Collins)\n       Repeal the ObamaCare Individual Mandate: This provision \n     would permanently repeal the individual mandate under \n     ObamaCare. (S. 40--Hatch)\n       Repeal the Medical Device Tax: This provision would repeal \n     the 2.3% ObamaCare medical device tax, which has already \n     destroyed over 30,000 jobs. (S. 232--Hatch/Toomey/Coats)\n       Exempt the Long-Term Unemployed from ObamaCare Employer \n     Mandate: This provision would exempt long-term unemployed \n     from the ObamaCare employer mandate headcount. (Thune UI \n     Amdt. #2899)\n       Hire More Heroes Act: This provision would exempt veterans \n     from the ObamaCare employer mandate headcount. A similar \n     provision passed that House 406-1.

To \n     encourage investment in start-up businesses, investors may \n     exclude 100 percent (reverted back to 50 percent in 2014) of \n     the capital gains from selling Section 1202 stock that was \n     acquired at original issue and held for more than five years.\n       Permanent Double Deductions for Start-up Businesses: This \n     provision would permanently double the maximum allowable \n     deduction for start-up costs to $10,000.\n       Permanent Reduction in S-Corporation Built-In Gains Tax: \n     Corporations that convert to S-corporation status are subject \n     to a tax on appreciated assets that the corporation held \n     before the conversion. The required holding period was \n     shortened from 10 years to five years for sales of assets in \n     2012 and 2013. This provision would make permanent the five-\n     year holding period.\n       Permanent Deduction for Health Insurance Costs in Computing \n     Self-Employment Taxes: This provision would permanently place \n     the self-employed on a level playing field with other \n     businesses that currently exclude health insurance costs for \n     both income and payroll tax purposes.\n       Permanent Expansion of Cash Accounting: This provision \n     would permanently expand cash accounting to firms with annual \n     gross receipts of up to $10 million and inventories of up to \n     the $10 million--current law is $5 million. Cash accounting \n     affords small businesses greater flexibility in managing \n     their cash flow, as it allows recognition of income and \n     expenses when they are realized rather than when events give \n     rise to the income (such as when a contract is signed).\n       Regulatory Accountability: This provision would enact \n     targeted reforms of the federal rulemaking process. It would \n     require that agencies conduct a cost-benefit analysis and \n     consider alternatives to proposed regulations, and it would \n     require advanced public notice of major rulemakings with \n     greater than $100 million in annual costs.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                              Wind Energy\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \njobs and about one sector in particular that has created tremendous \neconomic growth in Colorado and across the United States, and that is \nwind energy and the jobs it has brought to our State.\n  During last Thursday's markup in the Finance Committee, we worked in \na bipartisan fashion to include a 2-year extension of the production \ntax credit, known as the PTC, and the investment tax credit, known as \nthe ITC, for wind energy.\n  The wind credit has enjoyed broad bipartisan support from both sides \nof the aisle over a number of years, ranging from its original \nchampion--who continues to be a champion--Senator Grassley from Iowa, \nto my friend and colleague from Colorado Senator Mark Udall, who has \nbeen a tireless and relentless supporter over the years for wind energy \njobs in Colorado. I know he will be a supportive advocate when the \nextenders bill reaches the floor. If enacted into the law, the \nextension of the production tax credit and investment tax credit will \ncontinue to drive job growth in my State of Colorado.\n  Sometimes I hear people say the government should not pick winners \nand losers in their critique of the wind energy tax credits. I actually \nagree with that notion, but what I would say to people who are \nlistening to this on the TV is that when you hear someone in Washington \nsay you shouldn't pick winners and losers, that is when you should hold \nonto your wallet. They say that is as if those decisions haven't \nalready been made--as if winners haven't already been produced \nsomewhere deep in the Tax Code in the last century or the regulatory \ncode or the statute books. It is a reminder to ask yourself: Who is \nmore likely to have benefits in this town? Is it the incumbent \nindustries that have been working on these for decade after decade or \nis it the innovators in our economy? And, of course, time and time \nagain it is the legacy firms that have the upper hand in these debates. \nI don't blame them for fighting for that advantage. But I also know \nthey are not necessarily going to be the industries that are going to \ncreate the 21st century jobs we need, and whether we know it or not \nthat is fundamentally the debate we are having. It is not a left-right \ndebate in this town. It is future versus past debate, and it is \ncritically important to the next generation of Americans that we get \nthis right.\n  This is an updated version of a chart I have been bringing to the \nfloor for the last 4 years that shows some interesting relationships of \nlines relating to our economy. The top chart is GDP growth in the \nUnited States, and that is the green line. Here is the recession right \nhere. You can see we are actually producing much more as an economy \ntoday than when we went into the recession. There is much greater gross \ndomestic product.\n  This is the unemployment level. You can see at the depths of the \nrecession the destruction in jobs the Presiding Officer saw in his home \nState, and we saw it in my home State. We were in a very difficult \nperiod at that time. We have actually begun to add jobs again, and we \nare almost back to where we were. I think we are back to where we were \nin terms of job creation.\n  This is a very stubborn and difficult issue for the people at home \nand the people I represent. This shows what has happened to median \nfamily and household income over periods of economic growth and over \nperiods of economic decline. A way of thinking about that line is: What \nis happening to the middle-class income in this country? What is \nhappening is the growth of middle-class income has decoupled from our \neconomic growth. That, among other causes, has produced the worst \nincome inequality we have seen in this country since 1928, I would \nargue, with the educational outcomes we have seen for kids, the most \nsignificant opportunity gap we have had in our lifetimes.\n  Why has this happened? There are a variety of reasons, but let me \ncall your attention to this line. This is the productivity index in the \nUnited States. This shows how productive and efficient our economy has \nbecome. It has become incredibly efficient partly because of the use of \ntechnology, that is true, partly because of reaction to competition \nfrom overseas from China and India, and partly because the recession \nitself, which you can see, drove the line straight up because firms had \nto figure out how to get by with fewer people. That is our challenge. \nThat is our central economic dilemma as we move into the second decade \nof this 21st century.\n  It is my view that there are two principal answers to that challenge. \nThe first is education. I am not here to talk about that tonight, but \njust as a reminder, we are not going to recognize ourselves in this new \ncentury if we continue to perpetuate a set of outcomes in our K-12 \nsystem where if you are born poor in the United States, your chances of \ngraduating with the equivalent of a college degree are roughly 9 in \n100. That is completely unsatisfactory and outrageous, particularly for \nthe kids we are talking about.\n  The other is innovation. We have to make sure we have the most \ninnovative economy in the United States, and whether we are willing to \nlead the world; it is the companies that will start next week, the week \nafter that, and the week after that, and the venture-backed companies \nthat are somebody's bright idea today in their garage, but tomorrow \ncould become the next Apple or Google. That is where the job growth and \nthe wage growth is going to come from.\n  In my view the wind credit cuts right to the core of whether we are \ngoing to compete in a global economy. We are not talking about a fly-\nby-night experimental industry. This credit has triggered tremendous \neconomic growth in Colorado and across the country. In Colorado alone, \nthese tax credits directly support 5,000 jobs.\n  Vestas, which manufactures wind turbines, employs over 1,400 workers \nacross four factories in our State from Pueblo all the way up I-25 to \nBrighton\n\n[[Page S2180]]\n\nand Windsor. They have hired 400 new workers this year with another 450 \nprojected to be added before the end of 2014. This is it. Right here. \nBricks and mortar. Real jobs. Made in America. It is not just \nmanufacturing and design jobs near urban centers; it is also \nconstruction and operation jobs at the actual wind farms.\n\n  One Thursday night I left this floor, as I do almost every week--or \nit was a Friday morning, I guess. I flew back to Colorado. I got in the \ncar and drove up to Peetz, where we have a wind farm. I climbed up to \nthe top of a wind turbine. I thought that was it. I was in the pod at \nthe top. That is not the technical term, but that is what it was. I \nthought I could then go home. When I got up there, they opened a trap \ndoor in the ceiling, and then I had to climb out on the roof of this \nthing, swaying over the Wyoming border, in the very shoes I wear on the \nfloor of the Senate. That was an uncomfortable feeling, even though I \nwas clipped in.\n  There was a guy up there who was one of the operators, one of the \nworkers. He said: I would never have had this job in this community if \nit were not for this wind farm. If it were not for a vision somebody \nimagined several years ago but was unimaginable a decade ago, I would \nnot have this job in this community.\n  This industry drives economic growth across our State from the \nconference rooms of tech startups in Boulder and Denver and all the way \nto 6,000-acre Kit Carson Wind Power Generating Site just west of the \nKansas State line.\n  These are good jobs. In 2012, median household income for a single \nmale in this country was just under $37,000. Compare this figure to \njobs in the wind industry--and these are all from the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics. Crane and wind tower operators have a median annual wage of \nover $47,000. These are jobs that can't be exported overseas. They \ncan't be exported overseas. The electricians on wind projects average \nnearly $50,000 annually. Land acquisition specialists who secure the \nland where wind projects are located have a median salary of $74,000, \nand site managers for wind projects make over $100,000 a year.\n  So if we are looking for a way to say we would like to see median \nfamily income start to rise again in this country instead of going down \nwhether we are in a period of economic growth or decline, we might \nstart to look at things such as the wind industry. These are good-\npaying jobs, and we are seeing it more and more in Colorado and all \nacross the country.\n  The production tax credit has driven $105 billion in private \ninvestment, opened 550 industrial facilities, and provided $180 million \nin lease payments to farmers, ranchers, and landowners who host wind \nfarms. Wind power accounts for more than a third of all new U.S. \nelectric generation in recent years. It has moved our State toward a \nmore diversified and cleaner energy portfolio. Colorado is in the lead \nin many ways, and we are proud of that. Most importantly, 70 percent of \na U.S. wind turbine is produced right here in the United States, and \nthat creates 80,000 American jobs. When we travel the highways of my \nState, we see the component parts of these wind turbines moving from \none plant to another, reflecting manufacturing jobs right here in the \nUnited States of America.\n  So I am delighted, I am glad, that we are moving to restore the wind \ncredit that expired at the end of last year. We have seen this before \nwhere the PTC expired without a prompt extension, and it doesn't end \nwell. Each time the credit has expired in the past, new installations \nfell between 76 and 93 percent, dealing a blow to the industry and its \nemployees--and a reminder once again that what we don't do here \nactually matters out there in the real lives of people.\n  I know I sound like a broken record, but the world is not waiting for \nus to get out of our own way. We can't keep going through this \nunnecessary political boom-and-bust cycle. I am pleased the Senate \nFinance Committee took an important first step last week by reporting \nout a 2-year extension. We need to follow that with good work by \nbringing the extenders package to the floor and passing it into law. \nThat outcome will give much-needed certainty to our industries and help \nsecure the economic future for Colorado families who work in the wind \nindustry.\n  With that, I thank the Chair for allowing me to speak this evening, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the nomination of Hamid Aboutalebi to be the \nAmbassador from the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations is a \ndeliberate and unambiguous insult to the United States. Mr. Aboutalebi \nwas an active participant in the terrorist group that took 52 Americans \nhostage on November 4, 1979, and held them for 444 days. There are no \ncircumstances under which the United States should grant such a person \na visa, and our immediate concern is to prevent Mr. Aboutalebi from \never setting foot on American soil.\n  But this nomination is not an isolated incident that is taking place \nin a vacuum. It is part of Iran's clear and consistent pattern of \nvirulent anti-Americanism that has defined their foreign policy since \n1979.\n  Given the larger strategic threat to the United States and our allies \nrepresented by Iran's nuclear ambitions, this is not the moment for \ndiplomatic niceties. We need to send Tehran an equally clear message: \nThe Senate is not going to ignore this most recent insult but, rather, \nis going to give our President the authority to affirmatively reject \nit. Unanimous passage of the bill I have introduced, which specifies \nthat engaging in terrorism against the United States is a basis to deny \na foreign U.N. ambassador a visa to enter our country, will do just \nthat, while also signaling to other unfriendly nations that we see this \nkind of offensive behavior for what it is, and we will not tolerate it.\n  I wish in particular to thank Senator Coats, who is a cosponsor of \nthis bill, as well as Senator Graham, Senator McCain, and Senator Kirk \nfor their leadership. I also wish to thank my friends across the aisle \nand, in particular, Senator Schumer, Senator Leahy, and Senator \nMenendez for working together with my office to reach bipartisan \nagreement. I am proud to join with all of my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle in this effort, and I am encouraged that we can all come \ntogether in a bipartisan manner on this national security issue that \ntranscends political parties. I am encouraged that the Senate can speak \nunanimously in a bipartisan voice defending the interests of our \nNation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the \nJudiciary be discharged from further consideration of S. 2195 and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2195) to deny admission to the United States to \n     any representative to the United Nations who is engaged in \n     espionage activities against the United States, poses a \n     threat to United States national security interests, or has \n     engaged in a terrorist activity against the United States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Cruz \namendment at the desk be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and \npassed, the Cruz amendment to the title be agreed to, and the motions \nto reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2960) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       On page 2, line 4, insert ``been found to have been'' after \n     ``has''.\n\n  The bill (S. 2195), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2195\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. VISA LIMITATION FOR CERTAIN REPRESENTATIVES TO THE \n                   UNITED NATIONS.\n\n       Section 407(a) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, \n     Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (8 U.S.C. 1102 note) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``such individual has been found to have \n     been engaged in espionage activities'' and inserting the \n     following: ``such individual--\n\n[[Page S2181]]\n\n       ``(1) has been found to have been engaged in espionage \n     activities or a terrorist activity (as defined in section \n     212(a)(3)(B)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(iii)))''; and\n       (2) by striking ``allies and may pose'' and inserting the \n     following: ``allies; and\n       ``(2) may pose''.\n\n  The amendment (No. 2961) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S2181, April 7, 2014, in the first column, the following \nlanguage appears: The amendment (No. 2361) was agreed to . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: The amendment (No, \n2961) was agreed to . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``A bill to deny admission \n     to the United States to any representative to the United \n     Nations who has been found to have been engaged in espionage \n     activities or a terrorist activity against the United States \n     and poses a threat to United States national security \n     interests.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I know my colleagues and good friends are \nwaiting. I will be very brief. I agree with the Senator from Texas that \nit was totally inappropriate that Mr. Aboutalebi was nominated in the \nfirst place. He was a member of the Muslim Student Followers of the \nImam's Line, the group that seized the embassy on November 4, 1979, and \nheld American staff hostage until 1981. There were New Yorkers I knew \namong that group.\n  While I believe that Mr. Aboutalebi's actions certainly would have \nmade him ineligible for a visa under the Immigration and Nationality \nAct, I believe it is worth it to clear up all doubt about our ability \nto deny him a visa under U.S. law by passing this bill.\n  I am fully aware that now is a sensitive time in our negotiations \nwith Iran regarding the future of the nuclear program. Nevertheless, it \nis exactly for this reason that Iran's leadership should not have \nunnecessarily escalated tensions with the United States by seeking to \nappoint an ambassador to the United Nations who materially aided \nterrorists who abducted American citizens. We should not further \naggravate the pain of the individuals and families who suffered through \nthe hostage crisis by allowing this individual to have a visa and \ndiplomatic immunity within the United States.\n  So I support this legislation. I am glad it has moved forward in a \nbipartisan way. I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for \nsupporting this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to recognize that this is a very \nimportant moment for the Senate to speak with one voice at a time when \nI think it matters to former hostages and their families. We heard you, \nSenator Cruz heard you, I heard you, and our friends on the other side \nheard you. So it is good to know that the Senate is listening to people \nwho have suffered in the past from this regime and Iran.\n  To Senators Leahy, Menendez, and Schumer, thank you very much for \nworking with Senator Cruz so we could reach this moment. I will do \neverything I can to get the House to act accordingly.\n  At the end of the day, it is very important that the Iranians not \nmistake how we view them. We have had our differences about Syria. We \nhave had foreign policy disputes between the administration and \nRepublicans, and sometimes Democrats, regarding how to move forward in \nthe world. But this is a unique moment when all 100 Senators support \nthe following statement to the Iranians: We remember who you are. We \nremember what you have done to our country and to our fellow citizens, \nand we are not going to forget. If you are listening in Iran, we have a \nvery clear-eyed view in the Senate of who we are dealing with. So this \nis a very appropriate time to speak with one voice. I hope the Iranians \nwill understand that we are resolved, Republicans and Democrats, to \nmake sure they never possess a nuclear weapon.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of this legislation, I \napplaud my colleagues who are here tonight. I think this is the right \nmessage to send. It is a sensitive time, so therefore we need to stand \nand be counted. I hope the House will act swiftly on this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/07/senate-section/article/S2181-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2181-S2188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n\n                          Jobs and the Economy\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise tonight at a time when we face a \nquiet crisis in this country. President Obama and many on the other \nside of the aisle tell us the economy has improved, we have turned a \ncorner, we are out of the woods, but I can tell my colleagues too many \nAmericans are being left behind. In fact, historic numbers of Americans \nare disconnected from work. It is a quiet crisis. It is affecting them \nand their families. It is affecting our economy in very fundamental \nways. It is one of the reasons we haven't seen the economic growth we \nhad hoped for because not enough Americans are involved in active work \nbecause so many are out of work. The unemployment numbers, by the way, \ndon't show the degree of the problem. An unemployment number around 7 \npercent doesn't show the fact that a lot of folks have left the work \nforce all together.\n  This crisis includes also 3.7 million long-term unemployed. These are \npeople who have been out of work for 6 months or more. This is also at \nhistoric levels. During this recent recession and during this weak \nrecovery over the last 5 years, we have had numbers of long-term \nunemployed, over 6 months, at historic levels. In fact, the number of \nlong-term unemployed right now is higher than it has been during any \nrecession in our Nation's history, except for the most recent one 5 \nyears ago.\n  Second, we have a lot of people who have left looking for work all \ntogether. So a lot of these folks were long-term unemployed, and they \nhave now given up looking for work. Some 10.5 million Americans aren't \neven counted in the unemployment numbers because they have given up \nlooking for work. The economists call this the labor participation \nrate. It is at historic lows for men, going back to the 1940s. In other \nwords, more men are out of work--and that means not working or not even \nlooking for a job--than we have ever had as a percentage of our \npopulation since we started keeping track of these statistics in the \n1940s.\n  For men and women combined, we can go back to the 1970s--the numbers \nare so low for the participation rate in work. That goes back to the \nCarter era, when we had double-digit unemployment, double-digit \ninflation, and double-digit interest rates. We have to go back to that \neconomy that was cratering in order to see the numbers of people who \nare out of work, not looking for work, and not even trying.\n  So we have a real problem in this country, and we are not addressing \nit. To make matters worse, people are saying: Well, Rob, this is \nactually the baby boomers, and it is people retiring early, so it is \nnot that bad. That is not true. To make matters worse, it is a lot of \nyoung people. There was a recent Brookings study that came out a couple \nweeks ago which indicates that actually a lot of the problem is young \nmen, single men, who are choosing not to work or cannot find a job and, \ntherefore, they drop out of the workforce altogether. Again, this is \nnot reflected in the unemployment numbers. This is not even reflected \nin the long-term unemployment numbers.\n  Disappointment after disappointment for many of these workers leads \nthem to give up looking for work altogether. These Americans feel as if \nwhat we are doing here in Washington does not really affect them and \ntheir lives. They feel as if we are not dealing with this issue, so the \nunderemployed, the unemployed, the long-term unemployed--the folks who \nare so disconnected from work that they are not even looking for a \njob--they are looking at us in Washington saying: What are you going to \ndo to help?\n  They are the reason I supported tonight this extension of \nunemployment insurance. Now, this was not exactly the legislation I \nwanted. But, also, it is not exactly the legislation that was brought \nto the floor. The other side of the aisle, the Democrats, brought \nlegislation to the floor that was a long-term extension on an emergency \nbasis. This is for people who have been out of work for over 26 weeks. \nThis is the Federal addition to the State unemployment insurance that \ngenerally is in place for people for up to 26 weeks. The Democratic \nversion was long-term--over a year. It also was not paid for, which \nwould take us further into debt and deficit, which would hurt the \neconomy. It also did not have any reforms.\n  The legislation that passed tonight with my vote--and some other \nRepublicans--had three things. No. 1, it is\n\n[[Page S2182]]\n\nshort term--5 months instead of a year. No. 2, it is paid for, so it \ndoes not take us further into debt and deficit. No. 3, it does have \nsome reforms to try to make the unemployment system work better to help \nthese people who are long-term unemployed who otherwise have very \nlittle prospect of getting gainful employment, being productive members \nof our economy.\n  In fact, there are some studies out there saying that only 10 to 15 \npercent of them would normally be likely to get a job once they are out \nof work for 6 months or more because of the resume gap, because of the \nskills gap. So we have in this legislation--that I will talk about \nlater in more detail--some reforms that add some skills training for \nthe long-term unemployed. The notion here is that there are jobs \navailable out there, and there are a lot of people, as we talked about, \nwho are out of work--or the long-term unemployed, in this case--but \nthey do not have the skills to match the jobs that are out there. So \nthe notion is to bring the skills and the jobs together to deal with \nthe skills gap.\n  Most on my side of the aisle--all but, I think, six of us--were \nagainst this unemployment extension because they argued that, instead, \nwe need progrowth policies to get this economy moving. I totally agree \nwith them about the progrowth policies. The ultimate solution here is \nnot another extension of unemployment insurance; it is to reform the \nprogram rather than just have another check, to add the skills \ntraining, which we will talk about in a second. We need to do more \nthere, but we also have to do what Jack Kennedy used to talk about. \nPresident Kennedy said, famously: A rising tide lifts all boats.\n  We need a rising tide. We need to create more economic growth and \nopportunity, and there is a plan to do this. It is called the Jobs for \nAmerica Plan. The Senate Republicans have all signed off on it. It has \nseven elements, all of which make a lot of sense.\n  One is to ensure, on health care, we actually reduce the cost, \nincrease choice. The economy is hurting now because the costs are going \nup, not down, and sometimes dramatically.\n  Another is an all-of-the-above energy strategy, to use the energy \nhere in the ground; having an all-of-the-above energy strategy to get \nAmerica's economy going, moving our economy forward. We can do a lot \nmore there.\n  Another is living within our means. The reason this unemployment \ninsurance extension was paid for is because we Republicans insisted on \nit. Why? Because the debt and deficit are like a wet blanket over the \neconomy. We do have to keep ourselves from going further into debt with \nour $17 trillion debt.\n  Another is having Tax Code reforms that are necessary to spur \neconomic growth. Both on the individual side and the business side our \nTax Code is antiquated and inefficient. It will help to give the \neconomy a shot in the arm if we can reform the Tax Code.\n  Another deals with regulations, unshackling job creators, helping to \nensure that regulations are sensible, that they are not making it more \ndifficult for small businesses to create jobs and opportunity. This is \nsomething we should be doing on a bipartisan basis.\n  Another is increasing exports. That means jobs. This President, this \nadministration, has not been able to move forward with any export \nagreements because the President has not been able to get trade \npromotion authority. In fact, some on the other side of the aisle have \nsaid he will not get it. That would be tragic for America's workers, \nfor America's farmers, for the people who provide services, who want to \npush for more exports because they create good-paying jobs and good \nbenefits.\n  Then, finally, and significantly, part of this Republican plan for \njobs is to create a competitive workforce to close the skills gap. That \nis what we are talking about here with the unemployment insurance \nissue. We need to ensure that our workforce is meeting the needs of the \n21st century--meaning a lot of technology jobs, even in manufacturing, \nadvanced manufacturing, bioscience jobs, information technology jobs. \nThose jobs are out there, as I said earlier. But, unfortunately, the \nFederal Government has not done a good job in providing the skills, \ngiving people the tools to access those jobs.\n  So we have made some steps in this legislation. The legislation we \npassed tonight ensures that job training reforms are part of long-term \nunemployment insurance. The reforms require officials to connect with \nthe unemployed early in the process and provide important information \nthey are now not getting about the skills and credentials that \nbusinesses in their area, in their region, are looking for.\n  We have also included provisions to strengthen the skills assessment \nprocess to ensure that the long-term unemployed have a better idea of \nthe specific skills necessary to become more competitive in the job \nmarket. That assessment is really important. A lot of these folks are \nstarting to give up hope. The assessment is important for them to \nunderstand where they are and where they can be.\n  These measures are intended to give the unemployed the opportunity to \nattain critical skills and credentials that are regionally relevant and \nnationally portable so they can access not only available jobs in their \narea but so that they can find other jobs around the country. There are \nsome States, as you know, where you have unemployment as low as 3 \npercent, and other States where unemployment is as high as 9 percent. \nSo people do need to know what the opportunities are, should they be \nable and willing to move.\n  So that is part of this unemployment extension we did tonight, and \nthat is something that was put in place because of negotiations between \nRepublicans and Democrats alike to ensure that, yes, it was paid for, \nand, yes, it was not long term--it was short term--and, third, that we \ndid put some skills training in place. I want to thank Senator Jack \nReed, Senator Dean Heller, and others who worked with us to ensure that \nwas part of this package.\n  But, folks, that is just the beginning. We have to do a lot more in \nterms of ensuring that our workforce programs in the Federal Government \nare meeting the needs of the 21st century.\n\n  So part of the Republican jobs plan is to say: Let's take the next \nstep. By the way, there is a commitment from both sides of the aisle, \nfrom the people who worked this out, to work during this short-term \nextension to try to increase the opportunities to provide people the \ntools they need.\n  We have big problems, as I said. We have a lot of people who are \nlong-term unemployed. It is at historic levels. We have historic levels \nof people who are disconnected from work altogether, and yet we have \njobs that are out there and available.\n  They say there are 3.9 million jobs around the country currently \navailable and unfilled--3.9 million jobs. That means about 25 percent \nof those who are out of the workforce could have an opportunity for a \njob if they had the skills and had the ability to meet the requirements \nfor those jobs.\n  In Ohio, we have over 100,000 jobs available. You can go on the Web \nsite and see them. These are not just part-time or minimum-wage \npositions. According to a recent study, Ohio is third--behind only \nCalifornia and Texas--in skilled factory job openings, full-time jobs \nwith benefits that often turn into long-term careers.\n  The problem of chronic unemployment is holding back our economy. By \nnot having the people to fill those jobs, the economy is not reaching \nits potential. In fact, some of those jobs are going overseas to find \nthose skilled workers. The Manufacturing Institute recently concluded \nthat 74 percent of manufacturers are experiencing workforce shortages \nor skills deficiency that keeps them from expanding their operations; \n74 percent of manufacturers are not expanding plants and equipment and \ncreating more jobs, as they could, because they do not have the \nworkforce.\n  So I view this unemployment insurance debate as an opportunity--an \nopportunity to talk about this issue, an opportunity to put in place \nsome initial reforms, some first steps for more skills assessment, more \ntraining, to encourage people to get the credentials they need to get a \njob. But it is only the first step. We should do much, much more.\n  The Federal Government is already very involved, by the way, in work \nretraining--not in a very productive way but very involved. There are \n47 different Federal workforce training programs spread over 7, 8 or 9 \ndepartments\n\n[[Page S2183]]\n\nand agencies, often overlapping. Often the right hand does not know \nwhat the left hand is doing. It costs us, by the way, as taxpayers \nabout $15 billion a year. So about $15 billion a year is going into \nworker retraining. Yet look at the results--again, record numbers of \nthe long-term unemployed, record numbers of men disconnected from work. \nSomething is not working.\n  The Government Accountability Office found that very little is known \nabout the effectiveness of these 47 programs. They have said, \nunbelievably, that only five of these Federal programs have conducted \nan impact study of their efforts since 2004. So 47 programs and only 5 \nhave conducted the kind of performance measures you would expect the \ngovernment to do to be sure the taxpayers' money is being spent right \nand that you certainly would be doing in the private sector.\n  The GAO is kind of generous in its assessment because those millions \nof unfilled jobs and millions more struggling workers are as \nincriminating an indictment of our worker training programs as any \nimpact study could ever be.\n  This is the story I hear all the time. Back home in Ohio, when I talk \nto workers, when I talk to businesses, when I talk to educators, people \nare frustrated. People are seeing these Federal dollars being spent but \nnot for actual training. What is unbelievable to me is recent data \nshows us that the number of credentials people are getting through \nthese Federal workforce training programs is actually going down, not \nup--at a time when it is clear that credentials are a key way to get a \njob.\n  It is unfair to employers who have open positions that they cannot \nfind qualified candidates to fill them. It is unfair to taxpayers who \nsend money to Washington believing the government is going to be a good \nsteward of those funds, and it is not. And, of course, it is unfair to \nthe millions of Americans who want to build a better life for \nthemselves and for their families, but they need the tools.\n  A lot of jobs were lost in this last recession. Unfortunately, I \nbelieve a lot of them are not coming back. But other jobs are being \ncreated. But, again, they are jobs that require a higher level of \nskill. We have to be sure we are doing a better job providing people \nwith those tools to get the skills they need. It is part of the plan \nthat Senate Republicans are talking about.\n  A small step was taken tonight with the unemployment insurance \nextension. I do not think we necessarily explained it very well to all \nof our colleagues, but it was part of what happened tonight on the \nfloor of the Senate. I am hopeful over the next few months we will take \nthe next important step, which is actually to change the way these \nFederal programs work so they are more effective at dealing with this \ncrisis.\n  I have a specific proposal that I like. It is called the CAREER Act. \nThe CAREER Act--you can look at it on line. Go to portman.senate.gov. \nMy cosponsor is Michael Bennet, who spoke here earlier tonight. He is a \nDemocrat from Colorado. He is a former education superintendent. He \nunderstands we need to change these programs to make them more \nefficient. To incentivize success, we have performance measures in our \nproposal, for instance. We do need to streamline and consolidate these \nprograms. We also need to be sure we are rewarding job training \nproviders that produce measurable results in actual job placement. It \nseems it is a pretty simple concept, but it is not happening now, as \nthe GAO told us.\n  The unemployment extension, in my view, buys us a couple more months. \nBut that is time where we ought to be doing the hard work to ensure \nthat workers have the skills they need to compete in this global \neconomy. Again, companies look globally for workers these days--\nparticularly larger companies. If we are not providing the skilled \nworkforce here, our economy is not as productive as it could be, not \nmeeting its potential, the rising tide is not lifting all boats because \nit is not rising. But we are also going to lose jobs overseas where \nthere is more focus on the STEM disciplines, on engineering and math, \non skills training.\n  We have to do a much better job at the Federal Government level, \nworking with the States, working with the private sector. One thing we \ndo in the CAREER Act is we connect the Federal funds with the actual \nprivate-sector jobs that out there to ensure we are getting a better \nresult--not training people for jobs that are not even available.\n  So let's spend these next few months working on more strategies to \nhelp folks get jobs. Let's work on all of this because we need to have \na growing economy. But with regard to the training part, let's fix a \nsystem that is not serving the unemployed. It is not serving the \ntaxpayer. Let's deal with this crisis. Let's restore hope and \nopportunity to America's workers.\n  With that, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                          Wage Discrimination\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleagues in \naddressing an issue that affects women and families across America \nevery day; that is, wage discrimination. Over 50 years have passed \nsince the Equal Pay Act was signed into law to require that men and \nwomen earn equal pay for equal work. Yet the wage gap between men and \nwomen remains persistently wide.\n  Tomorrow, April 8, is Equal Pay Day, the day that women's earnings \nfinally catch up to what men earned during the previous calendar year. \nWomen across our country have had to work more than 3 months into this \nyear to match what their male colleagues made in 2013. It is time to \nend gender discrimination in pay.\n  That is why I am proud to again stand on the Senate floor as a \ncosponsor and strong supporter of the Paycheck Fairness Act. This \nimportant bill would close loopholes in our existing equal pay laws and \nensure that gender-based pay discrimination cannot happen in the first \nplace.\n  Some still question why we need this legislation. The numbers make it \npretty clear. More than 50 years after the Equal Pay Act was passed \nwomen in America still earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by \nmen. In North Carolina it is a little better but still far from equal. \nWomen earn 82 cents for every dollar earned by men doing the same work. \nTo be sure, we have seen remarkable progress among women in North \nCarolina over the last 20 years.\n  Women have higher levels of education than men of the same age, and \nthe share of employed women in my State who work in managerial and \nprofessional occupations has increased from 26 to 40 percent. While \nincreased education has improved women's pay, it has not reduced the \npay gap. Men are earning more money than women across all major sectors \nof the economy and at every educational level.\n  In fact, women in North Carolina who have some college education or \nan associates degree still earn less on average than men who have only \nreceived a high school diploma. In 2014, that is simply unacceptable.\n  I will never forget a constituent whom I met at an event back home in \nNorth Carolina. A woman had her young son with her. They both had T-\nshirts on that had a number on the front. The mother's shirt said \n``94.'' The son's shirt said ``50.'' If earnings continue at the slow \npace at which they are growing now, those numbers, the 94 and the 50, \nsignify the ages those two individuals will be when pay equality is \nfinally achieved.\n  Sadly, at the rate we are progressing, most of us in the Senate will \nnot live to see that day. We cannot afford to wait another few decades \nfor this change. This wage gap has real consequences, not just for \nwomen but for their families too. In North Carolina alone, women head \nover 500,000 households. Women and families' economic security is put \nat risk when they are paid less than men for performing the same job.\n  In North Carolina women who are employed full time lose approximately \n$9.8 billion each year due to the wage gap. Once again, just in North \nCarolina, these women, employed full time, lose approximately $9.8 \nbillion. That is real money. That is money that could be spent on a \ndownpayment or a mortgage for a home, put away for their child's \ncollege savings or invested in a secure retirement.\n  Also in North Carolina there are 108,000 households with incomes \nbelow the poverty line headed by women. Closing the wage gap would help \nput food on the table for them, gas in their\n\n[[Page S2184]]\n\ncar, and pay basic necessities such as rent and utilities. In fact, \nclosing the wage gap would allow a working woman in North Carolina to \nafford 63 more weeks of food, 6 more months of mortgage and utility \npayments, 10 more months of rent or 2,200 additional gallons of gas by \nchanging that wage gap.\n  Addressing those disparities is critical to promoting the well-being \nof local economies across North Carolina and nationwide. When women \nthrive at work, their families and communities prosper as well. Later \nthis week I will be voting for equal pay and to end wage \ndiscrimination. I am hopeful that partisan gamesmanship does not get in \nthe way of a bipartisan issue that Democrats and Republicans, women and \nmen across the country, overwhelmingly support. Congress needs to come \ntogether and pass the Paycheck Fairness Act because we need a stronger \nequal pay law to prohibit employers from retaliating against employees \nwho discuss salary information with their coworkers. We need a stronger \nequal pay law to empower women to better negotiate their salaries and \nwages. We need a stronger equal pay law to provide businesses, \nespecially small ones, assistance with equal pay practices.\n  On this eve of the anniversary of the Equal Pay Act, we need to close \nthe loophole that allows pay discrimination to happen in the first \nplace. The Paycheck Fairness Act would do just that by helping women \nsuccessfully fight for the equal pay they have earned. In today's tough \neconomic landscape, equal pay is about more than just principle, it is \nabout ensuring an economically sound future for all of our families.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Colombia\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak to two \nissues, both in the Western Hemisphere, that I think are incredibly \nimportant. I come to the floor to speak about labor rights in Colombia \nand labor rights of workers around the world.\n  Three years ago today the U.S. and Colombian Governments announced \nthe creation of a Labor Action Plan that identified concrete steps to \naddress the challenges faced by Colombian workers--threats, deadly \nviolence, and widespread informality that opens the door to worker \nabuse.\n  Both governments said that the implementation of the plan would be a \nprecondition to enacting the free-trade agreement between our two \ncountries. At the time I advocated that the standards laid out in the \nLabor Action Plan should have been part of the formal free-trade \nagreement and should have included provisions for monitoring the plan's \nimplementation.\n  It is true that the Colombian Government initially made impressive \nsteps, but unfortunately other aspects of the plan have not been \nfulfilled. Today the AFL-CIO and Colombia's National Union School have \nreleased reports evaluating the Labor Action Plan and identifying key \nareas where implementation has fallen short. I come to the floor to \nshare these key findings.\n  In February I traveled to Colombia and met with Colombian union \nleaders and representatives of the National Labor School. I had a \nchance to meet with President Santos and Minister of Labor Rafael \nPardo. We had the opportunity to review the important steps the \nColombian Government has taken and what still needs to be done.\n  Shortly after the Labor Action Plan was established in April of 2011, \nnearly overnight Colombia established an independent Ministry of Labor. \nTo date, the Ministry has hired more than 480 new labor inspectors and \ncreated a formal complaint mechanism for workers and unionists.\n  The Colombian Government reformed its penal code to strengthen \nsanctions against employers violating rights to free association. The \nMinistry of Labor has opened nearly 400 investigations of violations \nand issued nearly 70 sanctions. The government has directed its \nprotection units to concentrate efforts on labor activists who are \nunder threat. As a result of these steps, Colombia has made progress. \nAccording to the Colombian Government's own statistics, more than \n530,000 jobs have been formalized in accordance with government \nstandards.\n  While it is important to acknowledge the progress that has been made, \nthe reports released today by the AFL-CIO and Colombia's National Union \nSchool remind us that much more needs to be done. Aspects of the Labor \nAction Plan remain unfinished and risks to Colombian workers continue, \nspecifically in the palm oil industry, sugar sector, oil industry, and \nports sector.\n  Both reports point out, while some trade unionists have seen better \nprotection from the government, others continue to face threats and \nviolence. In 2013, 26 trade unionists were murdered. Equally troubling \nwas the fact that in the cases of murdered trade unionists, 86.8 \npercent go unresolved in terms of the cases. The two reports recognize \nthat in response to the Labor Action Plan, the Colombian Government \ntook steps to address irregular contracting practices, specifically \nfocusing on associated work cooperatives or CTAs as they are known.\n  But given the loopholes in new labor regulations that have come to \nlight, the government has been unable to stem the rise of alternate \nhiring, such as simplified joint stock companies that keep workers from \nbeing directly hired and being entitled to benefits and collective \nbargaining rights. So there has been progress but clearly more needs to \nbe done.\n  The report rightfully applauds the creation of the Ministry of Labor \nbut also notes that the hiring of labor inspectors did not comply with \ninternational labor organization standards, severely affecting these \ninspectors' autonomy and technical capacity. As further evidence of the \nchallenges of informal labor arrangements, a majority of labor \ninspectors are provisional hires.\n  When it comes to finding those guilty of violations, the Colombian \nGovernment has levied millions of dollars in fines against companies \nviolating labor standards, but both the AFL-CIO and the National Labor \nSchool point out that not a single dollar of those millions of fines \nhas been collected--not one.\n  Fines hardly constitute a deterrent if companies know they will never \nhave to pay the bill. As the U.S. and Colombian Governments along with \norganized labor in the United States and Colombia look forward, it is \nimportant that everyone come to the table, identify targeted goals, and \nestablish benchmarks that will bring the kind of change we are all \nlooking for, lasting change that protects workers and worker rights.\n  Given that the United States and Colombia renewed the Labor Action \nPlan through the end of 2014, now is the time to renew political \ncommitment. Now is the time for collective action. Having met with \nMinister Pardo and knowing our colleagues in the Department of Labor, I \nknow the political will is there. Now is the time for swift action.\n  Lessons from Colombia should be lessons for all of us, as the United \nStates continues to engage in trade negotiations around the world. Our \ntrade agreements must include the highest labor standards, concrete \nbenchmarks for guaranteeing compliance with these standards, and a \nclear plan to monitor implementation. Anything less will leave the most \nvulnerable around the world at risk.\n  We are moving in the right direction when it comes to protecting \nworkers and workers' rights in Colombia and around the world. Let's \nkeep moving forward and aspire to the highest labor standards in every \nnation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Cuba\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. As the attention of the world has been focused on the \npre-1991 Soviet behavior of President Putin in Crimea, I come to the \nfloor to remind the American public and Members of this body that there \nis also a full-fledged humanitarian rights crisis ongoing in our own \nhemisphere, just 90 miles away from our shores in Cuba.\n\n[[Page S2185]]\n\n  As Ukrainians courageously fight to protect the democracy they won \nwhen the Berlin Wall fell 25 years ago this summer, the Cuban people \ncontinue to suffer from the oppression of a Soviet-style dictatorship \nthat denies them the most basic rights. When the Soviet Union dissolved \nin 1991, millions of people--from Kiev to Budapest to Africa to Asia--\nwere given their first chances in decades to build their own \ngovernments, a first chance to organize democratic elections, the \nchance to begin to determine their own futures.\n  Since the end of the Cold War, peace, prosperity and progress has \nlargely been the order of the day for hundreds of millions of people \nbut not for the people of Cuba. Not one of those core principles of \ndemocracy can be found on the island. Fidel and Raul Castro have been \nthe only names on any ballot in over 50 years. Not one free election \nhas been held, not one Cuban has been allowed to own their own company, \nnot one legitimate trade union has been allowed to be organized, and \nnot one peaceful protest has occurred without being brutally squashed \nby the regime.\n  No, this is the reality of Cuba today. It was the reality when the \nBerlin Wall fell, and it has been Cuba's reality for almost 60 years \nsince Fidel Castro began taking control of every aspect of Cuban life. \nThis reality in Cuba, a decades-long brutal oppression of simple human \ndemocratic rights, with total disdain for the aspirations of a people \nby the Castro regime, its military and communist lackey thugs who \npenetrate and control people's lives at all levels, should not be \noverlooked, should not be romanticized and it can never be explained \naway.\n  But, unlike Ukraine, where we have watched in horror as people have \nbeen ruthlessly beaten and killed for simply aspiring to democratic and \ntransparent government, the Castro regime does not allow images of its \noppression to be broadcast around the globe, let alone at home. Just \nbecause we do not see those images streaming across television sets and \nin the newspapers does not mean the world should not be watching. It \ndoes not mean we have turned the other way, and it does not mean we \nhave overlooked the brutal and oftentimes lethal oppression of the \nCastro regime.\n  The number of people the regime has murdered or abducted is in the \ntens of thousands. Hundreds of thousands of children have been \nseparated from their parents, maybe hundreds of thousands of families \nhave been torn apart. We don't even know how many have died in the \nFlorida straits in search of freedom.\n  Millions of men, women, and young people have been forced into fields \nto cut sugarcane and perform other hard labor against their will. The \naverage human worker lives on an income of less than $1 a day. The \nCastro regime has been most adept--not at spreading education and \nprosperity--I listened to some of my colleagues recently on the floor \nand, oh my God, what a paradise, a paradise that people are willing to \ntake to makeshift rafts to flee from and die on the high seas, a \nparadise that has long lines at the U.S. interests section waiting to \nbe able to come to the United States, such a paradise that there are \nwell over 1 million Cuban Americans in the United States and others in \nSpain and throughout the world.\n  It is not a paradise that I think people flee from. But they are \ngreat--not at spreading education and prosperity, but at instilling a \npenetrating fear and terror in the style of a Stalinist police state. \nIt has been going on since 1959. Unfortunately, these are all of the \nrealities. It is not a thing of the past.\n  Let us not overlook the fact that arbitrary and politically motivated \narrests in Cuba reportedly topped 1,000 for a third straight month this \nFebruary, according to the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and \nNational Reconciliation, a group inside of Cuba, formed and founded by \nElizardo Sanchez Santa-Cruz--whose mission is to bring change and \nfreedom--to report to the world. The commission reported that:\n\n       . . . arrests in the past three months have nearly doubled \n     from the monthly averages of the previous 2 years.\n\n  We must remind ourselves every day of the continued oppression and \nhuman suffering that is happening, not halfway around the world but 90 \nmiles from our own shores. The ongoing oppressive behavior of the Cuban \nregime we saw for the last half of the 20th century still haunts our \nhemisphere today.\n  While Putin has annexed Crimea, while one wonders what is next, while \nAssad continues to kill his own people in Syria, while the world is \nwatching the Taliban in Afghanistan, and violence continues in the \nCentral African Republic taking countless lives, the oppression of the \nCastro regime keeps rolling along unabated.\n  If there is a single symbol of that oppression, of the longing for \nfreedom in Cuba, it is the Ladies in White, Damas de Blanco, and their \nleader Berta Soler.\n  This is a picture of Berta. The courage she has displayed, along with \nall the other women, to promote democracy and political freedom in Cuba \nhas served as an extraordinary example for all of us and everyone \naround the world who longs to be free. Every Sunday they protest the \njailing of their relatives by attending mass and quietly marching \nthrough the streets of Havana, praying for nothing more than the \nfreedom of their relatives and respect for the human rights of all \nCubans.\n  But, as we see in this picture, often arrested, roughed-up--let's go \nto the previous picture. These are some of the of the Ladies in White. \nAll they do is dress up in white, they march with a gladiola--quietly--\ntoward church. The response of the state regime is to detain them, beat \nthem, jail them, and hold them for days, maybe weeks. They are \nreleased, then jailed again.\n  The Ladies in White are the symbol of freedom, and women such as \nLaura Pollan represent the story of thousands. She was a schoolteacher \nliving with her husband Hector, the leader of the outlawed Cuban \nLiberal Party. They were living a normal life in a small house on \nNeptune Street in Havana.\n\n  Early one morning there was a pounding on the front door. The police \ncame in, searched everything. There was a sham trial held in Cuba. \nHector was imprisoned, sentenced to 20 years in jail, and accused of \nacting against national security. His crime was dreaming of a free Cuba \nand putting that dream in writing.\n  Since I last came to the floor to speak about Cuba, I met Rosa Maria \nPaya, the daughter of the long-time political activist Oswaldo Paya. He \nwas a Catholic and head of the Christian Liberation Movement who \ncollected 25,000 signatures under a project called the Varela Project, \na peaceful effort to petition the regime under the existing Cuban \nConstitution for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. For his \npeaceful efforts he was awarded the Sakharov prize by the European \nParliament.\n  His peaceful efforts were seen as a danger to the regime, a threat \nfor which he was detained and arrested many times. Many times he \nsuffered at the hands of the regime, and last year he died in Cuba, \nkilled as Cuban state security rammed his car off the road.\n  What we know is that the car, driven by a Spanish politician from \nSpain, Angel Carromero, a citizen of Spain, and Jens Aron Modig, a \nparty activist in Sweden, was involved in the fatal automobile accident \nthat killed Paya and his Cuban colleague Harold Cepero. The \ncircumstances surrounding Paya's death lead any reasonable person to \nconclude what really happened on that road in eastern Cuba that took \nthe life of Oswaldo was an assassination. His daughter Rosa Maria \nimmediately challenged the regime's version of events, stating that the \nfamily had received information from the survivors that their car was \nrepeatedly rammed by another vehicle. She said:\n\n       So we think it's not an accident. They wanted to do harm \n     and then ended up killing my father.\n\n  Ms. Paya was in Washington not long ago accepting a posthumous award \nfrom the National Endowment for Democracy on behalf of another Cuban \nactivist who died alongside her father. At the time the U.N. Ambassador \nto the United Nations Samantha Power had come before the Foreign \nRelations Committee during the nominations process and assured me she \nwould reach out to Ms. Paya when confirmed. Since then, she has not \nonly met with Rosa Maria but also to directly challenge Cuba's Foreign \nMinister to permit an independent international investigation into Mr. \nPaya's death.\n  I want to commend Ambassador Power for standing with those still \nsuffering in Cuba and with the family of\n\n[[Page S2186]]\n\nOswaldo Paya who died for advocating peaceful, democratic change and \nChristian values.\n  But Cuba's reach doesn't end with the detention or the death of \ndissidents such as Paya. It doesn't end at the water's edge. It goes \nmuch farther.\n  Cuba is the head of a new and dire crisis in our hemisphere that we \ncannot ignore, and now we see the same oppression of peaceful activists \nin Cuba on the streets of Caracas.\n  Venezuela's political crisis is growing: 40 dead, hundreds injured, \nthe nation's economy deteriorating, inflation at record levels, and a \nscarcity of basic food and goods. It sounds like Cuba to me.\n  But behind Venezuela's economic crisis we can see Cuba's failed \npolicies, expropriation, and nationalization of various sectors of the \neconomy, fixed prices in the consumer economy, criminalization of \nbusiness leaders and their companies, currency manipulation, and \nrationing of basic foodstuffs. Behind Venezuela's political crisis we \ncan clearly see familiar Cuban tactics--the demonization of the \ndissent, intolerance, and oppression of any form of opposition, \npoliticizing of the military and judiciary, the silencing of \nindependent television and radio stations, the shutting down of \nnewspapers, and the arrests of political opponents doing nothing more \nthan exercising basic rights to freedom of assembly.\n  We see Cuba's destabilizing presence is deeply intertwined in \nVenezuela's crisis, not simply because of the actions but because of \nthese facts. It started with the discovery of 29 Cuban spies on \nMargarita Island in Venezuela.\n  It grew steadily and insidiously throughout the Chavez years with the \nCuban presence and key advisers from Havana in almost every institution \nof national government in Venezuela, from the military, to intelligence \nagencies, to the health sector, to industrial policy. And the result? \nDemocracy subverted and innocent people dying from bullets fired by the \ngovernment and its thugs, just like in Cuba.\n  Yet knowing the instability the Cuban regime continues to spread, \namazing, amazing European nations, nations in Latin America, then the \nCaribbean, some of my colleagues in this Chamber are seeking new \nopportunities to engage the Cuban regime by easing sanctions at a \ncritical moment and fundamentally redefining our relationship with \nCuba.\n  I couldn't disagree more. We can never turn our back on what has \nhappened and continues to happen inside of Cuba. We can never have a \nwink and a nod and say, well, it has been almost 50 years, that is long \nenough. Things are changing for the better in Cuba so we should ease \nsanctions when, in fact, that is not the case at all.\n  As I listen to these human rights activists who finally have been \nable to come from Cuba and visit with us, to a person, they have said \nto me when I have asked them, is there change? They laugh and say: \nSenator, no, of course, there is no change. Is there a change in the \neconomic system? No, there is no change. Is there change in your \nability to organize? No, there is no change.\n  They call for some of the most significant measures that I could \nimagine--based upon them being in the belly of the beast, not some \nromanticism from outside. So, no, we should not ease sanctions. That is \nnot what they are calling for. We should not let up and we should not \nreward the Castro regime for its human rights violations, for the \nsuffering it continues to cause the people of Cuba. We should not \nreward the regime of the long dark years that have been brought to the \nisland. And we should not ease tourism restrictions simply because the \nclock is ticking. Those who wish to pursue that type of engagement with \nCuba must not forget Cuba's history. It is also its present state of \ntorture and oppression, its systemic curtailment of freedom.\n  Recent events tell us a different story than those who have the sense \nof romanticism about the Castro regime. It is the story of two \nterrorist states: Cuba and North Korea.\n  There is unshakable, undeniable, incontrovertible proof that the \nCuban Government, colluding with North Korea, violated United Nations \nsecurity sanctions regimes.\n  In July of last year, a North Korean ship was docked in Cuba's new \nMariel Port facility. The North Korean ship--suspicious even to the \nmost untrained observer--left the dock, and it wasn't long afterward it \nwas seized by the Panamanian Government when it attempted to enter the \nPanama Canal. Panamanian authorities boarded the ship and what did they \nfind? There in the cargo bays, under some 200,000 bags of sugar, \nauthorities discovered 240 tons of weapons--bound for where? For where? \nNorth Korea, another terrorist state.\n  Apparently this evidence, to some of my colleagues, is not of \nconcern, but that is not the end of the story. When authorities \ninventoried the 240 tons of weapons hidden beneath the 200,000 bags of \nsugar they found on the North Korean ship, they found 2 MiG aircraft, \nseveral SA-2, SA-3 surface-to-air missile systems, missile and radar \ncomponents, and a cache of small arms and rocket-propelled grenades.\n  This is a depiction from the U.N. sources of what was found. I ask my \ncolleagues, is this the behavior of a tired and old, benign regime, one \nthat deserves our sympathy? Is there a misunderstanding that does not \ncheck enough terrorist boxes? Is this something we should justifiably \nignore, falling under the category of Castro will be Castro or is this, \nat its core, the active and dangerous play of a terrorist state that we \nwould not tolerate from any other Nation?\n  It seems to me that supplying a rogue nation such as North Korea with \na secret cache of weapons demands something more than the loosening of \ntravel restrictions and the opening of trade. It demands exactly the \nopposite. We should treat Cuba and the Castro regime as we would treat \nany other state sponsor of terrorism, because it is. Yet here I am once \nagain forced to come to the floor of the Senate to point to pictures of \na North Korean ship in a Cuban port smuggling MiG aircraft and surface-\nto-air missiles and ask: Why should we turn a blind eye to what we \nclearly would not accept from Iran, Syria or Sudan? And why in God's \nname would we want to take this opportunity to reward the regime with \ncashflow so they can continue to oppress their people and subvert \nneighboring countries? Why should we accept the lame excuses given by \nthe Cuban regime that somehow--despite the fact that many of the arms \nwere still in their original packaging, despite the fact that others \nhad been recently calibrated, despite the fact there was a fresh coat \nof paint over the insignia of the Cuban Air Force on the side of the \nMiGs to hide their origin, despite the fact that the entire shipment \nwas covered with 200,000 bags of sugar to deceive--this was a purely \ninnocent business transaction, an innocent business transaction, and \nthat the arms were being sent to North Korea for maintenance and would \nhave been returned to the island?\n  Does anyone actually believe such a ludicrous claim? Can we and \nshould we simply ignore it and move on, even though U.N. weapons \ninspectors found that the shipment was a clear violation--a clear \nviolation--of U.N. sanctions, that Cuba was the first country in the \nWestern Hemisphere to violate international sanctions related to North \nKorea and that the shipment constituted the largest amount of arms \nshipped to or from North Korea since the adoption of Security Council \nresolution 1874 in 2009 and resolution 2094 in 2013? I repeat, the \nlargest amount of arms shipped to or from North Korea. If that is not \nfood for thought when it comes to easing restrictions against a \nterrorist state to our south, I don't know what is.\n  In recent years some would have us believe--and I have listened to \nsome of my colleagues--that reforms led by Raul Castro placed Cuba on a \npath to economic progress, but if we look at the new law on foreign \ninvestment Cuba just passed last week, we get a clearer picture of the \ntruth behind Cuba's economic model.\n  Let's be clear about this economic model. Under Cuba's new foreign \ninvestment law, investment projects will be allowed to be fully funded \nby foreign capital, business taxes on profits would be cut by 50 \npercent, foreign companies would be exempt from paying taxes for the \nfirst 8 years of operations in Cuba, and many foreigners living in Cuba \nwould be let off the hook from paying income taxes at all. Think about \nit. The question is, Who wins? Who wins? Not the people of Cuba.\n\n[[Page S2187]]\n\n  The most glaring omission in this law is any benefit at all to the \nCuban people. Instead of receiving a new investment opportunity or \nbenefiting from tax cuts--although Cubans don't make enough to benefit \nfrom any tax cuts--they will continue to live under restrictive laws \nand regulations, unable to start their own business, unable to follow a \ndream or build a better life. They are left to live under the most \nrestrictive laws preventing them from ever realizing their dreams for \nthemselves and their families.\n  In fact, the Cuban regime has permitted people to work for themselves \nbut only in 200 types of jobs the government officially sanctions. They \nhave a list of authorized jobs that includes sewing buttons, filling \ncigarette lighters, street performing--not exactly lucrative startups \nthat can build an economy. These authorized jobs bear more resemblance \nto a feudal economy than anything we would recognize as economic \nopportunity.\n  At the same time the government has moved aggressively to close \ninhome movie theaters, secondhand clothing markets, and fledgling \nprivate restaurants that it considers too large or too successful. Why? \nBecause anything that allows Cubans to meet legally, lawfully, and as a \ngroup is seen as a threat to the regime. Simply allowing people to come \ntogether for what we take for granted in our country and most countries \nin the world is seen as a threat to the regime because God knows what \nthose Cubans would do if they started talking to each other in a place \nwhere they had no fear.\n  While the Cuban Government offers new incentives to foreign investors \nand continues to clamp down on self-employed workers, the real economic \nchange in Cuba is the growing role of the Cuban Armed Forces in the \ncountry's economy. Under the watchful eye of Raul Castro's son-in-law, \na general in the Cuban Armed Forces, the military holding company, \nGAESA, has amassed control of more than 40 percent of Cuba's economy. \nThrough companies such as GAESA, the government and the Armed Forces--\nthose most loyal to the Castros--are laying a foundation for its future \ncontrol of Cuba and the Cuban economy.\n  On the economic front, I think it is important to make the point that \nwhen people argue for travel and trade with Cuba, they are arguing to \ndo so with who--with Castro's monopolies. Let us be clear: Regular \nCubans are prohibited from engaging in foreign trade and commerce. So \ndo we want to trade with Castro's state-owned monopolies--monopolies \nthat are largely controlled by the Armed Forces of Cuba? Do we? Do we \ntruly want to reward a regime that sends the biggest amount of weapons \nto North Korea in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions?\n  The U.S. Government's own report of agricultural sales to Cuba states \nhow every single transaction with Cuba, by hundreds of American \nagricultural companies, has only one counterpart--Castro's food \nmonopoly through a state-owned company named Alimport. That hasn't \nhelped the people one bit. So do we truly want to unleash billions to \nCastro's monopolies?\n  Also, every single foreign people-to-people traveler who currently \nstays at a hotel or resort owned by whom? By the Cuban military. No \nexceptions. No exceptions. So how does that promote independence of the \nCuban people from the regime as President Obama's policy statement upon \nrelease of this regulation states? At the very least they should be \ncompelled to stay at what we call a casa particular, which means a \nprivate home that used to be able to take in a visitor, but staying at \nthe military facilities owned by the military or copartnering by the \nmilitary with some foreign private sector contravenes the President's \nown policy statement.\n  This hardly constitutes an economic opening for the people of Cuba. \nBy the way, if you are an individual Cuban, you can't go to a foreign \ncompany. You can't even go to the hotels in your own country unless you \nare invited in by a foreigner. You work there if the state sends you \nthere. Those of us who get to work here, we actually would only be here \nbecause the state would send us here, not because through our abilities \nand competency we would have earned the opportunity to be employed here \nor anywhere else in this country or in the private sector. That is not \npossible for the average Cuban. So in their own country they cannot go \nto a hotel unless they are invited in by a foreigner. Imagine visiting \nthroughout our country and not being able to go into a hotel unless \nsomebody from some other country tells you you can go into it.\n  However, if there is one positive trend to be found in Cuba today it \nis that after decades of fear and self-imposed silence there is a \ngrowing and growing number of Cuban citizens beginning to speak out \ncritically, increasingly in public.\n  In June of 2012, Jorge Luis Garcia Perez--known as Antunez--testified \nat my invitation before the Foreign Relations Committee via Skype from \nthe U.S. intrasection, as you can see in this photograph. After he \ntestified he was beaten and detained for his testimony on human rights \nabuses on the island, but that didn't stop him. It didn't stop the \nbloggers from the Cuban diasporo from getting the word out.\n  After decades of being manipulated by the Castros, the people of Cuba \nno longer identify with the government. While the government still \nholds power through its security operations, its legitimacy is \nplummeting in the opinions of its people. So after 55 years of \ndictatorship, it is our responsibility in the international community \nto encourage this independence and help the people of Cuba reclaim \ntheir rights--rights to freedom of expression, rights to organize \nunions, rights to freedom of assembly, rights to freedom of the press, \nrights to freedom of religion--universal human rights, the rights and \nfreedoms that will be the building blocks of a new and Democratic Cuba \nof the future.\n  But let us not be misled. Although Berto Soler--the ladies in white \nthat I showed earlier--is now allowed by the regime to visit the United \nStates and Europe after an enormous amount of international pressure, \nwhen she returns to Cuba there is no change in the status of the ladies \nin white. The pictures I showed of the beatings and the arrests is \nstill their reality. Every move she and her courageous partners make is \nmonitored by the Castro regime. They are physically harassed \nintimidated and arrested. Why? For simply wanting what any mother in \nany country on the face of the Earth wants--to learn the fate of her \nhusband, her son or daughter who has been harassed, beaten and jailed \nby an aging, illegitimate regime.\n  According to the Cuban Commissioner for Human Rights and National \nReconciliation, there were more than 15,000 cases of arbitrarily, \npolitically motivated detentions since the start of 2012. In January of \nthis year, when 30 heads of State from Latin America and the Caribbean \ncame together, as well as the Secretary General of the United Nations \nand the Secretary General of the OAS, at a summit in Havana, there were \nmore than 1,050 detentions over the course of 1 month.\n  In one prominent case, a leading Afro-Cuban political activist, \nintellectual, and known leftist Manuel Cuesta Morua was arrested after \nattempting--to do what? To organize a parallel civil society summit \nduring the visit by the heads of state.\n  This simple practice--a practice not uncommon and, in fact ubiquitous \nthroughout Latin America and the world--is not tolerated by the Castro \nregime.\n  Instead, Mr. Cuesta Morua faced 5 days of intensive interrogation and \nhas been charged with ``disseminating false news against international \npeace,'' joining prominent activists Jorge Luis Garcia Perez Antunez \nand Guillermo Farinas--who was awarded the Sakharov Prize by the \nEuropean Parliament--simply because they knew there were heads of state \nthroughout Latin America and of major international organizations \nwanting to hold a parallel meeting, peacefully doing so to promote \ntheir vision of what human rights and democracy should be inside of \ntheir country. Their result was to ultimately be jailed and face the \ncharges which can leave them for many years in jail.\n  Unfortunately, except for one or two, most of the leaders of the \nhemisphere who went to that meeting didn't even try to meet with the \nhuman rights activists, political dissidents, or independent \njournalists because they did not want to insult the Castro regime.\n  Here is Farinas shown being taken away by the police. These activists\n\n[[Page S2188]]\n\nhave faced repeated brutal acts at the hands of the Castro regime--no \nless violent than the regimes of any other terrorist state.\n  Finally, it is important to note that detentions, violence, and \nharassment are not reserved for political activists alone but also \ndirected at labor rights activists as well. In early March of this year \nAFL-CIO President Trumka called on the Cuban Government to end its \nharassment of Mr. Cuesta Morua and all independent union activists \nadvocating for labor rights to protect Cuban workers, such as Morua and \nMaria Elena Mir and her colleagues.\n  American workers are not turning a blind eye to what the Cuban regime \nis doing to limit worker rights, and we should not turn a blind eye \neither. We must support those such as Morua and Maria who are willing \nto step forward for labor rights in the face of a repressive regime \nthat will not stop at anything to silence them.\n  As the people of Cuba look to cast off the shackles of five decades \nof dictatorial rule, we must stand with and speak out in support of all \nthose who seek to reclaim their civil and political rights and promote \npolitical pluralism and democratic values. We cannot turn our back on \nCuba's human rights violations record for decades simply because \n``enough time has passed.'' If that is the case, enough time has surely \npassed in places such as Syria, Sudan, Iran, and North Korea.\n  To me and to the thousands who have suffered at the hands of this \nregime, the clock has nothing to do with our policy options. Engagement \nand sanctions relief have to be earned. It can't be timed out. It must \ncome through real change, not Xs on a calendar or the ticking of a \nclock. And the clock is ticking for Alan Gross.\n  On December 4, 2009, Alan Gross, a private subcontractor for the U.S. \nGovernment, working to bring information to the Jewish community inside \nof Cuba, was arrested in Cuba. Mr. Gross, a 64-year-old development \nprofessional who worked in dozens of countries around the world with \nprograms to help people get access to basic information, was doing \nnothing different. That is why I am amazed with this uproar which \nexists by some who want to paint this picture that, my God, we actually \nwere trying to assist the Cuban people to have greater access to the \nInternet through a Twitter program. That is what we do throughout the \nworld. Even the foreign operations legislation talks about tens of \nmillions of dollars--not several hundred million dollars--to be \npromoting Internet access in closed societies.\n  It seems to me that freedom of information is one of the most \nfundamental elements, and yet we have this bit of a firestorm going on \nover simply creating the possibility for people to have access to \ninformation so they can speak for themselves and hear unfettered what \nis happening in the outside world. We all condemned what is happening \nin Turkey when the head of Turkey ultimately tried to shut down \nTwitter, but somehow it is OK to shut down the people of Cuba.\n  Since 2009, Alan Gross has been detained in Villa Marista, a prison \nin Havana notorious for its treatment of political prisoners by the \nCuban National Security Agency. This is not a minimum-security prison \nwhere foreigners are routinely held. It is a harsh, repressive prison \nreserved for Cuban dissidents. He is still being held at Villa Marista, \nand it is time for the Castro regime to let this American be released. \nHe did nothing wrong. After serving 4 years now of a 15-year sentence, \nthis 64-year-old American's mental health is reported to be \ndeteriorating and his life may well be in danger.\n  The case of Alan Gross is only one example of why we cannot let up \nuntil the dead weight of this oppressive regime is lifted once and for \nall.\n  We have supported democracy movements around the world. I have been a \nbig advocate of that in my 21 years in the Congress, in the House and \nthe Senate, serving on both foreign policy committees. I am a big \nadvocate because freedom and democracy and human rights, when they are \nobserved, mean we deal with countries in which we will have less \nconflict and more opportunity. It is the idea upon which this Nation \nwas founded, and it is who we are as a people and what we stand for in \nthe eyes of the world.\n  We can no longer condone, through inaction and outright support--in \nsome cases even from some of my colleagues in this Chamber--the actions \nof a repressive regime 90 miles from our own shores simply because of \nthe passage of time or because of some romantic idea of what the Castro \nregime is all about.\n  So to my colleagues, let me say, I know I have come to this floor on \nmany occasions demanding action. I have come to this floor demanding \nthat we live up to our rhetoric and our values. I ask that we hold the \nCastro brothers accountable for the suffering of the Cuban people--not \nonly the years of brutality and oppression which have deprived the \nCuban people of the basic human rights we so proudly proclaim to \nsupport around the world, but also for the continuing reality of the \nsuppression of those human rights today. I will come to the floor again \nand again to ask for nothing less, to ask that we never allow the \nCastro regime to profit from increased trade which would benefit the \nregime and will use these dollars for repression but not put one ounce \nof food on the plates of Cuban families.\n  I will end with this photograph of a man being arrested in Havana and \nflashing a sign recognized across Cuba and throughout the world. The \nsign is ``L'' for liberty. Libertad. That is all we ask for the people \nof Cuba, and I won't rest until we achieve it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor and recognize the 50th \nanniversary for the League of Women Voters of the Las Vegas Valley. On \nMay 7, 1964, the league held their first meeting, which was attended by \njust a handful of women in Las Vegas. Fifty years later, because of the \nhard work and relentless service of its founding members and their \npredecessors, the league today continues to be a resounding voice for \nSouthern Nevadans on issues that matter most to women, families, and \ncommunities.\n  Upon the league's inception and formal recognition from the National \nLeague of Women Voters in 1965, the group began organizing around \nissues such as school integration, open housing, environmental \nconservation, and education. By coming together, league members found \ngreat success on many of the issues they championed. Today, the league \nremains a vital force in the Las Vegas Valley around similar, important \nsocial causes. Some of the league's earliest members included \ndistinguished Southern Nevadans, many of whom are personal role models \nof mine, like Flora Duncan, Margaret Quinn, and Jean Ford. Over the \nyears, countless others began their path to leadership with the League.\n  As I stand to honor the league on this special occasion, it is also \nimportant to recognize that this year we celebrate the 100th \nanniversary of women having the right to vote in Nevada. In 1920, the \n19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was passed to prohibit any \nUnited States citizen from being denied the right to vote on the basis \nof sex. I am proud that in my home State, we had already recognized \nwomen's right to vote 6 years earlier.\n  Nevada was a leader among States in the fight for women's suffrage--\nundoubtedly, this achievement was due to the remarkable and pioneer-\nlike spirit of those Nevadans behind the movement. This spirit still \nexists today among organizations like the league and its members.\n  Across the U.S. and in every State, women have had the constitutional\n\n[[Page S2189]]\n\nright to vote for just short of a century. It is important that \ncitizens, both women and men, do not take for granted their right to be \nheard. For this reason, it is fitting that we honor the League of Women \nVoters of Las Vegas Valley as their work offers each new generation the \nreminder that civic engagement has been, and continues to be, one of \nthe most important rights we have as we strive to make our community \nand our country a better place to live. I applaud and celebrate with \nthe League of Women Voters of Las Vegas Valley on their 50th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/07/senate-section/article/S2189-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MARRIAGE EQUALITY IN VERMONT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am particularly proud of my home \nState, as we commemorate the fifth anniversary of the passage of \nVermont's law guaranteeing marriage equality.\n  Throughout history, Vermont has taken a leadership role in America's \njourney to build a more just society. Vermont was the first State in \nthe Union to outlaw slavery, and Vermonters offered shelter to runaway \nslaves seeking refuge while in transit to Canada--serving as one of the \nlast stops on the Underground Railroad. Vermont was also the first to \nadopt universal manhood suffrage, regardless of property ownership.\n  It is because of this history that it is not surprising that Vermont \nhas been at the forefront of our Nation's march toward marriage \nequality: Vermont was the first State to provide civil unions to same-\nsex couples back in 2000. On April 7, 2009, Vermont took the next step, \noverriding a veto to pass legislation affording marriage equality to \nall Vermonters in loving relationships who wanted their commitment \nrecognized by the State. Once again Vermont led the Nation by granting \nmarriage equality for the first time through democratically elected \nofficials on a bipartisan basis, instead of through the courts.\n  This is not to say that it was easy. The initial move toward civil \nunions fomented heated debate among Vermonters and throughout the \nNation. Several courageous leaders, such as the late Republican U.S. \nSenator from Vermont Bob Stafford, and State Representatives Bill \nLippert and Marion Milne, among others, showed us the way, and their \nadvocacy for equality was powerfully moving. Like many Vermonters, I \nlistened to advocates, friends, and neighbors who reminded us that love \nand commitment are values to encourage and not to fear. I continue to \nbe inspired by the inclusive example set by Vermont.\n  Now, 5 years later, 3,766 same-sex couples have married in the State \nof Vermont, 17 States and the District of Columbia have marriage \nequality, and the Supreme Court has decided a landmark case on the \nissue of same-sex marriage. In that case--United States v. Windsor--the \nCourt struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, which \ndefined marriage for purposes of Federal law as ``only a legal union \nbetween one man and one woman.'' The Court reasoned that the law \ndeprived couples of equal liberty as protected by our Fifth Amendment. \nAll Americans deserve equal justice under the law, and Marcelle and I, \nmarried for more than 50 years, celebrated this important decision, \nwhich pushed the Nation farther on its path toward equality.\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have long worked to \nmake civil rights a focal point of our committee's agenda and a \npriority in the Senate. I often hear from those who think that the \nstruggle for civil rights is over--that this issue is one for the \nhistory books. I remind them that this is our recent history and that \nwhile we have made great strides, there is still much work to be done. \nThe march toward equality must continue until all individuals--\nregardless of sexual orientation, gender or gender identity, race, \nethnicity, religion, or disability--are protected and respected, \nequally, under our laws. I am confident that Vermont will continue to \nlead the way, and I am proud of all that we have already accomplished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/07/senate-section/article/S2189-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2189-S2190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS AND PREVENTION MONTH\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, April is Sexual Assault Awareness and \nPrevention Month, and it is an important reminder of the ongoing \nproblem of sexual assault in our nation.\n  The Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, which first passed in 1994, has \nhad an astounding impact on reducing sexual and domestic assault in our \ncountry. The annual incidence of domestic violence has dropped more \nthan 50 percent since VAWA became law. This groundbreaking bipartisan \nlegislation included many provisions critical to supporting and \nimproving services for all victims of sexual assault and ensuring that \nlaw enforcement has the tools it needs to find and prosecute \nperpetrators. I was proud to author the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against \nWomen Reauthorization Act of 2013, which was signed into law by \nPresident Obama last year.\n  The Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Act built upon past successes \nand expanded its protections to more inclusive to the victims most at \nrisk of domestic violence and sexual assault, including LGBT, Native \nAmerican, and immigrant victims. One aspect of this important effort \nthat did not receive much attention is how it increased focus on sexual \nassault prevention, enforcement, and services to encourage reporting. \nIt also increased support for programs that improve law enforcement and \nforensic responses to sexual assault and to address backlogs of \nuntested rape kits. These improvements, along with the many others made \nin the reauthorization, will continue to advance the national response \nto sexual assault.\n  Our bipartisan effort last year is making lives better today, but \nthere is much more we must do. The National Network to End Domestic \nViolence, in their annual National Domestic Violence Counts Census, \nfound that every day 9,000 service requests go unmet because of a lack \nof resources. This is not acceptable. Every day tens of thousands of \nvictims turn to domestic and sexual violence services providers for \nsupport through emergency safe shelters, legal assistance, and child \nsupport groups, and we must do all we can to ensure these needs are \nmet.\n  We cannot stop by simply supporting a strong VAWA law. That is why I \nwas proud to support the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act, which \nincluded historic reforms to sexual assault prevention and response \nwithin the military. I was also heartened last month when the Senate \ncame together to pass the Victims Protection Act of 2014 by a vote of \n97 to 0. This legislation takes even greater steps to encourage \nmilitary servicemembers to come forward and report sexual assault. As I \nhave said many times, a victim, is a victim, is a victim. We must \nprotect all victims, including our Nation's service men and women, and \nthat means working to decrease the fear of stigma or inaction that can \noften deter reporting.\n  Following the reauthorization of VAWA, the passage of the NDAA, and \nthe Victims Protection Act, I hope the Senate will soon approve the \nbipartisan Justice for All Act reauthorization that I authored with \nSenator John Cornyn. I was proud to author the original legislation, \nand our reauthorization includes many critical provisions for victims. \nImportantly, our bill reauthorizes the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant \nProgram, which seeks to reduce the backlog of untested rape kits and \nother DNA evidence. This program is named after Debbie Smith, who \nwaited years after being attacked before her rape kit was tested and \nthe perpetrator was caught. Every Senate Democrat has cleared the way \nfor passage the bipartisan Justice For All Act reauthorization, and I \nhope Senate Republicans will act quickly so we can pass this measure \nthat means so much to rape survivors and all victims of crime.\n  I applaud the tireless work of the many advocates who work on behalf \nof victims each day and thank them for their dedication to this \ncritical problem. Together we have taken significant steps to ensure \nvictims of sexual assault have access to the services they need to \nrebuild their lives, that law enforcement have the tools they need to \nprosecute those who commit these horrific crimes, and to reduce future \nincidences of sexual assault through education and prevention efforts. \nLast year, the Senate stood up for the survivors of rape by passing the \nLeahy-\n\n[[Page S2190]]\n\nCrapo Violence Against Women Act reauthorization. Today, as we mark \nSexual Assault Awareness and Prevention month, I hope Senate \nRepublicans will join Senate Democrats to stand with them again by \npassing the Leahy-Cornyn Justice For All Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/07/senate-section/article/S2190-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2190-S2191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT JESSE T. WETHINGTON\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this past Saturday, April 5, I was \nextremely pleased and honored to be a part of the awarding of the \nPurple Heart Medal to a brave soldier Kentucky is proud to call one of \nits own. SGT Jesse T. Wethington of Liberty, KY, received his Purple \nHeart for wounds suffered while serving our country in Iraq. I want to \nshare the honor and majesty of this event with my colleagues and so \ntherefore ask unanimous consent that the full text of my remarks at the \nceremony to award SGT Jesse T. Wethington his Purple Heart, as well as \nthe text of the proclamation for the Purple Heart be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Senator McConnell's Remarks at Awarding of Purple Heart to Sergeant \n                   Jesse T. Wethington, April 5, 2014\n\n       Thank you for that kind introduction. Thank you, General \n     Dolan, for the invocation. It is my great honor to be here \n     for the presentation of the Purple Heart Medal to Sergeant \n     Jesse T. Wethington of Liberty, Kentucky, for wounds received \n     in action while in service to our country in Iraq. It is an \n     honor that is long overdue.\n       Because we are here to recognize the service of a brave \n     soldier, it is fitting to be at VFW Post 1170. I want to \n     thank our hosts, led by VFW Post Commander Dwight Riggle. I \n     also want to thank VFW State Commander Joe Schnitterbaum and \n     VFW leaders Brian Duffy and Carl Kaelin for all they have \n     done in support of America's veterans.\n       It's a pleasure to have Chris Smrt and the Kentucky chapter \n     of the Military Order of the Purple Heart here today to \n     welcome Sergeant Wethington into their ranks. Chris and the \n     Military Order of the Purple Heart, like the VFW, are strong \n     advocates for our veterans.\n       And on this day when we're honoring a Kentucky Guardsman, \n     it's wonderful to see so many Kentucky Guard soldiers and \n     airmen here today, including our outstanding Adjutant \n     General, Ed Tonini.\n       Finally, I'd like to welcome the folks who came here from \n     Jesse's hometown of Liberty, including Jesse's wife, Ashley; \n     his daughter, Hannah; his mother, Gayle; Jesse's brother, \n     Chris, and Chris's wife, Dorothy; Jesse's mother-in-law, Mrs. \n     Hope Metz; and Liberty VFW Post Commander and former State \n     VFW Commander Claude Wyatt. Welcome to VFW Post 1170.\n       The original Purple Heart, also known as the Badge of \n     Military Merit, was established by George Washington himself, \n     and as such, the Purple Heart is the oldest existing military \n     award that is still given to servicemembers.\n       I think the commander of the Continental Army and our first \n     president can speak better than I to the courage and bravery \n     which this award represents. In July of 1776, at the outbreak \n     of the War for Independence, General Washington wrote in his \n     own hand the weight of the task that had befallen him and his \n     army. He said:\n       ``The fate of unborn millions will now depend, under God, \n     on the courage and conduct of this Army . . . we have \n     therefore to resolve to conquer or die. . . . Let us \n     therefore rely upon the goodness of the cause, and the aid of \n     the Supreme Being, in whose hands victory is, to animate and \n     encourage us to great and noble actions. The eyes of all our \n     countrymen are now upon us.''\n       That same patriotism--that same Spirit of '76--which was \n     embodied by the leader of the Revolutionary Army lives on \n     today in those in uniform such as Jesse. Perhaps that is \n     inevitable in Jesse's case, given that he hails from a place \n     called Liberty, a town founded by Revolutionary War veterans \n     in 1806.\n       Although warfare has changed dramatically since the \n     Revolutionary Era, the valor of our warfighters, such as \n     Jesse, remains the same. That valor would have been instantly \n     recognizable to George Washington.\n       It is the same valor that propelled Americans to victory \n     against the mighty British Empire. The same valor that \n     propelled Americans to die for other men's freedoms in the \n     Civil War. The same valor we remember in the Greatest \n     Generation, men and women who sacrificed halfway around the \n     globe to save democracy. The same valor displayed in Cold War \n     conflicts in Korea and Vietnam.\n       Sergeant Wethington's service is simply the latest chapter \n     in a long and unbroken line of heroism and sacrifice, a line \n     that is as old as our country.\n       The story of Jesse Wethington, the soldier from Liberty, is \n     like that of those who served in the Revolutionary War--it is \n     the story of a volunteer. Jesse could have chosen any number \n     of paths, paths that would not have involved protecting ``the \n     fate of unborn millions,'' paths that would not have placed \n     him in imminent danger.\n       Instead, Jesse volunteered to serve in the Kentucky Army \n     National Guard. He volunteered to go on the road in a Humvee \n     that would be targeted by the enemy in Iraq. He volunteered \n     to sit in the gunner's turret. And even after his injury in \n     combat, Jesse volunteered again to sit right back in that \n     gunner's turret through the end of his tour of duty.\n       Jesse was mobilized with Battery B, First Battalion, 623rd \n     Field Artillery of the Kentucky Army National Guard in late \n     2004, and he deployed to Iraq in January 2005. He served as a \n     communications specialist and worked in the tactical \n     operations center at the forward operating base.\n       In his communications role, Jesse had a view of his entire \n     unit's activities. He saw the gun trucks and Humvees that \n     deployed every day, and how often they were targeted by the \n     enemy's IEDs. He saw good men, friends of his, injured. He \n     saw the deaths of three soldiers in his unit, Kentuckians \n     all.\n       Knowing these things, knowing all the risks involved, Jesse \n     still volunteered. And when a spot opened up in a gun truck, \n     Jesse stepped forward and said, ``Send me.'' Jesse \n     volunteered yet again to serve as a gunner. He encountered \n     several IEDs on the road, but always came away uninjured. \n     Until the fateful day of September 30, 2005.\n       On that day, Jesse's Humvee was moving slowly through \n     congested traffic as part of a convoy. It stopped, and Jesse \n     stood up in the gunner's hatch to direct traffic. Suddenly, \n     an IED struck the right side of the truck with devastating \n     force. The impact from the blast was so great it sent \n     shrapnel hurdling through the back window, just missing \n     Jesse's right leg and embedding itself into a storage bin \n     within the Humvee.\n       Jesse suffered injury to his throat and the back of his \n     head. After the explosion, he could not hear, and his vision \n     and thoughts were blurred. Yet, amazingly, he continued his \n     mission. Upon returning to the base, Jesse received medical \n     care, and after a few days of light duty returned to the \n     gunner's turret. He finished out his tour of duty through the \n     end of the year and returned from Iraq in January 2006.\n       Unfortunately, Jesse's departure from the battlefield \n     didn't end his struggles. He suffered traumatic brain injury, \n     hearing loss, and post-traumatic stress disorder, and he is \n     continually confronted by the effects of his injuries.\n       Through all these difficulties, I know Jesse's greatest \n     source of strength and support is his family, especially, \n     Ashley and Hannah.\n       Coincidentally, the very same day Jesse found out he would \n     be receiving this Purple Heart, he and Ashley also discovered \n     they would be having a baby boy. It is entirely fitting that \n     news of both events arrived on the same day, given Jesse's \n     valor in defending the ``fate of unborn millions.''\n       Before the presentation of the Purple Heart Medal, I want \n     to note that there is another hero in this story. It's \n     Jesse's friend and fellow soldier, retired Staff Sergeant \n     Glen Phillips, who we heard from earlier this morning.\n       It was Staff Sergeant Phillips who gathered the facts in \n     order for Jesse to receive his Purple Heart today. Glen, who \n     is also from Liberty, has helped look out for Jesse and many \n     other veterans over the years.\n       When Jesse told Glen he didn't think anyone would care that \n     he had yet to receive his Purple Heart, this is what Glen had \n     to say: ``Jesse, I care, the VA cares, the U.S. Army cares, \n     and people you don't even know care across this great land.''\n       I couldn't agree more. I think the witnesses here today for \n     this solemn occasion are proof positive that Kentucky does \n     indeed care and cares deeply about you, Jesse, and your \n     bravery in uniform. And we are grateful for all you have done \n     and continue to do to make us proud.\n       And I believe that many people who are not present today--\n     including, one day, your son--will see how you served in Iraq \n     with dignity and honor, will see that you continue to carry \n     yourself with dignity and honor here at home, and will see \n     the Purple Heart proclamation of your heroism. And they too \n     will be moved by your service and your sacrifice.\n       The presentation of this Purple Heart Medal is just a small \n     recognition of the wealth of respect you deserve for your \n     service to our country. Your service in protecting all of us. \n     And your service to the values that make America the greatest \n     nation on earth--values expressed by General Washington and \n     the men who founded a place called Liberty more than two \n     centuries ago.\n       Now, the solemn moment we're gathered here today for has \n     arrived. Sergeant Jesse T. Wethington, Ashley, and Hannah--\n     please join me for the reading of the proclamation and the \n     presentation of the Purple Heart Medal.\n\n                Text of Purple Heart Medal Proclamation\n\n     THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n     To All Who Shall See These Presents, Greeting:\n     This is to Certify That the President of the United States of \n         America Has Awarded the PURPLE HEART\n     Established by General George Washington\n     At Newburgh, New York, August 7, 1782 to:\n     Specialist Jesse T.

Mr. President, our kids spend at least 7 hours a day at \nschool working, learning, growing, and trying to build themselves into \nthe people they want to grow up to become. It is our job to help them. \nThat means giving them the education they deserve. It means giving them \nthe support they need to keep working hard. And it means making sure \nthey get healthy meals to keep them strong and to give them the fuel \nthey need to focus in class.\n  That is why Senator Susan Collins from Maine and I introduced the \nSchool Food Modernization Act, which would help schools provide \nhealthier meals to students in North Dakota and throughout the country. \nThis bill would continue ongoing efforts to provide healthy meals for \nour children during the school day and make sure schools have the \nresources they need to get the most nutritious food to students.\n  Providing healthy meals is particularly important as childhood \nobesity rates in the U.S. have tripled over the last three decades. \nMore than 23 million adolescents and children in our country--nearly 1 \nin 3 young people nationwide--are obese or overweight. According to the \nAmerican Heart Association, it is the No. 1 healthy concern among \nparents--more than drug abuse and smoking. Even in my State of North \nDakota, which is consistently ranked as one of the healthiest States in \nthe country, more than 1 in 8 adolescents are overweight or obese.\n  Improving the nutritional quality of school meals can help fight the \nobesity epidemic, putting children on strong footing to prevent long-\nterm health concerns related to obesity, such as diabetes, heart \ndisease, and stroke. In 2010, Congress passed the Healthy and Hunger \nFree Kids Act to improve the school nutrition standards. It made \nimportant improvements to nutrition standards in school meals, but was \nnot perfect. Most importantly, it mandated school lunch requirements \nwithout offering real support to reach those standards.\n  Senator Collins and I are working to improve these standards in order \nto provide greater flexibility to school meal planners to make sure \nthey can provide students with the nutrition they need in workable \nfashion. We are also offering grant assistance to help schools get \nresources to comply with standards.\n  Another way we can help provide more nutritious meals to students is \nby providing our schools with the necessary tools to prepare meals and \nstore fresh produce. While nutritional standards for meals served in \nour schools have increased considerably, support for schools to \nimplement these important changes has lagged behind.\n  Many school kitchens were built decades ago and designed with little \ncapacity beyond reheating and holding food for dining service. In fact, \naccording to the Pew Charitable Trusts, 74 percent of school districts \nin North Dakota need at least one piece of kitchen equipment to better \nserve healthy meals. We can do better than that.\n  The legislation we introduced would give schools greater access to \nthe equipment they need to prepare healthy meals, reduce waste, and \nmake resources stretch further.\n  Specifically, our legislation would provide targeted grant assistance \nto school administrators and food service directors to upgrade kitchen \ninfrastructure or purchase high-quality, durable kitchen equipment such \nas commercial ovens, steamers, and stoves. Additionally, our \nlegislation would establish a loan assistance program within USDA to \nhelp schools acquire new equipment to prepare and serve healthier, more \nnutritious meals to students. School administrators and other eligible \nborrowers would be able to obtain Federal guarantees for 90 percent of \nthe loan value needed to construct, remodel, or expand their kitchens, \ndining, or food storage infrastructure. Finally, our legislation would \nstrengthen training and provide technical assistance to aid school food \nservice personnel in meeting the updated nutrition guidelines. Not \nevery school food service employee is equipped with the expertise to \ncomply with healthier meal and food preparation standards. Our bill \nauthorizes USDA to provide support on a competitive basis to highly \nqualified third-party trainers to develop and administer training and \ntechnical assistance.\n  USDA has a long history of providing support for schools to upgrade \nmeal preparation equipment; however, this support has been sporadic and \nunreliable for long-term planning. And in recent years, the demand for \nsupport has been great with requests for assistance far outpacing \navailability.\n  As the Senate agriculture committee begins to consider \nreauthorization of the school nutrition program, I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on improving school meal offerings and \nproviding schools with the tools needed to give our children the \nnutritional fuel necessary to learn and grow.\n  As the daughter of a school cook, I understand the work that goes \ninto preparing many healthy meals each day for kids, and this bill \nwould help make limited resources stretch as far as possible to provide \nsupport to communities that need it in North Dakota and throughout the \nU.S. That just makes sense for our students, parents, teachers, and \nschool cooks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/07/senate-section/article/S2191-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2191-S2192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, growing up, my mother was a single parent. \nShe raised three children by herself. I know what it is like to run out \nof money at the end of the month, what it is like when every dime \nmatters.\n  The minimum wage is a poverty wage. Today, the minimum wage hasn't \nkept up with inflation. If the minimum wage had kept up with inflation \nin 1968, the minimum wage today would be $10.68. If you do the math, \nminimum wage workers today earn less than $15,000 per year. If you are \nsupporting a child or an elderly parent, that is a family income below \nthe Federal poverty line. Raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 \nwould help lift nearly a million workers and their families out of \npoverty. In Hawaii, nearly 100,000 women would get a raise.\n  This is especially important for women. More and more women serve as \nheads of households. And nearly two-thirds of minimum wage workers are \nwomen. Nearly two-thirds of workers in tipped occupations are women.\n  The situation is even more dire in Hawaii, where the cost of living \nis higher. In Hawaii, one out of five Hawaii women workers would get a \nraise if we raised the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10. A person \nworking full time making $7.25 per hour makes $14,500 per year. The \naverage rent in Hawaii for a one-bedroom is $1,278. That is more than \n$15,000 per year. That is why many in Hawaii have to work more than one \njob.\n  And there are stories all across the country of women struggling. \nHawaii Catholic Charities recently shared their story with me of a \nwoman in Hawaii working for minimum wage who was unable to afford basic \nliving expenses for herself and her son. She had to move back in with \nher parents. Over the course of a few years she was able to change jobs \nto a department store, where she eventually earned $10 per hour. At \nthat wage she was able to contribute to her family's household expenses \nand start a savings account for her son. We all hear stories like this \noften. It's why we must raise the minimum wage--so that hard working \nfamilies have a chance at building a better life for themselves and \ntheir children.\n  Some critics claim the minimum wage will cost jobs. The CBO report \nlooked at old studies and not the latest research. Just last week, a \nGoldman Sachs report said the CBO estimate of 0.3 percent job loss is \ntoo high because raising the minimum wage would actually increase \ndemand. Minimum-wage workers spend that money right away, at local \nbusinesses in their communities. A survey of small business owners \nfound that three out of five supported raising the minimum wage. They \nsaid a higher minimum wage would increase consumer spending on their \ngoods and services. The Goldman Sachs report said that States which \nraised their minimum wage in 2014 actually created more jobs than other \nstates.\n\n[[Page S2192]]\n\n  In Hawaii, a large part of our economy is hospitality and tourism. \nMany workers earn the tipped minimum wage, which is lower than the \nregular wage. I have met restaurant workers who can't afford to eat at \nthe restaurant where they work. I heard one mother say she had to \nchoose between buying diapers for her kids or eating lunch that day. \nWomen should not have to make that choice. Back in 2007, the last time \nCongress raised the minimum wage, the restaurant industry said it would \ncost their industry jobs. But in 2013, the restaurant industry forecast \nsaid, ``Restaurants remain among the leaders in job creation.'' The \nBureau of Labor Statistics reports that between 2007 and 2013, \nrestaurants added 724,000 jobs.\n  Raising the minimum wage also saves taxpayer money on social \nservices. When companies pay a low minimum wage, workers in poverty \ncan't afford to eat. Taxpayers are picking up the tab--we're \nsubsidizing low-wage companies. If we raise the wage to $10.10, we \nreduce taxpayer costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \nProgram, or food stamps, by $4.6 billion a year. In Hawaii, over 15,000 \nworkers would no longer need SNAP beneifts.\n  In America, we believe that if you work hard and play by the rules, \nyou can get ahead. Let's increase the minimum wage, to give all \nAmericans a fair shot.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/07/senate-section/article/S2192-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     REMEMBERING NICHOLAS J. HALIAS\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nexceptional public service of Nicholas J. ``Nick'' Halias who passed \naway on March 3, 2014. Nick most recently served as the chief of police \nof the University of New Hampshire Police Department and previously \nserved as a major in the New Hampshire State Police. His law \nenforcement career extended for more than 42 years of dedicated service \nto our State and nation.\n  Nick began his law enforcement career with the New Hampshire State \nPolice in 1969. Through hard work, dedication, and an innate leadership \nability, Nick advanced through the ranks of the New Hampshire State \nPolice culminating in his promotion to major. Major Halias was a \ngraduate of the FBI National Academy, earned a master's degree from \nFitchburg State University, and graduated from the New England \nInstitute of Law Enforcement Management at Babson College.\n  Following his retirement from the New Hampshire State Police, Nick \ncontinued his law enforcement career serving as the chief of police for \nthe University of New Hampshire Police Department from 2000 to 2012. \nNick led that agency to accreditation by the Commission on Law \nEnforcement Accreditation and became an accreditation mentor and \nassessor for police organizations across the United States.\n  It was my privilege during my service as New Hampshire's attorney \ngeneral to work directly with Nick on many law enforcement initiatives. \nNick earned the respect and admiration of his peers in law enforcement. \nHe was also highly regarded by members of other disciplines including \nadvocates for reducing domestic and sexual violence, victim witness \nadvocates, and many others across New Hampshire. Nick was a thoughtful \nand effective participant in efforts to improve the criminal justice \nsystem and public safety in New Hampshire. He also was a down-to-earth, \nkind man who regularly volunteered at annual multidisciplinary \nconferences conducted by the attorney general's office. He participated \nas an instructor, but also consistently helped set up and tear down. \nNick was fun to work with. I will miss his wise counsel and his \nfriendship.\n  As the New Hampshire law enforcement community gathers on April 10, \n2014 to honor Nicholas J. Halias' extraordinary life of public service, \nI join all in commending Nick's exceptional contribution to law \nenforcement and public safety in New Hampshire. New Hampshire is safer \nand our quality of life is better because of the work done by Nicholas \nJ. Halias. I extend heartfelt condolences to Nick's wife Linda and to \nhis family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/07/senate-section/article/S2192-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING DR. ROBERT SPENCE\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to honor Dr. Robert H. \nSpence, who is retiring as president of Evangel University after 40 \nyears of dedicated service in that role--making him the longest tenured \ncollege president in the State of Missouri and one of the longest \ntenured college presidents in the United States.\n  Under his vision and leadership over the last 40 years, Evangel has \nbeen transformed from what was once a World War II-era Army hospital \ncampus--complete with metal huts--into a modern institution with a \ndozen new facilities. Today, Evangel boasts an impressive campus with \ntwo residence halls, a 2,200 seat chapel, a state-of-the-art fitness \ncenter, dining hall, student union, fine arts center, two major \nclassroom buildings and a 66,000-square-foot administration building. \nThe expansion of facilities reflects the fact that Evangel's enrollment \nhas doubled, and the school has added nine masters programs. With Dr. \nSpence at the helm, Evangel University has flourished.\n  Evangel is located in my hometown of Springfield, MO, so I have \npersonally witnessed the growth and development of the university and \ncan attest to Dr. Spence's dynamic leadership and commitment. He is \nactive in the community, serving on numerous boards and institutions, \ndedicating his time and energy to Springfield's citizens on- and off-\ncampus. In recognition of his community work, the Springfield Area \nChamber of Commerce, where Dr. Spence once served as chairman of the \nboard, honored him for a ``Career of Character,'' naming him \nSpringfieldian of the Year in 2004. In 2012 he received the Springfield \nBusiness Journal's Lifetime Achievement in Business Award. These \nrecognitions are well deserved.\n  I join many other community leaders in Springfield in thanking Dr. \nSpence for his lifetime of work as an inspirational minister, \nmessenger, and educator. As a former university president, I applaud \nhim for his commitment to Evangel University over the last four \ndecades. I have always relied on Dr. Spence's sound counsel and \njudgment and wish him and his wife Ann a long and enjoyable retirement. \nThey have certainly earned this time to relax.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/07/senate-section/article/S2192-3", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2192-S2193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER JOHN ALAN FISHER\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to honor CW5 John \nAlan Fisher as he retires from a 30-year career with the Missouri Army \nNational Guard. Chief Fisher has had an extraordinary career with the \nGuard and has made incredible contributions little-known outside his \nfield. I am glad to be able to recognize him for his accomplishments \ntoday.\n  Chief Fisher began his career as a young Marine, earning the Vietnam \nService Medal, the Navy Unit Commendation Medal and the Humanitarian \nService Medal over the course of his 8 years of service. In 1980, after \nfulfilling his commitment to the Marines, Chief Fisher enlisted in the \nArmy National Guard. In the three decades since, he and his team of \nprofessionals have helped supply and maintain mission-ready aircraft \nwithout a single aircraft accident or incident reported.\n  Chief Fisher's career has been in aviation maintenance, leading \nefforts to identify problems with the helicopter fleet that is serviced \nin my hometown of Springfield, MO. Early in his career, Chief Fisher \nrecognized problems with wiring that compromised the Guard's ability to \nmaintain combat-readiness in its helicopter fleet. While others thought \nthe modules for the fleet were wearing out, it was Chief Fisher who \nrecognized that the problem was in fact a failure of the wiring. Since \nthat time, he and his team have developed the first protocol to rewire \nliterally miles of wiring in helicopters. His efforts ensure the \nreliability of the fleet for 14 States.\n  Under Chief Fisher's leadership, these programs have grown into a \nworld-class operation at the Missouri Theater Aviation Sustainment \nMaintenance Group, MO-TASMG, in Springfield. Today, Springfield remains \nthe only National Guard site in the Nation that specializes in rewiring \nair frames for America's military helicopters. Officer Fisher has been \nan incredible asset to this mission, as has the team\n\n[[Page S2193]]\n\nof highly-skilled professionals he helped train. The crew at MO-TASMG \nare able to build and repair some of the most complex parts of \nvirtually any aircraft in the Army inventory. Many of these components \nhave been integral to the success of missions in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. In fact, in 2004 you could open \nnearly any avionics compartment in an aircraft in theater to find a \nrepaired component label identifying Chief Fisher's team as the source \nof its repair.\n  With multiple deployments to both Operation Enduring Freedom and \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, these accomplishments only scratch the surface \nof Chief Fisher's many contributions throughout his nearly four decades \nof service. I am also pleased to note that Chief Fisher's legacy \nextends beyond his own service, as his son Shane Fisher also serves in \nthe Missouri National Guard. I am thankful to both of them for their \nservice. Congratulations again to Chief Fisher on his well-deserved \nretirement. He has certainly earned this time to relax with his \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/07/senate-section/article/S2193-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PROJECT HOME\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Project HOME on \nthe occasion of their 25th anniversary. Founded in Philadelphia, PA, \nProject HOME is a national leader in combating homelessness and \nproviding life-saving services to countless individuals. Project HOME \nhas a mission that not only includes providing shelter to those in \nneed, but also helping to break the cycle of chronic homelessness by \nexamining the root causes.\n  Project HOME was co-founded in 1989 by Sister Mary Scullion and Joan \nDawson McConnon. Their first shelter, the Mother Katherine Drexel \nResidence for chronically homeless men, was established shortly \nthereafter. Then, in the summer of 1990, Project HOME opened its first \ntransitional house, the Diamond Street Residence, which provided a safe \nenvironment for up to 12 men.\n  Over the last 25 years Project HOME has grown dramatically, providing \nthe care and support that is necessary to combat Philadelphia's battle \nwith homelessness. The strong leadership of Sister Mary Scullion and \nJoan Dawson McConnon has allowed Project HOME to expand from a single \nwinter shelter into an organization with 535 units of affordable \nhousing.\n  The vision of Project HOME is simple: none of us are home until all \nof us are home. Sister Mary and Joan, along with their dedicated staff, \nstrive to make this vision a reality every day. Project HOME has \nempowered countless individuals in Philadelphia to realize their full \npotential. Their commitment to promoting compassion and a community \nspirit has benefited the City of Philadelphia and served as a model \nwithin the Commonwealth and across the country. It is a privilege and \nan honor to recognize Project HOME for its tremendous work as they \ncelebrate 25 years of activism and advocacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/07/senate-section/article/S2193-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO COLONEL GREGORY A.

Scheidhauer for his past 2 years of exemplary dedication to \nduty and service as a congressional budget liaison for the Secretary of \nthe Army. Greg was recently selected to serve the Army and Congress as \nthe chief of Army Reserve Legislative Affairs. We wish him well in his \nnew position.\n  A native of Bowie, MD, Colonel Scheidhauer earned a bachelor of \nscience degree at West Virginia University and was commissioned a \nquartermaster officer in the Army in 1990. He has earned advanced \ndegrees in public administration, public health education, and \nstrategic studies.\n  Greg has served in a broad range of duty stations and assignments \nduring his 23 years of service. As a lieutenant, he served as a \ntransportation platoon leader and battalion logistics officer. As a \ncaptain, he served as a supply and services officer in Tennessee and as \na training officer in Fort Buchanan, PR. Prior to his current \nassignment, Greg was the director J4, Joint Forces Special Operations \nComponent Command, Iraq.\n  In 2009, following his assignment with the First Army Division East, \nColonel Scheidhauer was selected as a military fellow in then-\nRepresentative Joe Donnelly's personal office, serving the people of \nIndiana's Second Congressional District.\n  After this, he served as a legislative liaison in the Office of the \nChief of Army Reserve, and then as a congressional budget liaison \nofficer in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for \nFinancial Management and Comptroller. In this capacity, Greg was tasked \nwith managing the Army's research, development, test and evaluation \nportfolio as well as its aviation portfolio.

In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice \nstating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13536 \nof April 12, 2010, with respect to Somalia is to continue in effect \nbeyond April 12, 2014.\n  On January 17, 2013, the United States Government announced its \nrecognition of the Government of Somalia. The United States had not \nrecognized a government in Somalia for the previous 22 years. Although \nthe U.S. recognition underscores a strong commitment to Somalia's \nstabilization, it does not remove the importance of U.S. sanctions, \nespecially against persons undermining the stability of Somalia. For \nthis reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the \nnational emergency with respect to Somalia and to maintain in force the \nsanctions to respond to this threat.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, April 7, 2014.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/07/senate-section/article/S2193-6", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2193-S2194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:45 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n\n[[Page S2194]]\n\n\n       H.R. 1874.

Res. 412\n\n       Whereas Asia-Pacific's maritime domains, which include both \n     the sea and airspace above the domains, are critical to the \n     region's prosperity, stability, and security, including \n     global commerce;\n       Whereas the United States is a longstanding Asia-Pacific \n     power and has a national interest in maintaining freedom of \n     operations in international waters and airspace both in the \n     Asia-Pacific region and around the world;\n       Whereas, for over 60 years, the United States Government, \n     alongside United States allies and partners, has played an \n     instrumental role in maintaining stability in the Asia-\n     Pacific, including safeguarding the prosperity and economic \n     growth and development of the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas the United States, from the earliest days of the \n     Republic, has had a deep and abiding national security \n     interest in freedom of navigation, freedom of the seas, \n     respect for international law, and unimpeded lawful commerce, \n     including in the East China and South China Seas;\n       Whereas the United States alliance relationships in the \n     region, including with Japan, Korea, Australia, the \n     Philippines, and Thailand, are at the heart of United States \n     policy and engagement in the Asia-Pacific region, and share a \n     common approach to supporting the maintenance of peace and \n     stability, freedom of navigation, and other internationally \n     lawful uses of sea and airspace in the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas territorial and maritime claims must be derived \n     from land features and otherwise comport with international \n     law;\n       Whereas the United States Government has a clear interest \n     in encouraging and supporting the nations of the region to \n     work collaboratively and diplomatically to resolve disputes \n     and is firmly opposed to coercion, intimidation, threats, or \n     the use of force;\n       Whereas the South China Sea contains great natural \n     resources, and their stewardship and responsible use offers \n     immense potential benefit for generations to come;\n       Whereas the United States is not a claimant party in either \n     the East China or South China Seas, but does have an interest \n     in the peaceful diplomatic resolution of disputed claims in \n     accordance with international law, in freedom of operations, \n     and in the free-flow of commerce free of coercion, \n     intimidation, or the use of force;\n       Whereas the United States supports the obligation of all \n     members of the United Nations to seek to resolve disputes by \n     peaceful means;\n       Whereas freedom of navigation and other lawful uses of sea \n     and airspace in the Asia-Pacific region are embodied in \n     international law, not granted by certain states to others;\n       Whereas, on November 23, 2013, the People's Republic of \n     China unilaterally and without prior consultations with the \n     United States, Japan, the Republic of Korea or other nations \n     of the Asia-Pacific region, declared an Air Defense \n     Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the East China Sea, also \n     announcing that all aircraft entering the PRC's self-declared \n     ADIZ, even if they do not intend to enter Chinese territorial \n     airspace, would have to submit flight plans, maintain radio \n     contact, and follow directions from the Chinese Ministry of \n     National Defense or face ``emergency defensive measures'';\n       Whereas the ``rules of engagement'' declared by China, \n     including the ``emergency defensive measures'', are in \n     violation of the concept of ``due regard for the safety of \n     civil aviation'' under the Chicago Convention of the \n     International Civil Aviation Organization's Chicago \n     Convention and thereby are a departure from accepted \n     practice;\n       Whereas the Chicago Convention of the International Civil \n     Aviation Organization distinguishes between civilian aircraft \n     and state aircraft and provides for the specific obligations \n     of state parties, consistent with customary law, to ``refrain \n     from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft \n     in flight and . . . in case of interception, the lives of \n     persons on board and the safety of aircraft must not be \n     endangered'';\n       Whereas international civil aviation is regulated by \n     international agreements, including standards and regulations \n     set by ICAO for aviation safety, security, efficiency and \n     regularity, as well as for aviation environmental protection;\n       Whereas, in accordance with the norm of airborne innocent \n     passage, the United States does not recognize the right of a \n     coastal nation to apply its ADIZ procedures to foreign state \n     aircraft not intending to enter national airspace nor does \n     the United States apply its ADIZ procedures to foreign state \n     aircraft not intending to enter United States airspace;\n       Whereas the United States Government expressed profound \n     concerns with China's unilateral, provocative, dangerous, and \n     destabilizing declaration of such a zone, including the \n     potential for misunderstandings and miscalculations by \n     aircraft operating lawfully in international airspace;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China's declaration of an \n     ADIZ in the East China Sea will not alter how the United \n     States Government conducts operations in the region or the \n     unwavering United States commitment to peace, security and \n     stability in the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas the Government of Japan expressed deep concern \n     about the People's Republic of China's declaration of such a \n     zone, regarding it as an effort to unduly infringe upon the \n     freedom of flight in international airspace and to change the \n     status quo that could escalate tensions and potentially cause \n     unintentional consequences in the East China Sea;\n       Whereas the Government of the Republic of Korea has \n     expressed concern over China's declared ADIZ, and on December \n     9, 2013, announced an adjustment to its longstanding Air \n     Defense Identification Zone, which does not encompass \n     territory administered by another country, and did so only \n     after undertaking a deliberate process of consultations with \n     the United States, Japan, and China;\n       Whereas the Government of the Philippines has stressed that \n     China's declared ADIZ seeks to transfer an entire air zone \n     into Chinese domestic airspace, infringes on freedom of \n     flight in international airspace, and compromises the safety \n     of civil aviation and the national security of affected \n     states, and has called on China to ensure that its actions do \n     not jeopardize regional security and stability;\n       Whereas, on November 26, 2013, the Government of Australia \n     made clear in a statement its opposition to any coercive or \n     unilateral actions to change the status quo in the East China \n     Sea;\n       Whereas, on March 10, 2014, the United States Government \n     and the Government of Japan jointly submitted a letter to the \n     ICAO Secretariat regarding the issue of freedom of overflight \n     by civil aircraft in international airspace and the effective \n     management of civil air traffic within allocated Flight \n     Information Regions (FIR);\n       Whereas Indonesia Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa, in a \n     hearing before the Committee on Defense and Foreign Affairs \n     on February 18, 2014, stated, ``We have firmly told China we \n     will not accept a similar [Air Defense Identification] Zone \n     if it is adopted in the South China Sea. And the signal we \n     have received thus far is, China does not plan to adopt a \n     similar Zone in the South China Sea.'';\n       Whereas over half the world's merchant tonnage flows \n     through the South China Sea, and over 15,000,000 barrels of \n     oil per day transit the Strait of Malacca, fueling economic \n     growth and prosperity throughout the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas the increasing frequency and assertiveness of \n     patrols and competing regulations over disputed territory and \n     maritime areas and airspace in the South China Sea and the \n     East China Sea are raising tensions and increasing the risk \n     of confrontation;\n       Whereas the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \n     has promoted multilateral talks on disputed areas without \n     settling the issue of sovereignty, and in 2002 joined with \n     China in signing a Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in \n     the South China Sea that committed all parties to those \n     territorial disputes to ``reaffirm their respect for and \n     commitment to the freedom of navigation in and over flight \n     above the South China Sea as provided for by the universally \n     recognized principles of international law'' and to ``resolve \n     their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful \n     means, without resorting to the threat or use of force'';\n       Whereas ASEAN and China committed in 2002 to develop an \n     effective Code of Conduct when they adopted the Declaration \n     on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, yet \n     negotiations are irregular and little progress has been made;\n       Whereas, in recent years, there have been numerous \n     dangerous and destabilizing incidents in waters near the \n     coasts of the Philippines, China, Malaysia, and Vietnam;\n       Whereas the United States Government is deeply concerned \n     about unilateral actions by any claimant seeking to change \n     the status quo through the use of coercion, intimidation, or \n     military force, including the continued restrictions on \n     access to Scarborough Reef and pressure on long-standing \n     Philippine presence at the Second Thomas Shoal by the \n     People's Republic of China; actions by any state to prevent \n     any other state from exercising its sovereign rights to the \n     resources of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and \n     continental shelf by making claims to those areas that have \n     no support in international law; declarations of \n     administrative and military districts in contested areas in \n     the South China Sea; and the imposition of new fishing \n     regulations covering disputed areas, which have raised \n     tensions in the region;\n       Whereas international law is important to safeguard the \n     rights and freedoms of all states in the Asia-Pacific region, \n     and the lack of clarity in accordance with international law \n     by claimants with regard to their South China Sea claims can \n     create uncertainty, insecurity, and instability;\n       Whereas the United States Government opposes the use of \n     intimidation, coercion, or force to assert a territorial \n     claim in the South China Sea;\n       Whereas claims in the South China Sea must accord with \n     international law, and those that are not derived from land \n     features are fundamentally flawed;\n       Whereas ASEAN issued Six-Point Principles on the South \n     China Sea on July 20, 2012, whereby ASEAN's Foreign Ministers \n     reiterated and reaffirmed ``the commitment of ASEAN Member \n     States to:. . . 1. the full implementation of the Declaration \n     on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (2002); . . \n     . 2. the Guidelines for the Implementation of the Declaration \n     on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (2011); . . \n     . 3. the early conclusion of a Regional Code of Conduct in \n     the South China Sea; . . . 4. the full respect of the \n     universally recognized\n\n[[Page S2199]]\n\n     principles of International Law, including the 1982 United \n     Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS); . . . 5. \n     the continued exercise of self-restraint and non-use of force \n     by all parties; and . . . 6. the peaceful resolution of \n     disputes, in accordance with universally recognized \n     principles of International Law, including the 1982 United \n     Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).'';\n       Whereas, in 2013, the Republic of the Philippines properly \n     exercised its rights to peaceful settlement mechanisms with \n     the filing of arbitration case under Article 287 and Annex \n     VII of the Convention on the Law of the Sea in order to \n     achieve a peaceful and durable solution to the dispute, and \n     the United States hopes that all parties in any dispute \n     ultimately abide by the rulings of internationally recognized \n     dispute-settlement bodies;\n       Whereas China and Japan are the world's second and third \n     largest economies, and have a shared interest in preserving \n     stable maritime domains to continue to support economic \n     growth;\n       Whereas there has been an unprecedented increase in \n     dangerous activities by Chinese maritime agencies in areas \n     near the Senkaku islands, including between 6 and 25 ships of \n     the Government of China intruding into the Japanese \n     territorial sea each month since September 2012, between 26 \n     and 124 ships entering the ``contiguous zone'' in the same \n     time period, and 9 ships intruding into the territorial sea \n     and 33 ships entering in the contiguous zone in February \n     2014;\n       Whereas, although the United States Government does not \n     take a position on the ultimate sovereignty of the Senkaku \n     Islands, the United States Government acknowledges that they \n     are under the administration of Japan and opposes any \n     unilateral actions that would seek to undermine such \n     administration;\n       Whereas the United States Senate has previously affirmed \n     that the unilateral actions of a third party will not affect \n     the United States' acknowledgment of the administration of \n     Japan over the Senkaku Islands;\n       Whereas the United States remains committed under the \n     Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security to respond to any \n     armed attack in the territories under the administration of \n     Japan, has urged all parties to take steps to prevent \n     incidents and manage disagreements through peaceful means, \n     and commends the Government of Japan for its restrained \n     approach in this regard;\n       Whereas both the United States and the People's Republic of \n     China are parties to and are obligated to observe the rules \n     of the Convention on the International Regulations for \n     Preventing Collisions at Sea, done at London October 12, 1972 \n     (COLREGs);\n       Whereas on December 5, 2013, the USS Cowpens was lawfully \n     operating in international waters in the South China Sea when \n     a People's Liberation Army Navy vessel reportedly crossed its \n     bow at a distance of less than 500 yards and stopped in the \n     water, forcing the USS Cowpens to take evasive action to \n     avoid a collision;\n       Whereas the reported actions taken by the People's \n     Liberation Army Navy vessel in the USS Cowpens' incident, as \n     publicly reported, appear contrary to the international legal \n     obligations of the People's Republic of China under COLREGs;\n       Whereas, on January 19, 1998, the United States and \n     People's Republic of China signed the Military Maritime \n     Consultative Agreement, creating a mechanism for consultation \n     and coordination on operational safety issues in the maritime \n     domain between the United States and the People's Republic of \n     China;\n       Whereas the Western Pacific Naval Symposium, inaugurated in \n     1988 and comprising the navies of Australia, Brunei, \n     Cambodia, Canada, Chile, France, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, \n     New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the People's Republic of \n     China, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, the Russian \n     Federation, Singapore, Thailand, Tonga, the United States, \n     and Vietnam, whose countries all border the Pacific Ocean \n     region, provides a forum where leaders of regional navies can \n     meet to discuss cooperative initiatives, discuss regional and \n     global maritime issues, and undertake exercises to strengthen \n     norms and practices that contribute to operational safety, \n     including protocols for unexpected encounters at sea, common \n     ways of communication, common ways of operating, and common \n     ways of engagement;\n       Whereas, Japan and the People's Republic of China sought to \n     negotiate a Maritime Communications Mechanism between the \n     defense authorities and a Maritime Search and Rescue \n     Agreement and agreed in principle to these agreements to \n     address operational safety on the maritime domains but failed \n     to sign them;\n       Whereas the Changi Command and Control Center in Singapore \n     provides a platform for all the countries of the Western \n     Pacific to share information on what kind of contact at sea \n     and to provide a common operational picture for the region;\n       Whereas 2014 commemorates the 35th anniversary of \n     normalization of diplomatic relations between the United \n     States and the People's Republic of China, and the United \n     States welcomes the development of a peaceful and prosperous \n     China that becomes a responsible international stakeholder, \n     the government of which respects international norms, \n     international laws, international institutions, and \n     international rules; enhances security and peace; and seeks \n     to advance relations between the United States and China; and\n       Whereas ASEAN plays an important role, in partnership with \n     others in the regional and international community, in \n     addressing maritime security issues in the Asia-Pacific \n     region and the Indian Ocean, including open access to the \n     maritime domain of Asia; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       The Senate--\n       (1) condemns coercive and threatening actions or the use of \n     force to impede freedom of operations in international \n     airspace by military or civilian aircraft, to alter the \n     status quo or to destabilize the Asia-Pacific region;\n       (2) urges the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     to refrain from implementing the declared East China Sea Air \n     Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), which is contrary to \n     freedom of overflight in international airspace, and to \n     refrain from taking similar provocative actions elsewhere in \n     the Asia-Pacific region; and\n       (3) commends the Governments of Japan and of the Republic \n     of Korea for their restraint, and commends the Government of \n     the Republic of Korea for engaging in a deliberate process of \n     consultations with the United States, Japan and China prior \n     to announcing its adjustment of its Air Defense \n     Identification Zone on December 9, 2013, and for its \n     commitment to implement this adjusted Air Defense \n     Identification Zone (ADIZ) in a manner consistent with \n     international practice and respect for the freedom of \n     overflight and other internationally lawful uses of \n     international airspace.\n\n     SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to--\n       (1) reaffirm its unwavering commitment and support for \n     allies and partners in the Asia-Pacific region, including \n     longstanding United States policy regarding Article V of the \n     United States-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty and that \n     Article V of the United States-Japan Mutual Defense Treaty \n     applies to the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands;\n       (2) oppose claims that impinge on the rights, freedoms, and \n     lawful use of the sea that belong to all nations;\n       (3) urge all parties to refrain from engaging in \n     destabilizing activities, including illegal occupation or \n     efforts to unlawfully assert administration over disputed \n     claims;\n       (4) ensure that disputes are managed without intimidation, \n     coercion, or force;\n       (5) call on all claimants to clarify or adjust claims in \n     accordance with international law;\n       (6) support efforts by ASEAN and the People's Republic of \n     China to develop an effective Code of Conduct, including the \n     ``early harvest'' of agreed-upon elements in the Code of \n     Conduct that can be implemented immediately;\n       (7) reaffirm that an existing body of international rules \n     and guidelines, including the International Regulations for \n     Preventing Collisions at Sea, done at London October 12, 1972 \n     (COLREGs), is sufficient to ensure the safety of navigation \n     between the United States Armed Forces and the forces of \n     other countries, including the People's Republic of China;\n       (8) support the development of regional institutions and \n     bodies, including the ASEAN Regional Forum, the ASEAN Defense \n     Minister's Meeting Plus, the East Asia Summit, and the \n     expanded ASEAN Maritime Forum, to build practical cooperation \n     in the region and reinforce the role of international law;\n       (9) encourage the adoption of mechanisms such as hotlines \n     or emergency procedures for preventing incidents in sensitive \n     areas, managing them if they occur, and preventing disputes \n     from escalating;\n       (10) fully support the rights of claimants to exercise \n     rights they may have to avail themselves of peaceful dispute \n     settlement mechanisms;\n       (11) encourage claimants not to undertake new unilateral \n     attempts to change the status quo since the signing of the \n     2002 Declaration of Conduct, including not asserting \n     administrative measures or controls in disputed areas in the \n     South China Sea;\n       (12) encourage the deepening of partnerships with other \n     countries in the region for maritime domain awareness and \n     capacity building, as well as efforts by the United States \n     Government to explore the development of appropriate \n     multilateral mechanisms for a ``common operating picture'' in \n     the South China Sea that would serve to help countries avoid \n     destabilizing behavior and deter risky and dangerous \n     activities; and\n       (13) assure the continuity of operations by the United \n     States in the Asia-Pacific region, including, when \n     appropriate, in cooperation with partners and allies, to \n     reaffirm the principle of freedom of operations in \n     international waters and airspace in accordance with \n     established principles and practices of international law.\n\n[[Page S2200]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 413--RECOGNIZING 20 YEARS SINCE THE GENOCIDE IN \n  RWANDA, AND AFFIRMING IT IS IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST OF THE UNITED \n  STATES TO WORK IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS TO \n     HELP PREVENT AND MITIGATE ACTS OF GENOCIDE AND MASS ATROCITIES\n\n  Mr. COONS (for himself, Mr. Menendez, and Mr. Flake) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.:\n\n                              S. Res. 413\n\n       Whereas, in the aftermath of the Holocaust, the United \n     Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the \n     Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide declaring \n     that genocide, whether committed in a time of peace or war, \n     is a crime under international law;\n       Whereas the United States was the first country to sign the \n     Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \n     Genocide, and the Senate voted to ratify the Convention on \n     the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide on \n     February 11, 1986;\n       Whereas, for approximately 100 days between April 7, 1994, \n     and July 1994, more than 800,000 civilians were killed in a \n     genocide in Rwanda that targeted members of the Tutsi, \n     moderate Hutu, and Twa populations, resulting in the horrific \n     deaths of nearly 70 percent of the Tutsi population living in \n     Rwanda;\n       Whereas the massacres of innocent Rwandan civilians were \n     premeditated and systematic attempts to eliminate the Tutsi \n     population by Hutu extremists, fueled by hatred and \n     incitement propagated by newspapers and radio;\n       Whereas, in addition to systematic targeting of an ethnic \n     minority in Rwanda resulting in the mass slaughter of \n     innocent civilians, rape was also used as a weapon of war;\n       Whereas, despite the deployment of the United Nations \n     Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) in October 1993 \n     following the end of the Rwandan Civil War, its mandate was \n     insufficient to ensure the protection of large swathes of the \n     population, demonstrating the inability of the United Nations \n     to effectively respond to the unfolding genocide and stop or \n     mitigate its impact;\n       Whereas, on July 4, 1994, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, a \n     trained military group consisting of formerly exiled Tutsis, \n     began its takeover of the country, which resulted in an \n     ending of the genocide, though not a complete end to the \n     violence, including retribution;\n       Whereas, in October 1994, the International Criminal \n     Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) was established as the first \n     international tribunal with the mandate to prosecute the \n     crime of genocide and ultimately prosecuted 63 individuals \n     for war crimes, including genocide and crimes against \n     humanity as well as the first convictions for rape as a \n     weapon of war;\n       Whereas the United States Government supports initiatives \n     to ensure that victims of genocide and mass atrocities are \n     not forgotten, and has committed to work with international \n     partners to help prevent genocide and mass atrocities and \n     identify and support a range of actions to protect civilian \n     populations at risk;\n       Whereas, in July 2004, the Senate adopted Senate Concurrent \n     Resolution 133 and the House of Representatives adopted House \n     Concurrent Resolution 467, declaring that ``the atrocities \n     unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, are genocide'', and calling on \n     the United States Government and the international community \n     to take measures to address the situation immediately;\n       Whereas, in September 2004, the United States Government, \n     in testimony by Secretary of State Colin Powell before the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, declared the \n     ongoing conflict in Darfur, Sudan a ``genocide'' perpetrated \n     by the government based in Khartoum against its own people \n     and affecting over 2,400,000 people in Sudan, including an \n     estimated 200,000 fatalities;\n       Whereas, in September 2005, the United States joined other \n     members of the United Nations in adopting United Nations \n     General Assembly Resolution 60/1, which affirmed that the \n     international community has a responsibility to use \n     appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful \n     means, in accordance with Chapter VI (Military enforcement) \n     and VIII (Regional Arrangements) of the United Nations \n     Charter, to help protect populations from genocide, war \n     crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity;\n       Whereas, in December 2011, the Senate unanimously passed \n     Senate Concurrent Resolution 71, recognizing the United \n     States' national interest in helping to prevent and mitigate \n     acts of genocide and other mass atrocities against civilians, \n     and urging the development of a whole of government approach \n     to prevent and mitigate such acts;\n       Whereas, in April 2012, President Barack Obama established \n     the Atrocities Prevention Board within the United States \n     inter-agency structure, chaired by National Security staff, \n     to help identify and more effectively address atrocity \n     threats, including genocide, as a core national security \n     interest and core moral responsibility;\n       Whereas, in July 2013, the National Intelligence Council \n     completed the first ever National Intelligence Estimate on \n     the global risk for mass atrocities and genocide;\n       Whereas, in January 2014, the National Director of \n     Intelligence testified before the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the Senate, stating that ``the overall risk \n     of mass atrocities worldwide will probably increase in 2014 \n     and beyond . . . Much of the world will almost certainly turn \n     to the United States for leadership to prevent and respond to \n     mass atrocities.'';\n       Whereas, despite measures taken by the United States \n     Government and other governments since 1994, the \n     international community still faces the challenges of \n     responding to escalation of violence, atrocities, and \n     religious-based conflict in many corners of the globe, \n     including Syria and the Central African Republic, and a \n     failure of the international community to appropriately \n     respond to and address the rapidly deteriorating situation \n     could result in further atrocities;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council was unable to \n     pass a resolution condemning the Government of Bashar al \n     Assad of Syria for the use of chemical weapons against \n     civilians, killing more than 1,400 of his own people in \n     August 2013; and\n       Whereas United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \n     recommended to the United Nations Security Council the \n     establishment of a United Nations peacekeeping mission in the \n     Central African Republic with the primary mandate to protect \n     civilians: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the United Nations' designation of April 7th \n     as the International Day of Reflection on the Genocide in \n     Rwanda;\n       (2) honors the memory of the more than 800,000 victims of \n     the Rwandan genocide and expresses sympathy for those whose \n     lives were forever changed by this horrific event;\n       (3) expresses support for the people of Rwanda as they \n     remember the victims of genocide;\n       (4) affirms it is in the national interest of the United \n     States to work in close coordination with international \n     partners to prevent and mitigate acts of genocide and mass \n     atrocities;\n       (5) condemns ongoing acts of violence and mass atrocities \n     perpetrated against innocent civilians in Syria, the Central \n     African Republic, South Sudan, Sudan and elsewhere;\n       (6) urges the President to confer with Congress on an \n     ongoing basis regarding the priorities and objectives of the \n     Atrocities Prevention Board;\n       (7) urges the President to work with Congress to strengthen \n     the United States Government's ability to identify and more \n     rapidly respond to genocide and mass atrocities in order to \n     prevent where possible and mitigate the impact of such \n     events; and\n       (8) supports ongoing United States and international \n     efforts to--\n       (A) strengthen multilateral peacekeeping capacities;\n       (B) build capacity for democratic rule of law, security \n     sector reform, and other measures to improve civilian \n     protection in areas of conflict;\n       (C) ensure measures of accountability for perpetrators of \n     mass atrocities and crimes against humanity; and\n       (D) strengthen the work of United States and international \n     institutions, such as the Holocaust Memorial Museum, which \n     are working to document, identify, and prevent mass \n     atrocities and inspire citizens and leaders worldwide to \n     confront hatred and prevent genocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/07/senate-section/article/S2200-1", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2200-S2201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 414--DESIGNATING APRIL 2014 AS ``NATIONAL CONGENITAL \n                 DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS (for himself and Mr. Cardin) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 415\n\n       Whereas the week of April 7 through April 13, 2014, is \n     National Public Health Week, and the theme for 2014 is \n     ``Public Health: Start Here'';\n       Whereas since 1995, public health organizations have used \n     National Public Health Week to educate the public, \n     policymakers, and public health professionals about issues \n     that are important to improving the health of the people of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the public health system that keeps our communities \n     healthy and safe is changing as technologies advance, public \n     attitudes toward health shift, and more health and safety \n     options become available;\n       Whereas the value of a strong public health system is in \n     the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, and \n     the places where we live, learn, work, and play;\n       Whereas public health professionals help communities \n     prepare for, withstand, and recover from the impact of \n     natural and man-made disasters;\n       Whereas according to the Institute of Medicine, despite \n     being one of the wealthiest nations in the world, the United \n     States still ranks below many other economically prosperous \n     countries in life expectancy, infant mortality, low birth \n     weight, and many other indicators of public health;\n       Whereas studies have shown that small strategic investments \n     in preventive health care could result in significant savings \n     in overall health care costs;\n       Whereas research suggests that each 10 percent increase in \n     local public health spending contributes to a 6.9 percent \n     decrease in infant deaths, a 3.2 percent decrease in \n     cardiovascular deaths, a 1.4 percent decrease in deaths due \n     to diabetes, and a 1.1 percent decrease in cancer deaths;\n       Whereas in communities across the country, people are \n     changing the way they care for their health by avoiding \n     tobacco use, eating well, being physically active, and \n     preventing injuries at home and in the workplace; and\n       Whereas by adequately supporting public health and \n     preventive health care, we can continue to transition from a \n     public health system focused on treating illness to one \n     focused on preventing disease and promoting wellness: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Public Health \n     Week;\n       (2) recognizes the efforts of public health professionals, \n     the Federal Government, States, Tribes, municipalities, local \n     communities, and individuals in preventing disease and \n     injury;\n       (3) recognizes the role of the public health system in \n     improving the health of individuals in the United States;\n       (4) encourages increasing the efforts and resources devoted \n     to improving the health of people in the United States and to \n     making the United States the healthiest nation in the world \n     in one generation through--\n       (A) greater opportunities to improve community health and \n     prevent disease and injury; and\n       (B) strengthening the public health system of the United \n     States; and\n       (5) encourages the people of the United States to learn \n     about the role of the public health system in improving \n     health in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/04/07/senate-section/article/S2201-2", "month": "04", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 416--AUTHORIZING THE TAKING OF A PHOTOGRAPH IN THE \n                  CHAMBER OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. McConnell) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to.:\n\n                              S.
