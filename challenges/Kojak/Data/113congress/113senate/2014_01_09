Another day has passed and we still have a vast majority of \nRepublicans standing in the way of the extension of unemployment \nbenefits.\n  Some Republican Senators are having conversations about possible \noffsets for a full-year extension. I have said a number of times I \nthink we would be ill-advised to have another short-term extension. If \nwe are going to have an extension that they are talking about paying \nfor, let's do it for 1 year. We don't need to come back and worry about \nthis in 3 more months.\n  Let's see how they wish to pay for this. We have heard proposals. The \nproposals are, one, to stop people having health care. The other is to \ngo after children, the earned-income tax credit for American boys and \ngirls. It doesn't sound like a very good idea to me.\n  Then we have a number of proposals suggested by another Senator late \nlast night that, if we look at it, it is not worth $5 billion. It is \nworth much less than that. To do what has been suggested by one \nRepublican Senator would be to devastate the disabled, and that \nwouldn't be appropriate.\n  I would be interested if there are other proposals. As I have \nindicated on a number of occasions, I continue to say offsetting the \ncost of emergency unemployment benefits is not something I agree with.\n  President Bush extended emergency unemployment insurance five times. \nNot one of these five times was there a whimper from my Republican \ncolleagues or certainly Democratic Senators that it should be paid for. \nIt wasn't right to offset the cost when President Bush was President, \nand it is not right to offset the cost now that President Obama is in \nthe White House.\n  We have cut the deficit in half since President Obama took office, \nand overall debt reduction has been even more transparent, almost $3 \ntrillion. While we must keep up our good work, we have more to do. We \nmust solve the Nation's job crisis if we ever hope to solve fiscal \nproblems.\n  Today's long-term unemployment rate is more than double what it was \nat any time Congress let emergency job assistance expire. Since many \nRepublican Senators are insisting that the cost be offset, I am pleased \nto talk, as we all are on this side of the aisle, about a long-term \nemergency extension of unemployment benefits. I repeat, I am waiting to \nhear from my Republican colleagues about how to pay for this extension.\n  It has been a week since families already hanging by a thread were \nkicked off of unemployment insurance benefits. Think about this. People \nwho have been out of work for month after\n\n[[Page S190]]\n\nmonth learned at the beginning of this year they wouldn't get $300 a \nweek.\n  Remember, this is not charity. First, they have to lose their job, \nthrough no fault of their own. Then they have to go out every week, \nlook for a job, and have to list where they have gone.\n  For every job that is available in America today, there are three \npeople looking for that job. I was stunned when I had my news briefing \nthis morning when one Republican Senator said: There are so many jobs \nthat are unfilled in America today. Let these people go get those jobs. \nTry that one on for size.\n  For many the benefits were the only thing preventing them from \ndescending into poverty or even becoming homeless. Hundreds of \nthousands of children, as a result of these benefits, have been stopped \nfrom going into the rolls of the poor.\n  These families can't wait any longer for relief. I am optimistic my \nRepublican colleagues will help us find a way out of this, and put \npeople first and partisanship second.\n  Tuesday, House Republican leaders were forced to send a message to \ntheir Members reminding them these people are out of work, be \ncompassionate. Then, of course, the memo came to the Senate.\n  Can one imagine having to remind Senators about having compassion for \npeople who have been long-term unemployed?\n  Yesterday afternoon the Republican leader spoke in this Chamber for a \nlong time, 45 minutes. Not once during this discussion were the words \n``jobs,'' ``the economy'' or ``unemployment'' mentioned--not once.\n  Middle-class Americans are hurting. We know the rich are getting \nricher, the poor are getting poorer, and the middle class is being \nsqueezed.\n  During the last 30 years, the middle class has lost 10 percent of the \nearnings they had in the previous 30 years, whereas the top 1 percent \nduring that same 30-year period had their income and wealth triple.\n  These people who are struggling out there are working two jobs. Some \nare even trying to do it with three jobs, and some of it is part-time, \njust in an effort to get by. The rest have watched their wages shrink \nat the same time, as I have indicated, as the richest of the rich are \ndoing much, much better.\n  What beleaguered Americans need is not a memo on basic decency, as \nRepublicans got on Tuesday, or a bitter diatribe about the rules of the \nSenate; they need solutions. For 1.3 million Americans today and 5 \nmillion Americans over the course of this year, extending emergency \nunemployment benefits is a solution.\n  Raising the minimum wage so a mother or father working two jobs can \nafford the rent and an electric bill in the same month is a solution. \nInvesting in job creation and education so the workers of today can \ncompete for the jobs of tomorrow is a solution. Whenever my Republican \ncolleagues are prepared to stop complaining and start working with \nDemocrats to create solutions, we will be here waiting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/09/senate-section/article/S190-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

For months the Democrats who run Washington have been \ndesperate to distract from the pain of ObamaCare. If we listen to them, \nthey think they have found something that might work for them.\n  The one thing that can actually distract folks from the misery of \nthis law is the misery of the economic malaise they have presided over \nfor the past 5 years. We truly have to hand it to them in one respect. \nIt takes a lot of chutzpah to spend an entire Presidential term pushing \npolicies that are supposedly meant to help the little guy and then turn \naround and blame everybody else when they flop.\n  But chutzpah won't solve the problem, and the poll-tested talking \npoints and failed stimulus ideas we have seen Democrats trot out thus \nfar won't do much to improve the plight of millions of Americans \nstruggling in today's economy.\n  To me that is the real tragedy, because the discussion about how to \nhelp Americans battle against the odds day after day is a conversation \nwe actually should be having. In fact, it is a debate Republicans are \nhaving. In recent days we have seen several leading Republicans talk \nabout how to tackle poverty in the 21st century.\n  Unlike the Democrats' outdated ideas from the sixties, Republicans \nare thinking about ways to update our Nation's approach with fresh \nproposals that speak to the situation Americans actually find \nthemselves in today, not back in the sixties.\n  The Republican approach is to learn from past mistakes. It is about \nturning the left's good intentions into policies that can actually get \nthe job done, and it is about moving beyond the treatment of symptoms \nand getting at the underlying problems.\n  That is the thinking behind the Economic Freedom Zones Act, which \nSenator Paul and I recently introduced. It aims to shine a light into \nsome of the most impoverished corners of our country, to raise up \ncities and families who have been left behind and sometimes literally \ncrushed by the outdated ideas from the sixties and to actually do that \nin a way that lasts.\n  With this legislation, some of the most disadvantaged areas of our \ncountry would acquire the ability to apply for economic freedom zone \nstatus that would help lift the burden of some of the poorest families \nin our country. Small business owners would see fewer government \nregulations, enabling them to create jobs and drive prosperity. \nEntrepreneurs would see punitive tax barriers peeled back, allowing \nthem to lead a recovery with new ideas and new energy. Failed \neducational systems would see reforms that lift up disadvantaged \nchildren, giving new hope to a younger generation. Cities and regions \nthat now face a dark future could transform themselves, if they chose, \nalmost instantly into magnets for new ideas and for new hope.\n  If our Democratic colleagues are serious about their focus on \neconomic distress--if it is more than only some poll-tested ObamaCare \ndistraction--then I would invite them to work with us on innovative new \napproaches such as this.\n  This could allow the Senate, for instance, to consider our proposal \nas an amendment to the unemployment insurance legislation currently on \nthe floor, because this is a discussion that needs to be about helping \npeople. These economic freedom zones are similar in some ways to the \nPromise Zone initiative recently developed by the Obama administration.\n  I was pleased to hear that eight counties in eastern Kentucky will \nsoon receive Promise Zone designation. That is why I wrote in support \nof granting this designation last year, because there is no doubt that \neastern Kentucky is a region that has suffered enormous hardship in \nrecent years--much of it, unfortunately, related to the very same Obama \nadministration war on coal families. But the promise zone designation \nis a step in the right direction nonetheless. Senator Paul and I will \nbe heading to the White House later today for a promise zone event \nbecause we are encouraged the President is finally--finally--focused on \na concrete approach to jobs that Members of both parties can support, \nproving that we can accomplish things when we focus on real efforts \nrather than political show votes that are designed to fail.\n\n  Promise zones are something we can build on with far more \ncomprehensive approaches, such as Senator Paul's economic freedom zones \nthat would reach even more communities in need\n\n[[Page S191]]\n\nof revitalization. Because let's remember this: Government programs can \nsometimes help, but they can't do everything. The 1960s mindset about \nhow to fight poverty needs to change to fit the realities of the 21st \ncentury.\n  I want to share a sentiment I read yesterday from Thomas Vincent, an \nunemployed coal worker from the very Kentucky county where LBJ launched \nhis big-government blitz 50 years ago. This was his take on the so-\ncalled ``war on poverty:'' What good are all these government programs \nif they do not get you a job? It is a feeling, the article noted, that \nis widespread among his neighbors in Martin County.\n  This is why Republicans say it is time for modernization and new \napproaches. It is time to give folks such as Thomas real hope. It is \ntime to give them more than just good intentions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/09/senate-section/article/S191-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss amendment No. 2622 \nI have filed, the Solutions to Long-Term Unemployment Act, that will be \nbefore the Senate today.\n  The bill before the Senate today would extend emergency unemployment \nbenefits for the 13th time since 2008. Let me repeat that. Congress has \nenacted or extended emergency unemployment benefits 13 times over the \npast 5 years. At some point you have to start asking yourself: At what \npoint does this no longer become an emergency but it becomes permanent? \nWe have been doing this now for 5 years. This will be the 13th time.\n  Obviously, there are lots of people in a tough economy who are still \nhurting. But what this should say to us is that it is time we started \nnot just treating the symptom but fixing the problem we have in America \ntoday. And the problem we have is a sluggish economy that continues to \nsort of stumble along. We have a chronically high unemployment rate \nwith lots of people who have been unemployed for a very long period of \ntime. Over that same period, Congress has pushed through ObamaCare, \nraised taxes on job creators, while the administration has pursued \naggressive regulations that have done little more than drive up costs \nfor many of our small businesses.\n  So after 13 extensions of unemployment benefits, expensive new \nregulations, and higher taxes, what is the result? Well, today over 37 \npercent of unemployed Americans have been out of work for 27 weeks or \nlonger. That represents over 4 million men and women who have been most \nimpacted by President Obama's failed economic policies.\n  I applaud my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle who have \noffered up commonsense, even bipartisan, ideas to pay for the extension \nof emergency unemployment benefits. If we extend these benefits once \nagain, I am hopeful we can find an appropriate way to pay for this \nextension and not pass the bill on to our children and grandchildren. \nHowever, I also have to come to the floor today to challenge all of my \ncolleagues to look at solutions to the underlying problem rather than \nsimply treating the symptoms of long-term unemployment for yet the 13th \ntime.\n  The underlying problem is we have 4 million Americans who have not \nbeen able to find jobs for more than 6 months on account of the \nstagnant Obama economy. That is almost double--double--the amount of \nlong-term unemployed Americans relative to prerecession levels. So my \namendment addresses the underlying problem of long-term unemployment by \nreducing labor costs, increasing worker mobility, and strengthening \nFederal worker training programs.\n  First, my amendment would provide much-needed relief from ObamaCare \nfor any employer who hires an individual who has been unemployed for 27 \nweeks or longer. As we all know, ObamaCare is full of additional costs \nand mandates that are stifling economic growth. The ObamaCare employer \nmandate arguably has the greatest impact on an already weak labor \nmarket. The impact of this mandate is so great the administration has \nunilaterally delayed it until after the next election. Under this \nmandate, a business with 50 or more employees must provide government-\napproved insurance or pay an annual penalty of $2,000 to $3,000 per \nemployee. For a smaller or medium-sized business, that is a significant \ndeterrent to expanding and hiring more workers.\n  Under my amendment, if a business decides to hire someone who has \nbeen out of work for 27 weeks or longer, that person would be exempt \nfrom the ObamaCare mandate for as long as he or she works at that \nbusiness.\n  Second, my amendment would further reduce labor costs by providing a \n6-month payroll tax holiday for any employer who hires a long-term \nunemployed worker. Employers currently pay a payroll tax of 6.2 percent \nof an employee's wages up to a capped amount known as the Social \nSecurity wage base. Waiving this tax is an incentive for employers to \nhire those employees often considered to be a higher risk by virtue of \nthe fact they have been out of the labor force for an extended period \nof time.\n  Consider a job that is paying an annual wage of $40,000. The employer \npayroll tax holiday in my amendment represents a $1,240 incentive for \nthe employer to hire a long-term unemployed individual. Or take a \nhigher skilled job paying $80,000 annually. A payroll tax holiday \nrepresents a $2,480 incentive for the employer to hire someone who has \nbeen unemployed for 27 weeks or longer. When coupled with the ObamaCare \nexemption in my amendment, that is an incentive of roughly $5,000 to \nhire an individual who has been unemployed for an extended period of \ntime.\n  Third, my amendment addresses a fundamental problem facing the long-\nterm unemployed by providing relocation assistance to start a job or \nfind better opportunities.\n  While the national labor market remains weak, there are pockets of \nprosperity across the country. In my home State of South Dakota, we \nhave an unemployment rate of 3.6 percent. That is second only to our \nneighbors in North Dakota who are fully embracing the energy \nrenaissance which is occurring in the Upper Great Plains and other \nparts of the country. Because of South Dakota's low tax and regulatory \nframework, it consistently makes us one of the best places in the \nUnited States to start and grow a business. In fact, one of the biggest \nissues we hear from prospective business investors is a concern they \nare not going to have enough workers if they decide to move to my \nState.\n\n  Meanwhile, we have other parts of the Nation that continue to \nstruggle with persistently high unemployment rates. Virginia has an \nunemployment rate of 8\\1/2\\ percent, and Rhode Island has 9 percent. \nThe number of job openings and hire rates varies from region to region \nas well. This past summer the rate of job openings in the South was 20 \npercent greater than in the Northeast. The same trend exists for hiring \nrates between those two regions.\n  Part of a dynamic 21st economy is ensuring a mobile workforce that \ncan meet regional demands for good-paying jobs. However, if you have \nsomeone who has been living off of unemployment benefits for the past 6 \nmonths, that person likely does not have the resources to move to a new \nState for a new job.\n  My amendment would provide a low-interest loan of up to $10,000 for \nanyone willing to relocate to a new job or move to a new State with \nbetter employment opportunities. These loans would have to be repaid \nwithin 10 years, but no payments would be required for 1 year while \nthat individual or family gets back on their feet. Additionally, if the \nnew job is eliminated within that first year, through no fault of the \nemployee, the loan could be forgiven.\n\n[[Page S192]]\n\n  Finally, my amendment would strengthen and streamline Federal worker \ntraining programs. We currently have over 50--50--Federal training \nprograms across 9 Federal bureaucracies. It is a broken morass of \nprograms that isn't helping employers or employees, and it certainly \nisn't an efficient use of taxpayer dollars. Even President Obama, in \nhis 2012 State of the Union speech, said he wanted to ``cut through the \nmaze of confusing [job] training programs'' and create ``one program'' \nfor workers to find the help they need. Unfortunately, like many of the \nPresident's promises, that turned out to be more talk than action.\n  While the President has failed to put forward a real plan to reform \nour worker training programs, the Republican-led House of \nRepresentatives has acted on a plan to accomplish just that. The House-\npassed SKILLS Act includes several critical reforms that ensure workers \nreceive the training they need for positions that businesses need \nfilled today.\n  The SKILLS Act would consolidate 35 redundant and ineffective Federal \nworker programs into a single workforce investment fund that would \nserve as a single source of support for workers, employers, and job \nseekers at the State level. This legislation creates much-needed \nflexibility at the State level and it empowers Governors and local \nemployers to train workers for today's in-demand jobs.\n  The SKILLS Act cuts through redtape and eliminates barriers that \noftentimes keep workers from receiving the training they need when they \nneed it. For too long we have been throwing taxpayer dollars at a maze \nof overlapping bureaucracies when we should be providing more targeted \nassistance directly to job seekers. We need to be training our workers \nfor the high-tech jobs of today and the jobs that will continue to be \nin demand in the future.\n  The SKILLS Act accomplishes these goals, which is why I included it \nin my amendment as a commonsense way to help the long-term unemployed \ntry to find work in today's economy.\n  There is no one solution to helping the unemployed. However, one \nthing is clear: We need to find ways to make it more attractive for \nemployers to invest in and hire workers rather than constantly pushing \nlegislation that will raise the cost of doing business in America.\n  Let's think for a second about the bills the Democratic majority \nsupports or supported in the past. ObamaCare raised the cost of labor, \nit drove up premiums for millions of Americans and made it more \nexpensive for employers to hire new employees.\n  Raising the minimum wage will raise the cost of hiring new employees \nand only worsen the job prospects for the long-term unemployed.\n  The tax increases pushed by Democrats here in the Senate and the \nWhite House apply to millions of small business owners which \ndiscourages investment and job growth.\n  New environmental regulations are driving up the cost of energy and, \ntherefore, the cost of doing business in this country.\n  I am not suggesting the provisions in my amendment are the only way \nto make it more economical for employers to hire more workers, but I am \nsuggesting if we want more employment, we need to make it less costly, \nnot more costly, to hire each additional employee. It seems that nearly \nevery policy pursued by the Democratic majority and the White House \nwould raise costs on businesses, especially those small businesses \nwhich create the majority of jobs in this country.\n  We have tried the approach of bigger government, higher taxes, and \nmore regulations for the last 5 years and it has not worked. Let's try \nsomething different. Let's have a real debate about how we lower cost \nand make it easier for employers to go out and hire new employees. \nLet's focus our efforts on those who need the most help, such as those \nAmericans who have been out of work the longest on account of the \nlagging Obama economy.\n  I hope this amendment as well as others that my colleagues will offer \nwill have an opportunity to be heard here on the floor of the Senate \nand voted on. What we have going on here now in terms of a process \ndoesn't resemble anything like an open process that should allow us to \nopenly debate the big issues that affect the American people. This is a \npocketbook issue. This strikes at the very heart of the quality of \nlife, the standard of living, the future economic well-being of \nAmericans all across this country.\n  I certainly hope the majority leader will allow for an open process \nwhich will enable us to enter into that debate, to put forward \nproposals--mine, among many others--which could be considered and voted \non that would actually improve the overall situation of middle-class \nAmericans. It is high time we had that debate. I hope we can, and I \nhope the majority will give us that opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/09/senate-section/article/S192-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S192-S193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, before I make my remarks, I commend the \nSenator from South Dakota and underscore what the Senator said \nregarding the SKILLS Act passed by the House of Representatives.\n  I am the ranking member of the labor subcommittee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions. Six years ago the Workforce Investment \nAct expired in its authorization, and for 6 years it has languished in \nthe bowels and in the heart of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives, going unauthorized.\n  During that same 6-year period of time between 2008 and today, \nAmerica has experienced terrible unemployment, terrible job loss, \nterrible increases in unemployment, and extensions of that \nunemployment.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is exactly correct: If we were doing \nour job and reauthorizing programs in the law today--such as the \nWorkforce Investment Act--and training people for the skills of the \n21st century and the jobs of the 21st century, we wouldn't be talking \nabout unemployment compensation, we wouldn't be talking about the great \ntragedies of America. We would be talking about America's greatest \nprosperity. So I commend the Senator from South Dakota for pointing out \nwhat is critically important for us to recognize as Members of the U.S. \nCongress.\n  I come to the floor, though, to talk about the Affordable Care Act, I \nwill tell a couple real-life stories which came to me by email. But \nbefore I do, my job is to do what the people of Georgia want me to do. \nI have office hours when I am home. I answer my own phone calls. I try \nto respond to the concerns they have. I try to see that people get \nreferred to the right place.\n  Since January 1, I have dealt with almost nothing but the Affordable \nCare Act--or ObamaCare--and the consequences of that act, and what \neffect it is having on the American people and the people of Georgia--\nand, in particular, on the two great promises used on the floor of this \nSenate to sell that legislation to the American people: One, if you \nlike your policy, you can keep it; and, if you like your doctor, you \ncan keep him or her. Both were clear, unequivocal promises.\n  I will tell two stories today that came to my attention which \nillustrate how it was not true. And these are just two of many stories. \nThe first is from Jane.\n\n       Congressman, This is not my story but my friend's story, \n     Steve. . . . He has suffered with multiple myeloma for more \n     than 10 years. This is a disease that usually kills within 5 \n     years of being diagnosed. But with the excellent health care \n     he has been able to receive through his health care program \n     he has had access to the Mayo Clinic and a myriad of drugs. \n     Now he has been told that his plan will be cancelled since \n     the plan does not meet the minimum standards set forth in the \n     ACA.\n       Now he can no longer continue his treatments because the \n     various plans have deemed the drugs he needs to stay alive as \n     experimental. WOW! Really that is just awful and not enough \n     is being said about this government take over of our lives is \n     affecting those that are critically ill.\n\n  And what about the promise made that if we liked our plan we can keep \nit? Steve doesn't have a plan, but he still has multiple myeloma.\n  This story comes about the promise that: If you like your doctor, you \ncan keep them. This is from Felicia in Alpharetta, GA, a story I hear \nmore and more as I travel my State:\n\n       My husband and I are both currently paying individual \n     health care policies as he currently has a small business and \n     I used to own one. He is on a Kaiser HMO and I am on a PPO \n     with Blue Cross Blue Shield. We have\n\n[[Page S193]]\n\n     both received numerous letters with conflicting information \n     regarding changes to our current policies. We are reasonably \n     intelligent people and yet we cannot figure out what is \n     actually happening with our health care nor do we believe the \n     government has any clue what is happening with this new \n     legislation. Also, in comparing an equivalent Obama care \n     policy to my current policy, I have only 10% of the doctors \n     available in network to what I currently have and of course, \n     my doctors are not in network. Please STOP and REPEAL this \n     ridiculous legislation. I DO NOT SEE ANY EVIDENCE that the \n     government can improve our current health care, only EVIDENCE \n     that it has caused much confusion, created wasted time, \n     wasted money, and driven Americans crazy!\n\n  These are two emails sent to me out of many more I could be reading. \nBut it is important for us to understand the impact the Affordable Care \nAct is having on the American people and the people of my State. In \nfact, I will share my personal experience from just over the Christmas \nholidays.\n  In December, I enrolled through the DC health care plan to buy my \nhealth care because all of Congress was moved into the DC health \nexchange to comply with the ObamaCare legislation. I worked hard to try \nand match the same care I had before under plan 105 Blue Cross/Blue \nShield under the government health care. I couldn't find exactly a good \nenough match of PPO, but I came close--close in everything except \npremium. The premium went up 20 percent. And I think most of the \nAmerican people--certainly people of my age--are realizing the same \ntype of experience where premiums are going up and up.\n  I would suspect the reason for the Executive order to extend next \nyear's open enrollment date beyond the election is in part because the \nadministration suspects what I suspect; that is, the realities of less \nenrollment than thought, and fewer young people going into coverage \nthan thought is going to mean higher premiums, less access, and less \naffordability.\n  But let me share another story which is really poignant. Fortunately, \nI was able to help, but when I found out, it broke my heart. It is a \nstory about my grandson Jack and his speech therapist.\n  Jack is a great kid, a highly intelligent kid, but had some speech \nproblems and so had a special speech therapist named Dr. Tim. Over the \nChristmas holidays I got to meet Dr. Tim, and we were talking about his \njob, what he does as a speech therapist, and about Jack and all of his \nimprovements.\n\n  Dr. Tim turned to me and said: I don't want to burden you with my \npersonal problems, but my youngest daughter has cystic fibrosis and has \nhad it into her teenage years; and I have had health care coverage up \nuntil a week ago, when I was notified my health coverage would no \nlonger pay for the drugs it takes to keep her alive.\n  For anybody in this Senate or in America who understands cystic \nfibrosis, it is a terrible debilitating disease of the lungs and people \nnever used to live to the age of 21. But because of medicine, health \ncare, and breakthroughs in pharmaceutical therapy, people live past the \nage of 21. In fact, we have a Georgian who lived into his 50s before he \npassed from cystic fibrosis. But they cannot live if they don't have \nthe pharmaceutical therapy. And there are no substitutes and there are \nno replacements.\n  This doctor lost his health care reimbursement for pharmaceuticals \nfor cystic fibrosis in part because of the judgments and the \napplicability of the Affordable Care Act. To his credit and to the \ncredit of the health care system and the insurance industry, he was \nable to in part replace it but not nearly as close to what he had on \nthe policy before.\n  These are just a few stories about Americans who are experiencing \nterrible problems because of the change in our health care system.\n  The promises we made are not being kept. The promises that were made \nto sell the Affordable Care Act to the American people and to the \nCongress of the United States are not being kept. It is important for \nus to understand that cannot stand. And if what happens next year \nhappens as I think it will, costs will skyrocket again for the American \npeople, access and affordability will go away or will not be nearly as \ngood as it is, and we will have taken a health care system which was \nthe envy of the world and turned it into a health care system that is \nthe biggest problem in the world.\n  I want things to work. I want to help the American people. I want \nthem to have access to affordable health care. I want them to have \naccess to their doctors and to be able to keep their policy. We need to \nwork toward that as we go through the tragedies of the implementation \nin 2014 of the Health Care Act--ObamaCare--which today is America's No. \n1 personal problem for the average American citizen.\n  I am grateful for the time, and I yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come here to speak about a couple items. \nWe are now in a second-day delay as the majority leader and his caucus \ndecide whether Republicans will be allowed to offer alternatives and to \noffer amendments to the proposal before us, and that is extension of \nthe Unemployment Insurance Act.\n  I was one of six who voted for the motion to proceed for the very \npurpose of achieving the opportunity to offer ideas which I have had \nand to allow others on our side of the aisle to offer their ideas as to \nhow we can improve this program, and how we ought to address it at this \npoint in our continuing effort to struggle out of the great recession \nnow into its fifth year.\n  Unemployment is still high in my State--over 7 percent--as a number \nof States, which is unacceptable, and particularly into the fifth year \nafter a recession. The growth has been so anemic and so tepid, we are \nsort of staggering our way into a better position.\n  Nevertheless, while some people are finding jobs and getting back to \nwork, there are many who aren't. That is a serious subject and \nsomething we ought to be debating and talking about.\n  Unemployment insurance is one of the programs which has been proposed \nto help those in need. There are people who are genuinely in need of \nthat help and have made every possible effort to get back to work and, \nfor many reasons, have not been able to do so. But we also know, and it \nhas been documented, that there are many people who have taken \nadvantage of this program and basically said, I don't have to work hard \nto get back to work because I am getting enough support from the \ngovernment.\n  We have to acknowledge the fact that there are policy issues which \nhave to be discussed as we go forward without automatically extending a \nprogram where we know reforms would make the program better and would \nput us in a better position to help people get back to work and to move \nour economy.\n  We also know, working now to just pass a budget for the first time \nhere in several years to work off of, the number we agreed on we \nwouldn't go over is now being violated. The very first legislative \npiece which has come before this body violates the budget agreement \nwhich was agreed to a short time ago. So a number of us would like the \nopportunity to propose ways to offset the spending if this program goes \nforward.\n  The combination of those two things--reforms which will allow us to \ncontinue to support those who are genuinely unable to find work from \nthose who are taking advantage of the program and abuse of the program, \nas well as suggestions as to how we can support efforts toward more \nfull employment through training programs, through any number of \ninitiatives--my colleagues would like to at least talk about, at least \ndebate, and at least have a vote on. We are in the minority here. We \nare not sure we are going to win any of those votes. Although I think \nif we make persuasive enough arguments and it makes enough sense, \nperhaps we will.\n  Given this 2-day delay in terms of a decision from majority leader \nHarry Reid as to whether to allow us these opportunities, it appears \nthat through this tactic of supporting the motion to proceed we have \nliterally put the ball in Harry Reid's office and his caucus court as \nto what they want to do.\n  We went through the year 2013, and since July, Republicans have been \noffered a total of only four amendments to all the things done in the \nlast 6\n\n[[Page S194]]\n\nmonths of this year. That is not how the Senate is supposed to work. \nThat is a dictatorial dictate by the majority leader, unprecedented in \n200 years or more of operation of this Senate.\n  So we are waiting for that decision, and, obviously, that decision \nwill have a bearing on my position on this particular issue.\n  I would also comment on the fact that lately we have been hearing a \nlot from the President about income inequality, and I anticipate we \nwill be hearing a lot more as we move toward the 2014 elections in \nNovember. There will be a debate on this, and I hope there will be a \ndebate which allows both sides to look at this in a serious way and try \nto find ways to address the issue. But if we do that, I think it is \nimportant we understand that the President's signature accomplishment, \nthe Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare, as it is called--is contributing to \nthe problem of income inequality. So any debate on that issue, to be \nfactually accurate and to be truthful, needs to incorporate a \nconversation about the impact of ObamaCare.\n  As recently as 2012, we were told by the President that the health \ninsurance premiums paid by small businesses and individuals ``will go \ndown.'' Yet even as the administration recently has admitted that many \nAmericans will pay more for health care because of ObamaCare, this week \nthe latest report on health spending trends from CMS--the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid--disclosed that health care spending in the \nUnited States rose 3.7 percent in 2012. That is less than it rose in \nprevious years, and that is a good sign.\n  Many are saying, well, the reason for this is the Affordable Care \nAct. Had we not passed the Affordable Care Act, this wouldn't have \nhappened. Apparently, though, they did not read the rest of the report \nbecause the report also states that the provisions in the Affordable \nCare Act had minimal impact on total national health care spending. So \nwhile the administration may claim that their bill, ObamaCare, is \nlowering overall health care spending, the report says it has only had \na minimal impact.\n\n  What is happening is that there are reforms being made through the \nprivate sector, through the providers, in terms of more efficient, more \neffective ways to deliver health care. That is not operating because of \nthe health care act. In fact, the health care act, if we are truthful \nabout it, is contributing to the problem of inequality.\n  Many Americans are experiencing, despite what the President has said, \nhigher premiums or paying outrageous deductibles when they purchase \ncoverage through the ObamaCare exchanges. Let's bring this down to a \npersonal level because I have been receiving hundreds, actually \nthousands of emails, phone calls, letters, comments that I hear back \nhome from Hoosiers who basically say: This ain't working. It is sure \nnot working for me.\n  But I want to bring it down to the personal level so we can \nunderstand what individual families are going through at this \nparticular time with this mandate imposed upon them relative to their \nhealth care coverage.\n  Thomas from Indianapolis wrote to me and said he went on the \nObamaCare exchange to take a look at health insurance plans that would \nbe available to him and he was, as he said, ``shocked to find that it \nwas at least $200 a month.'' That is $2,400 a year more than he had \nbeen quoted just a few months before from a broker. He added, ``I have \nthought about just going without insurance''--as we know many \nindividuals are thinking about and have decided not to sign up for this \nprogram. Of course, the program is built financially on the fact that \nmillions will sign up and that is not happening. I predict that is \ngoing to break the back of the program. He added:\n\n       I have thought about going without insurance, but my family \n     suggested that I not do that. The Affordable Care Act has \n     created a terrible quandary for me. At this point I feel as \n     if the Federal Government is like a mean Big Brother, making \n     my life miserable.\n\n  William from Granger, IN, emailed me to tell me his wife, who works \nas a part-time nurse, now is no longer offered health care because she \nis part time. So William then decided, OK, I will have to go into the \nexchange and find insurance for my wife and my family and discovered \nthat their premiums will rise to $19,076 a year. He goes on to say, \n``So much for `if you like your plan, if you like your doctor . . . \nyour costs will go down by $2,500.' ''\n  Let me repeat that. The President has said your costs are going to go \ndown by an average of $2,500 a year. William's costs increased over \n$7,500 a year. That is a $10,500 swing. That is not what was promised.\n  Brandy from Cambridge City, IN, told me:\n\n       I have been offered insurance through work at a cost of \n     $318 or $80 a week. I then checked HealthCare.Gov and have \n     been given a quote of $450 a month. I work a minimum wage job \n     and work as many hours as I can to get by as it is. After \n     taxes and child support, neither option is an option that I \n     can afford.\n\n  He also cannot even afford to pay the penalty of the payment.\n  These are just a few of the hundreds, if not thousands, of Hoosier \ncomments I have heard from people who are experiencing sticker shock \nwhen they search for so-called affordable care under ObamaCare. I don't \nknow if these people are Republicans or Democrats, conservatives, \nmoderates, liberals, nonvoters or voters. These are just human beings \nwho live in my State, regardless of their political affiliation, who \nare basically saying this thing is killing us. All these examples, \nmultiplied by hundreds if not thousands, are contributing to the \ninequality the President is talking about.\n  The inescapable truth is that the Democrats forced an unwanted, \nunpopular, and unread--the famous quote from then House Speaker Nancy \nPelosi--``We have to pass the bill so we can find out what is in it''--\nand we are finding out about what is in it--an unwanted, unpopular, and \nunread 2000-plus page, one-size-fits-all health care bill, dictated by \none party without any support from the minority.\n  I am questioning whether this is the best way to deal with health \ncare issues. Jamming this thing through on Christmas Eve day in 2009 \nhas turned out to be a disastrous Christmas gift for the American \npeople. Families across our country who are being forced to redirect \nmoney they would have used to pay rent, to help their children attend \nschool, to put food on the table, to pay the electric bills, are \nfinding many cannot even do that.\n  As we discuss the issue of income inequality, and it appears the \nPresident is going to want to do that throughout this coming election \nyear, let's not pretend that ObamaCare is helping the situation. It is \nnot. We need to face up to the fact that the Affordable Care Act--I bet \nthe writers of this bill, if they could do it over again, wish they had \nnot used the word ``affordable.'' They could call it the health care \nact or health care act for American people or whatever. If they went \nback and rewrote it, I bet you they would drop the word ``affordable,'' \nbased on the facts, not the perception, the fact of what this health \ncare bill is.\n  I suspect they would have wanted to pass this in a bipartisan way so \nthat at this point in time they would not have to take full \nresponsibility for this act. Too many hard-working American families \nare paying more, not less, for health care because of ObamaCare, and it \nis contributing to the inequality the President continues to talk \nabout.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/09/senate-section/article/S194-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S194-S196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the last few days our friends across \nthe aisle have been telling the American people that we have a choice \nwhen it comes to the extension of long-term unemployment benefits. On \none hand, they are saying we can do exactly what the President, Senator \nReid, and his allies want, which is to extend benefits for 3 months at \na cost of $6.5 billion that we will have to borrow from somebody or we \nwill do nothing at all.\n  Well, I am here to suggest that is a false choice, as President Obama \nlikes to say from time to time. We can do better than that. As a matter \nof fact, several of my Republican colleagues have offered their \nsuggestions. I have in my hand a list of 23 amendments that would deal \nwith everything from improving access to workforce training to finding \na way to pay for this money that would otherwise have to be borrowed \nfrom the Chinese or other creditors of the United States and added to \nour $17.3 trillion debt.\n\n[[Page S195]]\n\n  In other words, there are a lot of good ideas. We just have not been \ngiven the opportunity to debate them and offer these amendments and \nactually do what the Senate used to do. As the Republican leader said \nyesterday, we actually used to have committees that voted on amendments \nand then passed bills that came to the floor. We used to actually have \nan open amendment process where people could offer their amendments, \nand then we would debate them and vote on them. What a novel idea. \nThat, of course, is called legislating. That is what the legislative \nbranch--Congress--is supposed to be doing. That is not what we have \nbeen doing.\n  The majority leader is basically the traffic cop for the Senate \nfloor. He is the one who determines whether we have an opportunity to \nhave this sort of fulsome debate so we can offer these constructive, \nbipartisan--in many instances--ideas.\n  We would like to try to reform our unemployment compensation system \nin order to help grow the economy, help the private sector create jobs, \nand get more people back to work so they don't have to depend on \nextended unemployment insurance. However, if they do find themselves in \na difficult circumstance, as many Americans unfortunately do, they can \nthen go back to school by the using Pell grant, for example, to go to \nour community colleges, which do a fantastic job of helping people \nlearn new skills that make them a good fit for the good jobs, of which \nthere are many. Unfortunately, there are not enough skilled workers in \nthe workforce who are qualified for those jobs.\n  To give the Senate a flavor for some of the ideas, my colleague from \nOklahoma, Senator Coburn, who is always full of a lot of ideas, filed \nan amendment to ensure that people don't claim unemployment insurance \nand Social Security disability benefits simultaneously. If there is a \ncase of double dipping, that would seem to be it, and it is an abuse of \nthe system. He has filed an amendment that would prevent millionaires \nand billionaires from receiving unemployment checks. I know it is hard \nto believe, but people with incomes of $1 million or more have claimed \nnearly $21 million worth of unemployment benefits in a single year. \nThat is unbelievable. What an abuse. That is an insult, really, to \npeople who are in dire straits and need help, to know there are people \ngaming the system either by double dipping or being millionaires and \nclaiming unemployment benefits. Again, we have borrowed $250 billion to \npay these extended unemployment benefits since 2008, and there are some \nmillionaires and billionaires who are gaming the system for their \nbenefit. Why wouldn't we want to fix that? Why wouldn't we want to have \na vote on those good ideas by our colleague Senator Coburn?\n  Meanwhile, our colleague from South Carolina, Senator Scott, has \nfiled a commonsense amendment that would define full-time employment as \na 40-hour workweek for the purposes of ObamaCare. The Presiding \nOfficer--and since he walked in, I will pick on my friend from \nMaryland--remembers when we had a number of leaders from organized \nlabor who came to the White House and said that ObamaCare is turning \nfull-time work into part-time work. Because of the penalties associated \nwith the employer mandate and the like, many employers are shifting \nfull-time workers into part-time workers. That is not just a concern on \nthis side of the aisle; it is a broad concern which impacts a lot of \npeople.\n  I remember recently being in Tyler, TX, at a diner, and the owner of \nthat diner said he tragically had to put a single mom on a 30-hour \nworkweek in order to avoid some of the penalties of ObamaCare. So to \nmake up for that lost income, she had to go and get a second part-time \njob because of ObamaCare and its unintended consequences. So Senator \nScott has an amendment that would address that problem.\n  I hope the majority leader will rethink his longstanding position--at \nleast over the last 6 months--of basically shutting out any other \nconstructive ideas not just on this side of the aisle but on the other \nside of the aisle as well, as the Republican leader pointed out \nyesterday.\n  In addition, our colleague from Indiana, Senator Coats, has several \nideas. One would offset the extension of long-term unemployment \nbenefits by delaying the individual and employer mandates under \nObamaCare until 2015. We all recall that the President and this \nadministration on its own initiative--I am looking hard to find where \nthey have the authority, but nevertheless they did--delayed the \nemployer mandate for a year on their own. Well, this would take the \nmoney saved from delaying the individual employer mandate and use that \nto pay for the extension of unemployment benefits.\n  Another amendment would offset the cost of this extension by \nrequiring people to provide a Social Security number before they claim \nthe child tax credit. All it would do is make them provide a Social \nSecurity number to make sure that we root out fraud and abuse in the \nchild tax credit claims. It would save billions of dollars, and it \nwould allow us to pay for this short-term extension of long-term \nunemployment benefits.\n  I would also add that I think most people need to be reminded that \nactually the basic program of unemployment insurance covers people for \nup to half a year, but over the last 5 years Congress has extended that \nup to 99 weeks, which is about 2 years. Well, this is supposed to be an \nemergency program, and thankfully the economy is starting to show some \nsigns of improvement and growth. So what we need to do is get off of \nthis temporary emergency measure and get back to normal circumstances \nand try to find ways to pay our bills and make sure people don't abuse \nthe American taxpayer by gaming the system. We need to continue to look \nfor ways to help people learn the skills they need in order to get the \ngood, high-paying jobs that exist, among other things.\n  Well, here is another idea. Our colleague from New Hampshire, Senator \nAyotte, has filed an amendment that would restore the military pension \nbenefits. This is something, if you will remember, that was taken out \nof the Murray-Ryan budget deal that passed before we left for \nChristmas, and I think it is fair to say there is broad bipartisan \nsupport for restoring those cuts to the military pensions, and Senator \nAyotte's amendment would do that.\n  All of these amendments deserve debate, which I am trying in some \nsmall way to provide here, but others have their ideas and have their \nway of talking about it, and they also deserve a vote. But, again, the \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, is the traffic cop on the Senate floor. \nAs Senator McConnell pointed out yesterday, the Senate has been \ndramatically transformed from a place where the Senate was justifiably \nclaimed as the greatest deliberative body on the planet but no more.\n  We can return to the way the Senate used to be by having this sort of \nconstructive, bipartisan, fulsome discussion and vote on good ideas and \nmake legislation better and not settle for something less. I said--and \nit is true--that Senators have a right to debate and offer legislation. \nI am not sure many people across America have thought very deeply about \nwhat that means.\n\n  This isn't about the Presiding Officer's rights as a Senator or my \nrights as a Senator. This is about the rights and the voices of the 26 \nmillion people I represent, because when I am shut out of the process--\nwhen I can't offer amendments and ideas about how to improve \nlegislation--they are shut out as well, and that is wrong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I was unaware there was a time limit. I \nask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  So these amendments represent just a small sample of the ideas our \nside of the aisle has put forward to help the long-term unemployed, \naccelerate job creation, and grow the economy--something I know we all \nwant. We all want it, so why not talk about it. Why not vote on these \nideas. Why not get the Senate back into the position where we have the \ngive and take of ideas and where we come up with the best for the \nAmerican people.\n  A few other amendments my colleagues from Ohio and Kansas, Senator \nPortman and Senator Roberts, have\n\n[[Page S196]]\n\noffered would increase accountability and much stronger safeguards in \nthe U.S. regulatory system. Regulations are what the bureaucracy does. \nWe can't vote for them or against them. We can't hold them accountable \nthat way, and they are out of control. If someone wants to know why \nthose bills are so important, it is because last year the Obama \nadministration imposed $112 billion worth of new regulations on the \nU.S. economy--$112 billion worth of new regulations in 2013 alone.\n  Our colleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, who is the ranking \nmember of the energy committee, is rightly concerned about the impact \nof misguided regulations on our energy industry--primarily the oil and \ngas industry--and she has taken the time to draft a bold plan for \nreforming U.S. energy policy that would promote economic growth, job \ncreation, national security, and responsible stewardship of our \nenvironment.\n  In conclusion, I wish to recognize--in terms of a summary of some of \nthe ideas, 23 of which I have on this card, but I will just mention a \nfew of them--the ideas of our colleague from Utah, Senator Mike Lee, \nand his efforts to reform our dysfunctional tax system in a way that \nsupports middle class families who are working hard to provide for \ntheir children. We should agree, as Senator Lee has advocated, that tax \nreform should aim not just to simplify the Tax Code and fuel job \ngrowth, but also to ease the burden on hard-working, middle-class \nfamilies.\n  There are a lot of great ideas out there. I can't think of a better \ntime to talk about them than this time, when the President of the \nUnited States has made a priority of income inequality which, \nunfortunately, has become worse under his administration, not better. \nThis has been further exacerbated by burdens such as ObamaCare, which \nwe find out is just a bundle of broken promises, including: ``If you \nlike what you have, you can keep it.'' ``It will lower costs, not \nincrease them.'' We are finding out none of that is true.\n  There are a lot of great ideas that we could, working together in the \ninterests of the American people, agree on that would actually improve \ntheir economic situation and help restore the American dream. But what \nis the American dream to somebody who has been out of work and can't \nfind work? It is a disappointment to say the least. We need to help \npeople to not maintain their dependency on a government benefit in \nperpetuity but to liberate them from that dependency, to help them \nregain their self respect and sense of dignity by finding work and \nproviding for themselves and their families, and to live their version \nof the American dream. In the process we all benefit. The Federal \nGovernment can pay its bills because people are paying taxes because \nthey have good jobs, and America will be the same America we inherited \nfrom our parents and grandparents and, hopefully, we will make it \nbetter for the next generation and beyond.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have taken the floor of the Senate--and \nwhen I was a Member of the House, the floor of the House--to talk about \ncircumstances that are occurring somewhere in the world where people \nare being killed, displaced; people are being uprooted simply because \nof their ethnicity. Ethnic cleansing has occurred around the world. I \nhave taken the opportunity to put a spotlight on it in an effort to say \nthat the civilized world needs to bring an end to those types of crimes \nagainst humanity. I have used the opportunity as a member of the \nHelsinki Commission, and now as chairman of the Helsinki Commission, to \npoint out what America's priority needs to be, and that is to be a \nleader in the world to prevent ethnic cleansing.\n  Many of us believed, after World War II, that the world would never \nagain allow circumstances wherein people were killed simply because of \nthe ethnic community to which they belong. I have spoken about Bosnia, \nRwanda, Darfur, and Syria, and now we see the same thing happening \nagain in South Sudan.\n  I just came from a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nthat was convened to discuss the crisis in South Sudan with two \nwitnesses: the Honorable Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Assistant Secretary \nof the Bureau of African Affairs, and the Honorable Nancy E. Lindborg, \nAssistant Administrator of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and \nHumanitarian Assistance. These two witnesses were giving an update to \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee as to the circumstances in South \nSudan and what we can do to try to bring about a resolution.\n  I rise today to discuss the deteriorating circumstances in South \nSudan. As some of my colleagues may know, ongoing political tensions \nbetween forces loyal to President Salva Kiir and forces loyal to the \nformer Vice President Riek Machar, coupled with preexisting ethnic \ntensions, erupted in violence the night of December 15. I join the \nPresident and Secretary Kerry in calling for an immediate end to the \nviolence in South Sudan. Currently, it is estimated that nearly 200,000 \npeople have been internally displaced as a result of the conflict, with \nanother 32,000 having fled to neighboring States. The U.N. estimates \nthat thousands of Sudanese people have been killed since December 15. \nLet me just remind my colleagues that three years ago today the people \nof South Sudan started a voting process that later that year led to \ntheir independence as the youngest new country in the world.\n  Our U.S. Ambassador, Susan Page, has remained in Juba, along with a \nsecurity detail and minimum key personnel. I thank her; it is very \ncourageous of her to remain in South Sudan so we have our leadership on \nthe ground to try to help the people. I applaud her bravery and \nsacrifice and those who are with her.\n  The worsening violence has spurred a humanitarian crisis. The \nPresident has nominated Ambassador Booth to be our ambassador to that \nregion to try to get a peace process started. He is currently in \nEthiopia trying to get the international community to respond to a \npolitical solution to South Sudan. The international community has \nresponded rapidly, including by working to significantly expand the \nsize of the U.N. mission in South Sudan, but since the evacuation of \nforeign aid workers, most humanitarian agencies and the international \nNGOs are heavily reliant on brave South Sudanese staff who put their \nlives at risk to help their people.\n  These are large numbers for the country of Sudan--the number of \npeople displaced and the number of people killed. Let me share with my \ncolleagues one of many examples of the crisis and how it has affected \npeople in that region.\n  I recently learned that at the onset of the December clashes, one \nlocal staff person from an American NGO was rounded up, along with \nseven members of his family, and taken to a police station in Juba. He \nultimately escaped to the U.N. compound, but his family was killed, \nalong with more than 200 others. He is from the Nuer ethnic group, \nwhich now lives in fear of ethnic targeting by members of the country's \nsecurity forces from another ethnic group, the Dinka. Media reports \nalso suggest that individuals in uniforms have entered the U.N. bases \nin several locations and forcibly removed civilians taking shelter \nthere. On December 21, two U.N. peacekeepers were killed after a group \nattacked a U.N. peacekeeping base that was sheltering 20 civilians.\n  There is no safe harbor today in South Sudan. The U.N.'s base can be \noverrun, and people killed because of their ethnicity. The \ninternational community must respond.\n  I remain extremely concerned at the reports out of South Sudan, all \nof which suggest serious crimes against humanity are occurring in the \ncountry. The world cannot stand by and bear witness to another ethnic \ncleansing as we have seen in so many other places around the world. We \nmust do all we can to ensure a peaceful resolution of the crisis and \naccountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity in South \nSudan.\n  Our first priority is to get peace on the ground, to stop the \nkillings, so people can live in peace. We need to work with the \ninternational community so humanitarian aid can get to the people who \nneed it--and that is very challenging considering that international\n\n[[Page S197]]\n\nNGOs cannot operate today in South Sudan--and we must hold accountable \nthose who have committed crimes against humanity. We have said it over \nand over, but unless we hold accountable those who have perpetrated \nthese atrocities, we will see it again and again. U.S. leadership is \ncritically important to make sure that we document what has taken place \nand that we bring to justice those who are responsible for the crimes \nthat have been committed.\n  There is no question that a solution to the crisis in South Sudan \nmust be political and not military. We understand that. South Sudan \nagain is at a crossroads, and after coming so far, it must choose to \nrenounce violence immediately and pursue a path of peaceful \nreconciliation.\n  I am encouraged that President Kiir and former President Machar have \nsent negotiators to Ethiopia to participate in mediation talks. While \nthese talks are a good first step, in the interim the violence must \nend, and both sides must be committed to negotiating in good faith. It \nis my hope these talks can bring about the bright future so many South \nSudanese aspire for. The people of South Sudan deserve to understand \nthe true meaning of safety and security, of peace, and prosperity. The \nUnited States stands with the people of South Sudan through these \ndifficult times. We must pledge to continue to support those who seek \npeace, democracy, human rights, and justice for all of the citizens of \nthe world's newest nation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask consent to address the Senate as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. My colleague from South Carolina will join me shortly on \nthe floor, but I will make some remarks while I am waiting.\n  When the Senator from South Carolina joins me, I ask unanimous \nconsent to engage in a colloquy with the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/09/senate-section/article/S197-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S197-S200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                FALLUJAH\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Some of us were in the Senate 10 years ago in 2004 when \nU.S. troops led two major offensives against Al Qaeda and other \nmilitants in the Iraqi city of Fallujah. Some of us remember how 146 of \nour brave men and women in uniform lost their lives and more than 1,000 \nwere wounded. Those fights were some of the bloodiest and toughest \nbattles since the Vietnam war. Success was costly, but success we had. \nTen years later, Al Qaeda fighters have once again raised their black \nflags over Fallujah, and they are battling to control other parts of \nIraq.\n  This tragic setback is leaving many of our brave Iraq war veterans--\nand especially those who shed their blood, risked their lives, and lost \ntheir friends in fighting against Fallujah--questioning what their \nsacrifice was worth. Sadly, they find themselves agreeing with \nCongressman Duncan Hunter, a former marine who fought in Fallujah.\n  He said:\n\n       We did our job. We did what we were asked to do, and we \n     won. Every single man and woman who fought in Iraq, and \n     especially in those cities, feels a kick in the gut for all \n     they did, because this President decided to squander their \n     sacrifice.\n\n  Prior to 2011, President Obama frequently referred to a responsible \nwithdrawal from Iraq, which was based on leaving behind a stable and \nrepresentative government in Baghdad and avoiding a power vacuum that \nterrorists could exploit.\n  The President's Deputy National Security Adviser Antony Blinken in \n2012--and I am not making this up--stated that ``Iraq today is less \nviolent, more democratic, and more prosperous . . . than any other time \nin history.''\n  Based on the President's own markers, the administration is falling \nshort of its own goals. The illusion of a stable and representative \ngovernment has been shattered by increasing sectarian tension, and it \nis clear terrorists are exploiting the power vacuum left behind.\n  The Obama administration blames Iraqis for failing to grant the \nnecessary privileges and immunities for a U.S. force presence beyond \n2011. This is misleading--in fact, false--because as we saw firsthand, \nthe administration never took the necessary diplomatic effort to reach \nsuch an agreement.\n  The Senator from South Carolina and I traveled to Iraq in May 2011, \nonly several months away from the deadline that our commanders had set \nfor the beginning of the withdrawal. We met with all the leaders of \nIraq's main political blocs and we heard a common message during all of \nthese private conversations: Iraqi leaders recognized it was in their \ncountry's interest to maintain a limited number of U.S. troops to \ncontinue training and assisting Iraqi security forces beyond 2011.\n\n  But when we asked Ambassador Jeffrey and the Commander of U.S. Forces \nin Iraq Lloyd Austin, while in a meeting with Prime Minister Maliki, \nhow many U.S. troops remaining in Iraq would perform and how many the \nadministration sought to maintain, they couldn't tell us or the Iraqis. \nThe White House still had not made a decision.\n  It went on like this for the next few months. By August 2011, leaders \nof Iraq's main political blocs joined together and stated they were \nprepared to enter negotiations to keep some U.S. troops in Iraq. An \nentire month passed and still the White House made no decision. All the \nwhile, during this internal deliberation, as Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff GEN Martin Dempsey later testified before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, the size of a potential U.S. force presence \nkept cascading down from upwards of 16,000 to an eventual low of less \nthan 3,000. By that point, the force would be able to do little other \nthan protect itself, and Prime Minister Maliki and other Iraqi leaders \nrealized the political cost of accepting this proposal was not worth \nthe benefit.\n  To blame this failure entirely on the Iraqis is convenient, but it \nmisses the real point. The reason to keep around 10,000 to 15,000 U.S. \nforces in Iraq was not for the sake of Iraq alone. It was first and \nforemost in our national security interest to continue training and \nadvising Iraqi forces and to maintain greater U.S. influence in Iraq. \nThat core principle should have driven a very different U.S. approach \nto the SOFA--the status of forces agreement--diplomacy.\n  The Obama administration should have recognized that after years of \nbrutal conflict, Iraqi leaders still lacked trust in one another, and a \nstrong U.S. role was required to help Iraqis broker their most \npolitically sensitive decisions. For this reason the administration \nshould have determined what tasks and troop numbers were in the \nnational interest to maintain in Iraq and done so with ample time to \nengage with Iraqis at the highest level of the U.S. Government to shape \npolitical conditions in Baghdad to achieve our goal.\n  We focus on this failure not because U.S. troops would have made a \ndecisive difference in Iraq by engaging in unilateral combat operations \nagainst Al Qaeda and other threats to Iraq's stability. By 2011, U.S. \nforces were no longer in Iraqi cities or engaged in security \noperations. However, residual U.S. troop presence could have assisted \nIraqi forces in their continued fight against Al Qaeda, it could have \nprovided a platform for greater diplomatic engagement and intelligence \ncooperation with our Iraqi partners, it could have made Iranian leaders \nthink twice about using Iraqi airspace to transit military assistance \nand weapons and arms and equipment to Assad and his forces in Syria \nand, most importantly, it could have maintained the significant \ndiplomatic influence the United States at that time possessed in Iraq--\ninfluence that had been and still was essential in guaranteeing Iraq's \nnascent political system, reassuring Iraqi leaders they could resolve \ntheir differences peacefully and politically, despite their mistrust of \none another, and checking the authoritarian and sectarian tendencies of \nPrime Minister Maliki and his allies.\n  The administration's failure in Iraq has been further compounded by \nits\n\n[[Page S198]]\n\nfailure in Syria. In Syria, where President Obama has refused to take \nany meaningful action, the initially peaceful protests of early 2011 \nwere met by horrific violence by the Assad regime.\n  This President and this administration have stood back and watched \nwhile over 130,000 people have been brutally killed and a fourth of the \npopulation displaced. In his promise to avoid military action and \nreduce the U.S. footprint in the Middle East, we have seen the \nresurgence of Al Qaeda throughout the region, Hezbollah and Iran \nemboldened in Syria, Russia reasserting its principal presence for the \nfirst time since it was kicked out of Egypt by Egyptian President Sadat \nin 1973, and the destabilization of the region in ways that will \ninevitably reverberate here in America.\n  Again, there are those who may applaud President Obama's decision to \ndisengage, arguing this isn't America's problem to solve. That the \nUnited States is fundamentally limited in its ability to influence \ndevelopments in the Middle East is a consistent theme within the \nadministration. No one denies there are limits to what the United \nStates can do. That is always the case. But as Secretary Hillary \nClinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as she was leaving \noffice:\n\n       Let me underscore the importance of the United States \n     continuing to lead in the Middle East, North Africa and \n     around the world. When America is absent, especially from \n     unstable environments, there are consequences. Extremism \n     takes root, our interests suffer, and our security at home is \n     threatened.\n\n  Nowhere do her words ring more true than in Syria and Iraq today, \nbegging the question that by fleeing Iraq and sidestepping Syria has \nthe administration helped empower terrorist forces in ways that have \ncreated long-term threats to U.S. national security? I am afraid it is \nhard to argue the answer is no.\n  The administration must recognize its failed policies and change its \ncourse. America has lost credibility and influence over the past years, \nand we simply can't afford to remain disengaged. It is time that \nAmerica stands and take its rightful role in resolving these conflicts \nto best serve American interests. It is time we adopt a comprehensive \nstrategy for addressing the growing threats that are now emanating from \nthe region and move forward from a position of strength. A return of Al \nQaeda to Anbar Province is a sobering reminder for the administration \nthat the tide of war is not receding.\n  I see my colleague from South Carolina is here. I am sorry I didn't \nrealize he had come to the floor. I know the Senator from South \nCarolina and I need to discuss a recent unfortunate development in \nAfghanistan, but before we do, could I recall for my friend from South \nCarolina the many visits--and I have lost count, but many visits--we \nmade to Iraq from 2003 really up to 2012, and that one of the most \ninteresting visits we had was when we were in Ramadi and Colonel \nMacFarland announced to us that the Sunni sheiks had come over--that \nthe major sheik had come over, and he had sent some tanks over--and \nthat was the beginning of what we know as the Anbar awakening--a \nturning point in the entire conflict. That, coupled with the surge, \nchanged the fortunes of war in Iraq.\n  By the way, the surge was opposed vehemently by the President of the \nUnited States and the former Secretary of State, then Senator Clinton, \nwho stated in a hearing with General Petraeus that she would have to \nhave a ``willing suspension of disbelief in order to believe that the \nsurge would succeed.''\n  But setting that aside, later, when we came back again to Fallujah \nand Ramadi, the Senator from South Carolina and I walked down the main \nstreet of Ramadi--down the main street--with Iraqis everywhere, proving \nthe success of the surge in Anbar Province. Yet now, on the same \nstreets we walked down--the exact same streets--there are now vehicles \nfilled with Al Qaeda, flying the black flag of Al Qaeda.\n  The bloodiest war of the conflict that was fought during our entire \ninvolvement with Iraq was the second battle of Fallujah. There were 95 \nbrave Americans killed and over 600 wounded. What do we tell these \nyoung people and their families? What do we tell them? I tell you what \nwe have to tell them. We have to tell them their sacrifice was \nsquandered by an administration that wanted out and didn't want to \nremain and consolidate the gains that were made through the sacrifice \nof American blood and treasure.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would be glad to respond to the Senator's comments.\n  No. 1, I understand the average American thinks of the wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan as having been long and difficult wars costing a lot of \nmoney and a lot of American lives. But the point of the war is to make \nsure that radical Islam is contained and eventually defeated, and that \nis going to take an effort on our part.\n  Does it matter that the Al Qaeda flag flies over Fallujah and Ramadi? \nI think it does. I think when Al Qaeda occupies a city anywhere in the \nworld, it potentially affects every city throughout the world. Imagine \nthe Nazis having come back in Germany and occupying part of Germany. We \ndidn't let that happen. We had a following force in Japan and Germany \nto make sure the transition from totalitarian and dictatorial states to \nfunctioning democracies would occur. We are still in Japan and Germany. \nWe are not taking casualties.\n  To go into the Mideast and replace dictatorships and think you can do \nit in a matter of months or even a decade is probably not going to hold \nwater, quite frankly. The good news is we were in a position in Iraq in \n2010 where if we had left behind a residual force not to be in combat \nbut to provide the logistical, air support, training, intelligence \ncapabilities missing in the Iraqi Army, this would have been a very \ndifferent outcome.\n  And it does matter to my fellow citizens here in the United States. \nIf Al Qaeda is on the rise anywhere, it does affect us. Remember \nAfghanistan? Remember when the Russians left and the Taliban took over \nand they invited Al Qaeda and bin Laden in to be their honored guests? \nThe rest is history. The reason 3,000 Americans died on 9/11 and not 3 \nmillion is the terrorists, the radical Islamists, Al Qaeda and their \naffiliates can't get the weapons to kill 3 million of us. If they \ncould, they would.\n  So the goal is to create stability and marginalize Al Qaeda \nthroughout the region. Unfortunately, as Senator McCain has predicted \nfor a very long time, the absence of a following force allows security \nto break down and the vacuum was filled by the emergence of Al Qaeda in \nIraq.\n  I would like to go over some testimony from June of 2010, when \nGeneral Austin was about to take over from General Odierno the command \nof our operations in Iraq. General Austin told me during my questioning \nthat we were inside the 10-yard line when it came to being successful \nin Iraq. In other words, the surge had worked. The surge Senator McCain \nsupported during his Presidential campaign worked.\n  President Bush made his fair share of mistakes in Iraq, but to his \nundying credit he adjusted policies. We were all in. He gave General \nPetraeus all the troops we had to give and he stood behind General \nPetraeus, and over a 2- or 3-year period there was a phenomenal \nturnaround in the security situation in Iraq. The surge started in late \n2007, early 2008.\n  Here is what had existed in 2010 in June. Basically, we were inside \nthe 10-yard line, and General Odierno said: I think the next 18 months \nwill determine whether we get to the goal line or give the Iraqis an \nopportunity to hit the goal line beyond 2011.\n  So we were in a good spot. The surge had worked, and we needed to \nclose this thing out. I asked this question back in 2010: What would \nhappen if Iraq had become a failed state? Let's say we are inside the \n10-yard line but we are not smart enough to get in the end zone. What \nwould happen? Here is what General Odierno said:\n\n       . . . if we had a failed state in Iraq, it would create \n     uncertainty and significant instability probably within the \n     region. Because of the criticality of Iraq, its relationship \n     to Iran, its relationship to the other Arab states in the \n     region, if it became unstable, it could create an environment \n     that could continue to increase the instability.\n\n  I don't believe we are close to that. I believe we are very far away \nfrom that happening. I think we are definitely on the right path. But \nthose are the kinds of things which would happen if we had a complete \nbreakdown inside Iraq. Here was a quote:\n\n\n[[Page S199]]\n\n\n       The top U.S. commander in Iraq, Army Gen. Lloyd Austin, has \n     said repeatedly that Iraq is not yet fully capable of \n     defending its own air space or land borders, and that it \n     needs help in other areas such as intelligence and logistics.\n\n  Our military commanders were telling us that the surge had worked, \nbut we were not there yet.\n  Here is what I would like to say to the administration: If you \nbelieve Iraq was the wrong war to fight and we shouldn't be there, own \nyour decision. Don't blame the Iraqis.\n  The truth is the administration, led by President Obama, had \nabsolutely no desire to leave one person behind in Iraq because this \nwas Bush's war and America was tired, and he ran on the idea of ending \nthe war in Iraq. When it came time to make that fateful decision about \na small 10,000 or 12,000, whatever the number was, residual force to \nmaintain the gains we fought so hard and to keep Iraq stable, he now \nwants to tell the world it was the Iraqis. I know differently.\n  I know, and so does Senator McCain, that this administration made it \nimpossible for the Iraqis to say yes because this administration would \nnever give the Iraqi Government a troop number from the White House as \nto the size of the force.\n  I remember General Austin saying publicly we needed 18,000. The \nbottom line from the Pentagon was somewhere slightly north of 10,000. I \nremember the discussions in the White House got down to 3,500 and it \nwas cascading down.\n  I remember General Dempsey answering my question as to how the \nnumbers were reduced: Was it as a result of the Iraqis saying, no, that \nis too many troops to leave behind in Iraq or were the numbers reduced \nbecause the White House did not want to have that many people left \nbehind? He said the cascading down from 18,000 all the way to 3,500 had \nnothing to do with the Iraqis. It was the uncertainty and unwillingness \nof the White House to commit to a number.\n  So what happened? We left the country with 200 U.S. troops advising \nand assisting, no capability. Everything they talked about happening if \nwe do not get Iraq right and get into the end zone from the 10-yard \nline in 2010 is happening on steroids. Everything our generals told us \nabout what would await Iraq if we didn't get this right is coming true \nat an accelerated pace.\n  So I turn it back over to Senator McCain.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask the Senator again: One, Iraq and Syria now \nare in danger of becoming a base for Al Qaeda and movement back and \nforth between that area of Anbar Province, which obviously poses an \nenormous threat, because we know what the ultimate goal of Al Qaeda is.\n  Could I also recall for my friend from South Carolina the meeting we \nhad with Maliki--after we had met with Allawi, after we had met with \nBarzani, the leader of the Kurds, who all agreed we would get together \nand endorse a U.S. troop presence to remain in Iraq. This \nadministration refused--even after we came back and begged them to give \nus a number--refused to give the number, claiming it had to be endorsed \nby their Parliament, which was absolutely false.\n  But now we see Iranian aircraft overflying Iraq with weapons and arms \nfor Bashar al-Assad. We see Anbar and that area of Syria and Iraq now \nbecoming possibly a base for Al Qaeda to operate. We see the two major \ncities in Anbar, Ramadi, and Fallujah--where so much American blood was \nshed--now with vehicles driving around with the black flag of Al Qaeda \non display.\n  I think it is important we make it clear. The Senator from South \nCarolina and I are not advocating sending combat troops back to Iraq. \nThat is impossible. It may be an avenue, but it is impossible, and we \nare not advocating that. We are advocating that we give advice, send \nequipment, and we give them some capabilities. We help them with \nintelligence. There are certain places we can help them. But at the \nsame time, now Prime Minister Maliki has to reach out to the Sunnis and \nget a reconciliation.\n  From the day U.S. troops left Iraq, Maliki began to persecute the \nSunni. He even charged his own Vice President, who was a Sunni, with \ntreason and the Vice President had to leave the country.\n  So if any of this is going to work, if we have any influence--and \nhave no doubt who has the influence in Iraq today: Iran. But if we have \nany influence, we have to tell Maliki we want to help and we want to \ngive him the kind of technical assistance he needs. But he has to reach \nout to the Sunni in the way that took place in the Anbar awakening back \nin 2008. Because without national reconciliation, all the equipment and \nall the assistance we can give the Iraqis will not help.\n  So I do blame Prime Minister Maliki. Responsibility lies with his \nbehavior toward the Sunni, but we were not there to influence him. We \nwere not there. It is not only the kind of assistance we could have \nprovided them that they need, but it also is the influence issue. No \nexpert on Iraq today will tell you we have anything but a minimal \ninfluence and Iran has that. If anybody thinks Al Qaeda's control of \nlarge portions of Iraq and Syria is not a threat to the United States \nof America, then they don't understand the nature of Al Qaeda.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. As to the future of how to move forward, Prime Minister \nMaliki with all thought did go to Basra and take on the Shia militia.\n  The political gains we made in Iraq are being lost by lack of \nsecurity. If we would have had a residual force, the political momentum \ntoward reconciling Iraq would have continued. Without security, people \ngo back to their sectarian corners. I would argue that the Sunnis need \nto up their game too.\n  But the immediate problem is how do you repel Al Qaeda from Fallujah \nand Ramadi? The way it worked before is you had the Sunni awakening, \nwhere the Sunni tribal leaders in Anbar had a taste of the Al Qaeda \nagenda and said: No, thank you. They were literally killing children in \nfront of their parents for smoking. The stories coming out of Anbar \nProvince about the abuse the people of Anbar suffered under Al Qaeda \ncontrol would break your heart. So the Sunni leaders married with \nAmerican military personnel to drive the Al Qaeda elements out of \nAnbar.\n  We are not there now. So how do you get Al Qaeda dislodged from Anbar \nProvince, Ramadi and Fallujah? You are going to have to get the Sunni \ntribal leaders to work with the Iraqi Army.\n  I think now is a good time to send a former military commander of the \nU.S. forces--someone who is retired if that is what is required--to see \nif they can bring these parties together to form a military alliance \nbetween the Sunni tribal leaders and the Iraqi Army so the weight of \nthe Iraqi Army can be brought into this fight. The distrust is high. \nBut the way Al Qaeda was defeated in the past was the U.S. military \nworking with the Sunni tribal leaders. We are not there.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would argue, I say to the Senator from South Carolina, \ntwo names which spring to mind would be General Petraeus and Ambassador \nCrocker, probably the two most respected people in Iraq today. Maybe we \nare getting into too much detail, but I do agree with him on that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The bottom line is we have to change the momentum. We are \nnot there. But Senator Menendez, to his great credit, is willing to \nrelease his hold on the sale of Apache helicopters to allow the Iraqi \nmilitary an advantage over Al Qaeda. I think Senator Menendez did the \nright thing.\n  So supplying arms in a smart way is part of the strategy to move \nforward. But we have to get the military in Iraq working with the Sunni \ntribal leaders.\n  I would ask Senator McCain this question: On the other side of the \nborder in Syria is complete chaos, is hell on Earth. I don't know how \nwe stabilize Iraq long term until we deal with the dismantling of Syria \nwhere Al Qaeda occupies the region right across the Iraqi border. How \ndoes a breakdown in Syria affect Iraq?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I don't think there is any doubt, I would say to my \nfriend from South Carolina, that this has become an almost safe \noperating area on both sides of the Syria-Iraq border for Al Qaeda.\n  It is interesting. There has been a little good news in the last day \nor two; that is, some of the more moderate forces in Syria have struck \nback at this radical Islamist group because of the incredible cruelty \nof al-Nusra and ISIS, which is the radical Islamic group both in Iraq \nand Syria. Interestingly enough, that is being accomplished without any \nU.S. help. Thank\n\n[[Page S200]]\n\nGod for the other countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and others \nwhich have been of assistance to these people. They have been driving \nout some of the more extremist element. We are working with the \nRussians to remove the chemical weapons.\n  In Syria today, Bashar al-Assad, from helicopters, is dropping these \ncrude cluster bombs which are just shrapnel that kill anybody within \nlethal range. Since dropping it on populated areas, Bashar al-Assad has \nslaughtered innocent men, women, and children.\n  So here we are working with the Russians. Today there was a U.N. \nresolution from the Security Council condemning Bashar al-Assad's \nbarbaric behavior. Guess who vetoed that. Our friends, the Russians. \nThis is the most Orwellian situation in Iraq anybody has ever seen \nthroughout history. Russians are working with us to remove chemical \nweapons from Syria and at the same time aircraft from Russia are \nlanding full of weapons to kill Syrian men, women, and children. I am \nnot sure a Syrian mother can differentiate between her child dying from \na chemical weapon or dying from one of these cluster bombs that Bashar \nal-Assad is unloading from his helicopters.\n  So we have this grandiose idea the Secretary of State and the \nadministration have been pushing for months and months to have a Geneva \nII. The first Geneva failed. Does anyone on God's green Earth believe \nthat Bashar al-Assad, who is winning, is going to preside over his own \ntransition from power? Of course not.\n  I will never forget--I am sure the Senator from South Carolina will \nnever forget--the testimony of our now still Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff and then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta before the \nArmed Services Committee: Bashar al-Assad inevitably will leave.\n  The President of the United States: Bashar al-Assad, it is not a \nmatter of when, it is not a matter of whether he will leave but a \nmatter of when.\n  Meanwhile, the weapons pour in from Iran; Hezbollah, 5,000 of them; \n130,000 people slaughtered, and one-quarter of the population being \nslaughtered, while this administration not only sits by and does \nnothing but the President of the United States says nothing.\n  This will go down as one of the most shameful chapters in American \nhistory. If the policy of this administration is to only focus on \ncounterterrorism, get out of the Middle East, and remove any \ninvolvement of the United States in the Middle East, I can assure my \ncolleagues the Middle East will not allow the United States of America \nto not be involved.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I may just conclude. I have a quote from Speaker \nBoehner, who said he would support the Obama administration if it \ndecides to leave troops in Iraq beyond 2011.\n  I remember Senator Obama and Senator Clinton not being particularly \nhelpful to the mistakes made in Iraq during the Bush administration. In \nfact, the entire election in 2008 and the primary was about Iraq. I \nremember the politics of Candidate Barack Obama, who basically used the \nIraq war to win the nomination, for lack of a better word. I remember \nduring the campaign he talked about Afghanistan being a good war. We \nwill talk about Afghanistan later. It is not a happy story either, I am \nafraid.\n\n  But the bottom line is that there was bipartisan support for troop \npresence beyond 2011, a residual force. This administration chose to \nignore the advice of the commanders, and they created the situation \nwhere the Iraqis could not say yes. Yet they want history to record \nthis being a problem created by the Iraqis for not giving legal \nimmunity to U.S. soldiers. History is going to be written about our \ntimes. How this ends, nobody knows. But I know this: It is not fair to \nsay that the reason we have nobody left behind in Iraq is because of \nthe Iraqis. It is fair to say that the administration got the result \nthey wanted, and they should own that--good, bad, or indifferent. Don't \ncreate a straw person for the situation that you drove and you created.\n  As to Syria, please understand that this whole conflict started when \npeople went to the streets peacefully to ask for more political freedom \nafter the uprising in Egypt; that this war in Syria did not start with \na Sunni uprising or Al Qaeda invading the country. The conflict in \nSyria started when the people of Syria, from all walks of life, started \ndemanding more from their government, from this dictatorship, and the \nresponse they received from their government was to use lethal force.\n  It has broken down now to a regional conflict where the Iranians are \nbacking Assad and you have Sunni Arab States backing parts of the \nopposition and you have Al Qaeda types coming from Iraq and other \nplaces filling in the vacuum created by this breakdown in Syria.\n  At the end of the day, what Senator McCain had been talking about for \n3 years is that once you say Assad has to go--no President should say \nthat unless they are willing to make it happen. Assad was on the ropes. \nWith just any effort on our part, a no-fly zone to boots on the ground, \nany assistance at all in the last couple of years and Assad would be \ngone, the transition would be well underway. It would have been bloody \nat first, but we would have behind us now a Syria moving toward \nstability because the good news is the average Syrian is not a radical \nAl Qaeda Islamist. Syrians have been living peacefully with each \nother--Christians, Sunnis, and Alawites--for hundreds of years. Now \nSyria has become the central battle for every radical Islamist in the \nregion, and it is just sad and sorry to witness.\n  But what does it mean to us? It means that if this war continues--our \nfriend the King of Jordan is under siege. The Lebanese Ambassador \ntestified a couple of weeks ago in our committee that the country is \nsaturated. Almost 1 million refugees from Syria have gone to Lebanon. \nThere are over 5 million in Lebanon today. They have added almost 1 \nmillion refugees from Syria. They didn't plan to get to 5 million \npeople until 2050. The Kingdom of Jordan--the Jordanians have received \nover 600,000 refugees, with no end in sight.\n  Syria is not a civil war. Syria is a regional conflict where you have \nproxies backing each side in Syria that are taking the entire region \ninto chaos. It is killing Iraq. It is destabilizing Lebanon and Jordan. \nIt has to be addressed in an effective way.\n  If you want to be President of the United States, certain \nrequirements come with the job: having a vision, making tough calls at \nthe time when it would matter. On President Obama's watch, you had the \nArab spring come about and you had a desire by this administration to \nleave the region at any and all costs. Now you have absolute chaos. The \nonly way we are going to fix this is for America to get reengaged. We \ndo not need boots on the ground, but we need leadership.\n  It just breaks my heart to see how close we were in 2010. The surge \ndid work in spite of opposition from President Obama as Senator and \nSecretary Clinton as Senator. In spite of their vehement opposition, \nthe surge did work, and on their watch we are about to lose everything \nwe fought for. Al Qaeda is the biggest beneficiary of our withdrawal \nfrom Iraq. Al Qaeda is the biggest beneficiary of our indifference in \nSyria. Al Qaeda is thriving, and our allies and our friends are in \nretreat.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Madam President, many of us have come back from a \ncouple of wonderful weeks in our home States, traveling and visiting \nwith families, and had the privilege of spending time with loved ones \nand sharing our hopes and plans for the new year. Not everyone was so \nfortunate.\n  I rise today to honor the memory of yet another tragic victim of gun \nviolence in Connecticut and our country.\n  On December 28, in New Haven, shortly before the beginning of this \nnew year, one family's time together with their son was cut short when \nJavier Martinez was shot and killed.\n  I have his picture here in the Chamber. His memory is with us today, \nas I ask this body to honor him, along with other victims of gun \nviolence who have died since Newtown, and those who have died before \nNewtown, and now I ask them to be remembered not only in words but also \nin action by this body, so that Javier shall not have died in vain.\n  He was only 18 years old. He was a senior at Common Ground High \nSchool in New Haven, one of the really extraordinary educational \ninstitutions in our State.\n  His teachers and classmates describe him as a kind, intelligent young \nman who was becoming a leader in the school and in his community.\n  He had a bright future. In fact, he had the whole world, his whole \nlife ahead of him.\n  At Common Ground, a charter school that focuses on sustainability and \nconnecting students with natural resources in their own communities, he \nwas absolutely thriving.\n  I have heard that some of his classmates and teachers at Common \nGround are perhaps watching right now or will watch at some point, and \nI want to thank them for joining in honoring his memory and continuing \nhis work to make our planet, our world, our Nation, and the community \nof New Haven better, and keeping faith with his memory.\n  Javier cared about his community and the environment and the issues \nof sustainability and clean air and clean water, and he took action to \nimprove the world around him.\n  Last summer he participated in a highly competitive internship at the \nNature Conservancy, where he worked to protect endangered species. A \ndirector of this program regarded Javier as one of the most outstanding \nparticipants that the program ever had.\n  He spent last spring planting trees--planting trees--with the New \nHaven Urban Resources Initiative. He planted trees that he will never \nsit under, but the world will be better for all that he did--one small \nact, one small part of what Javier did to make New Haven and the world \nbetter.\n  This past fall he joined a crew of West River Stewards, identifying \nand documenting sources of pollution along the West River in the New \nHaven area.\n  Not only did he have a bright future ahead of him, but he knew what \nhe wanted. He was pursuing the American dream. He was seeking and \nworking to make America a better place for him and for his fellow \nstudents at Common Ground.\n  By all accounts he was not only dedicated and hard working, but he \nhad a good heart. He had a great sense of himself. He stayed out of \ntrouble. He had no criminal record whatsoever, it goes without saying. \nHe worked hard at his studies.\n  He was loved in New Haven by his classmates, by his teachers, and by \nall who knew him. He had a growing dedication to protecting that world. \nUnfortunately, our society failed to protect him, failed to protect him \nduring the simple act of walking home, failed to protect him from gun \nviolence, failed to protect him in a neighborhood where he thought he \nwould be safe as he walked.\n  On that early morning of December 28, shortly before 1 a.m., he was \nfound shot to death on the streets of New Haven. In fact, he was \nwalking from his house to a friend's house. He did not have a car, so \nhis only choice was to walk. He sustained multiple gunshot wounds and \nwas pronounced dead at the scene.\n  The police are continuing to investigate. Have no doubt that they are \nworking hard. The New Haven Police have been extraordinarily responsive \nand responsible in combating gun violence, so I know they are going to \nget answers. Whether they will ever get enough answers to prosecute \nsomeone remains to be seen. But I know they are dedicated to finding \nout what happened on that night.\n  The death of Javier Martinez is a tragedy, heartbreaking. It is \nheartbreaking, as are many of the random deaths in America resulting \nfrom gun violence. This young man is a testament to our continuing \nresponsibility, our obligation, and our opportunity to combat and \nprevent gun violence on the streets and in the neighborhoods across our \ncountry.\n  Just a few weeks ago I spoke on this floor, in this very place, about \nanother promising young person from Connecticut who was killed by a \nperson with a gun whose name was Erika Robinson. The victim of that \ncrime, Erika Robinson, just like Javier, was killed because she was at \nthe wrong place at the wrong time.\n  We ought to remember some of the other victims. We should keep in \nmind all of the now tens of thousands, just since Newtown, who maybe \nsurvived but who are changed and challenged in ways they never could \nhave envisioned. Their lives have been changed forever.\n  Amber Smith, who worked as a manager in a New Haven Burger King \nrestaurant, was shot on September 15, 2013, when two robbers entered \nthat Burger King.\n  The robbers demanded that she open a safe in the business, and one of \nthem shot her in the upper hip and through her leg. She was just 19 \nyears old at the time on September 15, 2013.\n  She remembers thinking that she was going to die and wondering who \nwould take care of her two small children. She almost bled to death but \nwas saved, fortunately, by receiving surgery in the emergency room. So \nshe survived the shooting, but she lives with the psychological and the \nphysical trauma of that shooting every day.\n  These random acts of violence may not always make the national news, \nthey may not always take a life, but they change lives, and they take \nlives one or two at a time.\n  Those shooting deaths of Javier Martinez and Erika Robinson have \nbecome all too often the mundane evil of our time. The banality of evil \nis found in gun violence, and we seem to accept it all too often with \nindifference as another news item. Yet it should be as repugnant and \nabhorrent and unacceptable as the deaths of 20 innocent children in \nNewtown and 6 great educators because every act of gun violence \ndiminishes us as a nation and as a community.\n  Our country has come to the point that gun violence can happen \nanywhere. If your life has not been touched by it, there is a near \ncertainty that it will be at some point--tragically, unfortunately--\nbecause far too often communities suffer in silence. We need to end \nthat silence. We need to end the inaction and the acceptance of this \nmundane and banal evil that lives among us.\n  While we have failed to act in this Chamber, even though we had a \nmajority of 55 Senators ready to approve very simple, commonsense \nmeasures to stop gun violence, the President has done what he can \nthrough executive action, most recently on mental health. I commend him \nfor those actions. He has done what he can to strengthen Federal \nbackground checks for firearms purchases. I thank him for that action.\n  These changes are incremental, but they are steps in the right \ndirection.\n  States have taken the leadership on this issue as well, maybe even \nmore so than the Federal Government. My own\n\n[[Page S202]]\n\nState of Connecticut, laudably, has passed laws to effectively ban, for \nexample, the sale of assault weapons.\n  But this body and this government need to act. The Federal Government \nhas a responsibility that only it can address, because we know that \nguns are trafficked across State lines. Stolen and illegally bought \nguns are trafficked across State lines. No single State can put a stop \nto it.\n  We know that without action in this body, mental health will remain \nan unmet need in this country. We know that without action in this \ncountry, background checks for people who buy firearms will be \nincomplete and inadequate.\n  So Javier's death should be a reminder and a call to action. As the \npeople of his family and New Haven mourn his death, we should celebrate \nhis contributions in making our planet better, in protecting the \nprecious resources that, unfortunately, he was unable to enjoy, and \nresolve to protect better the innocent people, particularly our \nchildren, who at any moment, at any place, may become victims of gun \nviolence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/09/senate-section/article/S202-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S202-S203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, we have been discussing, the last couple \nof days, the unemployment insurance issue. A number of us have had \nconcerns relative to the effectiveness of the program relative to the \ncost that would undertake and how it would be paid for if it goes \nforward and is extended and the reforms we think would be needed to \nmake this a much more effective program. We have not been offered the \nopportunity to do more than just discuss it on the floor. We have not \nbeen offered the opportunity to offer amendments, offer our ideas, have \nthem debated and voted on. It is my understanding that the majority \nleader will be coming to the floor shortly to potentially--well, to \ntell us what the decision is relative to whether we will have that \nopportunity.\n  Let me very quickly say I have been working with my colleagues \nSenator Ayotte from New Hampshire and Senator Portman from Ohio. All \nthree of us voted for the motion to proceed because we felt this is an \nissue that ought to be discussed and debated, and not simply dismissed, \nand because we would like to make corrections to the program that make \nit more viable.\n  We would like to raise the issue of, is there a better way to deal \nwith unemployment in this country? We have some amendments that would \nallow us to move and improve and move to what we think is a better way, \nas well as pay for a bill that, without being paid for, exceeds the \nbudget agreement we just entered into.\n  I offered four amendments. I was not insisting on offering all four. \nThey were similar to what my colleagues had offered. The three of us \nwant to very briefly speak to these and indicate to our colleagues what \nit is we would be doing. I offered the original bill way last fall, \nwhich would delay the individual mandate under the Affordable Care Act.\n  As we all know, the President has delayed for 1 year the mandates on \nemployers who provide health insurance for their employees, but did not \nso do so for individuals, for those who do not have coverage under \ntheir employer. We did not feel that was fair. Why one entity and not \nthe other? It also violated the law that the President took the liberty \nto exercise.\n  We are saying: Well, let's at least be fair, that those who are not \ncovered by the 1-year delay on the mandate of employers would be \nsubject to having to comply and we have--I will not go through all of \nthe details, but we have seen the disaster that has happened in terms \nof that rollout.\n  My amendment, No. 2611 to this bill, I am going to select out as the \namendment I am going forward with. My colleagues also have excellent \nideas. They will be offering those. Frankly, I agree with all of their \namendments and what they are doing also, so I think we are pretty much \non the same page.\n  This amendment would delay the individual employer mandate under \nObamaCare for 1 year. The estimated cost savings on this is $35 \nbillion. I think that is a savings that obviously could be used for a \nnumber of offsets. I think at this particular point in time, I would \nyield the floor and let my colleague from New Hampshire explain her \namendment and how the savings would be applied to some very necessary \nthings.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Indiana. As he \nsaid, I, as did my colleague from Indiana and my colleague from Ohio, \nmoved to allow this bill to go forward for debate. I thought it was \nimportant that we have a debate on obviously the situation of \nstruggling workers in our country and on the issue of whether to extend \nunemployment benefits for them.\n  I have been clear that on the pending bill if there is a way we can \nresponsibly pay for this temporary 3-month extension to do that, I \nwould be willing to support that--except the current bill does not have \na way to pay for it--because I do not believe we should be adding to \nour debt, $17 trillion, and our yearly deficits in order to do this.\n  But let me say that I have a very commonsense amendment. It is \namendment No. 2603. Let me say what it is about. My amendment fixes \nwhat is an abuse in our Tax Code. The Treasury inspector general found \nthat individuals who are not authorized to work in this country are \ncollecting billions of dollars in tax refunds by filing for an \nadditional child tax credit. The disturbing part about this trend is \nthat there has been a steady increase each year of billions of dollars \ncollected by illegal workers seeking these refunds.\n  Investigations of these tax refunds have found some gross examples of \nfraud; examples of refunds for children, children who do not live in \nthe United States of America; examples of fraud of many children who \nmay not even exist. For example, in Indiana, they found four \nunauthorized workers claiming over 20 children who lived in a \nresidence, fraudulently collecting tens of thousands of taxpayer \ndollars. They found examples of tax refund claims for children who live \nin Mexico, not the United States of America. In North Carolina, 1,000 \ntax returns were linked to 8 addresses--1,000 tax returns were linked \nto 8 addresses, refunding $5 million in tax refunds. Another example in \nNorth Carolina: 398 returns associated with 2 apartments--398 returns, \nrefunding $1.9 million to workers who are not authorized to work in our \ncountry. There was no evidence that the children being claimed either \nlived in the United States of America or even existed, for that matter.\n  My amendment is very straightforward in terms of the fix. The filer \nof the tax return who is going to claim the additional child tax credit \nwould have to list a Social Security number. This is the same \nrequirement for those who claim the earned income tax credit for which \nyou can receive a tax refund if you qualify. So it would be simply to \nadd that same requirement.\n  What the Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated is that we could \nsave $20 billion over the next 10 years simply by treating this child \ntax credit just like the earned filers income tax credit, that filers \nwould have to use a Social Security number as well.\n  What would this $20 billion go for? With this $20 billion, we can pay \nfor the recent cuts in the budget that were unfair, where our men and \nwomen in uniform, military retirees, were singled out for cuts to their \nretirement, to their cost-of-living increases, including, by the way, \nour wounded warriors, those who have medically retired, who got a cut \nto their cost-of-living increase in this recent budget. This was the \nonly group that was singled out in\n\n[[Page S203]]\n\nthis way, those who have taken a bullet for our country, many who have \ndone multiple tours for us in Afghanistan and Iraq, and some who have \nsuffered horrible wounds, including those many of us have had the \nprivilege of visiting at Walter Reed. So we can pay for and fix the \nmilitary retirement cuts, as many Members on both sides of the aisle \nhave said we have a commitment to do, because we think that was unfair.\n  What else can we do with this? We can also pay for the bill pending \non the floor, the 3 months extension of unemployment benefits for \nAmerican workers who are struggling during this period, who are trying \nto get back to work.\n  Finally, we can also take the remainder of the savings and apply it \nto the deficit. Again, fix tax abuse, where there has been fraud, \nrampant fraud found by investigations by requiring a Social Security \nnumber, such as the earned-income tax credit, and in return it is a \nthree-for.\n  We can pay for the 3-month unemployment extension on this floor, we \ncan fix the unfair cut to military retirees and to our wounded \nwarriors, and we can help reduce our deficit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren).

Under the previous order, all postcloture time \nwith respect to the motion to proceed to S. 1845 is considered expired.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1845) to provide for the extension of certain \n     unemployment benefits, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. This is similar to ``Groundhog Day'' because this is a \npicture we have already seen in the very lucid speech given by my \nfriend from New Hampshire.\n  She should have gone back through the Congressional Record. We have \nbeen through this before.\n  We are not going to hurt American children, and that is what it does. \nWe have been through this. This is something we have tried to use in \nthe past to pay for things that are very unfair to American children.\n  The other issue is there have been some efforts made, and good-faith \nefforts made by the Senator from Ohio, to stop double dipping--people \nwho are on disability and are drawing unemployment insurance. We agree \nwith him. We can take care of that, but it does not save $5.4 or $5.6 \nbillion.\n  The disability community at this point is outraged that anyone will \neven suggest this. We can stop the double dipping. We are happy to join \nwith them in doing that, but that savings is a little over $1 billion. \nWe are pleased, and that is part of the proposal we will all have in a \nlittle bit.\n  I received a phone call from a person who has done more for helping \npeople who are disabled than any person in the history of this body, \nthe senior Senator from the State of Iowa. He had been previously \nengaged and he heard about this. Those of us who know Tom Harkin know \nwhat he does to protect the disabled. I know my friend from Ohio has \ngood intentions, but the disability community will never allow this to \nhappen, and they are right.\n  My friend, the junior Senator from Nevada, as some of us know, has \nhad casts on one leg and now the other leg. He has had some surgery on \nhis ankles. He has had to replace the Achilles tendons in both of his \nlegs. A cast broke, I think it was on his left leg--maybe it was his \nright leg. I don't remember.\n  I talked to him this morning and he had to go to the emergency room \nto get his cast replaced. I am waiting to hear from him. I have \nexplained this proposal in some detail to him and his staff, but he \nhasn't had an opportunity to speak to his staff since he had to rush to \nthe emergency room--at least that is my understanding--so I am waiting \nuntil he gets back.\n  The proposal Senator Reed has come up with extends unemployment \ninsurance through mid-November. The package does what the Republicans \nwanted. It is entirely paid for. There are structural changes which \nthey have been demanding, and we have done that. It has reforms that \nreduce slightly the number of weeks an unemployed person can remain on \nthe unemployment insurance, while all along preserving extending the \nweeks of high-unemployment States.\n  The legislation proposed by Senator Jack Reed tightens the rules for \nunemployment insurance. It would include a proposal, much like that \nadvocated by the Senator from Ohio Mr. Portman, that would prevent \npeople from collecting both unemployment insurance and disability \ninsurance at the same time. That is clear.\n  Much of this offset is simply an extension of the Murray-Ryan \nagreement we all voted for--or a lot of us voted for earlier. This \nprovision would extend the sequester on mandatory programs for another \nyear. If Republicans have a complaint about this, don't call and \ncomplain to Jack Reed. Call Paul Ryan. This is his. This is his idea--\nmaybe not on this specific issue, but this is his proposal, his idea.\n  We believe if it is good enough to help other proposals propounded by \nmy Republican friends in the House, it is good enough to help the \nunemployed.\n  In this proposal, there has been a desire to address the concerns of \nthe Republicans and Democrats. Is it perfect? Of course not, but Jack \nReed has done a remarkably good job, and we believe this is a sound and \nbalanced proposal.\n  I would also say this takes care of it for the good part of this \nyear. I wish we could have done it until the first of the year. We \ncan't find enough money. I have been waiting here for more than 24 \nhours for a reasonable proposal by my Republican friends to pay for \nthis. We don't have one yet.\n  We are not going to strip the rights of people who have health \ninsurance, and we are certainly not going to go after little boys and \ngirls in America who have the child tax credit. There comes a time when \nwe have to move forward.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection has been heard.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Is there objection?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, objection was heard.\n  The clerk will continue to call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I first of all appreciate everyone's \ncooperation here--patience more than cooperation. We are doing our \nbest. I have already said what we are trying to do here, and I will \nrepeat just a part of it.\n  We have a proposal that is paid for. It is a pay-for that we have \nused and it is something I think is totally valid. The original idea \ncame from Paul Ryan, but we have used it on another occasion. This has \nnothing to change that original proposal except to extend it for 1 \nyear. The proposal of my friend from Ohio--an issue he has alerted us \nto--we think we have taken care of in this amendment. I think it is a \nfine proposal, but the breadth of what he is trying to do is really \nunfair and we can't do that. So we are doing our utmost.\n  We have structural changes in this. It is paid for--a pay-for for \nalmost to\n\n[[Page S204]]\n\nthe first of the year, as much money as we are able to find. But we \nhave done everything the Republicans have wanted: It is paid for, there \nare structural changes, and we have taken care of the double dipping of \nthose in the disability community on unemployment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2631\n\n  Mr. REID.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I tried to be recognized before the majority leader \ndecided to fill the tree, which means taking away the opportunity for \namendments to be offered--although there will be an attempt in a moment \nto offer some. I am disappointed in that, because I think we were very \nclose to reaching an agreement which would have enabled us to move \nforward with allowing Senators on both sides of the aisle to offer some \nof their ideas on the unemployment insurance extension.\n  Recall. This is an important debate we are having for the American \npeople. It is about whether we go beyond the roughly 26 weeks in \nunemployment insurance to having an emergency extension again. On this \nside of the aisle, there were a few of us who, in fact, crossed over to \nvote with the entire Democratic majority to say let's have that debate. \nWe thought we were doing so in good faith in that there would actually \nbe a debate on two issues. One is whether it should be paid for and how \nit should be paid for, which I will address in a second, but second is \nhow we should reform the unemployment insurance program and do other \nappropriate policies to get at the underlying problem, which is a \nrecord level, a record number of Americans who are long-term \nunemployed.\n  Clearly what we are doing isn't working, and we believe this is an \nopportunity for us to help improve the program to actually address the \nreal problem. The President of the United States wants us to do that. \nHe called me on Monday and told me he had hoped we would be able to \naddress this issue by voting for the motion to proceed to begin the \ndebate so that over the next few months, while we had a short-term \nextension of this program, there could be even more detailed \ndiscussions about how to improve the legislation and how to add other \nelements to it--specifically, on how to give people who are long-term \nunemployed the skills they need to access the jobs that are available. \nUnfortunately, we are not going to have that opportunity now, it \nappears, to have the debate over how to pay for it, what the pay-fors \nought to be, and, again, how to improve the program.\n  But let me say this is unfortunate, because we had 60 votes to \nproceed. That includes certainly three of us who are here on the floor \ntoday, and all three of us are willing to move forward with this with a \nreasonable provision to pay for this over the 3 months, and again, \nduring that period to come up with a better and improved unemployment \ninsurance program. We were not\n\n[[Page S205]]\n\npart of the discussion as to the pay-for that the majority leader has \njust put forward.\n  I appreciate his good faith in wanting to include one of the \nproposals I had in my amendment. I honestly do appreciate that. I will \nsay the offset he has put in, which I have just learned about because I \ndidn't have an opportunity to see until now, has an important \ndifference--a difference between what was just offered in the new \nDemocratic proposal and what is in my proposal. My proposal, which I \nhave come to the floor to talk about three times now, has been \npreviously proposed by the House. It says that if you get unemployment \ninsurance or you get trade adjustment assistance, then you also do not \nreceive Social Security disability insurance in that same month.\n  Why? Because these programs are mutually exclusive. If you are on \nSocial Security disability--SSDI--that means you are not working, by \ndefinition. If you are working and lose your job, you are then \ncontinuing to look for work and you get TAA. If you have lost your job \nand you are continuing to look for work, which is required, you get \nunemployment insurance.\n  This is why this same general program is laid out in the President's \nbudget, and in fact it is something I believe the administration \nsupports in others.\n  The proposal the Democrats included says that if you receive \nunemployment insurance in the month you receive Social Security, then \nyour SSDI is reduced by the amount of unemployment insurance received.\n  Why does that matter? It is not the same. And it matters because the \nproposal the majority leader has proposed it saves a lot less money. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, my proposal would save \nabout $5.4 billion; theirs, as I understand it from the distinguished \nmajority leader today, will save about $1 billion.\n  So again, I appreciate his wanting to include it, and I think it is \nin the same spirit as the amendment I offered, but honestly we haven't \nhad the chance to talk about this. I tried today to sit down with the \nDemocratic sponsor of the underlying legislation, the other Senator \nReed, who in good faith said he wanted to talk about it, but we haven't \nbeen able to schedule that. So we have not had the discussion. So we \nare just learning today what is again the sort of take-it-or-leave-it \nproposal that is in the majority leader's proposal in filling the tree.\n  There is a possibility, I think procedurally--and the majority has \nexpressed some interest in looking at this--in taking that agreement \nand altering it somewhat over the next couple of days, because the \ncloture would not ripen, as I understand it, until Monday afternoon, \nbut that still doesn't give all of our other colleagues a chance to \noffer their good ideas, and there are a bunch of them out there.\n\n  The Senator from New Hampshire offered hers day before yesterday, and \nshe talked about it today on the floor, where she wants to take away \nsome of the existing missed payments that are in the child tax credit. \nI would think all of us would want to do that--to preserve child tax \ncredits for those who are truly eligible. For those who are not \neligible, obviously, they shouldn't have access to it. It seems like a \nsensible amendment to me. I am a cosponsor of that amendment.\n  Senator Coats raised his ideas today, and I think he has some good \nideas that ought to be debated.\n  So my hope is we would be able to go back to where we were prior to \nfilling the tree and to say let's have a discussion. It can be limited. \nI think there are a very limited number of amendments.\n  I see the distinguished Republican whip on the floor, and he \nindicated to me today there are something under 20 amendments offered \nby the Republican side. I don't know how many of those have actually \nbeen filed, but it seems to me we could have had a good debate on that \nand still should.\n  So my hope is that we can come up with a solution here. I do think it \nis going to require us providing some opportunity for other people to \nbe engaged, and specifically those who want to get to a solution, which \nis a lot of people on this side of the aisle and that side of the \naisle--both sides of the aisle. Let's sit down and talk. We are adults. \nWe have been elected by millions of people to represent them, and it is \nour responsibility, indeed our commitment to them, we would sit down \nacross the aisle and work these things out, as you would in any other \nrelationship--in your marriage, in your business, with your neighbors.\n  We had some discussion about this yesterday, that for some reason in \nthe Senate it seems we are unable to have even the most basic level of \ndiscussion and debate. So I am open to that. I had hoped to do it \ntoday. I put my ideas out there; parts of them have been accepted, and \nI appreciate that, but, frankly, not the way we had laid it out in my \nown amendment. I do believe, if we have the opportunity, if we were to \nback up and to actually solve this problem, meaning to provide what the \nPresident says he wants, which is a 3-month extension of long-term \nunemployment, we can sit down, roll up our sleeves as Republicans and \nDemocrats, and come up with a better way to address what is a crisis in \nthis country, which is more long-term unemployed people than ever in \nthe history of our country.\n  Those people are hurting, and clearly the current system isn't \nworking. So to just extend it is not the answer. The answer is to allow \nthe Senate to do its job; that is, to reform these programs so they \nwork for the people we represent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. It is the same time and time again. Things are never quite \nright. They want to offer amendments. We have been waiting here since \nMonday for pay-fors. The only pay-for we have heard realistically to \ntake care of this is something everyone knows we disagree with--to take \naway health care benefits from the American people.\n  The proposal by my friend from Ohio is not a good proposal. It hurts \npeople who are disabled, and that is the fact. We have stopped dual \npayments. That is what our amendment does.\n  This is something we have been going through--the American people \nhave been going through now for years.\n  My friend worked with the senior Senator from New Hampshire on energy \nefficiency. Now, if that wasn't quite a show. I had conversations on \nnumerous occasions: Yeah, we have it all taken care of. Republicans are \ntrying to move forward on this.\n  It went on for weeks and weeks. We never got anything done.\n  So we are where we are. Democrats don't need a memo to tell them to \nhave a good conscience about people who are disabled, to be \ncompassionate about people who are unemployed. We don't need a memo. We \nknow that people who are long-term unemployed are desperate for help. \nWe are compassionate. We don't need a memo to tell us that.\n  The American people want to know where we stand. Are we going to \nextend unemployment benefits for people who have been out of work for a \nlong time? That is the issue before this body. And we have bent over \nbackward, through Jack Reed, to come up with a proposal to pay for \nthis, to get rid of this issue for this year. We have structural \nchanges in this amendment. We have a pay-for which came from Paul Ryan, \nthe Republican Vice Presidential candidate this last election cycle. He \nis chairman of the Budget Committee. So I think we have done a yeoman's \njob through Jack Reed, we need to move on, and that is what we are \ngoing to do.\n  If there is a proposal my friend has--and we know his expertise, but \nthe problem with his expertise is it is never quite right. It is almost \nbut not quite right.\n  So the time is now to fish or cut bait. And they can make all the \nmotions they want to try to complain about ``We didn't offer enough \namendments. We need to be more like the Senate used to be.'' Well, I \nknow what the Senate used to be because I was a used-to-be Senator, and \nit doesn't work the way it used to not because of anything we do wrong \nbut because of the obstruction of President Obama's agenda. Every day \nit is more obstruction.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask the distinguished majority leader \nwhether it is the position of his caucus and his position personally \nthat people ought to be able to collect unemployment compensation and \ndisability benefits simultaneously?\n\n[[Page S206]]\n\n  Mr. REID. No. And that is why Jack Reed's proposal stops it.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would further ask the majority leader, it is my \nunderstanding that the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Ohio \nwould discontinue the simultaneous collection of disability and \nunemployment benefits. But the majority leader objects to that \namendment and instead is blocking that amendment and other amendments \nby the Republican side of the aisle by one which changes the effective \ndate of the bill 1 day. In other words, it is purely a blocker \namendment, has zero substance whatsoever, and does nothing to improve \nthe underlying bill.\n  Mr. REID. Is there a question in all of this?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Isn't that right?\n  Mr. REID. Is what right?\n  Mr. CORNYN. What I just said.\n  Mr. REID. No, it is not right, because what the amendment of the \nSenator from Ohio does is hurt people who are disabled. Part of Jack \nReed's amendment stops people from drawing both benefits at the same \ntime.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would ask the distinguished majority leader one more \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Is the majority leader aware there are 24 Republican \namendments on file, almost all of which deal with the underlying bill \nin an attempt to either improve workforce education and training, \nprovide other reforms to the unemployment compensation system, or \notherwise help the economy recover so that people won't have to depend \non unemployment insurance and they can get a job? Is the majority \nleader aware that there are those amendments and those ideas on this \nside of the aisle?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I don't know the exact number, but there are always a lot \nof proposed amendments around. What I would say is this: Rather than \ncontinually denigrating our economy, our President, and, frankly, I \nbelieve, our country, I think we should have some more constructive \nthings around here.\n  For example, we had today a conversation for 1\\1/2\\ hours with \nChairman Bernanke. He is going to be there until the first of next \nmonth. It was a very good discussion. He talked about the vibrancy of \nthis economy now. He said, as we have been saying here, it is not as \ngood as it should be, but with a little bit of help, it would be on \nfire. Now, why isn't it on fire? Because of the obstruction over here.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, the new Fed chair, Chairman Yellen, \nhas also said unemployment benefits are a great impetus in helping the \neconomy. For every $1 put into the economy in unemployment benefits, we \nget $1.50 back.\n  This bill recognizes that these benefits don't go on forever. That is \nwhy we make structural changes. We would be happy anytime to sit down \nand have a good discussion with the senior Senator from Texas and \nanyone else to talk about things we can do.\n  We have had a lot of programs that deal with job retraining. In 1998 \nwhen we did that, it wasn't a bad deal. Here it is all these many years \nlater, and of course we need to sit down and talk about ways to improve \nretraining. This whole country needs that. That is also something \nChairman Bernanke said today.\n  So I repeat, let's start being constructive around here, and instead \nof talking about how terrible things are, let's talk about how things \nare improving. We have had 8 million new jobs since Obama has been \nPresident. We have a lot of good things that have happened. Has it been \nperfect? Not even close to perfect.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is it the majority leader's intent to allow votes on \nany Republican amendments?\n  Mr. REID. On what?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. On the bill we were just discussing.\n  Mr. REID. This is Thursday. We have been waiting since Monday to get \na proposal from the minority, the Republicans, as to what they believe \nwould be a good way to pay for this.\n  Nothing, other than whack ObamaCare. So the answer is that we are \nwhere we are now. We have tried a number of different ways on many \ndifferent pieces of legislation to say, OK, let's just do germane \namendments. No. How about relevant amendments? No. How about having a \nspecific number of amendments and giving the minority more than the \nmajority? No, can't do that either. We want unlimited amendments on \neverything. As a result of that, we have continued obstruction which \nhas taken place in this body for 5 years. It is time we get back to \nlegislating the way we used to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is the answer to my question, I would say to the \nmajority leader, no?\n  Mr. REID. The answer to the Senator's question is no.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I wish to make two corrections quickly \nand then yield to my colleague from Indiana.\n  One is that the proposal I did offer had nothing to do with \nObamaCare, as I thought the majority leader understood, and others do \nnot, including the amendment from the Senator from New Hampshire. So we \ndo have a number of amendments and a number of good ideas. We had a \ndebate.\n  Second, it is in the President's budget. So if it is such a terrible \nproposal, I am surprised the President would have proposed it.\n  Mr. REID. Would my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Of course.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator also understand that in the President's \nbudget, he calls for revenue, does he not?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Yes, he does. He calls for major tax increases.\n  Mr. REID. And my friend would also acknowledge that when Presidents \nsubmit these budgets, don't they propose a budget rather than \nnitpicking different pieces of the budget one at a time?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. The Senator is correct. After having put together a \nbudget myself, I would say you have to stand by all those policies. And \nI think if we were to call on the Office of Management and Budget or \nthe Treasury Department, they would tell you they stand by these \nproposals. So, yes, it is a package, but they put them in because they \nthink they are good policy.\n  So my point is that we have some good ideas not related to ObamaCare, \nsince that seems to be an objection by the majority leader, and I hope \nwe can work something out. I do think there is an opportunity for us to \ndo so. But I don't think we can do it unless there is a little bit of \ngive-and-take and some discussion, at least, which we have not been \nable to have yet.\n  With that, I yield for my friend from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I will be brief. I know my colleagues \nprobably have travel plans. But this is something we had earnestly \nhoped that by six of us supporting the motion to proceed, we would have \nthe opportunity to offer an amendment, debate that amendment, and have \nour colleagues vote on that amendment.\n  For the majority leader to simply say--and I quote him: I have looked \nat these amendments that Republicans have offered, and none of them are \nreasonable.\n  Isn't that something this body is supposed to achieve by something \ncalled a vote? Do we have one person here who runs the place and says: \nI will decide whether your amendment is not reasonable. And if I decide \nyour amendment is reasonable, along with all the other 23, then we \nwon't have any vote or debate or the ability to offer any amendment \nwhatsoever.\n  I thought the way we settle things here as to whether this body \nthought something was reasonable or helpful or might correct some of \nthe inequities which have been talked about here was decided by a vote \nof 100 Senators. But it has been decided by the decision of one Senator \nwho has the power to do what he is doing. But this just perpetuates.\n  The majority leader said he has been waiting since Monday for \nRepublicans to offer a pay-for. I was down here Tuesday offering four \noptions to pay for.\n  I know the majority leader doesn't sit in the office and come to the \nfloor\n\n[[Page S207]]\n\nwhen I come down to speak or turn on the television, but I think his \nstaff would have told him: Well, Coats has four pay-fors.\n  And I said: I am not asking for all four, Mr. Leader. You select the \none you think best fits the thoughts and ideas and values of your \ncaucus.\n  So I put four out. The majority leader said we are delaying time. We \nhave been waiting for nearly 2 days now for the majority leader to make \nup his mind in terms of what he wanted to do.\n  The three of us who were listed as surprise votes for the motion to \nproceed weren't even asked to be part of any negotiations. We were \ntrying to look for a solution to the problem, come together and have \nsomething to offer to our colleagues to vote on, but we weren't even \nasked to be part of that.\n  So here we are. I am representing the people of Indiana. Their voice \nis shut down. I don't even have the ability to offer an amendment, \nwhich my constituents sent me here to do. They didn't send me here just \nto be told: Sit down and forget it; one person decides. So I am very \ndisappointed.\n  With that, in the interest of time I ask unanimous consent to call up \nmy amendment No. 2611.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. If he will just withhold--and he can offer his amendment--I \ndo want to say this. We get nowhere with dueling amendments. We have \nlearned that in the past. Dueling amendments don't do the trick.\n  The issue is pronounced, it is here before us, and we went a step \nfurther. In the past we haven't paid for this. Five times, President \nBush signed bills extending unemployment benefits not paid for.\n  Again, we have done a good job reducing the debt. We have a lot more \nwe can do, but we have reduced it almost $3 trillion already. The issue \nnow before us is are we going to extend benefits for people who have \nbeen unemployed for a long time. That is the question. We bent over \nbackward to try to come up with a compromise, a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation. I repeat, it is paid for with a Paul Ryan pay-for. There \nare structural changes. It is a pretty good deal. I am very \ndisappointed we are at a point now where we have been for 5 years. \nNothing is ever quite good enough. They always want more amendments. \nThey always want more amendments.\n  But the issue is before us. Is this body going to vote to extend \nunemployment benefits paid for with Paul Ryan's pay-for and with \nstructural changes or are they going to turn their back on people who \nare desperate?\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, may I ask the majority leader to yield \nfor just one question?\n  Mr. REID. Sure.\n  Mr. COATS. The majority leader just said this body gets nowhere by \noffering amendments. Does he mean throughout this year it is worthless, \nmeaningless for Republicans to offer any amendments to any bill to try \nto make improvements to the bills or to try to make their voice heard \nor the voice of the people I represent, the people of Indiana, heard on \nthis floor?\n  Mr. REID. My friend, the Senator from Indiana, is of those Senators \nwho used to be here when the good old times were here. We didn't have \n``gotcha'' amendments. Every amendment offered, with rare exception, is \na ``gotcha'' amendment. That is not what we do here.\n  I have been waiting since Monday to get pay-fors as to how we can \nextend unemployment benefits for people. They come up with stuff that \ndoesn't even pay for 3 months' worth of extensions. Amendments are \nimportant, but I think we have to go back to the time when Senator \nCoats was here the first time and start working together to get things \ndone in this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, this is 100 percent different from the \ntime I was here the first time. We were able to offer any amendment to \nany bill at any time and the majority leader, both Republicans and \nDemocrats, allowed us to do that. This is the first time I have had the \nexperience of not being able to offer an amendment.\n  I think I heard the majority leader object, but I was not sure. Did \nhe object to my unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The objection was heard.\n  Mr. REID. I was there, just like my friend. Things were different \nthen, they certainly were, because we did not have hundreds of \nfilibusters that would take place. Filibuster was something that was \nused rarely. In those days would you ever filibuster the Secretary of \nDefense or all the other Cabinet officers? Of course you would not. \nThat is why action had to be taken.\n  But what my Republican friends have to realize is that filibuster is \nnot a right, it is a privilege. It has been abused. My friend can \nlecture me, and I am happy to listen to his many lectures, but I was \nhere. I know how things used to work and what has gone on in the last 5 \nyears would never have taken place in those days.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. He brings up the Secretary of Defense frequently. Was \nthe Secretary of Defense defeated or confirmed?\n  Mr. REID. No, he was only delayed while we had two wars going on in \nthis country.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Has a member of the President's Cabinet ever been \ndefeated on a filibuster in the history of the Senate?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in response to the question of my friend, in \nfact what has happened--and we find this with the judges--they stall \nfor weeks, months, and sometimes years. When the vote comes it is \npretty good, but in the meantime they have done significant damage to \nthis institution and our country by stalling and making it so the \nPresident of the United States has a very difficult time doing his job \nbecause he doesn't have his people there when he needs them.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask my friend, the majority leader, then is what he \nfinds offensive the fact that there are debates about these matters? \nSince none of these members are being defeated, what is the issue? I am \nhaving a hard time understanding it. Is it the fact that there is \ncontroversy, that there is debate? Since none of them are being \ndefeated, is he also suggesting we have no controversy about anybody \nsent by the President of the United States?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, of course that is a question that is a great \nbig softball--of course not. We need debate. We need good, strong \ndebate about nominations and everything else. But what we don't need is \nhours and days and weeks and months of obstruction. That is what we \nhave here.\n  My friend, the Republican leader, is picturing to everyone within the \nsound of his voice something that doesn't exist. There has been \nobstruction that has been carried to an extent that no one ever dreamed \nwould happen in this great Republic.\n  That is what the objection is. The objection is to obstruction. Was \nit only a debate when my Republican colleagues decided the DC Circuit--\nsome say the most important court in this country, even, some say, more \nimportant than the Supreme Court--when they decided there were vacant \nseats there and for 5 years held up filling those seats? Is that a \ndebate? No. It is obstruction.\n  If we turn to the dictionary and look up ``obstruction,'' they would \npoint right over here.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the majority leader yield for another question?\n  Since he has conceded that no Cabinet members have been defeated \nprior to the decision of the majority leader to break the rules of the \nSenate to change the rules of the Senate, is it not the case that 215 \nof President Barack Obama's judges have been confirmed and only 2 have \nbeen defeated?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, during the time we have been a country, and \nI don't know exactly long it has been, more than 230 years--I can't \ncome up with it this second--there have been 23 district court nominees \nfilibustered. Twenty of them have been during the 5 years of the Obama \nadministration, and that example is throughout the government.\n  The American people know what is taking place in this body. They can \ntry to paint over a picture that things are just fine, all we are doing \nis wanting a\n\n[[Page S208]]\n\nlittle bit of debate. There has been stalling, obstruction that is \nuntoward and never considered. I just can't imagine how my Republican \ncolleagues can justify what they have done. But they do. I accept that.\n  But we have an issue before this body. Again, they are trying to \ndivert attention and go to how many amendments, what are the rules. The \nissue before this body is whether the long-term unemployed get an \nextension of their benefits. As we speak, there are people all over \nthis country who are desperate to be able to get $300 a week to be able \nto survive for another week, hoping they will find a job. The sad part \nabout that--my friends say we need to do something about making sure \nthese people fill these vacant jobs. There are lots of places people \nfind work. For every job opening there are three people unemployed \ntrying to find a job.\n  I have answered the question to the best of my ability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Indiana had a consent \nrequest? Oh, I wanted my friend from Indiana to know I was not trying \nto object to something he has a right to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, let me just say I share in the comments of \nmy colleague from Indiana and my colleague from Ohio. The three of us \nvoted in good faith to debate this bill. I did so because I thought we \nshould try to debate this issue; that both sides, if they had an idea \nabout how to pay for this in a responsible way, we should bring it \nforward. When I hear the majority leader say I have been waiting since \nMonday, I filed an amendment on Tuesday. That amendment is \nstraightforward. That amendment is one that would fix fraud in our Tax \nCode that came to light in 2011 in a Treasury IG report. What it would \nsimply require is those who seek the additional child tax credit to \nfile a Social Security number just like those who seek the earned-\nincome tax credit in this country.\n  Why is that? Because the investigations of this tax refund people \nreceive found they were claiming it for people who, No. 1, were \nbasically not authorized to work in this country but were claiming it \nand, second, for children who may not even exist. Investigations found \nthat for children who do not even live in this country. So a \ncommonsense amendment that--by the way, would it pay for it? It would \npay for 3 months of unemployment insurance for American workers and for \nthis issue we have before this Chamber. It would pay for it to fix the \nmilitary retirement cuts to the COLAs--that also impacted our wounded \nwarriors--that were done in the most recent budget that were unfair, \nthat Members of both sides of the aisle have come together to say we \nshould fix and agree it is unfair.\n  What else would it do? It would reduce the deficit. What I hear from \nthe majority leader is: I hear that idea. We have heard that before. \nYou may have heard it before, but we have not been allowed a vote on \nit.\n  Are they so afraid of having a vote on something such as this that \nthe people of New Hampshire whom I represent can't get a vote on, \ntrying to fix this abuse in our Tax Code, on trying to solve this issue \npending on the floor and to pay for it so we do not add to our $17 \ntrillion in debt?\n  By the way, is it so unreasonable? I happened to sign a letter from a \nMember of the Democratic conference who, after the Treasury IG report \nwas issued that I am citing, was equally as concerned as I am about \nthis abuse in the Tax Code, in fact, described it as improper payments \nand said it seemed reasonable to presume that unauthorized workers were \nnot eligible for this tax credit and called on the Commissioner of the \nIRS--this is a respected Member of the Democratic conference who \nexpressed concerns about it. That Member said: ``We need to stop these \nunauthorized payments immediately.''\n  That was in 2011 and we cannot even get a vote on this? We can \nreasonably disagree, but the only way we can express those \ndisagreements in this body, as my colleagues have said, is to be \nallowed to vote and to be able to represent our States and to get votes \non amendments.\n  With that, I will ask unanimous consent to call up my amendment No. \n2603.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, talk about fiddling while Rome burns. If \nyou are one of the 1.3 million people in this country, 222,000 in my \nState, whose house is burning down because they are going to lose the \nsafety net of $300 a week to feed their family, to take care of their \nkids, to heat their homes, and my colleague talks about letters? I will \ntell you about a letter I got from a woman who sets her thermostat at \n55 degrees and she has a 2-year-old and a 1-year-old, and all they do \non that side is complain that their amendments, they are so important--\n24 of them. They know they are all partisan.\n  We are trying to work on a bipartisan solution. Somebody explain to \nme why the Republicans never objected to extending unemployment so many \ntimes when George W. Bush was President. Not a one. It was fine.\n  So do we make economic policy by who is in the White House or by the \nneeds of our people?\n  This idea of going after children is one of the worst ideas I have \never heard, and I am shocked. I am shocked. You are going to hurt \nchildren. You are going to take food out of their mouths. It is \noutrageous. If there are abuses, I say to my friend, put those people \nin jail.\n  If there were one corrupt Senator--and there could be and there might \nbe and there was in the past--and every one of us got painted with that \nbrush, which is what the Senator did in her speech, is to taint every \npoor child who happens to benefit from that credit. Let us not go down \nthat partisan route. Let us support our leader and let us work through \nthe weekend to come up with a plan. I think the majority leader has \none.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard. The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I would say, first of all, I voted in good \nfaith, one of six Republicans, to debate this bill to solve this \nproblem. I cannot get a vote. If the Senator from California objects to \nthis amendment, then why don't we vote on it? This is nothing about \nprotecting children--unless the Senator is trying to protect children \nwho may not exist or trying to protect children who do not live in the \nUnited States of America. This is about protecting abuse within the Tax \nCode which, again--I have a letter from a Member of her caucus who \nrecognized this problem as well, based on a Treasury IG report done \nduring this administration. This amendment is about protecting the \nAmerican taxpayer, and the American taxpayer needs some protection in \nthis body when it comes to tax fraud.\n\n  Let me say that we need to be able to have votes on behalf of our \nStates and on behalf of the American people, and if we disagree, let's \nvote them down. I don't see what the issue is unless they are worried \nit is going to pass because it just makes too much sense.\n  I have a parliamentary inquiry. Is it correct that no Senator is \npermitted to offer an amendment to the unemployment insurance bill \nwhile the majority leader's motion to commit with instructions with \nfurther amendments is pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I have a further parliamentary inquiry. If a motion to \ntable the Reid motion to commit with a further amendment is successful, \nwould there still be Reid amendments pending that would prevent me from \noffering my amendment or any of my colleagues from offering their \namendments which would pay for this and improve it and try to address \nthe problems we are supposed to be debating on this floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I have an important amendment, and that amendment would \nfix the abuse within the Tax Code that has been identified by a \nTreasury IG report and subsequent investigations. My amendment would \npay for this 3-month unemployment extension for American workers--those \nwho are struggling to find work. It is an amendment that would fix the \nunfair cuts to our military retirees and\n\n[[Page S209]]\n\nwounded warriors. I am concerned about the $17 trillion in debt and \nwhat it will do to the future of our children and this country, and \nthis amendment would reduce the deficit as well.\n  I would ask for a vote on my amendment, amendment No. 2603, but in \norder for the Senate to consider my important amendment and amendments \nthat my colleagues have talked about--and I hope amendments on the \nother side that we should be voting on--I move to table the pending \nReid motion to commit with instructions, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Casey) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Oklahoma (Mr. Coburn), the Senator from Kansas (Mr. \nMoran), and the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Paul).\n  The result was announced--yeas 42, nays 54, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 3 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--42\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Enzi\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kirk\n     Lee\n     Manchin\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--54\n\n     Baldwin\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Booker\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Coons\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Heller\n     Hirono\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Klobuchar\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Markey\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Casey\n     Coburn\n     Moran\n     Paul\n  The motion was rejected.\n\n\n  NOMINATION OF ROBERT LEON WILKINS TO BE U.S. CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE \n                DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.

The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The assistant bill clerk read the nomination of Robert Leon Wilkins, \nof the District of Columbia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we begin 2014, I hope we can set aside \nour differences and do what is best for this country by confirming \nqualified nominees to fill critical vacancies facing our Federal \njudiciary. We can do this today by voting to end the filibuster of \nJudge Robert Wilkins, who has been nominated to serve on the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the DC Circuit. Judge Wilkins was nominated last June, \nand it is time that he received an up-or-down vote on his nomination. \nLast month, before we adjourned the Senate, we were able to confirm two \nother exceptional nominees to this court--Patricia Millett and Nina \nPillard. Once Judge Wilkins is confirmed, the DC Circuit, which is \noften considered to be the second most important court in the Nation, \nwill finally be operating at full strength. The American people deserve \nno less.\n  Judge Wilkins is an outstanding nominee. He was unanimously confirmed \nto the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia less than 3 \nyears ago. He has presided over hundreds of cases and issued \nsignificant decisions in various areas of the law, including in the \nfields of administrative and constitutional law. Prior to serving on \nthe bench, he was a partner for nearly 10 years in private practice and \nserved more than 10 years as a public defender in the District of \nColumbia.\n  During his time at the Public Defender Service, Judge Wilkins served \nas the lead plaintiff in a racial profiling case, which arose out of an \nincident in which he and three family members were stopped and detained \nwhile returning from a funeral in Chicago. This lawsuit led to landmark \nsettlements that required systematic statewide compilation and \npublication of highway traffic stop-and-search data by race. These \nsettlements inspired an Executive order by President Clinton, \nlegislation in the House and Senate, and legislation in at least 28 \nStates prohibiting racial profiling or requiring data collection.\n  Despite the progress made in the past several decades, the struggle \nto diversify our Federal bench continues. If confirmed, Judge Wilkins \nwould be only the sixth African American to have ever served on the DC \nCircuit.\n  Judge Wilkins earned the ABA's highest possible rating of unanimously \n``well qualified.'' He also has the support of the National Bar \nAssociation, the Nation's largest professional association of African \nAmerican lawyers and judges, as well as several other prominent legal \norganizations. I ask unanimous consent to include a list of support in \nthe Record.\n  I urge my fellow senators to end the filibuster on this outstanding \nnominee. This Nation will be better off with Judge Robert Wilkins \nserving on the DC Circuit.\n  I would also note that on December 31, 2013, before the new year, \nChief Justice Roberts once again issued his annual year-end report on \nthe Federal judiciary. In this report, he focused on the significant \nfinancial strain on our Federal courts. The cuts from sequestration \nhave had a real impact for Americans seeking justice and pose real \nthreats to the dedicated public servants who work in our Nation's \nFederal courts as well as to members of the public. I hope that we can \nreturn to regular order in our appropriations process and ensure that \nour courts have the resources they require. As the Chief noted, the \nFederal Judiciary's entire budget ``consumes only the tiniest sliver of \nFederal revenues, just two-tenths of 1 percent of the Federal \ngovernment's total outlays.'' We receive the benefit of the greatest \njudicial system in the world for less than 1 percent of our entire \nFederal budget. It makes no sense to indiscriminately cut services from \nour independent Federal judiciary. There are better and smarter ways to \nsave taxpayer dollars.\n  Another threat facing our courts which is unaddressed in the Chief's \nyear-end report are the continuing vacancies experienced by the Federal \ncourts. Over the last year, the number of vacancies has hovered around \n90 because obstruction in Congress has led to filibuster after \nfilibuster of qualified nominees. And the unfortunate action taken by \nRepublicans at the end of the first session of this Congress will only \nmean further delay in filling these vacancies--Republicans, for the \nfirst time ever, refused to allow any currently pending judicial \nnominees to be held over so that they could be ready for immediate \naction this year. For purely political reasons, Senate Republicans are \nforcing us to duplicate work this year that we already completed in \n2013. In the jurisdiction of the Senate Judiciary Committee alone, more \nthan 65 judicial and executive nominees were returned to the President \nand had to be renominated this week. It is a waste of taxpayer dollars \nand valuable resources that could be spent addressing the difficult \nissues facing our Nation. We must not take for granted that we have the \ngreatest justice system in the world, and ensuring this continues \nrequires the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty of advice and \nconsent.\n  Fortunately, due to the procedural posture of the nomination from \nlast year, we did not have to send the nomination of Robert Wilkins to \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit back to the President for \nrenomination. I thank the majority leader for prioritizing this \nnomination in the first week of the second session of this Congress. I \nhope my fellow Senators\n\n[[Page S211]]\n\nwill join me today to end the filibuster of the nomination of this good \nman to serve on this important court.\n\n\n                            Vote Explanation\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was unable to attend the roll \ncall vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination of Robert \nWilkins to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the D.C. Circuit. Had I been \npresent for this vote and the two related procedural votes, I would \nhave voted aye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to proceed as though in morning business for 15 minutes, but \nprior to that I be able to yield to Senator Reed of Rhode Island for 5 \nminutes and that not be counted against my time; and that I then be \nrecognized after he is done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the Senator from Michigan is recognized and yields \nto the Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                         Unemployment Insurance\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Michigan, \nmy chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and I simply wish to make \na few comments about this afternoon's proceedings with respect to \nunemployment insurance. The reason we were here, and we can't lose \nsight of that, is that 1.3 million Americans, as of December 28, lost \ntheir extended unemployment benefits. They are without the modest \nsupport of roughly $300 to $350 a week. Every week, 73,000 more \nAmericans lose this support. We are going to see this number grow and \ngrow and grow and grow while we talk and talk and talk and talk.\n  Along with Senator Heller, we proposed a very straightforward \nmechanism: a 90 day extension and picking up retroactively those who \nhad lost it, unpaid for, so we could work on some of the difficult \nissues my colleagues have all explored this afternoon.\n  In listening to my colleagues, we made the determination there was a \nsincere concern and desire on the part of my Republican colleagues \nparticularly that any extension of benefits be paid for. Most \nfrequently, we don't pay for these benefits. We have on occasion, but \nmost times we consider it emergency spending. We go ahead and authorize \nthe payments and we don't offset it. But the concern was raised \nrepeatedly and very strenuously that these benefits should be paid for. \nAlso, there were several proposals to do that.\n  So working closely with my colleagues, we considered the best \napproach for it was not simply to bring up the Reed-Heller bill, the 90 \nday extension, but to respond as best we could to these concerns. So \nthe provision we brought up today is fully offset, but it goes beyond \n90 days because the simple logic was that going through the travail of \nfinding pay-fors is not something we want to do every 90 days. It is \nsomething we should do seriously but for as long as possible. So our \nprovision would be able to carry these benefits through to the middle \nof November, and it required finding offsets.\n  The other thing we have heard from our Republican colleagues is that \nwe shouldn't use any revenue--no tax provisions. In the Democratic \ncaucus we have seen this extension of extended unemployment insurance \nbenefits come up so many times under Republican Presidents and \nDemocratic Presidents completely unpaid for. But also in terms of \nseriously and thoughtfully balancing the way we pay for provisions, we \nhave many times suggested, which I think is common sense, let's have a \nmix of revenue and other provisions--spending provisions. Let's do \nthat; 50-50 or some fair combination. In fact, I think the American \npeople would see that as the most sensible approach to doing the work \nof government. But once again we yielded to the perceptions and the \ndemands, in some respects, that there be no revenue provisions in this \nbill.\n  As a result, we had to look for a series of pay-fors that didn't \ninvolve revenues. That was a deliberate attempt to reach across and to \nsay: We hear you. You want it fully paid for, you want no spending, and \nyou want provisions that will not involve revenue. So we proposed a \nmajor provision--an extension of the mandatory sequestration--that was \nincluded in the budget agreement and that had overwhelming support in \nthe Senate--for a bit over an additional year, which gained us, \nroughly--and these are rough figures--about $17 billion.\n  Then we took one of the provisions that was offered by my colleague \nSenator Portman, who has been working very assiduously and very \nthoughtfully on these issues, with respect to the double collection of \nboth SSDI benefits and unemployment compensation benefits and we tried \nto focus it and make it narrower, and that resulted in $1 billion, \ngiving us sufficient funds to carry this program through--if we voted \ntoday, starting as soon as the House passed it--all the way to the \nmiddle of November. That is where we are today.\n  We still are open to alternatives to try to deal with this issue. I \nknow many of my colleagues on the Democratic side have a long list of \nrevenue provisions. In fact, Chairman Levin has, through his work, a \nlist of what many would call--many Americans--egregious loopholes that \ncorporations enjoy. But certainly there are other ways to pay for this. \nBut we are still trying to work through this.\n  We are still trying to find a bipartisan approach to deal with the \nissue of the moment, the crisis of the moment, and that is 1.4 million \nAmericans today--and that number is growing--who worked hard and \nthrough no fault of their own lost their job and who are now struggling \nto get by with a modest $300 or $350 a week.\n  One final point. This is a crisis of the moment. I know some of my \ncolleagues are talking about an issue--the issue of military pensions--\nthat doesn't become effective, as I understand it, until 2015. There \nare other ways to deal with it. But that is a fair position to advance \nat any time, and I have great sympathy for that position.\n  I would hate to see other issues, systematic reform of our training \nprograms--which takes time, effort, and focused attention by committees \ntypically--essentially prevent a response to the immediate crisis of \npeople who are without jobs, who are desperately looking, and now don't \nhave very modest support to pay for their rent, pay for their heat, and \nprovide some support for their families.\n  We are still engaged. We will have a vote Monday. I hope we can \nsucceed on that procedural vote. Regardless, we are going to come back \nand back, because this number of Americans--growing each week by \napproximately 70,000--needs our response, not just our comments on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the current situation in Iraq is deeply \ndisturbing. The violence there is a human tragedy, and the resurgence \nof Al Qaeda-affiliated forces in Fallujah and elsewhere represents a \nthreat not just to the people of Iraq but to our own security and that \nof our friends and allies in the region. So I very much share in \nconcerns many of us have expressed about recent developments in Iraq.\n  The United States has announced it will expedite military assistance, \nincluding delivery of unmanned aerial vehicles and HELLFIRE missiles. \nThat is appropriate. The administration has stepped up intelligence \nsharing to help Iraq security forces in their fight. That is \nappropriate. The administration is holding ongoing conversations with \nIraq about other ways in which the United States might assist, and that \nis appropriate.\n  One form that assistance might take is in the sale of weapons such as \nattack helicopters to Iraq. The issue is not whether such aircraft \nwould help Iraq fight violent extremists; they would. The question is \nwhether the Maliki government would use those aircraft, for instance, \nonly against violent extremists, and whether we receive credible \nassurances that such weapons will be used to target Iraq's real enemies \nand not to further sectarian political objectives. With credible \nassurances, it would be appropriate to provide Iraq such assistance.\n  What it is wrong to do is to blame the Obama administration for the \npolitical failures of Iraqi leaders. Blaming the administration for \nfailures and decisions by the Iraqi Government ignores not only \nhistory, it also leads to policy approaches that would not be in our \ninterest or in the interests of the Iraqi people.\n\n[[Page S212]]\n\n  For example, here is what Senator McCain and Senator Graham said \nrecently:\n\n       When President Obama withdrew all U.S. forces from Iraq in \n     2011, over the objections of our military leaders and \n     commanders on the ground, many of us predicted that the \n     vacuum would be filled by America's enemies and would emerge \n     as a threat to U.S. national security interests. Sadly, that \n     reality is now clearer than ever.\n\n  That argument ignores some important history. First, it ignores the \nfact that the 2011 withdrawal date for U.S. forces in Iraq was not set \nby President Obama but by President Bush. In December of 2008, just \nbefore he left office, President Bush signed an agreement with the \nIraqi Government that called for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraqi \ncities in 2009, and the complete withdrawal of U.S. forces by the end \nof 2011. President Bush himself, standing next to Prime Minister Maliki \nin Baghdad as they announced their agreement, said, ``The agreement \nlays out a framework for the withdrawal of American forces in Iraq.'' \nSo the 2011 withdrawal date was set by President Bush, not by President \nObama.\n  As to whether our military commanders objected to our withdrawal from \nIraq, here is what happened: While there was no mention from President \nBush or Prime Minister Maliki when they announced their agreement of a \nU.S. troop presence after 2011, Secretary Gates and others discussed \nthe possibility of some U.S. forces remaining in Iraq after 2011. Then, \nduring 2011, the Obama administration entered into negotiations with \nthe Iraqi Government with the goal of keeping some U.S. troops, in \nlimited roles, in Iraq to assist Iraqi security forces after the 2011 \nwithdrawal date set by President Bush. I and many other Members of \nCongress supported the idea of continuing a smaller, specialized U.S. \nmilitary assistance force. While there was disagreement in the \nadministration over the size of a residual force, what decided the \nissue wasn't how many troops would remain; rather, it was the Iraqi \nGovernment's refusal to agree to legal protections for U.S. troops, \nwhatever their number. In the absence of such protections, it was the \nopinion of the military leaders that no U.S. forces should remain in \nIraq, regardless of whether the number was 3,500 or 20,000.\n  At a November 2011 Armed Services Committee hearing, I asked General \nDempsey, then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about the \nimportance of legal protections for our troops as part of any agreement \nto keep troops in Iraq after 2011. This is what the questions and \nanswers were:\n\n       Sen. Levin: Are you willing to have those forces remain \n     without an agreement relative to immunity for those troops?\n       Gen. Dempsey: No, sir, I am not. . . . It was the \n     recommendation, advice and strong belief of the Joint Chiefs \n     that we should not leave service men and women there without \n     protections.\n       Sen. Levin: And why is that?\n       Gen. Dempsey: Because the--of the many institutions in Iraq \n     that are still evolving and immature. The Iraqi judicial \n     system is certainly among those. And we did not believe it \n     was--it was appropriate, prudent to leave service men and \n     women without judicial protections in a country that still \n     had the challenge, as we know it has, and a very immature \n     judicial system.\n\n  Later in that same hearing, I asked General Dempsey if our commanders \non the ground in Iraq shared that opinion. He responded:\n\n       It was the topic of many secure video teleconferences and \n     engagements person to person. . . . I can state that they \n     also believed we needed the protections, both General Austin \n     and General Mattis, in order to leave our troops there.\n\n  Before our committee in February of 2013, General Austin, our \ncommander on the ground in Iraq during the 2011 negotiations, testified \nthat there were extensive discussions with Iraq about a continuing U.S. \ntroop presence. He testified:\n\n       We worked with the Iraqi leadership all the way up until \n     the point in time when they decided they weren't going to be \n     able to give us the protections that we needed to keep our \n     troops there.\n\n  As Secretary Panetta put it before our committee, the key moment in \nthe negotiations was ``once [the Iraqis] made the decision that they \nwere not going to provide any immunities for any level of force that we \nwould have there.''\n  So our military leaders were very much unwilling to leave any U.S. \nforces on the ground in Iraq if they could be subjected to the \nvicissitudes of the Iraqi judicial system. It is therefore wrong to say \nthat the withdrawal took place ``over the objections of our military \nleaders.'' It was Iraq's refusal to grant important legal protections \nto our troops that decided the matter.\n  This criticism of the administration's Iraq policy also understates \nthe importance of factors that have come to the forefront since the \n2011 withdrawal. Foremost among these has been an Iraqi Government that \nhas repeatedly pursued a sectarian agenda, disenfranchised Sunni \nIraqis, failed to address Kurdish concerns over the status of Kirkuk \nand the hydrocarbons law, and alienated moderate Shia Iraqis who seek a \nmore democratic and inclusive government. Prime Minister Maliki's \ngovernance shortfalls has stoked the sectarian tensions on which Al \nQaeda and other extremist groups try to capitalize.\n  Many Members of Congress have made clear that it is extremely \ndifficult to support more robust assistance to the Iraqi Government \nunless the Iraqi leadership places the good of their country ahead of \nsectarian politics and unless it produces a practical strategy for \ngoverning Iraq on a more inclusive and less sectarian basis.\n  For example, last October, I joined five colleagues--Senators McCain, \nMenendez, Corker, Inhofe, and Graham--in writing to President Obama, \nexpressing our concern about deteriorating conditions in Iraq.\n  I ask unanimous consent that our October 29, 2013, letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 29, 2013.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Obama: We are deeply concerned about the \n     deteriorating situation in Iraq. As Iraqi Prime Minister \n     Nouri al-Maliki visits Washington this week, we urge you to \n     press him to formulate a comprehensive political and security \n     strategy that can stabilize the country, enable Iraq to \n     realize its vast potential, and help to safeguard our \n     nation's enduring national security interests in Iraq.\n       By nearly every indicator, security conditions in Iraq have \n     dramatically worsened over the past two years. Al-Qaeda in \n     Iraq has returned with a vengeance: It has regenerated the \n     manpower, terrorist infrastructure, resources, and safe \n     havens to sustain and increase the tempo and intensity of \n     attacks and to penetrate deeper into all parts of Iraq than \n     at any time in recent years. Indeed, an analysis this month \n     by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy found, ``In \n     2010, the low point for the al-Qaeda effort in Iraq, car \n     bombings declined to an average of 10 a month and multiple \n     location attacks occurred only two or three times a year. In \n     2013, so far there has been an average of 68 car bombings a \n     month and a multiple-location strike every 10 days.'' The \n     United Nations estimates that more than 7,000 civilians have \n     been killed in Iraq thus far this year--a level of violence \n     not seen since the worst days of 2008.\n       What's worse, the deteriorating conflict in Syria has \n     enabled al-Qaeda in Iraq to transform into the larger and \n     more lethal Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), which \n     now has a major base for operations spanning both Iraq and \n     Syria. As the situation in both countries grows worse, and as \n     ISIS gathers strength, we are deeply concerned that Al-Qaeda \n     could use its new safe haven in Iraq and Syria to launch \n     attacks against U.S. interests and those of our friends and \n     allies.\n       Unfortunately, Prime Minister Maliki's mismanagement of \n     Iraqi politics is contributing to the recent surge of \n     violence. By too often pursuing a sectarian and authoritarian \n     agenda, Prime Minister Maliki and his allies are \n     disenfranchising Sunni Iraqis, marginalizing Kurdish Iraqis, \n     and alienating the many Shia Iraqis who have a democratic, \n     inclusive, and pluralistic vision for their country. This \n     failure of governance is driving many Sunni Iraqis into the \n     arms of Al-Qaeda in Iraq and fueling the rise of violence, \n     which in turn is radicalizing Shia Iraqi communities and \n     leading many Shia militant groups to remobilize. These were \n     the same conditions that drove Iraq toward civil war during \n     the last decade, and we fear that fate could befall Iraq once \n     again.\n       We therefore urge you to take the following steps as Prime \n     Minister Maliki visits Washington:\n       First, we believe the Prime Minister's visit is an \n     important opportunity to reengage with the American people \n     about the continuing strategic importance of Iraq. Though the \n     war in Iraq is over, Americans need to understand that the \n     United States has an enduring national security interest in \n     the development of a sovereign, stable, and democratic Iraq \n     that can secure its own citizens\n\n[[Page S213]]\n\n     and territory, sustain its own economic growth, resolve its \n     own internal disputes through inclusive and pluralistic \n     politics, and cooperate as a strategic partner of the United \n     States--a vision of our relationship that was best expressed \n     in the 2008 Strategic Framework Agreement.\n       Second, we urge you to make clear to Prime Minister Maliki \n     that the extent of Iran's malign influence in the Iraqi \n     government is a serious problem in our bilateral \n     relationship, especially for the Congress. Published reports \n     demonstrate that the Iranian regime uses Iraqi airspace to \n     transit military assistance into Syria to support Assad and \n     his forces. Furthermore, attacks against the residents of \n     Camp Ashraf in Iraq are reprehensible, especially because the \n     Iraqi government pledged to protect these people. Prime \n     Minister Maliki must understand that actions such as these \n     need to stop. Not only do they make it difficult for Iraq's \n     friends in the United States to build public support, \n     especially in the Congress, to enhance our strategic \n     partnership, but they also undermine Iraq's standing as a \n     responsible member of the international community.\n       Third, we encourage you to step up our counterterrorism \n     support for Iraq. It is in our national security interest to \n     enhance the effectiveness of Iraq's security forces, \n     especially through greater intelligence sharing. However, in \n     addition to our aforementioned concerns, we must see more \n     evidence from Prime Minister Maliki that U.S. security \n     assistance and arms sales are part of a comprehensive Iraqi \n     strategy that addresses the political sources of the current \n     violence and seeks to bring lasting peace to the country.\n       This leads us to the final and most important point that we \n     urge you to stress with Prime Minister Maliki: If he devises \n     and implements a real governance strategy for Iraq, the \n     United States is ready to provide the appropriate support to \n     help that strategy succeed. Iraq's challenges will never be \n     solved through security operations alone. Indeed, as the \n     United States learned through its own hard experience in \n     Iraq, applying security solutions to political problems will \n     only make those problems worse.\n       It is essential that you urge Prime Minister Maliki to \n     adopt a strategy to address Iraq's serious problems of \n     governance. Such a strategy should unite Iraqis of every sect \n     and ethnicity in a reformed constitutional order, based on \n     the rule of law, which can give Iraqis a real stake in their \n     nation's progress, marginalize Al-Qaeda in Iraq and other \n     violent extremists, and bring lasting peace to the country. \n     To be effective, an Iraqi political strategy should involve \n     sharing greater national power and revenue with Sunni Iraqis, \n     reconciling with Sunni leaders, and ending de-Baathification \n     and other policies of blanket retribution. It should include \n     agreements with the Kurdistan Regional Government to share \n     hydrocarbon revenues and resolve territorial disputes. And it \n     requires a clear commitment that the elections scheduled for \n     next year will happen freely, fairly, and inclusively in all \n     parts of Iraq, and that the necessary preparations will be \n     taken.\n       If Prime Minister Maliki were to take actions such as \n     these, he could cement his legacy as the leader who \n     safeguarded his country's sovereignty and laid the foundation \n     for the new Iraq. In this endeavor, Prime Minister Maliki and \n     our other Iraqi partners would have our support, including \n     appropriate security assistance, and we would encourage you \n     to provide U.S. diplomatic support at the highest levels to \n     help Iraqis reach the necessary political agreements before \n     the 2014 elections. However, if Prime Minister Maliki \n     continues to marginalize the Kurds, alienate many Shia, and \n     treat large numbers of Sunnis as terrorists, no amount of \n     security assistance will be able to bring stability and \n     security to Iraq. That is not a legacy we want for Prime \n     Minister Maliki, and that is not an outcome that would serve \n     America's national interests.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin.\n     John McCain.\n     Robert Menendez.\n     Bob Corker.\n     James M. Inhofe.\n     Lindsey Graham.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. In our letter, written as Prime Minister Malaki was \nvisiting Washington, we supported an increase in support for Iraq's \ncounterterrorism efforts. But we made clear that the Iraqi Government \nmust provide a practical plan for using such aid and provide assurances \nrelative to whom advanced weapons would be used against. We wrote \nPresident Obama as follows:\n\n       It is in our national security interest to enhance the \n     effectiveness of Iraq's security forces, especially through \n     greater intelligence sharing. However . . . we must see more \n     evidence from Prime Minister Maliki that U.S. security \n     assistance and arms sales are part of a comprehensive Iraqi \n     strategy that addresses the political sources of the current \n     violence and seeks to bring lasting peace to the country.\n\n  We further wrote:\n\n       This leads us to the final and most important point that we \n     urge you to stress with Prime Minister Maliki: If he devises \n     and implements a real governance strategy for Iraq, the \n     United States is ready to provide the appropriate support to \n     help that strategy succeed.\n\n  And:\n\n       If Prime Minister Maliki continues to marginalize the \n     Kurds, alienate many Shia, and treat large numbers of Sunnis \n     as terrorists, no amount of security assistance will be able \n     to bring stability and security to Iraq.\n\n  It is a tragedy for the Iraqi people and a real security concern for \nthe United States that Prime Minister Maliki has yet to produce a \nstrategy for broadly based governance in Iraq. We should not forget the \n2011 withdrawal date for American troops from Iraq was negotiated by \nPresident Bush. We should not forget the decision to reject an ongoing \nU.S. troop presence after 2011 was Iraq's, because of Iraq's refusal to \nassure us that our troops would have protections from Iraqi courts and \nprosecution. We should not forget that our military leaders supported \nthe decision not to leave our troops in Iraq without legal protections \nfrom Iraqi prosecution. We should not forget that while an ongoing \nrelationship is in our interests, no amount of military equipment from \nus will protect the Iraqi people if their government continues to place \nsectarian goals ahead of sound governance.\n  So we should use opportunities to assist Iraq in its struggle against \nviolent extremism and for stability and security, but Iraq's fate \nultimately rests with its people and their leaders.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when I \nconclude my remarks, Senator Murkowski of Alaska be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have been honored to serve with \nSenator Levin on the Armed Services Committee. He does an excellent \njob. He has spent a lot of time and many hours working to try to help \nus be successful in Iraq and other areas of national defense.\n  I think Generals Dempsey and Austin were right to say we could not \nkeep our troops there unless they had immunity from local prosecutions. \nBut as I recall the net feeling about the President's decision to \nwithdraw from continued negotiations on this contentious issue, the \nmilitary felt this was not wise--at least many of them did--and they \nbelieved that had we continued to pursue negotiations, we may have been \nable to reach the kind of agreement which would allow us to help the \nIraqi Government be stable and successful. Pulling out as we did always \nseemed to me to be too rapid, too precipitous, and created dangers \nwhich could place at risk that which our soldiers fought and died \nfor. I do believe that is what happened. It is a tragic thing.\n\n  I was in Falluja, not long after that bitter battle. We had hundreds \nwounded and almost 100 killed. The Marines performed with such valor \nand courage. It was one of the great, courageous performances of the \nU.S. Marine Corps. It is sad, sad to me to see that today Al Qaeda is \nflying its flag in parts of that city. It is a tragedy. It did not \nmaintain the faith that we ought to have maintained with those that we \nin Congress directed to go out and fight this war and to be successful. \nMaybe yet something can be done successfully to deal with this \nsituation, which I feel deeply about.\n\n\n                         unemployment insurance\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am here to share some thoughts about the remarks \ndelivered today by President Obama on the growing problem of poverty \nand our chronic unemployment that has occurred during the 6 years of \nhis Presidency, after he has declared that the recession is over and \nwas over. Just this week the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, said \nthat ``the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer \nand the middle class is under siege.''\n  Wages are not doing well. Americans in large numbers are not doing \nwell, and they are hurting. Washington Democrats, led by the President, \nare now proposing increased unemployment insurance and new wage-price \ncontrols, wage controls to mandate wages that have to be paid, to treat \nthe consequences of a failed economy--a stagnant, slow-growth economy \nthat is not creating jobs. These words and actions represent an \nadmission that the\n\n[[Page S214]]\n\nWhite House economic agenda has been a disaster for poor and middle \nclass people. It has not worked.\n  I know he believed it would work. I know he has advocated these \npolicies. I know he promised that they would work. But they are not \nworking. Worst still, the President remains fully committed to the \npolicy regime that he has been advocating, and that is not working. \nThese policies have failed, not just for the last 5 years; they have \nfailed for the last 50 years. They will never work. The President and \nMajority Leader Reid are correct, a nervous American business community \nis hoarding profits because they don't know what the future is going to \nbe like. Those struggling to get by are feeling the results of \ncorporate cost cutting and the policies that we are seeing executed by \nthe government are impacting this situation negatively. They just are.\n  I know the people proposing these solutions think they are caring \nabout people who are hurting today. But if we care about them, we will \nuse our heads as well as our hearts, and we will think through as to \nhow to make growth occur in our economy, how to help jobs be created, \nhow to have wages rise instead of stagnating or declining.\n  Mr. President, $16 trillion has been spent fighting poverty since the \nwar on poverty began 50 years ago, yet where do we stand today? Mr. \nPresident, 47 million Americans are on food stamps, 91.5 million are \noutside the labor force not working, and 46 million are living in \npoverty. In low-income communities the pain is especially severe. For \nexample, in the city of Baltimore, 1 in 3 residents receives food \nstamps. In Chicago, 51 percent of the city's children live in a single-\nparent family. In Detroit, almost 1 in 3 households had not had a \nsingle person working at any time throughout the year--almost 1 in 3 \nhouseholds. The city's violent crime rate is among the worst in the \ncountry. More than half of all Detroit children live in poverty.\n  The welfare bureaucracy that the left is determined to defend and \nexpand is failing our fellow Americans. It is just not working. We can \ndo better. We have to do better. No longer can we define compassion by \nhow much money we spend on poverty but by how many people we lift out \nof poverty.\n  The amount of money State and Federal governments spend on the \nwelfare bureaucracy each year amounts to more than $1 trillion. That is \na huge sum. It is twice the Defense Department budget. If all these \nfunds were converted to cash and mailed to every household in poverty, \nit would equate to $60,000 per household. Yet as the President now \nadmits, chronic poverty and a widening income gap is the new normal.\n  We have huge bureaucracies, huge multiple conflicting programs, and \nprograms that are not working and are not helping the people we are \nsupposed to help. They just are not.\n  Isn't it time that we broke from decades of policies that are proven \nnot to work? Imagine how much better it would be if we combined dozens \nof overlapping welfare programs into a single credit with better \noversight standards focused on the goal of helping people become \nfinancially self-sufficient. We need fresh approaches. We have to have \nfresh approaches. I believe it will happen. The sooner it happens the \nbetter off this country will be and the better off poor people will be.\n  But all we get from the White House are the stale policies of \nyesterday. What is the agenda the President persists in pushing? \nConsider the cornerstones of the President's economic agenda, the \nthings he has been pushing in the Senate and the Congress and \nadvocating unilaterally through the powers of the executive President--\nsome beyond all law, it seems to me. These are the things he has \nconsistently advocated for. He wants a government health care takeover, \nand that is proven to be a job killer. It is killing jobs and two-\nthirds of the jobs this year that have been created were part-time and \nin large part that has been a reaction to the Affordable Care Act.\n  What else? He has a hostility, a consistent hostility to the \nproduction of American energy, which makes the country more wealthy, to \nproduce our own energy rather than transferring our wealth abroad, to \nbuy energy from abroad. It creates jobs in America, high-paying jobs.\n  We have proposals for more and more taxes and more and more \nregulations that make it more difficult for U.S. workers to compete in \nthe global marketplace. It makes it harder for their companies to be \nable to export and therefore create more American jobs.\n  We have a lawless immigration policy that undermines American workers \nand their wages. It just does. They can say whatever they want to say, \nbut the bill that passed the Senate, the comprehensive immigration \nbill, would have doubled the number of guest workers. Some say: Well, \nJeff, they are just going to be agricultural workers. That is not so. \nOnly a small number are going to be agricultural workers. They are \ngoing to be a million-plus workers traveling around the country taking \njobs all over America--twice as many lawfully as would be the case \nunder current law. This is supposed to be immigration reform? This is \nsupposed to help American workers find a job or have a pay raise?\n  We have a weak trade policy. We have to stand up for the American \nworkers on the world stage and make sure that our trading partners are \naccepting our products like we accept their products, and if they do \nnot, we have to defend the interests of the American worker. That is \nthe way to help them have more jobs and better pay.\n  We have a welfare bureaucracy that penalizes work. The President is \nproposing more massive spending, creating more debt. He has had the \ngreatest debt increases in the history in our country. That is \ndestroying and weakening growth in America. It places a cloud over the \nAmerican economy, as experts have told us.\n  These policies have been the order of the day for 5 years. That is \nwhat we heard. We need to spend more, we need to invest more, and we \nneed to tax more. We have had more regulations than we have ever had in \nAmerican history. We have had trillion dollar deficits the likes of \nwhich we have never seen before, and people wonder why the economy is \nnot doing well.\n  We blocked oil production in the gulf for an inordinate period of \ntime and are only slowly allowing that to occur. We blocked a Canadian \npipeline that would create thousands of American jobs. We blocked \nenergy production on Federal lands. We make it harder for energy \nproduction on private lands to occur, and we wonder why we cannot \ncreate sufficient jobs and growth. We need lower-cost energy, cheaper \nenergy. That is good for the economy. Falling natural gas prices have \nbeen a help because of new techniques in the production of natural gas.\n  These statist, leftist policies have been tried in America before, \nand they have been tried throughout the world for decades, and they \nwill never work. Taxes, regulating, more government, and taking over \nthe health care industry will not create prosperity and jobs in \nAmerica. It just won't. If it would, we would be doing so much better.\n  Since the President has entered office we have added an incredible $7 \ntrillion to the debt of the United States, and what do we have to show \nfor that? Real wages are lower today than they were in 1999. Take-home \npay has fallen for 5 consecutive years. Average household wealth is 60 \npercent lower today than it was in 2007; 1.3 million fewer people are \nworking today than in 2007. Have we had a recovery? We have fewer \npeople working today than we had 6 years ago, and every month we add \n150,000 or more people, basically, to the age cohort of Americans that \ncould be working, because the population is increasing that much. So \nyou have to create real jobs to stay ahead of just normal population \ngrowth. There is 1.3 million fewer people working today, even though \nthe population has grown by 14.5 million. There are 1.3 million fewer \npeople who are working today than in 2007, even though the population \nhas grown 14.5 million. That is not good.\n  So the President is right to be worried about the health of the \nAmerican middle class and lower-income workers in America. It sure has \nnot been going well. I know he thought his statist ideas would work, \nand he pushed them steadfastly. He had a Senate that rubber stamped for \n2 years what he wanted, including a $800 billion stimulus bill that was \nsupposed to create jobs and prosperity in America, every penny of that \nborrowed.\n  If we continue down this road, I fear we are going to sentence an \nentire generation of young Americans to poverty,\n\n[[Page S215]]\n\njoblessness, and stagnant economic growth in our economy. Majority \nLeader Reid said this week that, ``We should realize that today there \nis only one job available for three people seeking a job. Think about \nit.''\n  I agree that we absolutely must think about that. We should think \nseriously about it. My first thought is this. Since three people are \nlooking for every one job that is open, then why has the President \nembraced an immigration bill that would double the flow of guest \nworkers into America? They will take jobs that would be available for \nAmerican workers. Why? That is what I think about.\n  As David Cameron, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, said \nrecently: Immigration cannot be a substitute for training our own \nworkforce. Is there something wrong with him saying that? Isn't that an \nhonest, correct statement, speaking for the interest of the average \nBriton?\n  We need to help struggling Americans get off welfare, off \nunemployment, and into good-paying jobs.\n  We have a loose labor market. We don't have a tight labor market. \nByron York recently wrote an excellent column. He showed that the very \nsame companies that signed letters to the President and the Congress \ndemanding more guest workers are laying off American workers by the \nthousands. Big companies are signing letters that demand more workers, \nand they are laying off thousands of workers. It is a fact. He listed \nthem. There were 10 or 15 companies. Some of them laid off thousands of \npeople the very year they wrote to this Congress demanding more foreign \nworkers. So now we have to extend unemployment benefits because people \ncan't find jobs. We have to pass a law to set the wage so the wage can \nbe higher because it is not going up through the natural free market as \nit should if we had a normal market for labor.\n  Whom do we work for? I know who I work for, and that is the hard-\nworking people of Alabama and the United States. I don't work for the \nmasters of the universe. They are demanding more workers from Congress \nwhen millions of Americans are unemployed.\n  America is not an oligarchy. House Republicans need to firmly tell \nthis President that we work for the American people. We reject any \nimmigration plan that puts special interests or corporate interests \nbefore working Americans. They need to say: We are going to defend the \nworking people of this country. They are not being defended in the \nSenate by the Democratic majority, that is for sure, with regard to the \nimmigration policy.\n  A small group of CEOs don't get to set immigration policy for the \ncountry, no matter how much money they have. How many ads do they buy? \nWe are not going to enrich the political class at the expense of the \nmiddle class, and we will reject the immigration bill that passed the \nSenate.\n  That is one of the things we could do to help improve job prospects \nfor Americans. It wouldn't cost us a dime. We wouldn't have to borrow \nmoney. It would actually get people off welfare and food stamps. It \nwould put them back into the workforce, and put us on a better path.\n  If we want to reverse the middle-class decline, we need a new \neconomic vision. We need concrete steps to restore opportunity to the \nAmerican people without adding a penny to the national debt. We need \npolicies that work to create prosperity without borrowing and creating \nmore debt. We just have to do that.\n  What are some of the things that we can do? Produce more American \nenergy. We can turn the welfare office into a job-training center. We \ncan do this. We are going to have to do this. We are going to have to \nmove people from dependence to independence. We need to streamline the \nTax Code and make it more growth oriented, which will help us to be \nmore competitive worldwide. We need to eliminate every Washington \nregulation that is not needed. These are regulations that kill jobs and \nkill competitiveness.\n  We need to enforce trade rules with our partners that defend the \nlegitimate interest of U.S. workers. We need to enforce an immigration \npolicy that serves the national interest--the people's interest--and \nprotects jobs for Americans. We need to make our government leaner and \nmore accountable. Our government needs to do more for less just like \ngood businesses and good corporations and good companies are doing all \nover America. We need to do that with our government. That will help \nthe economy.\n  We need to balance the Federal budget, restore the confidence of the \nAmerican people, the world financial community, the vitality and the \nfuture of America, and spare our children from a lifetime of debt.\n  These are all positive steps that are true to our constitutional \nheritage and our legacy of freedom and opportunity. Those are the \nthings we should be doing and we can do. They are all steps that will \ncreate more jobs and more growth without borrowing money, and these are \nall steps that will lift millions out of poverty, and help struggling \nAmericans realize the dream of financial independence.\n  I don't know what the President was thinking when he talked about a \nfew little promise zones--is that what he called them--around the \ncountry. This is somehow going to deal with the unemployment problem in \nAmerica?\n  He announced this today. I haven't had a chance to study it yet, but \nthese are just a few spots on the map of the country. This is not going \nto have any kind of systemic impact on our declining growth and the \nweak recovery we are seeing today. If the recovery doesn't exceed 2 \npercent GDP growth per year, it will not create jobs faster than the \npopulation grows.\n  I am afraid we are not in a good position there. We are not seeing \nthe growth that we had, and experts are predicting slow growth in the \nyears to come. We have to get off the path we are on and get on the \npath to growth, job creation, and prosperity. We have to make sure our \nAmerican citizens are trained, skilled, and moved into good jobs so \nthey can be independent and take care of their families without being \ndependent on the government of the United States.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                       unemployment compensation\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it has been a disappointing week here \nin the Senate. I started out the week feeling pretty good and \noptimistic. I had a major presentation before the Brookings \nInstitution. I talked about the enormous potential in this country for \nenergy production and the fact that we are at the highest level of \nenergy production domestically than we have been in 20 years and what \ngreat prospects we have for that. When we talk about jobs and economic \nopportunity, it is really one of the bright spots out there.\n  Of course, the debate this week has been over unemployment \ncompensation and the extension, initially proposed by the President to \nbe a 3-month extension--an emergency, temporary extension. I was one of \nsix Republicans who came together and said: This is an important \nconversation for us to be having at this particular point in time.\n  As we know, the long-term employment benefits expired on December 28, \n2013. It impacted over 1 million Americans around the country. In my \nhome State of Alaska about 6,500 people lost long-term benefits at the \nend of the year, and it was one of these cold turkey things. Those who \nstill had eligibility for certain benefits were cut off hard. There was \nno tapering down. This is hard.\n  Back here in Washington, DC, we have been living with some pretty \ncold weather. It is cold weather all the time in Alaska at this time of \nthe year. It is hard to be out of work. It is expensive to keep your \nhomes heated. It is expensive to live there, and so I recognize that \nthe safety nets we put in place are important. It is important for us \nto have discussions and debates so we can argue and compromise on the \nissue of long-term employment benefits. That is a conversation we \nshould have. I wanted to have that debate.\n  I wanted the opportunity for full-on amendments so we could bring up \ngood ideas, such as, good ideas about reform and perhaps tying benefits \nto job training, retooling, giving people that opportunity to move \nforward, and debate about how we pay for it. There have been times when \nwe extended long-term unemployment benefits with an offset, and then \nthere have been times\n\n[[Page S216]]\n\nwhen we extended it on an emergency basis with no offset. But let's \ntalk about it, let's debate it, and let's put up some amendments.\n  I was part of that group that really thought we would not only be \nable to talk, but that we would actually be able to weigh in as Members \nrepresenting our States, presenting our ideas, and speaking for our \nconstituents on issues that are very important around the country. \nUsually in a body such as the Senate, actions don't happen unless there \nis an opportunity to vote on issues.\n  So this afternoon when I listened to the majority leader's statement, \nhe said very clearly that we weren't going to have any amendments on \nthe Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act. In fact, his \nwords were: We get nowhere with doing amendments. I find that so \ndisturbing.\n  I have only been in the Senate for 10 years, but what I have seen in \nmy 10 years is a change in the process--a change in an institution \nwhere we are no longer taking the good ideas from this side and the \ngood ideas from the other side through an amendment process--or even \nfrom a committee process for that matter--and building better policy \nbased on the good ideas that we all have.\n  Why would we be afraid to vote on amendments? They may take us a \nlittle bit longer throughout the day to go through. It disrupts our \nschedules. My schedule is to work for the people of Alaska, and if that \nbusiness isn't conducted here through debate and voting, then what is \nit? What is it?\n  I was really quite discouraged after the exchange on the floor \nearlier. Colleagues have worked hard to come up with some good \nproposals. These are not ``gotcha'' amendments as was suggested by the \nmajority leader.\n  I think the proposal of the Senator from Ohio--a proposal that is \nactually contained in the President's budget proposal--was absolutely \nlegitimate. So to suggest that it is an amendment without merit is not \nfair.\n  At the end of the day, don't we judge the merit of an amendment, of \nan idea or of a proposal by presenting it to the body for a vote?\n  If we truly are at that point where we are simply not going to amend \nbills, that we are simply going to vote straight up or down on a bill \nthat has been presented to us--probably not even out of the committee \nprocess but more likely from the majority leader's chambers--that is a \ntough place for us to be as a body. That is not what this process is \nall about.\n  The minority leader reminded us yesterday that we can do better. We \ncan do better as an institution, but we sure didn't demonstrate that \ntoday.\n  I want to work with my colleagues on the issue of unemployment \ncompensation. I want to be able to recognize that compassion that we \nshow for other Americans who are dealing with great difficulty right \nnow. I want to try to move this country forward with policies that are \ngood and strong and create those jobs.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  When I started my comments, I talked about energy production being \nthat bright light. Look at what is happening in the State of North \nDakota where, boy, anybody who wants a job can get one. In fact, they \ncan get two or three jobs.\n  They are ground zero in this type of oil revolution. Their \nunemployment rate was 2.7 percent last October. There has been a lot of \nback-and-forth going on about Keystone and its potential for providing \ndirect jobs, direct and indirect end use jobs around the country--\n42,000 jobs around the country. Wouldn't that be helpful?\n  When we talk about our opportunities in this country, we need to be \nputting in place policies that help advance jobs and job creation and \nthe wealth then that comes with it. We can and must be doing more.\n  One of the areas we need to address is where this administration, in \nmy view, has seen some real policy failures; that is, in restricting \naccess to Federal lands for resource development, blocking and slowing \nthe permitting process. We need to be doing more. The President has \ntouted the gains made in energy production. But I think it is important \nto recognize that most of those gains have been on private and State \nlands. The Presiding Officer and I know there are enormous resources on \nour Federal lands. Let's access them. Let's access them safely and in \nan environmentally responsible way but in a way that is going to help \nour economy, help the job situation in this country. I feel we can do \nso much more. I am hopeful again that we will, in this body, in this \ninstitution, be able to work together to solve some of the issues that \nconfront us. But, again, I am disappointed.\n  I did not come to the floor this evening to talk about the comments \nmade earlier on where we are in the amendment process and not being \nable to advance an amendment process. But my colleagues can tell I care \ndeeply about this institution. I care deeply about our responsibility \nto govern around here. I am not convinced we are governing to our \nability. We need to make some changes, and it only comes when we \nacknowledge that those changes have to come and that cooperation has to \ncome from both sides.\n\n\n                        Emergency Connector Road\n\n  Tonight I come to the floor to talk about a decision that came out of \nthe Department of Interior the day before Christmas Eve. This is a \ndecision that in my view is absolutely unconscionable, and it is a \ndecision that was made by the Secretary of the Interior the afternoon \nof December 23, in which she rejected a medical emergency connector \nroad between two very remote Alaskan communities, the community of King \nCove and Cold Bay.\n  I have thought long and hard about my public comments to my \ncolleagues in the Senate because I have spoken out about this at home \nand I was very direct. I was very direct about my anger, my \ndisappointment, and my frustration. I recognize I have to work with \nfolks in this administration, and when we are talking about the \nSecretary of the Interior, I recognize she is effectively Alaska's \nlandlord. I need to be able to figure out a way to get along with her. \nBut I have to tell my colleagues that this was absolutely a heartless \ndecision by Secretary Jewell. It was a decision that she alone made, \nand it will only serve to endanger the Alaskan Native village residents \nof King Cove.\n  With the decision the Secretary made, she has put the interests of \ncertain environmental groups and the alleged peace and comfort of the \nbirds, the waterfowl in the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge above the \nlives of hundreds of Alaskans, because 950 Alaskans live in King Cove. \nBy the Secretary's act of denying this short road needed to ensure the \npeople of King Cove reliable and safe access to an all-weather airport \nin nearby Cold Bay, Secretary Jewell has effectively turned her back on \nthe Aleut people of western Alaska. She has discarded her duty to \nuphold the trust responsibility the Federal Government owes to its \nNative peoples.\n  The uncle of the Presiding Officer served as Secretary of the \nInterior. He knew full well that trust responsibility. It is a high \ntrust and the Secretary has turned her back on the Native people out in \nKing Cove.\n  To add insult to what could very well be real injury or even death, \nSecretary Jewell did this on the day before Christmas Eve. On the day \nbefore Christmas Eve, I received a voice mail message from the \nSecretary telling me that she later in that afternoon was going to deny \nthe road to King Cove. What was I doing? I was doing the exact same \nthing most of the people around me were doing--we were at the last \nminute getting ready for Christmas. I was in the parking lot of a Fred \nMeyer store going inside to get Scotch tape and wrapping paper.\n\n  The decision made by the Secretary is one that goes beyond building a \n10-mile, one-lane, gravel, noncommercial-use road between King Cove and \nCold Bay. This decision makes clear to us in Alaska that our lives--the \nlives of the people, the human beings who are there--just don't seem to \nmatter to the Secretary. It is clear to me that either she does not \nunderstand or she does not care about the most basic needs of our \nremote residents, and it is quite clear that we have, once again, \nreceived unfair treatment at the hands of our Federal Government.\n  Sometimes it just feels as though those on the outside, whether it is \nthe Federal Government, back here, 4,000 miles away from home, that \nthere is this sense that Alaskans need to be protected from themselves. \nQuite honestly, that is offensive. Quite frankly, I\n\n[[Page S217]]\n\nhave a very hard time believing that if this same situation occurred \nsomewhere in the lower 48, the decision would be the same. The fact is \nwe are out of sight, we are out of mind. There are only 720,000 people \nin Alaska. There are only 950 people, or thereabouts, in King Cove. Who \nis going to be upset? Well, I am upset. I am upset. Not only have the \npeople of King Cove been wronged, but the people of Alaska have been \nwronged. This is not a decision that is going to just go away because \nwe all got caught up in the Christmas holidays. This is not going to be \nsomething the people of Alaska or this Senator will forget, because we \nare not done.\n  I have been to this floor many times--many times--in fact, I think \nthe Presiding Officer has been in the chair on previous occasions--when \nI have come to call attention to this lifesaving road and the land \nexchange that was approved by Congress, signed into law by the \nPresident. I feel as though I have told this story so many times I \ndon't need to remind folks, but I am going to provide a brief \nrefresher.\n  The recent story of King Cove actually started pretty well. Congress \ncame together almost 5 years ago to give the Interior Secretary reason \nand authority to act in the public interest when it comes to providing \naccess. But as is so often the case, this has become yet another \nterrible example of the interests of our people put at risk by their \nown Federal Government. So back in 2009 we passed--I introduced \nlegislation--we passed legislation that proposed to add more than \n56,000 acres of State and tribal land to the Izembek Refuge in exchange \nfor a 206-acre road corridor through a corner of the refuge. Again, I \nwish to repeat the numbers because some people say I must have \nforgotten a zero: In exchange for 56,000 acres of State and tribal \nland, a 206-acre road corridor. In addition to the fact that this is \nbasically a 300-to-1 exchange that was offered, there was agreement \nthat this road would be so limited--so limited as to have an \ninfinitesimally small impact on the refuge. The people of King Cove are \nnot insensitive to the fact that this is a very rich ecosystem out \nthere. This is a very rich area. This is where the birds come through. \nThey have no interest in harming or damaging the refuge.\n  So the agreement was for a one-lane, between 10 and 11 miles long, \ngravel road, severely restricted by law--restricted by law; not just an \nagreement where the mayor says, oh, during my tenure, we are not going \nto use it for commercial purposes. This is in law: noncommercial \npurposes, one-lane, 11-mile-long gravel road. In addition, there were \ngoing to be roping corridors so that if a vehicle is on the road, it \nwouldn't be able to go off the road and onto the refuge and lay tire \nmarks or impact the refuge at all.\n  The Department of Interior EIS clearly showed that the actual acreage \ninside the refuge to be impacted by fill material was just around 2.7 \nacres. Again, think about the exchange. They are giving up 56,000 acres \nin exchange for a 206-acre road corridor and, of that, the impact by \nfill material is just about 2.7 acres. So consider also that the \nexchange would have added 2,300 acres of eelgrass beds to the refuge.\n  This is prime habitat and feed for the black brant, and this was \nsomething that clearly Secretary Jewell felt was very valuable because \nshe chose to place higher value on those black brants than she did on \nhuman and wildlife values. That 2,300 acres, then, is about 20 times \nmore than the eelgrass that the EIS said might have been impacted by \nerosion as a result of the road. So the rejection of this exchange just \ndumbfounds me. I don't understand it.\n  The State of Alaska and the local tribal groups were willing to give \nup 56,000 acres of land. Keep in mind, these are lands that were given \nto them under the Native Land Claims Settlement Act. These lands \nrepresent who they are, and they are willing to give up 56,000 acres of \nit for a lousy one-lane, 11-mile gravel, noncommercial-use road. That \nis how much this road meant to them, because it was more than a road. \nIt was a lifesaving connector. It was a way for them to get to an all-\nweather airport, the second longest runway in the State of Alaska that \nwas built during World War II; an amazing runway, actually, that isn't \nencumbered by the topography and the weather as the King Cove Airport \nis.\n  So you have a people who are desperate for a solution, so desperate \nfor their solution that they are willing to give up their lands. The \nmost prized thing the Native people have in our State are the lands \naround them, and they are willing to exchange them for a small road \ncorridor--a 300 to 1 exchange--and the proposed land that would have \nbeen provided to the Federal Government is pristine land that is \nvaluable for the waterfowl, for the wildlife, certainly would enhance \nand benefit the refuge.\n  But Secretary Jewell said no to this. She said no to this 300 to 1 \nexchange--an exchange that would enhance the habitat for the birds she \nwants to protect. It really makes you wonder: Has there ever been such \na lopsided land exchange that has been rejected by the Federal \nGovernment?\n  The former head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Dale Hall, was \nthe one who largely picked the lands and had approved of this exchange \nback in 2006--long before this legislation was ever introduced. So the \nFederal agencies, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the head of the \nFish and Wildlife Service had looked at all this and said: OK, in order \nto get this corridor, there is going to have to be some exchange, so \nlet's figure out what it is going to be. He gave his blessing to that \nback in 2006.\n  But what this does speak to is how strongly Alaskans feel about \nprotecting the health and safety of our residents, and rightly so. I \nwould submit to you, Mr. President, if Secretary Jewell and the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service truly had--truly had--the best interests of \nboth the human residents and the birds of the Izembek Refuge in mind, \nthey would have recognized that adding 56,000 acres, while taking out \njust 206 acres--and, then again, of that, the amount that would have \nactually been impacted by fill is 2.7 acres--I think they would provide \nfar greater benefit to the refuge than any small, single-lane, gravel, \nnoncommercial road ever possibly could subtract.\n  The legislation directed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to \nconduct an EIS for the road. So the 2009 legislation that passed the \nHouse, that passed the Senate, that was signed into law by the \nPresident, directed Fish and Wildlife to conduct an EIS. That agency \nprepared a faulty EIS. They failed to adhere to the underlying law, \nchoosing a ``no action'' alternative and failing to adequately account \nfor health and human safety when selecting the preferred alternative. \nThis is more evidence of systematic disregard for the well-being of the \nAleut who have lived in this region for thousands of years.\n  I also want to touch very briefly upon Interior's trust \nresponsibility to Alaska Native peoples. The Assistant Secretary for \nIndian Affairs, Kevin Washburn, went to King Cove. He visited. He \nactually spent 2 days there. In fact, they actually had some pretty \nstinky weather when he was there, and I think he saw firsthand what the \nresidents of King Cove deal with in getting in and out. The Assistant \nSecretary wrote a report for Secretary Jewell. It was not made public \nuntil after the Secretary announced her decision, which I think was \nunfortunate. But again, back to the trust responsibility--the \nresponsibility that the Federal Government has to protect the health \nand safety of Native Americans.\n  But here you have the Fish and Wildlife Service, you have Assistant \nSecretary Washburn, and now, finally, Secretary Jewell, who had the \nopportunity to encourage or actually make a decision that would improve \nthe lives of the residents of King Cove. They turned their backs on \nthese people, and they diminished the hopes of these first peoples.\n  The EIS, which recommended no action--no action--to help the people \nof King Cove has a clear negative impact on the health and safety of \nAlaska Natives who live in that village. The official report that was \nprepared by Mr. Washburn regarding his visit to King Cove, I believe, \nwas inadequate--wholly inadequate--and, quite frankly, very weak.\n  He, the Assistant Secretary, is viewed as a leading legal scholar on \nNative trust responsibility. I truly have high hopes for him because I \nbelieve that his heart clearly is in that right place. But his report \nfalls woefully short of his duty to the Aleut people, and I expected \nmore of him--truly\n\n[[Page S218]]\n\nI did--and I know the people of King Cove deserve better.\n  The health and safety of the people of King Cove is not some \nspeculative issue. We are not just talking about, oh, the weather is \nbad there or somebody might get hurt. The fact of the matter is that \nsince 1980, 18 people have died, and they have died because of medevac \ndelays or because of the dangers connected with the medevac flights out \nof the fishing village.\n  It is not easy to get in and out of King Cove. They have an airstrip, \nyes, they do, but they are surrounded on three sides by mountains, and \na valley on one and the ocean on another. The Coast Guard describes \nmedevacs into King Cove as one of the more frightening, more \nchallenging operations that the Coast Guard is tasked to do. You might \nsay, why is the Coast Guard doing medevacs? Well, because medevac \nflights from Anchorage--some 600 miles away--cannot get in. They say: \nThe risk to us to fly in for somebody who is in the midst of a \ndifficult labor and needs to get out to the nearest hospital--which is \nAnchorage, 600 miles away--is too great or we are not willing to risk \nour lives. So whom do you call? You call the Coast Guard.\n  In 2012, the Coast Guard was called in, I believe, five times, at a \ncost of up to $210,000 to the taxpayers per trip, to bring in a crew to \nmedevac that individual out. So if you can fly in--if the Coast Guard \nis able to do it, they will be there. But, in the meantime, you have \nhad people die, and you have had planes crash.\n  If you cannot get out, the alternative is--because there is no road; \nthere is no 10-mile, one-lane, gravel, noncommercial-use connector \nroad--you can go across the water. Think about it. If the weather is \nbad enough up in the air, think about what it is doing down in that \nocean. It is pretty tough.\n  So you can come across the water for hours in 15-, 20-foot seas, but \nthen, once you get over to Cold Bay, it is not like they can just load \nyou into a nice airplane on the runway there. You have to get docked, \nand up off the dock to get to the airport.\n  The fact of the matter is King Cove and Cold Bay--it is a little bit \nrustic out there. What is in this picture I have in the Chamber is \nprobably a little difficult to see. This is the top of the dock at \nnight. This is about a 20-foot drop to the ocean here. You have metal \nladders that you climb up, if you are able. But if you are able, you \nprobably do not need to be medevaced out. A person with a heart \ncondition, how is he climbing up this metal ladder--as the waves are \ncrashing against him in the dark and in the wind? What you are seeing \nhere is basically a sled that has been hoisted up on a crane, swinging \naround in the wind in the dark.\n\n  I do not have the picture here of the elder who had suffered a heart \ncondition and could not make it up the steps. They could not hoist him \nup. They put him in a crab pot and hauled him up by crane on to the top \nof the dock so that they could then take him to the airport, where he \nwas safely evacuated out and made it to Anchorage.\n  As I say, when we are talking about the health and safety of the \npeople of King Cove, it is not speculative. People are dying. People \nhave died. People are afraid to fly. The testimony that the Secretary \nheard, that my colleagues have heard--as the people of King Cove have \ncome back, they have said: Enough.\n  The Secretary, in her visit to King Cove in August, stood before the \nschoolchildren there at an assembly--and she is very good with \nchildren, and it was good to watch the exchange--but those children \nspoke up to her and told her why they needed a road out of King Cove. \nTo hear a child say: We need a road so that I am not afraid to fly and \nbecause I don't want anyone to die. This is an issue, again, where the \nstories we have heard, the Secretary has heard--because I was there \nwith her; we heard the stories together--they are heartwrenching. They \nbring tears to your eyes. The people, the families who have lived with \nthis have been devastated. The Secretary heard all this, and yet it \nseems that she has just chosen to ignore the voices of those children, \nthe stories of those elders, the pictures of an elder being hauled up \nin a crab pot so he can make a medevac to Anchorage.\n  I want my colleagues to know here in the Senate, as well as the \nadministration, that I am not going to let this issue die. There is a \nsimple reason why. Because I am not willing to let anyone in King Cove \nsuffer or die because they do not have emergency access out of their \nvillage.\n  This decision rested squarely on the shoulders of Secretary Jewell, \nwho then announced this devastating news only hours before Christmas \nEve--a heartless decision delivered at a heartless time. The Secretary \nsaid to me that there is no good time to deliver bad news, and I would \nagree. But the timing of this decision was solely hers. There was no \ndeadline within which she had to act. She chose to announce it on \nMonday afternoon, at 3 p.m., Washington, DC time, knowing that everyone \nwas going to be skating out of here for the holidays, hoping that \neveryone was going to be distracted with their family events, hoping \nthat no one was going to be watching. She knew that the people of King \nCove would be upset. She knew that I would be upset--but less than a \nthousand people, she thinks. That is not how you do things. It is not \nhow you do things.\n  The people of King Cove are without hope right now for one reason; \nand that is because of this decision from the Secretary. I have come \nhere to tell the Senate what happened to them in what was supposed to \nbe--what was supposed to be--a season of joy and celebration. I \ntruthfully cannot use strong enough words to show the depth of my anger \nfor this decision.\n  I cannot fathom why she came to it, why she was willing to sign her \nname to it. But I, for one, never thought that we would see a day \nwhere, under the guise of making a public interest determination, a \nCabinet Secretary would so blatantly disregard the public's health and \nsafety. But we have.\n  So the question now is, does it stand? Are we going to do what we \nknow is right and make sure that those who live in King Cove are \nprotected? I have my answer. I am going to stand in solidarity with the \npeople of King Cove and others in Alaska and across the country whose \nwell-being is put at risk by misguided government decisions, devoid of \nproper balance between human and wildlife considerations.\n  I have not yet identified every opportunity I may have to draw \nattention to, resist, and seek redress from Secretary Jewell's bad \ndecision.\n  An obvious and perhaps an easy step would be to introduce yet another \nbill. But I am not willing to concede that the last word has been \nspoken on the law, the law we enacted in 2009. That law passed after a \ngreat deal of effort. There was debate. There was significant \ncompromise as I have outlined. But that was a law we had all \nnegotiated. I do not believe that law has been properly implemented. \nWho knows how and whether the courts may address that injustice.\n  A messaging bill might get some attention. But I am concerned that \nits immediate consequence may be to legitimize in the eyes of many a \nbad decision we should be fighting rather than accepting. I think the \npeople of King Cove deserve better.\n  The Department of Interior needs more balance. The U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service needs better direction. I am not ruling out any \npossible remedy. In this case, Alaskans have been made the victim. But \nI think that all Americans are at risk from this kind of unbalanced \ndecisionmaking. I pledge to my colleagues and my constituents that I am \ngoing to keep fighting for what is right, both morally and legally.\n  This fight is not over. Again, the attention is drawn to the \nresidents of King Cove and a small connector road in a very remote part \nof our country. But I do think it is emblematic of the bigger struggle, \nthe bigger fight we are seeing as a State with our own agencies, with \nour own Federal Government.\n  I have taken a great deal of time this evening. I appreciate the \nPresiding Officer's attention as I have made my case. I am certain the \nadministration is listening to my words as well. As I indicated at the \noutset, in Alaska we have no choice but to figure out how we deal with \nour agencies because they consume, they occupy so much of how we are \neven able to move forward as a State. I will continue to do what I can \nto work with this administration in a manner that is going to benefit \nthe people whom I work for. But I will always put the health and safety \nand best interests of Alaskans first.\n\n[[Page S219]]\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         unemployment insurance\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today has been an eventful day on the \nunemployment compensation front. We began the day working with \nRepublican colleagues to put together what we thought was an amendment \nthey would join us in pushing forward. But surprisingly and \ndisappointingly to me, those whom we worked with were unable to join on \nthe amendment.\n  I am disappointed for a number of reasons, not the least of which is \nwe gave the Republicans what they wanted. It is entirely paid for. The \namendment made structural reforms in the unemployment compensation \nbill, which is something they said they wanted. The amendment includes \na proposal, much like that advocated by Senator Portman, that would \nprevent people from collecting both unemployment insurance and \ndisability insurance at the same time.\n  Our amendment includes an offset that is Paul Ryan's offset. It was \nthe same thing we used in the Murray-Ryan budget agreement this body \nsupported a few weeks ago.\n  So it is totally paid for with something Paul Ryan suggested and we \nadopted a short period of time ago. It makes structural reforms they \nsaid they wanted--maybe not all of them, but it made structural \nreforms. It is hard to understand why they cannot take yes for an \nanswer. Maybe it is because they do not want the legislation passed. It \nis possible.\n  But I have not given up. I have discussions with a number of \nRepublican colleagues this evening. They said they are going to try to \ncome up with something else. I certainly hope that is the case. We need \nto understand that there are 1.4 million Americans hurting. It is hard \nfor me to comprehend why something that meets the outlines of what we \nunderstood they wanted is not good enough.\n  Maybe they do not like it because it does not give them an \nopportunity to--I withdraw that. I think we have had enough talk here \ntoday. I am not going to add to that. All I wish to close the Senate \nwith tonight is it is very unfortunate for a lot of people who are \ntruly hurting.\n  It is paid for with something that is certainly standard around here. \nWe won't be able to use that anymore. States won't be able to use the \nsame money anymore, but it doesn't affect the budget in any way. It \ndoesn't raise the deficit one penny. It sounds as if it is a very good \ndeal to help 1.4 million people.\n  Explain to somebody who is on long-term unemployment in the State of \nColorado, State of Illinois, State of anyplace, and they will say they \ndidn't vote for this because they didn't get to offer unlimited \namendments, even though there was a proposal that wouldn't run up the \ndeficit one penny. It was all paid for. It is hard for me to comprehend \nthat. We could explain it to someone, but it is their job to explain \nit, not mine. My explanation is that it is something the American \npeople want, need, and should have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/09/senate-section/article/S219-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, as the U.S. mission in Afghanistan winds \ndown this year, one thing can be said with certainty: The dedication \nand service our men and women in uniform is unparalleled. It will truly \nbe with the thanks of a grateful nation that our troops will finally \nwithdraw from Afghanistan by year's end.\n  This weekend, that appreciation will be front and center in Vermont, \nwhen the 3rd Battalion, 172nd Infantry Regiment, Mountain, will receive \nthe Valorous Unit Award for extraordinary heroism in action, against an \narmed enemy of the United States, during their 2010 deployment to \nAfghanistan. The Mountain Battalion, as they are known, led Task Force \nAvalanche in Paktia, a province in western Afghanistan, and they were \nresponsible for security in an area the size of Delaware so that aid \nand development efforts could go forward.\n  In the best tradition of the ever ready Green Mountain Boys, the \nMountain Battalion knows a thing or two about operating in mountainous \nterrain. They are the only unit in the U.S. Army specifically designed \nto neutralize the enemy in a mountainous terrain--expertise that proved \ninvaluable as they supported seven forward operating bases and combat \noutposts spread throughout the mountains of Paktia. Upon their arrival \nin 2010, in advance of the parliamentary elections, they found many \nunsecure roads and zones. The men and women of the Mountain Battalion \nhelped to neutralize supply lines and occupied formerly safe zones to \nprovide a level of security during the election that increased voter \nturnout in those districts by 15 percent. In large part because of \ntheir efforts, Paktia province held the distinction of being the only \nprovince that cycle with zero civilian casualties during the election.\n  Throughout their deployment, the men and women of Task Force \nAvalanche formed close partnerships with their counterparts in the \nAfghan National Security Force, living and operating together. They \ncredit success in increasing proficiency and dedication of these forces \nin Paktia to the close relationship they forged. When the area of \noperations was hit hard by flooding, it was the Mountain Battalion and \ntheir Afghan partners who were there to respond for the civilians \nfacing devastation. They even dispatched a platoon across the border to \nPakistan to help flood victims--a border more often in the news for the \ncrossing of foreign fighters and the Haqqani Network. The Task Force \ntrained more than 50 Afghan National Army medics, who in turn provided \ncare to U.S. personnel as well. These medics are just one part of the \nlasting contribution left by the Mountain Battalion in Paktia.\n  Also remaining in Afghanistan as a testament to their valor are 2 \nschools, 4 mosques, a community center, and 22 other projects. The \nMountain Battalion is estimated to have contributed $700,000 into the \nlocal economy in money and jobs, and it is further estimated that \nalmost 30,000 Afghans were beneficiaries of humanitarian assistance \nalone after the floods. Despite having been one of the most chaotic \nprovinces in Afghanistan, our Green Mountain Boys left Paktia a better \nplace for the people who live there, and they did so in partnership \nwith the people who live there.\n  Through 5 months in Paktia, these men and women led 4,300 combat \npatrols, 9 air assault operations, and 65 named operations. A total of \n600 individuals were awarded combat badges, 26 individuals were awarded \nthe Purple Heart, and, tragically, 2 of these brave soldiers sacrificed \ntheir lives. Those who returned home brought with them the wisdom and \nexperience of their deployment. As a Vermonter, I could not be more \nproud of these men and women. They and the mission they so ably \nperformed help define what valor means.\n  Importantly, this incredible unit is a National Guard unit. Made up \nof citizen soldiers from Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire, the men and \nwomen of the 3rd Battalion, 172nd Infantry Regiment, Mountain returned \nfrom their distinguished service and went back to their jobs and their \nneighborhoods throughout Vermont and New England. This story was \nduplicated repeatedly in Afghanistan and also in Iraq. Because of \nsoldiers like these, today's National Guard is a ready and reliable \ncomponent of America's fighting force, indistinguishable on the \nbattlefield from their Active Duty counterparts, and trusted with \nessential missions.\n  I congratulate the Mountain Battalion of the Vermont National Guard \non the Valorous Unit Award. You make us proud. You have given us and \nyou have renewed and built upon an incredible legacy.\n\n[[Page S220]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/09/senate-section/article/S220-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LOIS McCLURE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommemorate the outstanding achievements of Ms. Lois McClure, voted the \n2013 Vermonter of the Year by The Burlington Free Press.\n  I am honored to count Lois among my closest friends. Marcelle and I \nare constantly inspired by her deep and sustained commitment to Vermont \nand to those of us who call it home.\n  As I have worked in public service, I have often looked for guidance \nin the breadth and depth of Lois McClure's philanthropic work. Year \nafter year, Lois has found just the right points of leverage for her \nwork to make Vermont a better place.\n  Lois McClure continues to build on a legacy of support for the arts, \ncultural and historic preservation, and environmental conservation, and \nyet her most meaningful work may be the help that she has provided \nVermonters confronting serious medical problems. Whether or not they \nrecognize it, many, many Vermonters have Lois in their corner as they \nfight back against cancer and other serious illness.\n  The Leahy Center for Lake Champlain, the Lake Champlain Maritime \nMuseum, the Visiting Nurses Association, the American Cancer Society of \nVermont, Fletcher Allen Health Care, and many other Vermont \ninstitutions are able to better serve Vermonters today because of \nLois's commitment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article \nabout this exceptional Vermonter who has dedicated her life to \nimproving her community and the lives of those around her.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Dec. 31, 2013]\n\n                2013 Vermonter of the Year: Lois McClure\n\n       The true measure of an act of philanthropy can be taken in \n     the lasting impact of what the initial donation set in \n     motion.\n       Years after the act of giving, the efforts and institutions \n     Lois McClure has chosen to support continue their good work.\n       McClure's engagement reflects a broad range, many with a \n     common theme a focus on building a better life for people of \n     all ages in her community.\n       For her life-long commitment to enriching people's lives in \n     ways big and small, the Burlington Free Press editorial board \n     names philanthropist Lois McClure 2013 Vermonter of the Year.\n       Over the years, McClure has built a legacy of generosity \n     and caring, started decades ago with her late husband, J. \n     Warren ``Mac'' McClure, former owner of the Burlington Free \n     Press who sold the newspaper to the Gannett Co. in 1971.\n       The McClure name can be seen on buildings throughout \n     Burlington and the surrounding area speaking to the long \n     record of giving for which this couple has long been known in \n     this community.\n       Lois McClure carried on the work after her husband's death \n     in 2004, and clearly made her own mark on her friends and \n     neighbors, as well as people who may never have heard her \n     name. These are just some of McClure's good works.\n       She continues to serve as a director of the J. Warren and \n     Lois McClure Foundation founded in 1995, which focuses on \n     improving access for Vermonters to higher education and life-\n     long learning.\n       She is a major benefactor of the ECHO Lake Aquarium and \n     Science Center--Leahy Center for Lake Champlain on the \n     Burlington waterfront, a wonderland to children, especially, \n     who explore what lies beneath the waters of the lake.\n       The Lake Champlain Maritime Museum named its schooner Lois \n     McClure in honor of her support for the effort to build a \n     replica of a sailing canal boat that plied the Broad Lake in \n     the early 1860s.\n       McClure, along with her husband, have long been \n     enthusiastic supporters of the Shelburne Museum, and she has \n     made generous gifts to organizations ranging from the \n     Burlington Community Land Trust to the Vermont Historical \n     Society.\n       Following a $1 million donation to the Visiting Nurse \n     Association in 2006, McClure told the Free Press, ``I get a \n     kick out of donating money and seeing that money make a \n     difference.'' Yet among all her giving, the realization of a \n     temporary home for cancer patients and their families who are \n     receiving treatment at near-by Fletcher Allen Health Care \n     perhaps became McClure's signature project.\n       The American Cancer Society's Hope Lodge opened in \n     Burlington in 2008, named the Lois McClure-Bee Tabakin \n     Building in honor of McClure and her long-time friend who \n     each lost a daughter to cancer.\n       The call for nominations for Vermonter of the Year asked \n     readers to ``Think of someone who has made a difference this \n     year or through a lifetime of work; someone who stepped up in \n     a time of need or proved to be a leader; someone whose acts \n     or accomplishments embodied the best of Vermont.''\n       McClure has been nominated by readers many times over the \n     years. In 2006, Jane Osborne McKnight wrote in a particularly \n     telling nominating letter, ``I have never met Lois, but have \n     admired her good works for many years. . . . She has \n     personally enriched our cultural life in Vermont and \n     furthered our understanding of Vermont history. These are \n     good deeds that will be felt, undoubtedly, for many \n     generations.''\n       McClure has lived a life that embodies the best qualities \n     of a Vermonter who looks out for her neighbor and lives for \n     the betterment of her community.\n       The Burlington Free Press' imminent departure from the \n     College Street building it has occupied since the 1830s \n     creates an appropriate occasion to give McClure the applause \n     she deserves. The paper once owned by McClure's family is \n     moving soon into new quarters on Bank Street.\n       McClure has built a legacy of making a real difference to \n     many people.\n       The Burlington Free Press names Lois McClure--a friend to \n     Vermonters, today and for generations to come--2013 Vermonter \n     of the Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/09/senate-section/article/S220-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n              Chief Warrant Officer Two Randy L.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize Hockey Week in \nFairbanks, a terrific annual celebration that takes place every winter. \nIt has become so popular it will run for 10 days, from January 31 to \nFebruary 9, 2014. During our long Alaskan winters, we welcome \nentertainment that celebrations like this offer and the outdoor and \nindoor activity that hockey represents.\n  Ice hockey has long been a popular sport all over Alaska, with \nleagues that run all year for players of all age groups. Due to the \ncommitment and interest of players, coaches, and boosters, a Fairbanks \nHockey Hall of Fame was established to honor those who helped develop \nthe sport in Interior Alaska. Because of the foresight and enthusiasm \nof the hall's board, they also sponsor hockey week.\n  The activities during 2014 hockey week are varied. There is the \npopular ``Wear Your Jersey to School Day,'' tournaments for youth, puck \nshooting, a contest for the best backyard rink, ice sculptures with \nhockey themes, and much more. Typical of the civic spirit of the \norganizers and partisans, they sponsor reading programs in elementary \nschools and conduct blood donation drives as well, during the week.\n  This year, the organizers have attracted a major exhibit. The \noutreach program of the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto will send \nartifacts from its collection to be on display in Fairbanks and, later, \nin Anchorage. Fans will see jerseys, sticks, skates, and many other \nitems belonging to some of the greats who have played professionally.\n  Each year, the celebration seems to top the previous year's. One of \nthe reasons it does is because of the major force behind the event: \nRandy Zarnke, the president of the Fairbanks Hockey Hall of Fame. The \nyear after he wrote a book about Fairbanks hockey pioneers in 2005, he \nstarted this remarkable celebration. I am happy to add my thanks for \nhis leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/09/senate-section/article/S220-4", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S220-S221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MARIE AND JOHN NOLAN\n\n Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Marie and \nJohn ``Jack'' Nolan of Lincoln, NE, on their 70th wedding anniversary. \nTheir commitment to one another and their devotion to family and faith \nare an inspiration.\n  Jack Nolan and Marie Barrett met in Pennington, NJ, where Jack and \nMarie's brothers were classmates at Pennington Prep School. Jack and\n\n[[Page S221]]\n\nMarie became friends and then started to date. They kept dating as Jack \nleft for college to play center for Temple University's football team \nin Philadelphia, PA. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, \n1941, and the U.S. entrance into the war, Jack volunteered for Army Air \nForces Aviation. In an instant, Jack was no longer playing football for \nTemple but, rather, beginning his primary training in San Antonio, \nTexas.\n  Jack's move to San Antonio would be the first of many moves to \nfollow. After completing flight school and additional trainings, he was \nsent to B-25 bomber school in Greenville, SC. During this time, Jack \nand Marie wrote letters and remained devoted to one another. Jack knew \nthat he would soon be sent overseas to fight in World War II, but he \nhad one last thing to do at home: marry Marie. Marie travelled on a \ntroop train to Greenville, SC, and married Jack on January 6, 1944. \nThree weeks later, Jack was sent to fight in New Guinea.\n  After his service in New Guinea, Jack and Marie were moved to Pampa, \nTX, and then to Enid, OK, where he taught others to fly the B-25 \nbombers. World War II ended while they were living in Enid. After the \nwar, Jack remained in the Air Force, continuing his service to our \ngreat Nation. I am told that Marie and Jack like to reminisce about \ntheir more than 20 moves throughout his military career. They lived in \nnumerous places across the United States, and Jack spent more than a \nyear in Japan. Marie's support of Jack and his military service was \nunwavering. She remained focused on her husband, faith, and growing \nfamily.\n  His last assignment was at Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base in Kansas \nCity, MO. After his retirement from the Air Force in the early 1960s, \nMarie and Jack remained in Kansas City. Jack coordinated emergency \npreparedness for the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Marie served \nas a church secretary at St. Elizabeth Catholic Church in Kansas City. \nThey called Kansas City home for 30 years.\n  Since 1990, they have lived in Lincoln, NE. Being active in their \nchurch and community and helping others has always been of great \nimportance to them. Marie and Jack have been blessed with four \nchildren, six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. The family \nhas shared that they are grateful for Jack and Marie's relentless love, \nexample of faith in action, and encouragement. Their partnership as \nhusband and wife sets a great example for others to follow. \nCongratulations to Marie and Jack on seventy years of marriage. May God \nbless them always.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/09/senate-section/article/S221-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING RICHARD E. GUTTING\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a man \nwho, although not a constituent, was very important to my State. \nRichard E. Gutting Jr., who died on Christmas Eve, spent over 40 years \nworking in and for the commercial seafood industry. As many of my \ncolleagues are aware, the seafood harvesting and processing industry is \nthe largest private sector employer in Alaska. The seafood industry is \ncrucial to the economic health of Alaska and employs more than 63,000 \nworkers in my State, and overall Alaska's fisheries support over \n165,000 American jobs.\n  The successful development and growth of the modern U.S. seafood \nindustry is the result of the hard work of many individuals, and Dick \nplayed an important role in many key areas. He was recognized as the \nforemost U.S. expert on seafood safety and trade policies, and he \ncontinued to dedicate his time and energy to the seafood industry right \nuntil the weeks before he passed, publishing a daily update on seafood \ntrade developments.\n  Dick's long career in both government and the private sector \ncoincided with a period of rapid development and expansion of my \nState's seafood industry. In the 1960s we were focused mostly on salmon \nand watched as foreign fleets took a wide variety of marine resources \nfrom the waters off our shores. The passage of the Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act--now the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act--on which Dick provided advice and counsel, was a \ncrucial step in allowing U.S. citizens to utilize the fisheries \nresources just off our shores. His work at the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, NOAA, at the National Fisheries Institute, \nNFI, and in private law practice helped not just Alaskans but the \nseafood industry throughout the country.\n  During his long tenure at NFI, Dick frequently testified before \nCongress on issues of great importance to the Nation's commercial \nseafood industry. His legal and policy insights, combined with his calm \ndemeanor, made him a valued advisor to ocean policy leaders such as \nSenator Ted Stevens, Congressman Don Young, and my father, Senator \nFrank Murkowski, as they crafted legislation necessary to develop U.S. \nfisheries while also promoting the consumption of seafood. He also \nhelped mentor an entire generation of both governmental and private \nsector policy leaders in the commercial seafood industry. Many of those \npeople are now in significant positions in government, academia and the \nprivate sector, and they continue to benefit from what they learned \nfrom Dick.\n  Above all, Dick loved seafood, and he loved to share his passion for \npromoting seafood throughout the country and the world. That is \nsomething that as an Alaskan I understand very well, and I appreciate \nhis contributions to my State and to the country.\n  Although Dick is no longer with us, we are left with his many \ncontributions to the responsible growth of the domestic seafood \nindustry. Our system of fishery management and our robust global trade \nin seafood products have in many ways been shaped by Dick's four \ndecades of work. These professional achievements, combined with the \nlove and admiration of family and friends, form a legacy that anyone \nwould be proud to leave behind.

A bill to establish congressional trade negotiating \nobjectives and enhanced consultation requirements for trade \nnegotiations, to provide for consideration of trade agreements, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, 52 years ago, in 1962, President John \nKennedy signed the Trade Expansion Act into law. At the signing he \nspoke about the importance of trade to the United States and its \npartners abroad, on how it helps secure our preeminence in a global \neconomy.\n  Here is what he said:\n\n       We now have the means to make certain that we build our \n     strength together and that we can maintain this preeminence.\n\n  His words still ring true today. International trade is a cornerstone \nof our economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, my friend from Montana is absolutely \nright. International trade is crucial to America's economy. Last year \nexports supported 9.8 million American jobs, including 25 percent of \nall manufacturing jobs.\n  Jobs created through trade are good jobs. On average, U.S. plants \nthat export overseas pay their workers up to 18 percent more than \nnonexporting plants. They increase employment 2 to 4 percent faster \nthan nonexporting plants. But we can do even better.\n  More than 95 percent of the world's population and 80 percent of the \nworld's purchasing power is outside of the United States. To succeed in \ntoday's world, our farmers, ranchers, and job creators must be able to \nfairly access the world market.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I hope everyone listened to my good friend's words. He \nmade very important points about statistics that I think most Americans \nare unaware of, and if they would think about it more, they would \nrealize the importance of trade.\n  We export so much more now. Exporting is such a large percent of our \neconomy and offers such good-paying jobs that, frankly, I am perplexed \nmore Americans don't want to work harder to get trade agreements passed \nso we can export more and get more good-paying jobs in America.\n  I must say that today we have a bold plan to strengthen our trade \nties with\n\n[[Page S225]]\n\nnations across the Pacific and in Europe.\n  What is our goal? Our goal is to seize new export opportunities so \nthat we can boost our economy and create jobs here at home. We all know \nthe big to-and-fro here with unemployment insurance. The key is to have \nfewer people unemployed. How does that happen? More good-paying jobs.\n  But there is a big first step we need to take before we can act on \nour trade agenda. What is that? It is Trade Promotion Authority, \notherwise known as TPA.\n  That is why this afternoon Senator Hatch and I introduced the \nBipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2014.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Our bill will help guarantee these landmark trade deals \nget done--and get done right.\n  First, the bill updates TPA by addressing 21st century issues. What \nare these issues? Nonscientific barriers to U.S. agricultural products, \nunfair competition from state-owned enterprises, arbitrary localization \nbarriers which require U.S. companies to turn over their intellectual \nproperty or locate facilities in a foreign country in order to access \nforeign markets, and unnecessary restrictions on digital trade and data \nwhich flows across borders.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is right. Our bill also addresses critical issues \nsuch as labor, environment, and innovation and for the first time \ncurrency manipulation. Our bill addresses it.\n  Senator Hatch and I worked with our good friend from the other body, \nthe Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, to carefully craft \nthese negotiating objectives and ensure that Congress is a full partner \nin trade negotiations.\n  Our bill helps lay out in clear terms what Congress's priorities are \nfor trade. It is our opportunity to tell the administration and our \npartners overseas what we must see in an agreement if it is going to be \napproved by Congress.\n  It boosts congressional oversight, increases transparency in trade \nnegotiations, and it gives every Member of Congress the right to a \nstrong voice in the process.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I want to praise the distinguished \nchairman of the Ways and Means Committee over in the House. He has \nworked long and hard on these issues and is not only a great partner to \nthe two of us but to every Senator.\n  What the Senator from Montana just said is absolutely right. Our bill \nempowers Congress, but it also empowers our negotiators. Its approval \nwill help them conclude high-standard agreements that will open new \nmarkets for U.S. exports, ultimately bringing jobs and economic growth \nto the United States.\n  Lastly, before I turn back to the chairman, I just want to say again \nhow critical this legislation is for our Nation and to commend my \nfriend from Montana, the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, for working to make Trade Promotion Authority a reality. He \nhas always been a tremendous leader on international trade, and I am \nglad to stand by his side to ensure that the Finance Committee and the \nSenate considers this job-creating legislation in a fair, thorough, and \nexpeditious manner.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I thank very much my good friend from \nUtah. As President Kennedy said 52 years ago, this is about working \nwith our trade partners to build strength together. It is about \nmaintaining U.S. preeminence. That is why TPA is so important--because \nit makes our job-creating trade agenda work, and it helps to secure our \nfuture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am happy to be on the floor to hear the \nnews from Senator Hatch and Senator Baucus that they have reached an \nagreement on trade promotion authority. I wish to congratulate them on \nthat, working with Chairman Camp on the House side.\n  This is incredibly important. These two Senators have worked closely \ntogether, as Republican and Democrat, over the last few months with the \nadministration to put in place the opportunity for American workers, \nAmerican farmers, and American service providers to be able to sell \ntheir goods and their services on a level playing field by opening more \nmarkets for U.S. products. I congratulate them. It is sad to me that \nfor the past 5 or 6 years we haven't had trade promotion authority, and \nwithout their strong efforts we still wouldn't have it today.\n  It has been noted that this administration, the Obama administration, \nis the first one since FDR not to have asked for even the ability to \nopen these markets through what is called trade promotion authority and \nits predecessors until last March. So until last spring they hadn't \neven asked for it. They did ask for it, and thanks to the hard work of \nthese two Senators and Congressman Camp, we are now going to have that \nopportunity. This gives our workers, our farmers, and our service \nproviders the ability to access these markets Senator Baucus and \nSenator Hatch spoke about.\n  It is critical to economic growth. If we look at the growth in the \nlast two or three recoveries, much of it was because of expanding \nexports. We all believe the current level of economic growth is \ndisappointing. It is anemic growth. We are looking at long-term \nunemployment being at historic levels, as we have spoken about on the \nfloor all week. One solution, clearly, is for the United States to do \nmore exporting, and we can't do that without trade promotion authority.\n  I speak as a former U.S. Trade Representative who had the honor of \ntraveling the world representing our great country. I will tell my \ncolleagues, when we got down to the negotiating across the table with \nanother country in terms of how to knock down both tariff and nontariff \nbarriers to trade, if they didn't know there was an ability with an up-\nor-down vote to get that trade agreement done in the U.S. Congress with \nsomething like trade promotion authority, they would not have put their \nlast and best offer on the table. That is a reality.\n  Our system is different from most systems in countries around the \nworld. We have to have trade promotion authority--that has been our \nexperience--in order to get these trade agreements done to help knock \ndown barriers to the people in the United States who make the best \nproducts in the world, who provide the best services in the world and \nare just looking for a fair shake and a level playing field.\n  So these two Senators, by doing this today, have opened up the \npossibility now for us to have trade agreements that give us the \nopportunity to grow our economy and create, as they both said, good-\npaying jobs and good benefits, and I congratulate them for that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, will my colleague from Ohio yield?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I am happy to yield to my colleague and ranking member \nfrom Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to compliment the distinguished \nSenator because he served as the US Trade Representative. He traveled \nall over the world. He understands how important these issues are. He \nunderstands that without TPA, we wouldn't be able to get these \nparticular trade agreements done. He understands how hard we have \nworked to try to come up with language we could all accept in spite of \nsome of the proclivities of this administration.\n  He worked diligently with both sides of the aisle on these issues as \nthe U.S. Trade Representative and continues to as a member of the \nSenate Finance Committee. I am so grateful we have him on the Senate \nFinance Committee, with all of his knowledge and his experience, to be \nable to help us on these particular issues.\n  I was a little nonplussed last week when one of the leading trade \nunion presidents in this country got on television and was decrying \ninternational trade. I made the point a little bit earlier that it \nmeans tremendous numbers of jobs, high-paying jobs, growth in our \neconomy. It is hard for me to understand why anybody in the union \nmovement would be against these free-trade policies. They basically \nallow us to export our goods while, yes, we import others, but that is \nwhat free trade is all about.\n  I wish to personally express my very high opinion of the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio because I can tell my colleagues that \nwe are so lucky to have him in the Senate with all of his experience in \nthis particular area but in\n\n[[Page S226]]\n\nmany other areas as well. He was at OMB as well. There are very few \nSenators in this body who can claim they have experience equivalent to \nthat of our distinguished friend from Ohio. I personally express my \nadmiration and my resolve to help him help those on the other side of \nthe aisle understand how important his words are here today, how \nimportant it is to have free trade, and how important it is to have \ntrade promotion authority so we can have free trade.\n  Every President since FDR--including him--has been for trade \npromotion authority--every President.\n  There is a fear around here amongst some of the Democrats that the \nunions are going to turn against them. My gosh, the Unions are going to \nbe main beneficiaries of major trade legislation. It is hard for me to \ncomprehend how they can even make a semi-argument against this matter. \nHopefully, they will realize this is in their interests, too, because \nit puts us in the real world, getting real jobs that have higher pay \nthan we wouldn't otherwise get if we didn't have these free-trade \nagreements and if we aren't able to get TPA passed. I suspect we will \nget this passed in large measure. I think, with the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, my friend who has just spoken, will be one \nof the main reasons why we do.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, will the Senator from Ohio yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to ask my good friend \nfrom Ohio if he could expand on what I think is a very important point, \nand it is namely this: With the world becoming more competitive and \nwith globalization, it is evermore important for the United States of \nAmerica to strive ahead and to keep working to develop good products, \ngood high-technology products, and to compete in the world. I believe, \nfrankly, when we are treading water, we are sinking. We have to keep \nmoving ahead if we are going to make products and boost incomes and \nhelp the American people.\n  That leads me to another point. If the Senator could tell us a little \nmore and explain to, frankly, some people who may not realize this, \nwhat is involved in TPP. What is TPP? Of course, we need trade \npromotion authority in order to get TPP.\n  Isn't it important, isn't it critical, isn't it crucial that the \nUnited States include a strong Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement not \nonly for economic reasons but also for geopolitical reasons to show to \nthe world, to show to Asian countries that are wondering where the \nUnited States is--is the United States going to show up? Is the United \nStates going to maintain its presence in Asia? What will happen if we \ndon't pass trade promotion authority? How will that affect the Trans-\nPacific Partnership negotiations, and what effect will that have on \nother countries in Asia and their perception of the United States?\n  My understanding is--and we know this better than anybody--that \nunfortunately President Obama was unable to travel to Southeast Asia to \nattend the ASEAN conference, and many people around the world are \nwondering whether the United States is going to show up anymore in \nAsia.\n  If the Senator could address how important is it that we engage \ncountries in the Pacific as we negotiate a Trans-Pacific Partnership, \nincluding the economic reasons, but also if he could address the \ngeopolitical issue, the degree to which it is important for the United \nStates to negotiate a successful agreement and to be there, to show up.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Reclaiming my time, I appreciate the question from my \ncolleague from Montana. I will say just based on his question that we \nare going to miss his wisdom and his experience on the trade issue. He \ntakes some political risks sometimes, I know, as he did in coming up \nwith an agreement on trade promotion authority, because there are many \non both sides of the aisle--especially his side of the aisle--who take \na different view of this issue. He has been willing to help to educate \nthem as to why this is in the interests of Montana farmers and ranchers \nand workers.\n  Senator Hatch spoke earlier about the impact of trade on the people \nhe represents.\n  My colleague is absolutely right. The trade promotion authority \nenables us to take that step toward things such as the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, called TPP--a lot of alphabet soup here with TPA to TPP. \nThat is important, as the Senator just said, because this is the \nfastest growing region of the world--these are the Pacific countries, \ncountries in South American but also in Asia; it is where the majority \nof the global GDP is now; and it is an area where, frankly, because of \nChina's strong interest in trade, other countries in the region are \nlooking to the United States to provide not only a market but also to \nhelp them with regard to their own markets; therefore, more U.S. \nexports, more of that, as my colleague said. The best technology in the \nworld is in the United States, the best products in the world that are \nmade here--to be able to export to those countries. So they want to \nhave this relationship with us.\n  As a future Ambassador to China, I will stipulate that I think the \nSenator from Montana understands this issue very well. But what this \nTrans-Pacific Partnership does is two things.\n  No. 1, it expands trade in an area of the world that again is the \nfastest growing part of our globe and a place where the tariffs and \nnontariff barriers are higher, relatively speaking, than they are here. \nIn other words, by lowering barriers we get a relative advantage.\n  This agreement also, I hope, will deal with the currency issue, as my \ncolleagues have negotiated in this trade promotion authority, which I \nsupport. This is pioneering work they have done in this area. We have \nto ensure that currency levels are appropriate, that there are not \nunfair trade advantages being given by countries that depreciate their \ncurrency by interfering in it.\n  So I believe it is about trade, and that is very important for our \nworkers and our farmers and our service providers, but, second, it does \nhave this geopolitical element where those countries in the Asia \nPacific area are allies of ours and are looking to us to develop a \nstronger relationship on the commercial side but also on the \nintergovernmental side to be able to ensure that the U.S. role \ncontinues in that area.\n  I think this TPA that these Senators have negotiated today that they \nare announcing is incredibly important because it is the first step \ntoward the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other agreements we can \ncomplete, as we just have recently under the old TPA, with South Korea, \nwith Panama, with Colombia--countries where we are seeing expansion of \nexports as well as a stronger relationship with key countries in the \nregion.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if I might ask one more question very \nbriefly, and that is this. One more opportunity here with trade \npromotion authority--with trade promotion authority, clearly we are \ngoing to get a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, and without trade \npromotion authority, we won't. Other countries will go their ways in \nthe Pacific and wonder, where is the United States?\n  There is another issue in addition to that. I wonder whether my good \nfriend would agree with this. Not only does trade promotion authority \nenable our country to negotiate trade agreements with the Pacific--\nTPP--but isn't it also true that it allows the United States, with the \npassage of the TPA, to negotiate with European countries? And doesn't \nthat mean that between Asia TPP and TTIP with the European countries, \nthat it is about 70 percent of world trade and is an opportunity for \nthe United States to lead in the harmonization of trade provisions and \nregulatory provisions not only in Asia and in the Pacific but also in \nEurope? It is an opportunity to lead? And if we don't pass TPA, is the \nUnited States squandering a huge opportunity to lead here in a way that \nwould raise productivity and raise incomes not just in our country but \nin other countries of the world?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Reclaiming my time, the Senator is absolutely right. The \nalternative is not to pass a trade promotion authority and to have \ncontinue to happen what has frankly been going on over the last 6 or 7 \nyears, which is these other countries around the world are actively \nnegotiating agreements, as the Senator from Montana says, using their \nown standards but also opening markets for their workers, their \nfarmers, and their service providers, and cutting us out of market \nshare.\n\n[[Page S227]]\n\n  So what has happened is the European Union, the Chinese, the \nCanadians, and others have been actively pursuing agreements while we \nhave been on the sidelines because we have not had trade promotion \nauthority. So not only does this give us an opportunity, with this \npossible agreement with the European Union--which would be an agreement \nnot like a free trade agreement but would be a partnership on \ninvestment, on standards, on being sure there is a harmonization that \nis more like the beneficial metrics that we use in this country that \ncan help both in our economy and, as the Senator says, globally--none \nof this can happen without us being able to say we are going to have \nthe possibility of taking trade agreements to the Congress for an up-\nor-down vote--a fair vote. Every one of these agreements will have to \nbe voted on separately because in these other countries they will not \nput that last, best offer on the table until they know that. They are \nnot going to be nickeled and dimed and amended to death as they get to \nthe Congress. That is just reality.\n  We have to get off the sidelines. We have to get reengaged. We have \nto help our economy, our workers to get their fair share, to get their \nmarket share. Right now we are losing that market share, as literally \nover 100 trade agreements have been negotiated while we have been \nsitting on the sidelines without having trade promotion authority on \nboth bilateral and regional agreements.\n  So the Senator is absolutely correct. This is a great opportunity for \nus to, frankly, take this anemic economy and give it a little shot in \nthe arm. It is part of an overall effort we ought to be doing to \nprovide the kind of economic opportunity we all want for the people we \nrepresent.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nUtah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I think we should all be listening to this \nman, this Senator from Ohio, who has had a wealth of experience not \njust in budget matters but also especially in these trade matters.\n  There are 11 countries in the TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and \nwe would like to come to an agreement on it. There are 28 different \ncountries in the European agreement on TTIP that we would like to bring \nto fruition, and you can go on from there.\n  Having said that, I cannot compliment my friend from Ohio enough. But \nI also want to pay tribute to our chairman of the committee. He is \nwilling to do this. He believes in it. He has had plenty of witness \nthat this is the way to do good trade, and he is willing to stand up \nand see that it is done. I cannot think of a better sendoff to China as \nthe new Ambassador--as soon as we finally finish these confirmation \nproceedings--than having passed TPA, which enables us to do free trade \nagreements all over the world and enables our fellow countries to \nrealize that we can get it done.\n  I want to pay tribute to the chairman, as well as my colleague from \nOhio, for their work in this area, and to say that this country will be \nmuch the better once we pass TPA and then get these trade agreements \ndone so the United States resumes its role in the world as the world's \nchief economic competitor, and doing it in a way that would benefit the \nwhole world but, more importantly, benefit this country.\n  So I want to thank my colleague from Montana, and my colleague from \nOhio as well. My colleague from Montana is going to be here at least a \nlittle bit longer, and hopefully we can get this passed in his honor. I \nthink he deserves that honor. I know the distinguished Senator from \nOhio and myself will do everything in our power to assist in this \nmatter.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/09/senate-section/article/S227-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2627.
