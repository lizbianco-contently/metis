Mr. President, Rick's departure from the Senate Armed \nServices Committee comes during a trying time for our Nation's \nmilitary, as deep across-the-board spending cuts are set to strike \nhundreds of thousands of civilian employees at the Defense Department \nwho will be furloughed in the coming weeks and months. Families and \nbusinesses across the country are also bracing for the pain of deep \ncuts in programs that keep our food safe, our water clean, and our \nborders secure.\n  But it is not too late to avert these damaging cuts, and cuts for \nwhich the overwhelming majority of Republicans in both the House and \nSenate voted--174 in the House, 28 here in the Senate. We believe we \nhave a balanced plan to remove the threat of the sequester, fully paid \nfor.\n  Our proposal would reduce the deficit by making smart spending cuts, \nand it would also close wasteful tax loopholes allowing companies that \noutsource jobs to China or India to claim tax deductions for doing so.\n  Our plan would stop wasteful subsidies to farmers, some of whom don't \neven farm anymore. That is right, there are some farmers who grew rice \ndecades ago, who still get payments from the Federal Government for \nrice they do not grow. Chairman Stabenow\n\n[[Page S960]]\n\nhas led the effort to make sure that won't happen anymore, and that is \npart of our legislation.\n  Our bill would also ask the wealthiest among us--those making, for \nexample, $5 million a year--to pay a minimum of 30 percent in taxes. I \ndon't think that is too outrageous. It is called the Buffet rule \nbecause that multibillionaire said he should pay as much in taxes as \nhis secretary, which he doesn't. So this legislation would make it more \nfair in that regard.\n  Almost 60 percent of Republicans around the country favor this \nbalanced approach, revenue from the richest of the rich and continuing \nwith governmental cuts. This proposition would ask millionaires and \nbillionaires and wealthy corporations to contribute a tiny fraction \nmore, as I have already indicated.\n\n  And everybody agrees--Republicans around the country and about 80 \npercent of the American people agree--it is the right thing to do. \nAlmost 60 percent of Republicans around the country agree it is the \nright thing to do. The only Republicans in America who don't agree are \nthose who serve in Congress.\n  Republicans in Congress are going after our proposal because it goes \nafter their special interests. Now, after days of infighting, Senate \nRepublicans have announced their plan. But instead of replacing the \npain of sequester with something smarter and more responsible, their \nplan would embrace these devastating cuts while abandoning any of the \nresponsibility that goes along with them.\n  One of the Senators in our caucus we had on Tuesday said the \nRepublican plan we thought was coming--and it did--would be like being \ntold you have to have three fingers cut off, and their proposal is to \nsend this to the President and have him decide which finger is going to \ngo first.\n  Republicans call the plan ``flexibility.'' Let's call it what it is: \nIt is a punt. They are punting. As President Obama said yesterday, it \nwould simply raise the question: ``Do I end funding that helps disabled \nchildren or poor children? Do I close this naval shipyard or that \none?''\n  The Republican plan is not a solution. And even members of the Senate \nRepublican Caucus have questioned the wisdom of this proposal, and they \nhave said so publicly. Why would the Republicans, part of the \nlegislative branch of government, cede more power to the White House?\n  The Republicans should give Congress true flexibility--the \nflexibility to cut wasteful subsidies, the flexibility to close \nunnecessary tax loopholes, and the flexibility to ask the richest of \nthe rich to contribute a little bit more. Instead, they have become \ncompletely inflexible, insisting we risk hundreds of thousands of \nAmerican jobs as well as programs that strengthen families and small \nbusinesses across the Nation.\n  I am sorry to say that should come as no surprise. As usual, the \nRepublicans have put the demands of special interests and protection of \nthe richest of the rich--people making up to $5 million a year and not \nbeing asked to contribute 30 percent of what they make--over the needs \nof the American people, especially the middle class.\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/28/senate-section/article/S960-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, here we are again, on the eve of this \nadministration's latest manufactured crisis. Tomorrow, as we all know--\nanybody who has been paying attention knows--the sequester will go into \neffect. And if we believe the majority leader, the President, and his \nCabinet, this will be devastating for our economy and for our country. \nBut I wish to suggest that the majority leader, the President, and his \nCabinet put down the beltway Koolaid, because they are predicting a \ndisaster that will not occur.\n  Let's put the responsibility for this where it lies. The sequester \nwas the President's idea in the first place. As much as he and his \npress secretary and staff try to deny it, the fact is, as he wrote in \nhis recent book, Bob Woodward has made the point that they told him it \nwas their idea. The White House proposed it to Congress and the \nPresident signed it into law on August 2, 2011.\n  In the year and a half since the Budget Control Act became the law of \nthe land, the President has done virtually nothing--nothing--about it. \nHe has ignored it. He suggested during the Presidential campaign that \nthe sequester would not happen, and it was as if he tried to simply \nwish it away. Certainly we know one thing, and that is neither the \nPresident nor his Cabinet nor the Defense Department nor any part of \nhis administration has done anything to plan for it--no planning \nwhatsoever--which, of course, makes the implementation more \nchallenging, to be sure.\n  At times, the President has pretended the sequester didn't even \nexist, even though he signed it into law, such as when the Department \nof Labor notified government contractors they didn't have to abide by \nanother Federal law called the WARN Act, which requires them to notify \ntheir employees of potential layoffs that could result from \nsequestration. The timing, it seems, was inconvenient. Those notices \nwould have gone out roughly around November 1, just 5 days before the \nlast election.\n  To be sure, there is bipartisan consensus the sequester is ham-\nfisted. These across-the-board cuts don't amount to smart budgeting. \nBut what would we expect after nearly 4 years of no budgeting? And what \nI mean by that, as this chart reflects, is that it has been 1,401 days \nsince the Senate, under Democrat control, has passed a budget. This is \na shameful record and one that needs to be rectified as soon as \npossible.\n  We are now told the President himself has missed his statutory \ndeadline for sending his proposed budget for the year over to Congress. \nThat deadline was February 4. And now they are saying we may not get it \nuntil after we have had to act ourselves on a budget. So they are \npredicting it will be roughly 7 weeks late.\n  Well, no one could argue with a straight face--contrary to the doom \nand gloom and the apocalyptic predictions--that 2.4-percent cuts from \nour anticipated $3.6 trillion annual spending amounts to devastation or \nthe end of Western civilization or whatever sort of apocalyptic terms \nyou want to use. So let's look at what 2.4 percent in cuts would mean \nto the average American family.\n\n  If you use 100 gallons of gasoline to run your car every month and \nyou had to cut that back by 2.4 percent, that means you would be able \nto use 97.6 gallons of gas.\n  If you have a $250-a-month grocery budget, you would need to find $6 \nin savings. And on a monthly utility bill of, let's say, $175, you \nwould have to trim it down by $4.20.\n  These are the kinds of cuts the American people have had to make for \nthemselves during the recession of 2008 and due to slow growth and high \nunemployment since then. Yet President Obama is either unwilling or \nunable to propose similar cuts to replace the sequester.\n  If he doesn't like it, well, let's have his proposal for how he would \nfix it since he signed it into law. Instead, what we get is a proposal \nthat we will vote on this afternoon from our friends across the aisle \nthat would just raise more taxes after one of the largest tax increases \nin American history as a result of the fiscal cliff negotiations just \nin late December.\n  So the President is content to push through more spending to grow the \nsize of government, notwithstanding the fact that the Federal \nGovernment is now spending more money than it ever has as a percentage \nof our economy. And we have $16.5 trillion in debt. We have important \nprograms such as Medicare and Social Security that are unsustainable--\nunless Congress and the President act on a bipartisan basis.\n\n[[Page S961]]\n\n  This is not a mystery. This is not something that Republicans know \nthat Democrats don't know; we all know it; and the President knows it \nbecause his own bipartisan fiscal commission told him in December 2010.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the White House-backed \nbill offered by our Senate Democratic friends to replace the sequester \nwould actually raise the deficit this year by tens of billions of \ndollars. Now, you may be wondering about that, thinking that the \nsequester was supposed to cut spending. But, actually, the proposal \nmade by our friends across the aisle would raise the deficit this year \nby tens of billions of dollars--not exactly what I would call progress. \nIt is absolutely ludicrous, especially when we consider that even with \nthe sequester spending by the Federal Government will still be higher \nthis year than it was last year.\n  Let me repeat that in case people weren't listening. Even with the \nspending cuts mandated by the sequestration, $85 billion in cuts, this \nadministration will still have more money to spend this year than last \nyear. It is hard to see how that would wreak devastation. Yet last year \nwe didn't see planes falling out of the sky, we didn't see empty \nsupermarket shelves for lack of safe food, nor did we see the national \nparks shutting their front gates. We didn't see any of the doomsday \nscenarios the President and his Cabinet are now warning about after \n1\\1/2\\ years of doing nothing.\n  Of course, the President talks endlessly, it seems, of the need for a \nso-called balanced approach. Well, he got his pound of flesh. He got \nhis $600 billion in additional tax revenue from the American people. So \nwhere is the balance to that? When all he and his party proposes is \nmore taxes and more spending, that is not balance.\n  Now is the time to cut spending. That is the only way forward, and \nthat is the only way to begin--with one small step--to return our \ncountry to sound fiscal footing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/28/senate-section/article/S961-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, earlier this year, the Democrats who \nrun Washington promised America things would be different under a \nreelected President Obama. Instead of politics, they would focus on \npolicy. Instead of leaving everything until the last minute, they would \nget the people's work done ahead of time for a change--and through the \nregular order. Well, those promises didn't last very long.\n  Later this afternoon, less than 24 hours before the President's \nsequester proposal takes effect, we will vote on a Senate Democrat plan \nthat does more to perpetuate the culture of irresponsibility around \nhere than it does to fix the culture of spending that Washington \nDemocrats claim to be concerned about.\n  Point of fact: Not only would their legislation fail to fix the \nspending problem facing our country, it would actually add billions \nmore to the deficit. In other words, it isn't a plan at all. It is a \ngimmick.\n  Top Democrats already concede it will never garner enough votes to \npass the very legislative body they control, much less the House. But \nlet's be very clear: For the President and for his allies, that is \nreally the whole point. They want it to fail so they can go around the \ncountry blaming Republicans for a sequester the President himself \nproposed. In fact, they are so concerned about preventing anything from \nactually passing the Congress they have limited the ability of Senators \non both sides to debate the issue openly and to offer different ideas.\n  For instance, Senators Ayotte and Paul have introduced bills that \ndeserve our consideration. And there are others too. Senator Collins \nhas been working on a proposal, and Senator Whitehouse has a plan that \nwould replace the sequester with a series of huge tax hikes. I don't \nsupport that approach, but his legislation at least merits a vote.\n  Republicans will get just one chance to offer a bill, and I will \ndiscuss that legislation a little later in my remarks. But if the \nPresident's sequester is going to be as horrible as Washington \nDemocrats have proposed, shouldn't we spend more than just a few hours \ndebating it? Is this really the best Senate Democrats can do?\n  As for the President, he too has yet to put forward a serious plan \nthat could pass either the House or the Democrat-controlled Senate, and \nhe has refused to engage in substantive discussions with congressional \nleaders. Now, this week, he finally invited Speaker Boehner and me to \ndiscuss the sequester; that is, tomorrow, the day it takes effect. In \nshort, instead of changing as they promised, Washington Democrats are \njust turning back to the same old campaign-first strategy they have \nemployed literally now for years.\n\n  Now, after thwarting every bipartisan attempt to avert the sequester, \nthe President is ready to make it bite as hard as possible--all to send \na simple message to the public: Do you want to control Washington \nspending, America? Fine. Let me show you how much I can make it hurt. \nThat is the President's strategy: Let me show you how much I can make \nit hurt.\n  Instead of directing his Cabinet Secretaries to trim waste in their \ndepartments, he is going after first responders and teachers and almost \nany other sympathetic constituency you can think of. He will \narbitrarily close parks and monuments too, all to force Americans to \naccept higher taxes.\n  He will claim his hands are tied. He will say he has no choice but to \nrelease criminals into the streets and withhold vaccinations from poor \nchildren. Somehow it will be everybody's fault but his. Nonsense.\n  Look, our country has a spending problem--a pretty massive one. Most \nof us in the Chamber at least acknowledge that fact. But we can either \naddress the problem in a smart way or we can do it in the way he has \nproposed. That is what the Toomey-Inhofe legislation we will vote on \nthis afternoon is all about. It is about giving agency heads greater \nflexibility to ensure the sequester cuts are implemented in a smarter \nway.\n  Some have raised concerns that this would give the administration too \nmuch power; that the President would just use the authority to punish \nhis critics. I certainly understand those concerns. But the goal here \nis twofold: One, to make sure the American people get the same amount \nof spending cuts that were promised to them in 2011; and, two, to \nguarantee some accountability on the President's part so those cuts are \nadministered in a more intelligent way.\n  You would think the President would welcome a proposal such as ours. \nGiven his complaints and those of his Cabinet Secretaries about their \nhands being tied on cuts, you would think he would be banging on our \ndoors demanding flexibility. But now--get this--he is complaining that \nhaving extra authority might mean he would actually have to choose \nwhich programs to preserve and which ones to cut; that he would have to \nprioritize spending within the Federal Government.\n  Well, with due respect, Mr. President, I think a lot of people who \nvoted for you think that is your job, to make those tough decisions--\nespecially tough decisions to implement the plan you, yourself, \nproposed and insisted upon. Surely, you can find a little more than 2 \npercent to cut from the Federal budget, and surely you can do it \nwithout raining down a phony Armageddon on American families. They had \nto find ways to cope with the 2 percent less in their paychecks just \nlast month after the payroll tax went back up. Why in the world can't \nWashington?\n  Look, the American people will simply not accept replacing spending \ncuts agreed to by both parties with tax hikes, and I plan to make all \nof this clear to the President when I meet with him tomorrow. He \nalready got hundreds of billions of dollars in new revenue earlier this \nyear when the tax law expired. Now it is time for the balanced part of \nthe equation, and that means keeping our promise to reduce spending.\n  So the time for games is over. No more protecting waste and broken \npromises at the expense of those who actually need government help. The \nAmerican people were promised more spending control, and Republicans \nare going to help them see that promise is fulfilled in the smartest \nway possible.\n\n[[Page S962]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a disappointing \nmilestone that we passed yesterday.\n  Yesterday was the 1,400th day since the Senate passed a Federal \nbudget--1,400 days. So I guess today is the first day moving toward \n1,500 days, but yesterday was the 1,400th day.\n  It has been said--and I know I have said it on this floor--that \nfailing to plan is planning to fail. If you don't have any idea where \nyou are going, you are not likely to get where you would like to be.\n  When it comes to our budgetary future, the strategy of the majority \nhas been just not to deal with it.\n  Last summer Vice President Joe Biden challenged and said: Show me \nyour budget and I will tell you what you value. Why the Vice President \nwould have said that I really don't know. The President's budget that \nhas arrived late and has been dead on arrival, apparently, every time \nit has arrived in the last 4 years and a Senate majority of the Vice \nPresident's party that has not passed a budget--why the Vice President \nwould have said: Show me your budget, and I will tell you what you \nvalue, I don't know.\n\n  I like the Vice President personally a lot. I often don't know \nexactly why he said what he said. But this comment really does raise a \nquestion about why we are not willing to talk about the things we want \nto achieve as a government.\n  Nearly 4 years have passed since we had any kind of blueprint. I am \ntold when we talk about a budget in Washington that apparently there \nwere no political consequences because the majority was rewarded with \nthe majority again even though if there was one comment made over and \nover again in that campaign, it is, it has been 3 years since there has \nbeen a budget, and now we are saying it has been 4 years since there \nhas been a budget, and we have seen the government lurch from crisis to \ncrisis. Frankly, most of these crises have been created by the people \nwho say they are trying to deal with them.\n  I could not imagine, in November and December, why we would want to \nstart a new year with the issues before us that were before us then. \nThis could have been handled at that time as easily as it could be \nhandled now. Part of it is the failure to plan.\n  Since the Senate, controlled for some time now by Democrats, passed a \nbudget in April of 2009, lots of things have happened. Four years ago \nnobody in America had an iPad yet because iPads had not yet been \ninvented. Nobody in America now doesn't know somebody who has an iPad \nif they don't have one themselves. Instagram, which our conference just \nadded to one of these tools this week, didn't even exist 4 years ago. \nThe Federal debt 4 years ago was less than $12 trillion. Now it is \n$16.6 trillion. LeBron James was still a Cleveland Cavalier the last \ntime the Senate passed a budget. ObamaCare--and the President, in the \nPresidential campaign, said he now liked that term. I think he may not \nlike it as well as he does now when people find out more about it--was \nnot even the law yet. It was not the law. The ``Oprah'' show was still \non the air. NASA had not announced yet that we were done with the space \nshuttle missions. Prince William and Kate Middleton were not engaged, \nand Brett Favre still played for the NFL. Lots of things have happened \nin the last 4 years, but one thing that has not happened is the Senate \nhas not passed a budget.\n  Republicans in the House have drawn up and voted for budgets. We \nfigured out ways occasionally to have a budget vote. But the \nPresident's budget would get no vote. There was no Senate majority \nbudget on which to vote. I look forward to seeing that budget on the \nfloor.\n  I was glad to vote just a few weeks ago on the bill that said that if \nwe do not have a budget, we do not get paid, because if we do not have \na budget, we do not have the fundamental tool it takes to have the \nother debates on the appropriations bills. People deserve a Senate that \nhas a budget, is willing to put it out there, and that then is willing \nto have the debates on appropriations bills we need to have. It has \nbeen 15 months since we had an appropriations bill on the Senate floor. \nWe have failed to do the work, and that leads us from one needless \ncrisis to another.\n  Now the crisis, of course, is the sequestration deadline. If you \nlisten to the administration, you would assume that this is the last \nday it is safe to go outside; that starting tomorrow terrible things \nare going to happen. I just heard our leader, the Republican leader, \ntalk about our willingness to give the President of the other party \nmore ability to direct these cuts in specific ways--but not forever. We \nneed to take that responsibility back ourselves and appropriate the \nmoney that is going to be spent October 1. But between now and \nSeptember 30, we need to make these reductions in the best way rather \nthan the worst way.\n  The Appropriations Committee, on which I am the ranking Republican, \nhas Agriculture in it. One thing I am going to ask the Department is, \nWhich employees are supposed to show up on those days that are so \ndangerous that you say only the critical employees need to be here? And \nif they are supposed to be here in bad weather, why wouldn't they be \nhere now? Why would you cut the Federal employee who has to show up at \na food-processing facility for anybody else to work and have somebody \nin an office somewhere doing something that could be done the next day \nthat is just dependent on them? If I were the President, I wouldn't \nwant to be answering, why did you cut this and not cut that?\n  Recently the President had a series of press conferences. He embarked \non a 100-city tour to warn about the sequester. He showed up in Newport \nNews in Virginia almost exactly 1 year after three of my colleagues \nwent there--Senator Graham, Senator Ayotte, and Senator McCain--saying: \nIn a year this is going to be a big problem. A year later the President \nshows up and says: This is going to be a big problem.\n  The President proposed the sequester in 2011. He insisted that it \nbecome law. He even threatened to veto a bill. He said: I will veto any \nbill to replace the sequester--late last year. Suddenly, now he has \nchanged his mind and all these terrible things are going to happen and \nit is unavoidable. It is only unavoidable if we refuse to cut things \nthat can be cut.\n  The Federal Government has grown 19 percent in its spending in the \nlast 4 years. The sequester would cut 2.4 or 2.5 percent. Anybody in \nAmerica whose budget has grown 19 percent in the last 2 years can go \nback, not to where they were the last 4 years--rather, not to where \nthey were 3 years or 4 years ago but just to where they were a few \nmonths ago and get their spending level back to that. This is a budget \nwhich has grown in a tremendous way, but now it is suddenly uncuttable. \nWe cannot begin to get by with the money we were spending 6 or 9 or 12 \nmonths ago? Nobody believes that.\n  If we want to have this discussion, that is fine with me. These \nspending cuts need to happen. They should happen, and they should \nhappen in the right way. This is not going to be solved by campaign \nappearances all over the country. It is going to be solved by good \nmanagement to reach reasonable goals. The accounting office has \nidentified 51 areas where programs are inefficient, ineffective, and \noverlapping--51 areas. Why don't we deal with that? That is the \nExecutive's responsibility, to say: Here is how we are going to \neliminate these programs the Government Accountability Office has said \nare inefficient, ineffective, and overlapping. Otherwise, I guess we \nare committed to keep the programs that are inefficient, ineffective, \nand overlapping and spend billions of dollars of the taxpayers' money.\n\n  That would include things such as 180 economic development programs \noperating in five different Cabinet agencies. I am for economic \ndevelopment. I am for opportunity and jobs. But do we need 180 \ndifferent programs in 5 different agencies? Divide 180 by 5--does each \nof those agencies need an average of that many programs?\n  There are 173 programs across 13 agencies to promote science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math education. That is not a bad goal, \nbut does it take 173 programs in 13 agencies to do it?\n  Twenty agencies oversee more than 50 financial literacy programs. \nMore than 50 programs across 4 departments are there to support \nentrepreneurs. Private sector job creation should be the No. 1 domestic \ngoal of the country\n\n[[Page S963]]\n\ntoday, but do you need 50 programs in four departments to encourage \nentrepreneurial skills? Probably not.\n  Why don't we hear about that instead of the air traffic controllers \nand the highway engineers and the meat plant inspectors and the Head \nStart teachers? Why don't we hear about these programs that we all know \nare ready to be made more efficient--or in some cases just simply the \nway to make them more effective is to eliminate those programs.\n  There are 47 job training programs in 9 agencies that cost $18 \nbillion in fiscal year 2009. I do not have a number newer than that. We \nactually don't have a budget much newer than that. But $18 billion for \n47 programs in 9 agencies? I am sure we can do better.\n  The Government Accountability Office found at least 37 duplicative \ninvestments in information technology--that was $1.2 billion over 5 \nyears--and 14 programs to administer grants to reduce diesel emissions \nacross 3 departments. This is not 14 programs to administer grants and \nloans, this is 14 programs to administer grants and loans to reduce \ndiesel emissions. I am for reducing diesel emissions. I am even for the \nFederal Government paying some attention to whether that is being done. \nBut do we need 14 programs in 3 different agencies to do it?\n  Across-the-board cutting, which is what sequester really means--that \nmeans we couldn't get to the number because, by the way, we didn't have \nany budget, we didn't pass any budget, so of course we couldn't get to \nthe number. We couldn't get to the number the law requires us not to \nexceed in our spending, so the cure for that is to cut every line item \nin the discretionary spending part of the budget--the part that defends \nthe country, the part that builds highways, the part that administers \nmost educational needs in which the Federal Government is involved? \nThat is what sequester is. We can do better.\n  The Department of Defense has spent more than $67 billion in the last \n10 years on nondefense spending. Probably somebody better than the \nDepartment of Defense could do the nondefense work. The Department of \nEnergy weatherization program, which has received $5 billion in \nstimulus funds, exhibited a failure rate of 80 percent. The stimulus \nprogram really worked out well. Here is an 80-percent failure rate in \nenergy weatherization.\n  The FAA--the Federal Aviation Administration, the one about which my \nfriend the Secretary of Transportation, with whom I served in the \nHouse, said we would have to eliminate air traffic controllers--they \nspend $500 million each year on consultants. It could be that it is \nmore important that the air traffic controllers show up than that the \nconsultants show up.\n  I have a list here I am going to submit because the list literally \ngoes on and on.\n  The Internal Revenue Service stored 22,486 items of unused furniture \nin a warehouse, at an annual cost of $862,000.\n  We will have this discussion of ``why cut that instead of this'' if \nwe want to. But my side is willing to give the President authority \nbetween now and the end of this haphazardly put together appropriating \nyear to target cuts so that those of us in the Senate can appropriate \nthe money for next year's spending.\n  We ought to be moving right now. We should not be having this debate \nat all today. We should be having a debate on the budget to have it \ndone by April 15 so the Appropriations Committee can begin to do its \nwork and we can find out what needs to happen here.\n  This is a good time to ask the question, Is this a job for the \ngovernment? If the answer is yes, the second question is, Is the \nFederal Government the best of all governments to solve this problem or \nis there some government closer to the people and closer to the problem \nthat can solve it in a better way?\n  There are two things I wish to submit and ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record as I close my remarks. One is a July 31, \n2012, memo to agencies from the Office of Management and Budget that \nsays, ``Agencies should continue normal spending and operations since \nthere are more than 5 months that remain for Congress to act.''\n  On September 28 the same management organization, the Office of \nManagement and Budget, under the Executive Office of the President, \nsent another memo out that says, ``Agencies should continue normal \nspending and operations, as instructed in the July 31 memo from the \nOffice of Management and Budget to executive departments and agencies \nwhich addresses operational and other issues raised by the potential of \nJanuary 2 sequestration.''\n  So the new spending year is about to begin in 2 days--2 days after \nthis goes out--and the direction from the White House is business as \nusual, full-speed ahead, spend money just like you are. Don't bother \nwith that law which says that beginning on January 1, we have to spend \nless money.\n  Well, I am convinced we are going to spend less money. I am prepared \nto work with the President to see that we do that in the smartest \npossible way, but we have to get our spending under control, and I look \nforward to seeing the Senate do its job first with the budget and then \nwith bills that debate our money and what we spend our money on.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 31, 2012.\n\n     Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies\n\n     From Jeffrey D. Zients, Acting Director.\n\n     Subject Issues Raised by Potential Sequestration Pursuant To \n         Section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n         Control Act of 1985.\n\n       Passed by bipartisan majorities in both houses of the \n     Congress, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; Public Law \n     112-25) amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA) to put into place an automatic \n     process of across-the-board reductions in budgetary \n     resources, known as a sequestration, specified in an order to \n     be issued on January 2, 2013, if the Joint Select Committee \n     on Deficit Reduction failed to propose, and the Congress \n     failed to enact, a bill containing at least $1.2 trillion in \n     deficit reduction.\n       The President has made clear that the Congress should act \n     to avoid such a sequestration. If allowed to occur, the \n     sequestration would be highly destructive to national \n     security and domestic priorities, as well as to core \n     government functions. To avoid this, the President submitted \n     a budget for 2013 that includes a comprehensive and balanced \n     set of proposals that contain greater deficit reduction than \n     the Congress was charged with achieving. The Administration \n     believes the Congress should redouble its efforts to reduce \n     the deficit in a bipartisan, balanced, and fiscally \n     responsible manner and avoid the sequestration.\n       If Congress were to enact the requisite deficit reduction \n     measures and avoid the sequestration, there would be no need \n     to take steps to issue the sequestration order, and then to \n     develop plans for agency operations for the remainder of FY \n     2013 within the constraints of that order. These \n     sequestration planning and implementation activities, once \n     undertaken, will necessarily divert scarce resources from \n     other important agency activities and priorities. The \n     President remains confident that Congress will act, but \n     because it has not yet made progress towards enacting \n     sufficient deficit reduction, the Office of Management and \n     Budget (OMB) will work with agencies, as necessary, on issues \n     raised by a sequestration of this magnitude.\n       To that end, OMB will be holding discussions on these \n     issues with you and your staff over the coming months. In the \n     near term, OMB will consult with you on such topics as the \n     application to your agency's accounts and programs of the \n     exemptions from sequestration contained in section 255 of \n     BBEDCA and the applicable sequestration rules specified in \n     section 256 of BBEDCA. These discussions should be informed \n     by your General Counsel's analysis of how the requirements of \n     BBEDCA, as amended by the BCA, and other statutory \n     authorities apply to a particular issue involving your \n     agency. OMB will also engage with agencies on anticipated \n     reporting requirements established by Congress that are \n     related to, but separate from, planning for or implementing a \n     sequestration order under the BCA.\n       Over the longer term, in the absence of Congressional \n     action on a balanced deficit reduction plan in advance of \n     January 2, 2013, OMB will undertake additional activities \n     related to the implementation of the BCA. OMB will work with \n     agencies, as necessary, on issues surrounding the \n     sequestration order and its implementation. For example, \n     sequestrable amounts can only be calculated once FY 2013 \n     funding levels are known; therefore, shortly before any \n     sequestration order is issued, OMB will collect information\n\n[[Page S964]]\n\n     from agencies on sequestrable amounts and, where applicable, \n     unobligated balances, and calculate the percentage reductions \n     necessary to implement the sequestration. In the meantime, \n     agencies should continue normal spending and operations since \n     more than 5 months remain for Congress to act.\n       The steps described above are necessary to prepare for the \n     contingency of having to issue a sequestration order, but \n     they do not change the fact that sequestration is bad policy, \n     was never meant to be implemented, and should be avoided \n     through the enactment of bipartisan, balanced deficit \n     legislation. The Administration urges the Congress to take \n     this course.\n                                  ____\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                               Washington, DC, September 28, 2012.\n\n   OMB Bulletin No. 12-02--To the Heads of Executive Departments and \n                             Establishments\n\n     Subject Apportionment of the Continuing Resolution(s) for \n         Fiscal Year 2013\n       1. Purpose and Background. H.J. Res. 117 will provide \n     continuing appropriations for the period October 1, 2012 \n     through March 27, 2013. Section 110 of H.J. 117 requires that \n     the joint resolution be implemented so that only the most \n     limited funding actions shall be taken in order to provide \n     for continuation of projects and activities, and section 109 \n     requires that programs restrict funding actions so as not to \n     impinge on the final funding prerogatives of the Congress. I \n     am automatically apportioning amounts provided by sections \n     101(a) and 101(b) of this continuing resolution (CR) as \n     specified in section 3. The amounts provided by the 0.612 \n     percent across-the-board (ATB) increase in section 101(c) \n     will be subject to the procedures for apportioning that \n     funding as outlined in section 4. This Bulletin supplements \n     instructions for apportionment of CRs in OMB Circular No. A-\n     11, sections 120 and 123.\n       The Administration continues to urge Congress to pass a \n     balanced package of deficit reduction that would replace the \n     potential sequestration on January 2, 2013, under section \n     251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985, as amended (BBEDCA). If necessary, the Bulletin will \n     be amended to address that sequestration. Unless and until \n     the Bulletin is amended, however, agencies should continue \n     normal spending and operations, as instructed in the July 31 \n     memo from OMB to executive departments and agencies which \n     addressed operational and other issues raised by the \n     potential January 2 sequestration. Unless the Bulletin is \n     subsequently amended, it should be assumed to apply to both \n     this CR and any extensions of this CR.\n       Note: Although the CR Bulletin does not automatically or \n     otherwise apportion budgetary resources for accounts that are \n     not determined by current appropriation action of the \n     Congress (such as mandatory funding and balances of prior \n     year budget authority), those apportionments will also be \n     amended if necessary, to reapportion sequestrable resources \n     to account for the potential January 2 sequestration. The \n     guidance above to spend and operate normally until further \n     notice also applies to these other resources.\n       2. Amounts Provided. Section 101(a) of H.J. Res. 117 \n     provides such amounts as may be necessary, at a rate for \n     operations as provided in the applicable appropriations Acts \n     for fiscal year (FY) 2012 and under the authority and \n     conditions provided in such stated Acts, for continuing \n     projects or activities (including the costs of direct loans \n     and loan guarantees) that are not otherwise specifically \n     provided for in H.J. Res. 117, that were conducted in FY \n     2012, and for Appropriations Act, 2012 (Public Law 112-55), \n     except for appropriations in that Act designated by the \n     Congress as being for disaster relief, the Consolidated \n     Appropriations Act, 2012 (Public Law 112-74), and the \n     Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2012 (Public Law 112-77), \n     except for appropriations in that Act under the heading \n     ``Corps of Engineers-Civil''.\n       Section 101(b) provides that notwithstanding section 101 \n     whenever an amount designated for Overseas Contingency \n     Operations (OCO)/Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) pursuant to \n     section 251(b)(2)(A) of BBEDCA in either the Department of \n     Defense Appropriations Act, 2012 (division A of Public Law \n     112-74) or in the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs \n     and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2012 (division H of \n     Public Law 112-74) that would be made available for a project \n     or activity is different from the amount requested in the \n     President's FY 2013 Budget request, the project or activity \n     shall be continued at a rate for operations that would be \n     permitted by, and such designation shall be applied to, the \n     amount in the President's FY 2013 Budget request. For \n     purposes of calculating the rate for operations, the \n     reference to ``amount'' in section 101(b) is assumed to mean \n     the budget account total.\n       Section 101(c) increases the rate for operations provided \n     by subsection (a) by 0.612 percent. Such increase does not \n     apply to OCO/GWOT amounts or to amounts incorporated in the \n     joint resolution by reference to the Disaster Relief \n     Appropriations Act, 2012 (Public Law 112-77).\n       3. Automatic Apportionments. Attachment A contains more \n     detailed instructions on calculating the annualized amount \n     provided by the CR. In order to calculate the amount \n     automatically apportioned through the period ending March 27, \n     2013 (and any extensions thereof) multiply the annualized \n     amount provided by the CR in sections 101(a) and 101(b) by \n     the lower of:\n       The percentage of the year (pro-rata) covered by the CR \n     (e.g., for H.J. Res. 117 use 48.77 percent), or\n       The historical seasonal rate of obligations for the period \n     of the year covered by the CR.\n       Unless determined otherwise by your RMO, all automatically \n     apportioned CR funds are apportioned as Category B (lump \n     sum), regardless of quarterly restrictions (i.e., amounts on \n     Category A) imposed in last year's apportionments. \n     Limitations on programs (i.e., other Category Bs) and \n     footnotes included in last year's apportionments remain in \n     effect under the CR.\n       Apportionment of the 0.612 percent ATB \n     increase in section 101(c) is discussed in \n     section 4.\n       4. Amounts Provided by Section 101(c) Excluded from \n     Automatic Apportionment. This automatic apportionment does \n     not apply to amounts provided by the 0.612 percent ATB \n     increase in section 101(c) of H.J. Res. 117. The agency may \n     submit a written apportionment to OMB to request these funds \n     during the period of the CR.\n       5. Accounts with Zero Funding Excluded from Automatic \n     Apportionment. As has been the case in recent CR Bulletins, \n     including FY 2012, if either the House or Senate has reported \n     or passed a bill that provides no funding for an account at \n     the time the CR is enacted or extended, this automatic \n     apportionment does not apply to that account. (Reported bills \n     are those that have been filed by the full House or Senate \n     Appropriations Committee for floor action.) The agency may \n     filed by the full House or Senate Appropriations Committee \n     for floor action.) The agency may submit a written \n     apportionment to OMB to request funds for the account during \n     the period of the CR, if needed.\n       6. Programs under Section 111. Funds for appropriated \n     entitlements and other mandatory payments, and activities \n     under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, are automatically \n     apportioned amounts as needed to carry out programs at a rate \n     to maintain program levels under current law, i.e., at the FY \n     2013 level. However, this automatic apportionment does not \n     apply to programs with more complex funding structures. \n     Agencies should contact their RMO representatives to \n     determine if their account is automatically apportioned or if \n     a written apportionment is required.\n       With regard to the associated administrative expenses for \n     those programs, section 111 does not apply. The associated \n     administrative expenses are automatically apportioned at the \n     pro-rata level based on FY 2012 annualized levels in section \n     101(a).\n       As noted in section 1, this automatic apportionment will be \n     amended, if necessary, to reapportion sequestrable resources \n     to account for the sequestration order that the President may \n     be required to issue on January 2, 2013, under section 251A \n     of BBEDCA. Until such time as the Bulletin is amended, \n     agencies should continue normal spending and operations, as \n     instructed in the July 31 memo from OMB to executive \n     departments and agencies which addressed operational and \n     other issues raised by the potential January 2 sequestration.\n       7. Credit Limitations. If there is an enacted credit \n     limitation (i.e., a limitation on loan principal or \n     commitment level) in FY 2012, then the automatic \n     apportionment is the pro-rata share of the credit limitation \n     or the budget authority (i.e., for subsidy cost), whichever \n     is less. To calculate amounts available, see exhibit 123B of \n     OMB Circular No. A-11.\n       8. Written Apportionments for Amounts Provided by Sections \n     101(a) and 101(b). If an agency seeks an amount for a program \n     that is more than the amount automatically apportioned under \n     sections 101(a) and 101(b), a written apportionment must be \n     requested from OMB. OMB expects to grant only a very limited \n     number of these written apportionment requests. Each of these \n     requests must be accompanied by a written justification that \n     includes the legal basis for the exception apportionment. \n     Similarly, an RMO or an agency may determine that an amount \n     for a program should be less than the amount automatically \n     apportioned by sections 101(a) and 101(b) in order to ensure \n     that an agency does not impinge on the final funding \n     prerogatives of the Congress. In these cases, a written \n     apportionment will also be required.\n       Agencies do not need to request a new written apportionment \n     for each extension of the CR (unless otherwise required by \n     your RMO). Instead, in the case of accounts that receive a \n     written apportionment at any time during the CR period, the \n     automatic apportionment will apply to such accounts under any \n     subsequent extensions of the CR, provided that the total \n     amount apportioned during the CR period does not exceed the \n     total annualized level of the CR. However, any footnotes on \n     the written apportionment continue to apply to the accounts, \n     when subsequently operating under the automatic \n     apportionment.\n       The written apportionments described in this section are \n     not intended to address the written apportionment \n     requirements for amounts provided by section 101(c) or \n     accounts with zero funding. Those requirements are described \n     in sections 4 and 5 above, respectively.\n                                                Jeffrey D.

Time is yielded back.\n  The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We will have a vote on the floor of the Senate. It is an \nimportant vote because tomorrow is the day of sequestration. The \nAmerican people are learning new terminology. The fiscal cliff meant \nnothing to most Americans 6 months ago, but by New Year's Eve many \nunderstood that something serious was about to occur. Laws had been \npassed which meant that taxes would go up on virtually every taxpaying \nAmerican on January 1 if Congress failed to act. That was the fiscal \ncliff.\n  We reached a last-minute agreement on ways to avert that from \nhappening and to make sure any tax increases on the income tax side \nwere going to be exclusively applied to those in the highest income \ncategories. Well, the Americans breathed a sigh of relief and said \nthank goodness that emergency is over.\n  We are good in Washington at manufacturing crises, and now we are in \na new crisis of our own creation. This is not some act of God, some \nnatural event, some occurrence we have no control over. We created \nthis. We created something called sequestration, and here is what it \nwas all about.\n  The President sat down with the leaders in Congress--this goes back \nover a year now--and said: Listen, we need to do something about our \ndeficit, but let's do it in a bipartisan way and a balanced way. Let's \nput together a supercommittee--an equal number of Democrats and \nRepublicans--and let's reach an agreement once and for all. Stop \nbickering and reach an agreement. Let's reduce the deficit as a result \nof that agreement. But, he said, to make sure you take it seriously, if \nyou don't reach an agreement, then as of this year, 2013, we are going \nto have automatic spending cuts called sequestration, and the \nsequestration cuts are not going to be very kind. They are going to be \nacross-the-board cuts by each line item of the budget. So to avoid \nthat, do the right thing and reach a bipartisan agreement in the \nsupercommittee.\n  We failed. We failed when the Republicans of the committee said no \nrevenue, no taxes. Sorry. We will just talk about spending cuts and \ncutting Medicare. That is all we are interested in talking about.\n  End of story; end of supercommittee; welcome to the world of \nsequestration. The threat that was supposed to make the supercommittee \nact is now about to become the reality. The reality means that in the \nremainder of this year--we do fiscal years, not calendar years--between \nnow and September 30, we need to cut $85 billion in spending. Half of \nit will be on the defense side, and half of it will be on the \nnondefense side. Some might say: Come on, this is a big government and \nthis is a big budget, and you are telling me $85 billion is a big \nproblem?\n  I happen to agree with the Senator from Missouri--Republican Senator \nBlunt who was here a moment ago--that there are plenty of areas to save \nin the Federal Government. I will speak to a few in a moment. We don't \ncreate an opportunity for that kind of thoughtful discussion and \ndecisionmaking. Instead, it is automatic. It just happens.\n  What is wrong with cutting every line of the budget by a certain \npercentage? Well, let's take it home. Let's talk about an American \nfamily. Let's assume that family has just learned that next year, due \nto circumstances beyond their control, they are going to be making $500 \nless each month; somebody lost a job in the family or something like \nthat. They look at the family budget and they say: We are going to have \nto tighten things up and make some hard choices. Someone else at the \nfamily table says: Wait a minute, We don't have to do it that way. What \nwe should do since $500 is maybe 5 percent of what we take home in pay, \nlet's cut everything we spend by 5 percent. If we do that, we will be \nable to reach that $500 mark.\n  When they stop and think about it for a minute, they realize that \ndoesn't make any sense at all. We are going to cut our mortgage payment \nby 5 percent? We cannot do that; we will default on our mortgage, and \nwe will lose our home. We will cut our utility payment by 5 percent? \nThey will cut off the lights. We cannot cut the prescription drugs by 5 \npercent. We need that medicine to keep our children healthy. No, we \nhave to look at a more thoughtful way. Let's look at parts where we \nspend money that we can afford to cut.\n  That is how families budget, that is how the government should \nbudget, but sequestration doesn't cut budgets that way. It cuts it by \neach line item--the mortgage, the utility bill, the prescription drugs \nare all cut the same. That is what we face starting tomorrow. Well, \nthere are ways to avoid that. The most important opportunity will come \ntomorrow afternoon. President Obama is bringing the congressional \nleaders--the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans, all four--\ntogether for a meeting in the White House. Let's hope cooler heads \nprevail. Once again, we are at the deadline. Once again, the American \npeople are looking to us and wondering what is going to happen.\n  What is at stake here? There are several things at stake. One of the \nthings that is at stake is that the cuts for many agencies are going to \nbe unreasonable. It will be unreasonable because they have to be done \nin a matter of 5 or 6 months. I am now chair of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee. It means that most of the civilian \nemployees who work for the Department of Defense are going to lose 1 \nday's pay\n\n[[Page S968]]\n\neach week. It will result in a 20-percent cut in pay between now and \nthe end of the year and will be a hardship on some families.\n  Don't believe these are fat-cat Federal employees. Many of them are \nstruggling families doing jobs in our Department of Defense which are \ncritical for our Nation's security. They range across the board from \nsome of the most sophisticated decisionmaking to keep us safe as a \nNation to the very basics of keeping the lights on in the buildings \nwhere these decisions are made. They are going to see this kind of \nfurlough, reduction in pay and, unfortunately, reduction in \nproductivity because of it. That is not good.\n  Other things are going to happen because of it. When workers are laid \noff at a depot where they repair a ship, it means the ship that was in \nfor repairs has to stay there longer. It cannot go out and protect \nAmerica.\n  Last week I was in a place called Bahrain. Bahrain, an island in the \nPersian Gulf, is a critical front in America's national defense. The \n5th Fleet is there. What a magnificent group of individuals. ADM John \nMiller took me around on the ships and introduced me to the men and \nwomen in uniform. I could not have been prouder as an American to say \nhello to these people who are literally giving and risking their lives \nfor our country. How are they protected while they are out there? Well, \nwe have a great aircraft carrier out there. It is there if needed. I \nhope it is never needed. It is only one of two carriers that is \nsupposed to be there.\n  The USS Truman was supposed to join the other carrier to protect our \ntroops and our interests in the Persian Gulf, but it will not be there. \nWhy? Because the Navy had to hold the Truman in reserve to save money. \nThis is just one example of how you can't contain the effects of \nsequestration. And our sailors--our men and women in uniform--are out \nin the Persian Gulf, literally in a much riskier situation because of \nit. When we talk about how easy it is to cut spending in the \ngovernment, it can be easy if we do it in a thoughtful way.\n\n  The second point I wish to make is that it is not just a matter of \nwhere we cut or how we cut, it is a matter of this process. We have \nbeen told by the people who give a credit rating to the United States \nof America that what has been happening for the last 2 years has not \ngone unnoticed. Think about your own family situation again. If a \nfamily is late in paying bills, what happens? Their credit rating goes \ndown, and then when they turn around to borrow some money--whether it \nis an installment loan for a car or a home--they look at their credit \nrating, don't they? They say: You are not the most reliable person in \npaying your bills. Your credit rating is lower; therefore, the interest \nrate you pay will be higher.\n  The same thing applies to the government. Over the last 2 years this \nstrategy that has been hitting us and says we have to lurch from one \nthreatened government shutdown, to a shutdown of the economy over the \ndebt ceiling, to the fiscal cliff, to the sequestration, is taking a \ntoll on America's credit rating. So the ratings agencies are saying: \nDon't get me wrong, it is a great Nation and a great economy, but there \nare not a great bunch of politicians in Washington when it comes to \nmaking decisions; therefore, we are going to have an uptick in the \ninterest rate paid by America to borrow money. What that means is we \nwill be paying more of the taxpayers' dollars in interest to those who \nloan us money, such as China, and less in goods and services to serve \nAmerica.\n  Now they are telling us again: If you go to sequestration and you get \ninto another hopeless political tangle, as you have over the last 2 \nyears, you run the risk that America's credit rating is going to be \ndowngraded, interest rates are going to go up, and your kids are going \nto owe more on the national debt. That is what is at stake here.\n  What are we going to do about it? This afternoon we will make a \nproposal that not a single Republican will vote for. I will make that \nprediction on the floor. It is a proposal where we take a look at one \nof the most wasteful areas of spending and eliminate it. It applies to \nmy State of Illinois, and here is what it is: direct payments to \nfarmers. I don't know why we did this, but in the last farm bill we \nsaid we will give direct support payments to farmers whether they make \nmoney or lose money. Sometimes we will give them the direct payments \nwhether they grow a crop or don't grow it. Does that make sense? I \ndon't think it does.\n  We said for a long time, 70-years plus, the U.S. Government will be \nthere when the farmers need it--when they need a helping hand. I \nunderstand that. Farming is a risky business, but direct support \npayments don't work on that principle. They make a payment regardless.\n  When Senator Stabenow of Michigan wrote the new farm bill, she said: \nI am eliminating direct payments. It saves $25 billion over 5 years. We \nhad 64 Senators, which is about a dozen Republicans, to join us in \npassing the farm bill. They agreed and the farm groups agreed that they \ncould no longer defend direct support payments. They could not defend \nit in a time when we have so many deficits.\n  The farm bill could not pass in the House. They were unable to pass a \nfarm bill. I don't know why, but they couldn't. So what we will do this \nafternoon is take that savings from the direct support payments and use \nthat to defer some of the cuts that would otherwise occur in \nsequestration. I think it is pretty sensible.\n  We will find out that not a single Republican will vote for it. They \ncan come to the floor and list where they will save money, and they \nwill have a chance on the floor this afternoon to actually save $25 \nbillion on something the farmers agree with and farm organization \nsupport--and many of them voted for--but not one will vote for it. Not \none. It is a sad situation.\n  Let me tell one other thing they ought to think about: for-profit \nschools. Does anyone know what they are? Well, if you have a child--a \nson or daughter in high school--you will know them soon because they \nare inundating your son or daughter with invitations to come join their \nuniversity. Let me give some of the biggest names of the for-profit \nschool industry: University of Phoenix. Ever heard of it? The combined \nenrollment of the University of Phoenix is more than the combined \nenrollment of the Big Ten. The second largest one, I believe, is DeVry, \nwhich is out of Chicago, and then Kaplan, which is a career education \ncorporation. These are private companies that purportedly educate \nstudents. Some do, most don't.\n  If anyone wants to know about the for-profit colleges in America, \nthey should remember three numbers. The first number is 12; 12 percent \nof all the high school graduates in America go to for-profit schools, \nsuch as the ones I mentioned, and others. The next number, 25; 25 \npercent of all the Federal aid to education goes to these schools. So \nthey have 12 percent of the students and 25 percent of the Federal aid \nto education. Well, how much is that? About $32 billion a year goes to \nthese schools, and it is Federal taxpayer dollars.\n  If we took the $32 billion that is going to for-profit schools and \ntranslated it into a Federal agency, it would be the ninth largest \nFederal agency in Washington--$32 billion to these schools. Hang on for \nthe third number. The third number is 47--12, 25, 47. Forty-seven \npercent of all the student loan defaults occur among students who are \ngoing to these for-profit schools.\n  What does that tell you? They are getting too deeply in debt, they \ncannot finish school, and they cannot find a job. What a waste. They \nend up with debt and nothing to show for it. The schools end up with \nthe money; the students and their families end up with the debt.\n  Let me recite one of these stories. I have invited students to tell \nme their stories at my Web site, and many of them have. Tabitha Hewitt, \nwho is a first-generation college student, was aggressively recruited \nby for-profit colleges. They promised her a great future with a paying \njob. What she ended up with was a student debt of $162,000. She \nattended the International Academy of Design and Technology, which is a \nfor-profit college owned by Career Education Corporation.\n  Tabitha is a veteran of the Air Force. She thought her education \nwould give her the skills she needed to be successful in the civilian \nworkplace. It turns out she does the same job as her colleagues who \ndidn't attend any of these\n\n[[Page S969]]\n\nfor-profit schools. She didn't pick up any advantage; she just picked \nup a debt. The GI bill didn't cover the tuition because it was too \nhigh, so she took out student loans.\n  Paying her loans is a daily struggle. For Tabitha, it consumes her \nlife. She sometimes has to walk away from other bills just to pay her \nstudent loans. She is constantly in battle with the lenders, trying to \nnegotiate a reasonable payment plan, and they refuse. She says she \ncan't save for anything. She can't pay for her own health insurance. \nShe probably can't get married and have children. She just can't afford \nit. She wants to go back to a real school for a real education, but \nguess what. This deeply in debt, she can't borrow any money to go to \nschool--to a real college instead of a for-profit school.\n  For-profit colleges prey on veterans such as Tabitha. They use \ndeceptive marketing and aggressive tactics. They tell the veterans \neverything is going to be great and everything is going to be paid for. \nIt is simply not true.\n  The 90-10 rule permits for-profit colleges to receive up to 90 \npercent of their total revenue from the Federal Government. These for-\nprofit colleges are 10 percent away from being Federal agencies. But \nhere is the thing: The 90 percent only includes Federal student aid \nprograms such as Pell grants or student loans. GI and Department of \nDefense tuition assistance are counted as private revenue, giving the \nschools a huge incentive to recruit and target servicemembers and \nveterans such as Tabitha. Veterans and servicemembers help the schools \nmeet the 90-10 rule and then end up with a worthless education.\n  Congress needs to stop this bloated industry from continuing to prey \non veterans such as Tabitha Hewitt. Congress needs to make sure \nservicemembers and veterans have all the information they need about a \nschool before they choose to enroll. We need to also make sure these \nschools are providing servicemembers the skills they need to succeed in \nthe workforce. Schools with awful outcomes should not be participating \nin the Department of Defense Tuition Assistance Program and they should \nnot be eligible for the GI bill.\n  Do my colleagues want to know where to save money without going into \na sequestration that lays off a lot of important people across America \nand, in some ways, compromises our national security and the protection \nof our men and women overseas? Start with the for-profit schools. These \nfolks have tapped into the Federal Treasury to the tune of $32 billion \na year.\n  People say to themselves: Why do we let them get away with it? They \nhave friends in high places. They are participants in our political \nprocesses. They can be found at many of the great parties and \nreceptions across the city of Washington and around the country. They \nare doing what they can legally do as citizens. They are finding \nfriends in high places and protecting the $32 billion a year that goes \nto these worthless schools, many of which are a complete waste of time \nand money for the students who end up there.\n  It would be bad enough if it was just a bad education or a waste of \ntime. Tabitha is stuck with a $162,000 student debt.\n  There is one last kicker. The student debt is different than the \nother debt a person has. If a person borrows money for a home or a car \nor a boat or to buy a washer and dryer and they go broke and go to \nbankruptcy court, those debts are going to be swept away--not student \nloans. Student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Tabitha, the \nbad news is this is a debt that will be with you for a lifetime. \nStudent debt is not dischargeable in bankruptcy. That is where we are \ntoday.\n  So when my friends come to the floor and talk about all the ways to \nsave money in Federal spending, I will give them two to start with, one \nthey can vote for this afternoon: end the direct payments in \nagriculture and save $25 billion. Secondly, reform this for-profit \nschool scam that costs us $32 billion a year. They are easy places to \nstart, perhaps even on a bipartisan basis.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, what has become painfully clear to me this \nweek is that folks in the Congress, folks in the Senate aren't \nlistening to each other anymore. As we lurch toward our latest fiscal \ncrisis--the looming sequester that takes effect tomorrow--I rise to \nspeak directly to the folks I work for--my constituents, my fellow \nDelawareans.\n  I wish to continue a conversation I have been having with my \nneighbors at the train station, in the Acme, outside church, on the \nsidelines of my kids' sporting events, consistently since coming here \nto serve you as Delaware's junior Senator.\n  I am focused a bit by a Facebook message I got from Sandi, a \nneighbor, this morning. It is fairly poignant. She writes: In 2011, \nwhen we spoke, you assured me the sequester was so Draconian it would \nnever happen. I feel betrayed by Congress, the Senate, and all of \nWashington.\n  She writes further: I trusted you to hold up our end of this deal and \nnow we are going to sequestration. Disappointed is an understatement \nfor how I feel. Why can't you get anything done down there?\n  To Sandi, to the nonprofits in Delaware whose funding is about to get \ncut, to the civilian workers at Dover Air Force Base who are facing \nfurlough, to the educators throughout the State who may be laid off and \nthe students who may well be crammed into more crowded classrooms, to \nthe parents whose children will not receive the vaccines they need, and \nto all my neighbors who will be abruptly impacted by what Washington \nhas failed to do this week to deal with the sequester, on behalf of the \nSenate, I am frustrated. I am at my wit's end. I am embarrassed by our \ndysfunction. I am sorry. This is simply not how your government is \nsupposed to work.\n  Our country, as we all know, has a real long-term problem--a national \ndebt now approaching $17 trillion, annual deficits for years of $1 \ntrillion, literally adding to the problem each day we don't act \ntogether. While the solution to this problem is not easy, it is \nrelatively obvious.\n  I wish to say this at the outset: Including interest savings, we have \nalready saved a little less than $2.5 trillion since 2010. But it is \neasy to miss since we have done it piecemeal, through reductions in \ncontinuing resolutions, through the Budget Control Act, through the \nrecent fiscal cliff deal. I know the general impression all of us get \nat home is we lurch from crisis to crisis and it is unclear that we \nhave made any progress at all. But we have already locked in nearly \n$2.5 trillion in savings.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, we got to hear from the Bowles-\nSimpson Commission, the Domenici-Rivlin Commission, a whole series of \nprominent economists who broadly agreed we needed $4 trillion in \nsavings to get our deficits under control and to stabilize our debt as \na percentage of our economy.\n  We have made about $2.5 trillion in progress and that leaves us about \n$1.5 trillion, maybe even $2 trillion left to go to achieve that \ntarget, depending on how we count. More than 70 percent of the savings \nwe have already enacted have come from cuts, overwhelmingly cuts to \ndomestic spending that are critical to the future of our economy. I \nthink it is important as we go forward that we achieve some balance in \nthe remaining component.\n  This Chamber will have to pass a budget resolution this year. That is \nwhat we are already working toward in the Budget Committee, a meeting \nfrom which I just came. We must cut spending, we must, in my view, \nraise revenue, and we must reform our entitlement programs. All of \nthese have some role to play in dealing with these long-term issues. \nNone of them though can solve the problem on their own, and this has \nbeen clear for the 3 years I have been serving here.\n  Our problem has been that we have a vocal part of one party who \nlargely would not entertain raising any revenue and a vocal part of \nanother party who largely would not consider reforming our entitlement \nprograms, so we have lurched from crisis to crises. We\n\n[[Page S970]]\n\ntry to force each other to do it on the backs of one piece of our large \nFederal budget.\n  So to my conservative neighbors or those in the other party, I am \nsorry, we just cannot do this through cuts to discretionary, nondefense \nprograms alone or through entitlement reforms alone. We cannot \nresponsibly deal with this deficit and debt just within those two \nareas.\n  In the last 2 years we already made more than $1.5 trillion in \ndiscretionary spending cuts. On the trajectory we are on now, in the \nnext decade the percentage these programs make of our total Federal \nGovernment will drop to levels not seen since Dwight Eisenhower was \nPresident, even as our revenues today are at their lowest as a \npercentage of our economy in 50 years.\n  Federal spending, done right, in the right sectors, fuels our long-\nterm competitiveness. I am talking about investments in education, in \ninfrastructure, in R, and basic science and curing diseases, and in \nspeeding commerce. They are key to our future.\n  One of our core areas of focus here ought to be on how do we create \njobs in a progrowth agenda for our country? By simply focusing on \nhacking off the domestic, discretionary piece of our Federal budget, it \nis like an airplane that is trying to get lift but one of its engines \nis being cut off. We need to sustain investment in some of these \ncritical areas of the Federal budget. But equally, I will say to my \nliberal neighbors, to folks in my party, we cannot solve this budget \nproblem just by raising taxes on the wealthy and on corporations. The \nmath just does not work. There is not enough we can raise there to deal \nwith the whole challenge.\n  Remember, the fiscal cliff deal we just passed in the last few weeks \nwill bring in another $600 billion in revenue over the next 10 years. \nSo we are making progress.\n  We also cannot do it if we simply ignore the poor fiscal health of \nour long-term entitlement programs either. Last year Medicare and \nMedicaid Programs--plus interest on the debt--made up almost 30 cents \nof every $1 the Federal Government spent. In two decades, on our \ncurrent trajectory, it may be 50 cents of every $1.\n  Demographics, steadily rising costs of health care will keep driving \nthis, and we must deal with it. Unless we change course, putting all \nthese things together, productive expenditures that grow our economy--\nmedical research, R be crowded out. Progressive priorities such \nas Head Start, low-income housing assistance, breast and cervical \ncancer screenings--the things that help care for the least among us or \nthat help make us healthier will be gone.\n  So in my view, why not take this moment when we still have a Democrat \nin the White House and Democrats in control of this Chamber to make \ntough choices while we have historically low interest rates and fight \nto preserve the legacy of the earned benefits--Medicare, Medicaid, and \nthe vital entitlement programs we treasure. In my view, we cannot \nsimply hope that the cost of our entitlement programs comes down and we \ncannot simply tax our way to economic health. Anyone who tells you that \neither of these is enough is wrong. Spending has to be cut. \nEntitlements have to be reformed. Revenue needs to be raised. They are \nall part of the problem, and they should all be part of the solution.\n  Somehow, though, when we actually do manage briefly to have a \nsubstantive debate on these questions, we tend to spend all of our time \nfocusing on the smallest facet of the Federal budget--discretionary \nspending--but almost no time discussing these others, the rest of the \nequation, the big drivers.\n  This place has become somewhat of an alternative reality where, if we \ndig in real hard and people get really scared and we use fancy words \nsuch as ``sequester'' or ``fiscal cliff,'' we can ignore the facts. \nThere is no question that we do have to reduce spending, but the \nsequester is the worst way to do it. When conceived, the sequester was \nsuch a bad idea that both sides were supposed to be motivated to move \nHeaven and Earth to prevent it from taking effect. That is how terrible \nit is as policy. Yet here we are.\n  I am dumbfounded. It is not as though we have not had plenty of time \nto make this better--18 months, by my count. Why are people talking now \nin the press here on Capitol Hill about whether Boehner will lose his \nspeakership or whether the first person to suggest the sequester worked \nin the White House or in the Capitol, whether Republicans have more to \ngain by the sequester kicking in or Democrats? How much time have we \nbeen spending trying to fix blame rather than fix the problem? Who owns \nthe sequester seems to be the fight of the day here. Who cares is my \nquestion. There are no winners in this fight.\n  I think the question of how we reduce our deficits, stabilize our \neconomy, prioritize spending that will grow jobs--this debate can \neither dominate the next 10 years, as we lurch every 3 months from \ncrisis to crisis, or we can address the broader, bigger question and \nfix it and lay a groundwork for health, for growth, for recovery. \nAgain, the math is not that hard; the politics are.\n  We here in Congress, with the executive branch, have largely created \nthis problem, and now we need to solve it. Tomorrow, leaders from this \nChamber and the House will go to the White House to meet with President \nObama about how to address the sequester on the very day it takes \neffect. On behalf of my constituents, on behalf of the teachers, the \npolice officers, the nonprofits, the personnel at Dover Air Force Base, \nthe kids, their parents, my neighbors, on behalf of my State, I urge \nour leaders to embrace this moment and to work not only to avert this \nshort-term sequester--not just this $85 billion in cuts--but to resume \ntheir work on the grand bargain. We need a big deal. We need it to be \nbalanced. We need it to be fair. Spending, entitlements, revenue--they \nall need to be on the table, and they all have to be part of the \nequation.\n  My question for everyone in that meeting tomorrow----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have to ask for regular order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority time has expired.\n  Mr. COONS. I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds to conclude my \nremarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COONS. My question for everyone--everyone--in both parties, both \nChambers who goes to this important meeting at the White House tomorrow \nis, How much more time do we have to fight and not to act, to attack \nand not compromise, to spin rather than solve? Based on the e-mails, \nthe calls, the contacts I have gotten from my constituents, from my \nneighbors, the time to step up and address this larger problem is now. \nThe sequester, while savage, is not the underlying problem. It is our \nunwillingness to come together across parties and Chambers to deal with \nthe underlying challenges of our budget. It is my hope, my prayer, that \nwe will take this moment and act.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/28/senate-section/article/S970-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 388, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 18, (S. 388) a bill to \n     appropriately limit sequestration, to eliminate tax \n     loopholes, and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that in addition \nto the two cloture votes on bills dealing with the sequester today, \nthere be set a time, to be determined by the majority leader in \nconsultation with the Republican leader, that without intervening \naction or debate the Senate proceed to a rollcall vote on the motion to \nproceed to my alternative bill dealing with the sequester which is now \nat the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S971]]\n\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object and will say \njust a few things.\n  Unless we act by midnight tomorrow, Friday, across-the-board cuts \nwill kick in. They are going to start kind of slowly, but they are \ngoing to ramp up really quickly. So the question for us today is, Are \nwe going to act to replace these across-the-board cuts?\n  The proposal we have put forward would prevent the cuts with a \nbalanced plan. Our plan will protect air safety, our food supply and, \nmost importantly, our national security. And frankly, Mr. President, \nair safety, which I mentioned, food supply--that is also part of our \nnational security in addition to our military.\n  The alternative that has been put forward by my friend the Republican \nleader would not replace the cuts. As I said earlier this morning here \non the floor, one of my colleagues in the Democratic caucus said at our \ncaucus on Tuesday that he understood what the Republicans were going to \nput forward, and he said it would be like sending the President an \norder: We have already decided you are going to have to cut off three \nfingers, and we are giving you the alternative to decide which one you \ncut first.\n  The Republican alternative would not replace the cuts but would call \nfor making the cuts in some different way. Republicans call their \nproposal ``flexibility.'' In fact, it is anything but that. Their \nproposal is entirely inflexible on one key point: not a single dollar \nof revenue, not a single tax loophole would be closed.\n  Now, remember, Mr. President, the one proposal we have forward says \nthat if you make $5 million a year, you will have to pay 30 percent tax \nminimum. That is it. That does not sound too outrageous. That is why \nthe American people agree--Democrats, Independents, and 60 percent of \nRepublicans.\n  Now the Republican side seeks a third vote on the Ayotte amendment, \nwhich would replace the cuts with a parade of even more unfair cuts and \npenalties on immigrants, people receiving health care under ObamaCare, \nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, those kinds of things.\n  I also have trouble understanding, as I do--I frankly do understand \nwhy, as I read in the paper, Ayotte, McCain, and Graham do not like the \nRepublican proposal--haven't we ceded enough power to the President?\n  So it is not our fault over here that the Republican leader chose to \noffer not the Ayotte alternative but instead chose the Republican \nalternative that we are going to talk about and vote on later today.\n  I return to my main question again briefly. Are Republicans really \nfilibustering a vote on replacing the sequester? My question is, Would \nthe Republican leader modify his consent to allow for simple up-or-down \nvotes on each of the two alternatives? Would it make a difference if we \nallowed votes on three bills, including the Ayotte alternative? I would \nbe happy to have three votes if the Republican leader would simply \nallow the votes to be held at majority thresholds.\n  So I have asked that. I can do it formally. I would be happy to do so \nif there is any taking of my request here. But this having been the \ncase, if my friend the Republican leader says: Yes, why don't you put \nthat in proper form--and I would be happy to do that--then we would \nhave votes on all three, with a simple majority on each one of them. \nNot hearing someone say: Great idea, then I object to the request of my \nfriend from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would say to my friend the majority \nleader that I would object. He can either propound such a consent or \nnot, whatever he chooses, but I would object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the original \nrequest?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I did that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, obviously we regret that we have not been \nable to reach an agreement. I am especially disappointed that we are \nunable to consider the Ayotte amendment, which is an alternative to the \nsequestration. A flexibility of sequestration would still sooner or \nlater have the same Draconian effects on our national security.\n  I also would point out to my colleagues that what we are about to go \nthrough is in some respects a charade because we know the proposal on \nthat side will not succeed with 60 votes, and the proposal on this side \nwill not succeed with 60 votes. Meanwhile, the clock moves on until \nsometime tomorrow night.\n  Some of us warned for a long time about the effects of sequestration, \nand if we want to have a blame game, then I will take blame, everybody \ntakes blame. But isn't it time that we prevented what our military \nleaders in uniform, who have made their careers and their lives serving \nand sacrificing for this country, say would harm and inflict terrible \ndamage on our ability to defend this Nation, our inability to train and \nequip the men who are serving? I always appreciate very much when \nMembers on both sides of the aisle praise the men and women who are \nserving in the military. I am always pleased to see that. But shouldn't \nwe be thinking about them now? Shouldn't we be thinking about those men \nand women who are serving who literally do not know what they are going \nto be doing tomorrow--like the crew of the aircraft carrier that they \ndecided not to deploy to the Middle East at a time when tensions are \nincredibly high?\n  I would also point out to my colleagues that this is not a fair \nsequestration. Most Americans believe this is half out of defense, half \nout of nondefense. It is not.\n  Under the formulation of the sequestration, about half of the \nspending we engage in is exempt, such as compensation for the \nPresident, such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, such as \npayment to the District of Columbia Pension Fund, such as the Host \nNation Support Fund for Relocation. All of these and many others were \nmade exempt, which meant the cuts and the reductions in defense were \neven larger, and, obviously, those who designed this legislation \ndecided that the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and relocation \nfunding was more important than national defense because we didn't \nexempt national defense.\n  That is disgraceful.\n  Nineteen percent of discretionary spending is out of defense. We are \nasking for a 50-percent cut out of defense, on top of $87 billion that \nhas already been enacted under Secretary Gates, on top of $487 billion \nin defense which is already on track to be cut. The percentage of gross \nnational product for defense continues to decline.\n  What are we doing?\n  A few days ago there was a wonderful ceremony in the White House \nwhere a brave young American received the Congressional Medal of Honor. \nI happened to go to an evening function at a pizza place with him and \nhis comrades who fought. A book was written by Jake Tapper, an \nexcellent book--I recommend it to all of my colleagues--about eight of \ntheir comrades who were killed. Here we are unable to make sure these \nyoung men and women serving in harm's way have the equipment, the \ntraining, and everything they need to defend this Nation. We are doing \nthe men and women who are serving this Nation a great disservice, and \nthe President did them a disservice when he said in the campaign: Not \nto worry, sequestration won't happen. The President of the United \nStates said that. I didn't say it. The three of us traveled this \ncountry warning about the effects of sequestration. Of course, we now \nknow the idea came from the White House. That is the blame game, and I \nwill be glad to engage in this game.\n  Can't we at least come to some agreement to prevent this? Are we \ngoing to lurch from one fiscal cliff to another? If we want to do that, \nthat is one thing.\n  General Odierno is one of the great leaders I have had the \nopportunity of knowing for many years. General Odierno, the Chief of \nStaff of the Army, a man who has decorations from here to there, said \nhe cannot replace the men and women who are serving in Afghanistan \nunder this sequestration because he doesn't have the ability to train \ntheir replacements. Isn't that an alarm for us?\n  We are going to go through a charade here. In a little while we are \ngoing to have a vote on the Democratic proposal, and it will not get \nsufficient\n\n[[Page S972]]\n\nvotes; and the same thing here on this side, and the clock will tick.\n  Tomorrow, on the last day, the President is going to call people over \nto the White House to see if we can address it. Where was he in the \nlast year?\n  Again, I am not taking the floor today for the blame game. I am \npleading for the men and women who are serving this Nation in harm's \nway who every single day have a hell-of-a-lot tougher time than we do. \nCan't we do something on their behalf to sit down with the President of \nthe United States, who is Commander in Chief, and get this issue \nresolved before we do great damage to our national security?\n  I thank Senator Ayotte for her proposal. It contains real reductions \nin spending so we don't have to go through this sequestration. On the \none side, now we have a choice between ``flexibility,'' which nobody \nreally knows exactly what that means--and on the other side, obviously, \na proposal that really bears no relevance to the issue that faces us.\n  I thank my colleagues for the time. If I sound a little emotional on \nthis issue, it is because I am. It seems to me we, at least on this \nissue of national security and the men and women who serve our Nation, \nshould come together. I stand ready to put everything on the table to \nprevent what could be, in the words of the departing Secretary of \nDefense, a devastating blow to our ability to defend this Nation in \nwhat I could make an argument are the most dangerous times.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire who authored this \namendment which Senator McCain and I support. She spent a lot of time \nand effort trying to fix sequestration in the first year and trying to \nlook at programs that are not as essential to the Nation, in my view, \nas the Department of Defense.\n  Let me put this in perspective. I don't need a poll to tell me what I \nthink about this. The majority leader referenced some poll out there \nabout where the American people are. I appreciate polling. It is a tool \nall politicians use. I don't need one here to know where I stand.\n  The question is, Do the people in South Carolina think I am right or \nwrong? I will have an election in 2014. I am certainly willing to stand \nbefore the people of South Carolina and say what we are doing in this \nsequestration proposal is ill-conceived, dangerous, and despicable.\n  Let's start with the Commander in Chief. This is what Mr. Lew said, \nour new Treasury Secretary:\n\n       Make no mistake, the sequester is not meant to be policy. \n     Rather, it is meant to be an unpalatable option that all \n     parties want to avoid.\n\n  That was their view of sequestration.\n  According to Bob Woodward and comments since, this idea came out of \nthe White House. The White House thought that if we created a penalty \nclause for supercommittee failure called sequestration, where we would \nhave to take $600 billion of the $1.2 trillion out of the Defense \nDepartment, that would make the supercommittee more likely to achieve a \nresult. If we took $600 billion out of nondefense, that would put \npressure on the supercommittee to get the right result.\n  We are going to spend $45 trillion over the next decade. The next \nquestion for the country is, Could we save $1.2 trillion without \ndestroying the Defense Department and raising taxes? Yes, we could if \nwe tried. Put me in the camp that this is an achievable spending cut. \nThis is not something that is unachievable.\n  What Senator McConnell said is very important. Two-thirds of the \nbudget, almost, is exempt from sequestration. When you hear Republicans \nsay surely we can find $85 billion out of $3.5 trillion in spending--to \nmy Republican colleagues, stop saying that. That is not accurate. We \nare not cutting $85 billion out of $3.5 trillion. We are cutting $85 \nbillion out of about 1.3, 1.25, because the Budget Control Act took off \nthe table two-thirds of the government from being cut.\n  I will get to the President in a minute, but let me talk a little bit \nabout my party, the party of Ronald Reagan, the party of peace through \nstrength. This is the party that believes--at least we used to--the No. \n1 obligation of the Federal Government, before it does anything else, \nis to get national security right. That was what made Ronald Reagan.\n  That is what I believe. I don't need a poll to tell me that. I don't \ncare if 90 percent of the people in the country said the Defense \nDepartment is not my primary concern when it comes to Federal \nbudgeting. Count me in the 10 percent.\n  The party of Ronald Reagan, even though it came out of the White \nHouse, this very bad idea, agreed to it. What did we agree to? We \nagreed to take off the table two-thirds of the Federal Government.\n  Pell grants. My sister received a Pell grant when my parents died. It \nis a very important program. It helps people go to college who are low-\nincome Americans. In 2008 it was $16.25 billion and in 2013 it is \n$41.57 billion.\n  Food stamps. A lot of people need help, I understand that. The Food \nStamp Program has doubled since 2008.\n  I guess the Republican Party believes the Pell grants, food stamps, \nthe FAA, and home mortgage interest deduction, and all this other stuff \nin the Federal Government should be shielded, but those who have been \nfighting the war that protects us all from radical Islam should be on \nthe chopping block. Ronald Reagan should be rolling over in his grave. \nShame on everybody who agreed this was a good idea on our side.\n  I cannot tell you how disgusted I am with the concept that when it \ncomes time to cut--because the budget politicians can't reach an \nagreement--we fire the soldiers and keep the politicians and every \nother social program intact and put half the cuts on those who are \nfighting the war.\n  So the next time you go to a military base, good luck. We will look \nthose men and women in the eye--I don't see how you could. I don't see \nhow you could go onto a military base or see somebody in the airport, \nshake their hand and thank them for their service given the fact you \nhave taken the Defense Department and made it something not very \nspecial anymore.\n  Secretary Panetta said: After 10 years of these cuts we would have \nthe smallest ground forces since 1940, the smallest number of ships \nsince 1915, and the smallest Air Force in its history. This isn't like \nthe drawdowns in the past when the potential enemy was disabled and in \nsome way rendered ineffective. We are still confronting a number of \nthreats in the world. It would decimate our defense. It would cripple \nus in terms of our ability to protect this country.\n  It would result in the hollowing out of our forces. It would terribly \nweaken our ability to respond to threats in the world. It is a ship \nwithout sailors. It is a brigade without bullets. It is an airwing \nwithout enough trained pilots. It is a paper tiger. In effect, it \ninvites aggression. A hollow military doesn't happen by accident; it \ncomes from poor stewardship and poor leadership.\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  To my Democratic colleagues, we are not going to raise any more taxes \nto spend money on the government. The next time I raise taxes, we are \ngoing to try to get out of debt. We are $17 trillion in debt, and every \ntime there is a crisis in this Nation you want to raise taxes to pay \nfor the government we already have. We have enough money to run this \ngovernment. We need to spend it better.\n  To my Republican colleagues, there is not enough flexibility in the \nworld to change the top line number. You either believe Secretary \nPanetta or you don't. You either believe every military commander--I \ndon't trust everything a general tells me, but the question for me is \ndo I trust all generals who tell me the same thing. Can all of them be \nwrong? It is one thing to have a dispute with a general or an admiral, \nbut when every general and admiral tells you the same thing--and if we \ndon't believe them, we need to fire them--we act accordingly.\n  As to the President, you have one obligation that nobody in this body \nhas. You are the Commander in Chief of the United States. They trust \nyou, they need you, and your primary goal is to take care of those in \nuniform and their families.\n  Mr. President, you have let them down. My party let them down, but \nyou are different from any other politician. You are the Commander in \nChief. How you could have considered this as an\n\n[[Page S973]]\n\nacceptable outcome just makes me sick to my stomach. I don't know how \nany Commander in Chief could have been comfortable with the idea that \nif the supercommittee fails, we are going to cut the military. You \nhaven't lifted a finger in the last year to do anything about it. You \nfinally go to a naval base down in Virginia, after the election, a few \ndays before this kicks in.\n  To me, this is pathetic leadership by the Commander in Chief. This is \nan abandonment of the Republican Party's belief in peace through \nstrength. This is a low point in my time in the U.S. Congress.\n  We are not going to raise taxes to fund the government. We are going \nto raise taxes in my construct to pay down debt and fix entitlements. I \ncannot tell you how ashamed I am of what we have done to those who have \nbeen busting their butts for the last 11 years, to those who have been \ndeployed time and time again, and to their families.\n  The thank-you you receive from your President and your Congress is we \nare going to put your way of life on the chopping block. God, if we \ncan't do better than that then all of us should be fired--politicians.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would ask the Senator to yield to respond to one \nquestion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, if I may interject, I believe I have \nthe floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have the right to ask a question from the person who \nhas the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina has \nyielded for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. My question is, does the Senator think the American \npeople appreciate and understand what this does to the lives of the \nAmerican men and women who are serving? For example, those who are \nserving on that aircraft carrier they said was going to deploy for many \nmonths and was cancelled at the last minute, the training plans which \nare now going to be cancelled, the deployments which will be changed--\nnot to mention the massive layoffs in the defense industry, which \nsometimes are not easily replaceable. That is my question.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, I don't know if they do or not. We have done \neverything we can--the three of us--to tell them what is coming our \nway. All I can say is that every general and admiral who has told us \nthe same thing, I respect what they are telling us. Leon Panetta is a \nDemocrat, but he is dead right. He has been a great Secretary of \nDefense. I trust their judgment.\n  I know enough about the military budget to know if we take $600 \nbillion out of their budget, on top of the $487 billion, plus the $89 \nbillion, we are going to make them less able to defend our Nation, \nputting our men and women at risk, and that is what this debate is \nabout.\n  I wish to thank Senator Ayotte, who came up with an alternative to \navoid this without raising taxes.\n  My time is up. I don't know who is next, but I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to interject just for a moment \nto sort out the order on the floor.\n  I apologize to the Senator from Arizona for the last exchange. I \nthought I had the floor at that point. I understand now this is a \ncolloquy.\n  I think Senator Ayotte seems to be in order, but the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee is here, so perhaps she could be recognized at \nthe conclusion of Senator Ayotte's remarks. I see Senator Inhofe, so if \nhe could follow Senator Mikulski and then I will follow Senator Inhofe, \nI offer that as a proposal.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, I don't need to be in this \nlineup. I will be talking later on. I only wanted to ask one question \nof Senator Ayotte when she has the floor.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The Senator has that right, and she will yield to \nhim.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank the Chair, and I thank very much the Senator from \nRhode Island for allowing me the opportunity to continue and for \nsorting out the order on the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator yield for a question before she starts?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I will, and then, obviously, I would like to make a few \ncomments.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, of course. The question is this--and I know the \nSenator already knows this, but others may not know, and I want to make \nsure they are aware.\n  I am in support of the Senator's bill. I am a cosponsor of the bill \nand have been since way back when the Senator first started with Jon \nKyl a long time ago.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank the Senator for that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I agree with what was said by both the Senator from \nArizona and the Senator South Carolina. In fact, it was my request that \nSenator Ayotte's measure be the Republican alternative. So I just \nwanted to make sure everyone knew that. I think it is a good idea.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank the Senator for his statement and for his support \nand I certainly join in the comments and concerns that were just raised \nby my colleagues Senators McCain and Graham.\n  Here is where we are. We are in this position where, frankly, as \nSenator McCain said, this is a charade. Both parties are acting out \nthis play where we are going to have one vote on the Democratic \nalternative that is going to fail, and then we are going to have \nanother vote on one Republican alternative that is going to fail. So I \nput pen to paper and came up with some other ways to cut spending, \nwhich comes to about $250 billion in savings over the next 10 years, in \norder to address sequester and also to have an alternative because I \nbelieve the American people see through this charade of what is going \nto happen today and that, ultimately, as prior speakers have said, the \nsequester was set up to be resolved in a way where we had alternative \nsavings that did not undermine our national security and some of the \ncore services that could be put at risk in the way the sequester is \nstructured.\n  I firmly believe, when we look at what has happened, this bill was \nill-conceived from the beginning. I didn't support it. I didn't vote \nfor it. One of the fundamental problems with it was it was a kick-the-\ncan-down-the-road exercise where we gave our responsibility to find the \n$1.2 trillion in savings--the sequester--to a supercommittee, rather \nthan the Senate and the Budget Committee doing our job of budgeting and \nprioritizing.\n  So stepping back, that is what has led us here. But I am also \ndisappointed in my Republican colleagues, and that is why I offer an \nalternative of spending cuts, because it seems to me, the way this is \nstructured we have already taken $487 billion in reductions to our \ndefense. I serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee. For 1 year on \nthat committee, I have been listening to our military leaders at every \nsingle level when asking them about the sequester. From the highest \nleaders, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the Secretary of \nDefense, we have heard things such as we are going to shoot ourselves \nin the head, we are going to hollow out our force, and America will no \nlonger be a global power, which is what General Dempsey once told us, \nas a result of sequestration.\n  This morning, we had leaders of our military before the Armed \nServices Committee and I asked Assistant Secretary Estevez: If we go \nwith the flexibility approach, does this address the impact on our \nnational security? In other words, will this address making sure we can \nstill meet the needs of our national security?\n  Let us not forget this is happening at a time when Iran is marching \ntoward a nuclear weapon, when we have conflict in Syria, and when we \nare still at war. By the way, with this sequester, the way it impacts \nthe Department of Defense, our war funding was not exempt. Over 50 \npercent of spending, as this was set up from the beginning, was exempt \nfrom the sequester, which of course is no way to find savings \nthroughout the whole government, but we didn't exempt the war funding.\n  So at a time of war, I asked the Assistant Secretary: Does the \nflexibility solve the problem to our national security? And he said: \nCertainly, flexibility\n\n[[Page S974]]\n\nwill help us deal with it, but it will not solve the problem in terms \nof our national security.\n  So that is why I decided to come up with some alternative savings. My \nproposal will not get a vote today. I think it is a time when, frankly, \nwe should be bringing more ideas to the floor, not less ideas, and \ndebating this vigorously in the Senate, instead of where we are right \nnow, which is a charade. We are going to have one vote and another vote \nand then we are all going to go to our respective sides and say: OK, \nAmerican people, we know there are real risks, particularly to the \nsafety of this country, that we should be addressing. From my \nperspective, I believe we can address them through alternative spending \ncuts.\n  Through all this, we have the President, who has called leaders of \nboth parties tomorrow to the White House. I have spent a year working \non this issue. He was at the Newport News shipyard the other day. We \nwere there in July talking about the impact on that shipyard. We \ntraveled to States around the country--to military facilities--to talk \nto the people there at those facilities about the impact of sequester. \nI think the President should have been on this much sooner, but now it \nis time for his leadership as the Commander in Chief--leadership we \ncould have used this past summer when we were all talking about it. We \ncould have been in a position to try to resolve it then rather than \ncontinuing to be in these crisis moments in which we find ourselves in \nthe Senate.\n  Where I am left on all this is that we owe it to our men and women in \nuniform to find alternative ways to save the money, still protecting \nour national security. Also, so people understand how this plays out, \nthe way the cuts are taken in 2013--during a shorter period, not a full \nperiod--OMB has estimated on the defense end it is about 13 percent, on \ntop of the $487 billion in reductions, and in nondefense spending it is \nabout 9 percent over the additional $487 billion.\n  So I would just simply ask for a time to stop this charade, and it is \nmy hope we could actually get down to resolving this in a responsible \nway for our country. That is why I put pen to paper. People can be \ncritical of my proposal, but I think that now is the time when we \nshould have a vote on every proposal and we should have every idea come \nto the table because it is a time to stop the charade and it is a time \nto solve this problem. Let's make sure we protect our country at a very \ndangerous time.\n  I will continue to work to do that for our country. I think we can do \nit, still addressing our deficit, still with savings, but we certainly \nneed to do it, and having the charade vote we are going to have today \nwill not solve it. The American people deserve better and we should be \ngiving them better and solving this.\n  I thank the Chair for allowing me the time, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \nDemocratic alternative that would cancel the sequester for this year.\n  Before the Senator from New Hampshire leaves, I would like to take a \nminute to compliment her on her energy, her passion, and the fact that \nshe actually wants to present ideas to be discussed. I think that is \nexcellent. I want her to also know I support the concept she is \nadvocating of no more delay; that we cannot solve America's fiscal \nsituation and also important public investments we need to make in \nresearch and innovation and keep our fragile economy going by just \npunting now. I think we agree on that.\n  The other thing we agree on is the goal to get our fiscal crisis in \norder, to strengthen our economy, and to keep America strong. We just \nare going to disagree on the means. But that is OK. That is called \nAmerica. That is called the Senate. That is called debate. Let's let \nthe world watch and hear that we actually have ideas, and just as we \nare doing this minute, we can do it with civility and with interest in \nwhat is being said. I found what the Senator from New Hampshire had to \nsay very interesting, and I will have a few comments about that and \nwhat the Senator from South Carolina said, but I wanted her to know \nthat I do think we must begin to move with urgency. I do think the \npolitics of delay, ultimatum and brinkmanship, should come to an end. I \nlike the idea of debating ideas and look forward to that both in \nconversation and so on.\n  I just wanted to say that to her.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Would the Senator from Maryland yield for a brief \ncomment?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank the Senator, and I wanted to first say I know she \nis the new chair of the Appropriations Committee and I congratulate her \non that. As we go forward, as we look at why we are where we are, if we \ncan get back to regular order in the Senate, with a budget and a \nregular appropriations process, I think we would do a great service for \nthe American people and eliminate this crisis-to-crisis mode. I know, \nas the new chair of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Mikulski will \nplay a leadership position in doing that.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I absolutely will. Just to respond, first of all, I \nhave a great vice chairman, Senator Richard Shelby, from the other side \nof the aisle, who shares that same idea.\n  What does the regular order mean? It means we bring out one bill at a \ntime; that we don't have a $1 trillion bill on the floor at one time, \nwhere we can't discuss it, debate it, analyze it, and certainly no more \nof these 7,000-page bills, where we find things have parachuted into \nthe bill in the middle of the night.\n  I agree with my colleague and I look forward to that, and I must say \nI have enjoyed working with her and look forward to doing more of the \nsame.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I do want to speak in support of the \nbill that is offered as our Democratic alternative. It is a balanced \nsolution to preventing the dysfunctional, disruptive, across-the-board \nspending cuts called sequester. Sequester is a Washington word and a \nWashington invention we came up with during the budget crisis debacle \nin August of 2011, where we would cut $1 trillion over 10 years or $110 \nbillion at a time. That was supposed to have been resolved through the \nsupercommittee, but that didn't happen. It was supposed to have been \nresolved through the fiscal cliff, all the way up to New Year's Eve. \nWhat happened? We punted. We delayed for 2 months, and so here we are.\n  While we are facing the Draconian implications of the sequester, we \ndo have an answer. That answer is composed of a balanced approach, \nwhere we look at increased revenue and strategic cuts that will not \ncripple our economy nor weaken America's strength here or abroad.\n  What does it do? Yes, it does go to increased revenue. The revenue we \nare talking about is to close these juicy loopholes, to end these \noutrageous tax earmarks that happen in the stealth of the night. Look, \nwe got rid of earmarks on the Appropriations Committee. Let's get rid \nof tax earmarks on the Finance Committee, and this is one of the ways \nto do it.\n  I want to compliment the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Whitehouse. \nHe has done incredible research on just exactly what these cushy, \nlobbyist-driven tax breaks are.\n  Our closing the loopholes cuts spending, and it also protects the \nmiddle class, ensures essential government services, and keeps America \nstrong. What does it do? Yes, it does reform the Tax Code. The first \nloophole it closes is something called the Buffett rule. It saves $53 \nbillion and it means wealthy taxpayers will pay lower effective tax \nrates than the middle class. In plain English, and this is what Warren \nBuffett said, a billionaire should pay the same tax rate as somebody \nwho makes about $55,000 a year.\n  Guess what. We Democrats believe in entrepreneurship. We believe in \nrewarding hard work. So that tax doesn't kick in until your second \nmillion. If I were a billionaire, I would take that deal. I am not a \nbillionaire. But, more importantly, neither are 99 percent of the \nAmerican population.\n  We also eliminate a special loophole to the oil and gas industry for \n$2 billion where they get oil from tar sands. That would be also \nsubject to a tax. But my favorite one is it eliminates tax breaks for \nshipping jobs overseas, another significant amount of money.\n  I am an appropriator, so let me talk about spending cuts. We have \ncome up with spending cuts: Yes, 27.5 in domestic spending, and 27.5 in \ndefense.\n\n[[Page S975]]\n\n  Let me start first with defense, because much has been said about \ndefense. Many tables have been pounded, many chests have been thumped \ntalking about it. And we do have to look out for our military. But our \n$27.5 billion recognizes the reality of boots on the ground. The \nreality of boots on the ground. Our troops are coming home. They will \nall be home by the summer of 2014. Our defense cuts kick in in 2015, so \nnothing we do will in any way dilute, diminish, end or terminate money \nthat would go to our men and women in harm's way. So our cuts don't \nkick in until 2015, and then it will be $3 billion a year over a 9-year \nperiod, which our generals and our Acting Secretary of Defense, \nSecretary Hagel, now concur with. So we are OK with defense. And, most \nof all, the military is OK with it.\n  Then we also cut domestic spending. Here, we cut $27 billion in the \nfarm bill. It eliminates subsidies we don't need to do anymore. The \nPresiding Officer is from an agricultural State. We love your cheese. \nWe even from time to time cheer on the Green Bay Packers. So we know \nagriculture is important. But essentially, we have a tax subsidy \nstructure that goes back to the 1930s--a different economy, a Dust \nBowl, people vacating homes in Oklahoma and following the grapes of \nwrath trail to California. So we came up through the New Deal with a \nway of subsidizing farms, restoring the land, and restoring people to \ntheir land. But a lot of those subsidies aren't needed anymore and, \nquite frankly, a lot goes to agra business for crops not even planted. \nSo working with the Agricultural Committee--Appropriations didn't do \nthis out of the blue--we come up with $27.5 billion.\n  Much is said about asking Democrats if we know math. Yes, we know \nmath. We have $27.5 billion cuts in domestic spending, $27.5 billion \ncuts in defense kicking in in 2015. That is $55 billion. Getting rid of \ntax-break earmarks and making those who make more than $2 million a \nyear pay their fair share, we come up with 110. Quite simply, that is \nour plan.\n  I spoke quite a bit during this week about the impact of sequester. \nSequester was never meant to happen. We have got to end sequester. We \ncould do it this afternoon. For all those people who are crying their \ntears and don't want it, do they want to protect America's middle \nclass, the 99 percent, or do they want to protect billionaire tax-break \nearmarks? That is the choice. So they can rally: We don't want to pay \nmore taxes. You can't have a government without paying taxes. And \nordinary people pay them every day.\n  Do you know what drives me wild? There is this fix the debt crowd \nflew in. I watched them fly in. I loved it. They stayed in Washington \nwhere they could take expense account deductions while they came to \nlobby us. And how did they come in? On their subsidized tax-break jets \nand their expense accounts that they could deduct, from sushi to \nCabernet. They came to tell us to raise Social Security. Then they told \nus to raise the age in Medicare because, after all, people live longer. \nMaybe when you have all that wealth you can afford health care and you \ndon't need Medicare. Nobody has to take Medicare. If you don't need it, \nyou don't have to take it. If you don't need Social Security, you don't \nneed to take it.\n  My whole point was, often the very solutions are given by people who \nget the most tax breaks. That is a pet peeve of mine.\n  But really what hurts me is this: I represent some of the great \niconic institutions in America--the National Institutes of Health, the \nNational Security Agency, each doing its own work to protect the \nAmerican people. The Federal Drug Administration--I have 4,000 Federal \nemployees keeping our drugs and medical devices safe for the American \npeople. And food safety. We have to make sure those people work so our \nprivate sector works and we keep our economy strong.\n  The Democratic alternative is sound from the standpoint of policy, it \nis sustainable and reliable. We could end sequester this afternoon.\n  I will be back to talk more about it. But I think we have a good idea \nhere. Let's not follow the politics and let's not dither in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, would the Senator from Rhode Island \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I thank the Senator, the gentleman from Rhode Island.\n  I wish to ask a question clarifying the procedure. My understanding \nis there is time reserved for me after the Senator from Rhode Island \nfinishes with his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No order has been forthcoming to that effect \nyet.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. But there will be time available?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Having the floor, why don't I propose now that at the \nconclusion of my remarks Senator Toomey be recognized.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I have no further questions. I thank the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from \nPennsylvania will be next.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am rising today in strong support \nof Leader Reid's proposal to stop the sequester. We need to reduce our \ndebt and deficit. We should do so in a thoughtful manner.\n  We have so often on this floor heard our Republican friends criticize \nDemocratic legislation as job killing: a job-killing bill, a job-\nkilling proposal. We hear that all the time. Often that charge has been \nwithout much factual support, but it is part of the common rhetoric in \nthis room. But now we face an event that actually is expected to cause \nthe loss of 1 million jobs, and yet so many Republicans support these \ncuts in their fixation, frankly, on what economists call budget \nausterity, cutting your way out of a recession.\n  How has the budget austerity record worked? There is a record now, \nbecause a lot of countries have tried it--from Spain to Portugal to \nGreece, countries slashed spending to address deficits in the name of \nbudget austerity. Their record? Lousy. Persistent double-digit \nunemployment and negative economic growth.\n  The U.S. unemployment rate of 7.9 percent--which is actually even \nhigher in my home State--is for sure too high, but it is far better \nthan the rate of 26 percent unemployment in Spain and Greece, the \nrecord of 16 percent unemployment in Portugal. Our 2.3 percent growth \nrate may seem inadequate, and it is; but as we recover from the deepest \nrecession we have seen since the Great Depression, it is much better \nthan the negative growth rates in the countries that took the austerity \npath. The results are clear. The evidence is in from the austerity \nexperiments. The countries that cut the deepest have been hurt the \nmost.\n  If we want to continue growing our economy and creating jobs, we need \nto resist the European path that is championed by Republican austerity \nadvocates. We need to maintain the balanced approach that has brought \nthe U.S. economy up out of recession--admittedly, not fast enough. But \nlook at what the alternative has been.\n  Leader Reid's bill would replace the indiscriminate cuts of the so-\ncalled sequester with targeted cuts to agricultural subsidies and \ndefense spending--as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nsaid--after the troops are home when the costs can necessarily come \ndown, paired with revenue not from raising taxes but from closing a \nloophole, a tax loophole that allows the highest paid people in America \nto pay lower tax rates than regular middle-class families.\n  I heard the passion of Senator McCain--and I respect him immensely--\non the harm the sequester will do to the military. We have a way out. \nIt is a question of priorities. Do you really want to protect the \nmilitary from these cuts or is it more important to protect the low tax \nrates of billionaires? That is the choice, and that is the choice they \nare making. Leader Reid's is a smart and balanced bill, and I hope it \nwill pass.\n  To put this into some context about where we are on spending cuts, \nthe ranking member of the Budget Committee said this week that \nPresident Obama was opposed to spending cuts. I have the transcript of \nwhat he said in\n\n[[Page S976]]\n\ncommittee here: The President believes no spending, even wasteful \nspending, should be cut.\n  Well, let's look at the facts. Through the Budget Control Act of 2011 \nand several other measures, we have cut spending almost $1.5 trillion \nin the budget period of the next decade. When you include interest \nsavings--the top part--from that reduced borrowing, it comes to $1.7 \ntrillion in spending cuts and associated interest savings.\n  On the revenue side, we have only generated a little over $700 \nbillion from ending the Bush tax cuts for the top 1 percent--at least \nover $450,000 in income--and from the associated interest savings. This \ntogether puts us $2.4 trillion in deficit reduction toward our goal of \n$4 trillion in total deficit reduction that most economists agree is \nneeded to stabilize our budget. But notice, in the balance between \nspending cuts and new revenues, spending cuts are ahead by $1 trillion.\n  The ranking member of the Budget Committee said President Obama \nbelieves no spending, even wasteful spending, should be cut. And he is \n$1 trillion ahead on spending versus revenues. We have cut $7 of \nspending for every $3 of revenue, even though right now U.S. Government \nrevenue is at its lowest percentage of GDP in more than 50 years, more \nthan half a century. Our proposal going forward is 50/50, spending cuts \nand revenues. So let's not pretend we are immune to or allergic to \nspending cuts. There have been more spending cuts than new revenues. We \nhave tried to find a balanced approach and so far, in this $2.4 \ntrillion, we have not even looked at tax loopholes, at spending that \nhappens through the Tax Code that mostly benefits big corporations, \nspecial interests, and super-high-end American earners.\n\n  Take a look at how big that amount is. We collect, in individual \nincome tax revenue, a little over $1 trillion every year from \nindividuals. But the total liability of individuals under the Tax Code \nis over $2 trillion. What happens to this other $1.02 trillion? It \nflows back out. It never comes into the government as revenues. It goes \nback to people as tax deductions, loopholes, and various ways that we \nspend money through the Tax Code.\n  If you look at the corporate income tax side, it is about the same. \nWe look at our corporations--which, by the way, contribute about one-\nsixth as much into our national revenue as they used to. They are at an \nall-time low in terms of contributing to our national revenues in the \nlast couple of decades--60 years, I want to say. They are at $118 \nbillion that actually gets collected and becomes revenue. And there is \nanother $157 billion that is corporate tax liability, but we let them \nget it back through loopholes in the Tax Code. You put them together \nand you have $1.16 trillion that we can use to help defeat or replace \nthe sequester.\n  It is a big deal to look at the tax spending as well as just the \nrevenues that come in. We have done nothing on that yet. That should be \npart of this discussion. That is what we do in the proposal I put out.\n  Last year we spent a great deal of time in this body debating whether \nthe top income tax rate should be 35 percent or 39.6 percent, and we \nultimately set the rate at 39.6 percent for families whose income is \nover $450,000. But what we know is that many of those families will \nnever pay anything close to that rate. The Tax Code is riddled with \nthose special provisions that I talked about, the loopholes, the tax \nspending that disproportionately benefits high-income folks. They are \nspecial deals for special interests. Of them all, perhaps the most \negregious is the so-called carried interest loophole that allows \nbillionaires--literally billionaires--to pay lower tax rates than \nregular families. That is why in the last election it became apparent \nthat Mitt Romney was paying something like an 11-percent tax rate.\n  It is not just Mitt Romney. The IRS tracks the effective tax rates \npaid by the top 400 highest income earners in the country. In 2009, the \nlast year they have data, the top 400 earned an average of over $200 \nmillion each, 1 year's income, over $200 million each. What did they \npay in taxes on average? About 20 percent. About 20 percent on average. \nSome paid more. The nominal rate was supposed to be 35 percent. How \nmany Mitt Romneys are there paying 11 percent in order to average to 20 \npercent? And 20 percent is the same rate that an average firefighter \npays in Rhode Island, or a brickmason pays in Rhode Island. Don't tell \nme a billionaire hedge fund manager cannot pay a higher tax rate than a \nbrickmason.\n  It is not just the top 400. The Congressional Research Service \nestimates that about a quarter of people in America who make more than \n$1 million a year, about a quarter of them pay lower tax rates than \nover 10 million middle-income taxpayers. In that sense the Tax Code is \nupside-down in favor of these high-income earners. Loopholes let them \ndo that.\n  So we cut across all these loopholes with the so-called Buffett rule. \nThey are supposed to pay 39.6 percent. The Buffett rule says: Ok, take \nall the loopholes you want, but you cannot go below 30 percent. We will \nlet you take off 9.6 percent of the rate the law says you are supposed \nto pay but you cannot go below 30 percent. You can't go to 11 percent. \nYou cannot be paying lower than a brickmason pays. That is in our \nsequester replacement bill. It produces $71 billion.\n  High-earning professionals can perform another trick. They can avoid \npaying Social Security and Medicare taxes simply by calling themselves \ncorporations for tax purposes. You heard the Republican Presidential \ncandidate say corporations are people. This is the flip side. These \npeople are corporations. If you make enough money you can afford to \nturn yourself into a corporation to dodge paying your Social Security \nand your Medicare contributions. So the second item on my list closes \nthat loophole too, which is another $9 billion.\n  The next item on the list contributes $3 billion by ending special \ndepreciation rules for private jets. Private jet owners can depreciate \ntheir aircraft faster, for tax purposes, than commercial aircraft. I am \nvery happy for anybody who is successful enough to have a private jet. \nBut that luxury need not be subsidized by taxpayers. Setting aside the \nneed for this because of the sequester, this is a change that makes \nsense just on fairness grounds. It stands on its own and it is another \n$3 billion.\n  The fourth provision in my bill would end tax breaks for big oil \ncompanies. Over the past decade the big five oil companies have \ncollectively enjoyed over $1 trillion in profits--yes, trillion with a \nT. Repealing taxpayer giveaways to them is something we should be doing \nanyway. It is another $24 billion toward getting rid of the sequester.\n  The final provision in my plan helps replace the sequester by ending \na tax break that, unbelievably, rewards manufacturers that close up \nshop in the United States and move jobs to other countries. It does \nthat by allowing those corporations to indefinitely delay paying taxes \non profits from those foreign overseas operations. Ending the deferral \nloophole for companies that manufacture goods overseas for sale to \nAmerican customers is something we should do anyway to support our \ndomestic manufacturers. It adds almost $20 billion toward replacing the \nsequester cuts.\n  Each one of these five provisions would make the Tax Code more fair \nfor ordinary Americans. I love our chairman of Appropriations. She can \nspeak to issues on the floor of the Senate like nobody else. When she \nsaid these are cushy, lobbyist-driven earmarks, she is dead right. They \ndo not deserve to stand on their own. And we can get rid of some of the \nsmelliest ones and spare ourselves the sequester and the loss of a \nmillion jobs at the same time? Gosh, I think we ought to be doing that.\n  I strongly support Leader Reid's bill to replace the sequester cuts \nwith a 50/50 mix of revenue and spending. But I also want to show we \ncan avoid the sequester for the coming year by looking at the vast tax \nspending we do through loopholes and gimmicks in the Tax Code--usually \nfor the benefit of powerful corporations, special interests, and very \nhigh-income individuals. When you set that against the economic harm \nthe sequester is going to cause to our country, closing those loopholes \nshould be a higher priority, on economic grounds and on grounds of \nfairness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n[[Page S977]]\n\n                         House Passage Of VAWA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania for allowing me to go first. I assure him I will be very \nbrief. I know the distinguished Senator from Washington State is here. \nShe has an interest in what I am going to say because of her very \nstrong support of the Violence Against Women bill.\n  Earlier this month, the Senate came together in the best tradition of \nthe chamber to pass the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act with a strong bipartisan vote. I am happy to report \nthat the House of Representatives just passed the Senate-passed bill. \nThis vital legislation will now go to the President, and it will be \nsigned into law. It will help victims of rape and domestic violence and \nvictims of human trafficking who could not wait another day for us to \nact. This action of Congress will prevent terrible crimes and help \ncountless victims rebuild their lives.\n  Today Congress showed that we still can act in a bipartisan way. I \nthank Senator Crapo for being my partner on this legislation from the \nbeginning, and I was glad when he and Senator Murkowski, another \nsteadfast supporter, joined me on a bipartisan letter earlier this week \nasking Speaker Boehner to pass this legislation to help all victims of \ndomestic and sexual violence. Today, the House followed the Senate's \nexample, and listened to the call from thousands of survivors of \nviolence and law enforcement by passing this fully-inclusive, life-\nsaving legislation with a bipartisan vote.\n  We made the Violence Against Women Act our top priority this Congress \nbut it should not have taken this long. Our bill was written with the \ninput of law enforcement, victims, and the people who work with victims \nevery day to address real needs. None of the commonsense changes it \nincluded should have been controversial. Still, at a time when we face \ngridlock and stonewalling on even the most compelling issues, I am glad \nto see that we could find a way to cut through all of that to help \nvictims of violence.\n  This new law will make lives better. It will encourage and fund \npractices proven to help law enforcement and victim service providers \nreduce domestic violence homicides. It will lead to more investigation \nand prosecution of rape and sexual assault crimes and more services \nprovided to victims of those crimes. It will also help eliminate \nbacklogs of untested rape kits to help those victims receive justice \nand security promptly.\n  This reauthorization, like every VAWA reauthorization before it, \ntakes new steps to ensure that we can reach the most vulnerable victims \nwhose needs are not being met. For the first time, it guarantees that \nall victims can receive needed services, regardless of sexual \norientation or gender identity. This law strengthens protections for \nvulnerable immigrant victims. It ensures that colleges and universities \nwill do more to protect students from domestic and sexual violence. \nThis reauthorization also takes important new steps to combat the \nappalling epidemic of domestic violence on tribal lands and to ensure \nthat no perpetrators of this terrible crime are above the law.\n  The bill that the President will sign also includes the Trafficking \nVictims Protection Reauthorization Act, which continues and strengthens \neffective programs to help us take on the scourge of human trafficking. \nIt is unacceptable that 150 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, \nthe evils of sex trafficking and labor trafficking, forms of modern day \nslavery, still exist around the world and even in the United States. It \nhas been too difficult, but I am glad that Congress is finally acting \nonce again to address trafficking.\n  I will never forget going as a young prosecutor to crime scenes at \n2:00 in the morning and seeing the victims of these awful crimes. As we \nworked on this bill, I heard the moving stories in hearings and rallies \nand meetings of those who survived true horrors and had the courage to \nshare their stories in the hopes that others could be spared what they \nwent through. We have finally come together to honor their courage and \ntake the action they demanded.\n  I thank the many Senators and Representatives of both parties who \nhave helped to lead this fight, and the leadership of both Houses who \nhave prioritized moving this vital legislation. I thank Representative \nCole for his steadfast dedication to help preserve the protections for \nNative women. But most of all, I thank the tireless victims, advocates, \nand service providers who have given so much of themselves to ensure \nthat this legislation would pass and that, when it did, it would make a \nreal difference. Lives will be better because of their work and because \nof this law.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I rise to address the issue of the \nsequestration and the Democratic and Republican alternatives. But I \nwant to start by expressing how disappointed I am that we are having \nthe debate in this fashion. This is certainly among the very most \nimportant issues we are grappling with--should be grappling with as a \nSenate, as a Congress, as a Federal Government. Getting ourselves on a \nsustainable fiscal path is as important as anything we can be doing. \nThe sequestration is an important part of that, and unfortunately the \nmajority party here does not want to have a full and open debate and \nwill not permit multiple amendments from both sides.\n  I don't know how many ideas there are on the Democratic side. I know \nthere are at least three or four or five different ideas on the \nRepublican side. Frankly, I think any sensible approach to this ought \nto have a full and open, robust debate and I am happy to vote on every \none of them. I will vote against some, I will probably vote for others. \nBut why in the world would we say there can only be two choices, one \nDemocratic choice and one Republican choice? I have to say I am \nextremely disappointed that we have gotten to this point where we \ncannot have an open debate and amendments on a wide range of ideas, \nbecause the challenges require that kind of response. It is very \ndisappointing that the majority party refuses to conduct that debate \nand appears unwilling to have those votes.\n  Nevertheless, I have developed a bill, together with Senator Inhofe, \nwhich I think is a much more sensible way to achieve the savings we \nbadly need. I will say unequivocally, we need to trim spending. We \ncannot continue spending at the rate we have been spending money. We \ncannot continue trillion dollar deficits. We have a $16 trillion debt. \nThe massive deficits and the accumulated debt are today costing us jobs \nand holding back our economy, so we need to begin the process of \ngetting spending under control. Frankly, the sequester barely starts \nthat process.\n  The President has been campaigning around the country, spreading this \nidea that somehow we are going to have a complete economic disaster and \nmeltdown if this modest spending discipline goes ahead. We keep hearing \nabout austerity. The question is, what austerity? Let me put a little \ncontext into what we are talking about here.\n  First of all, over the last 12 years, the Federal Government has \ndoubled in size. We spend 100 percent more now than we did a dozen \nyears ago. After this huge run-up in the size of Federal spending, this \nsequester--if it goes into effect or its equivalent--would reduce \nspending by 2.3 percent. After growing by 100 percent, we cannot find \n2.3 percent? By the way, that is budget authority, which means \npermission to spend the actual amount that would be spent during this \nyear would go down by about 1.2 percent. That is less than one-half of \n1 percent of our economy.\n  Here is the other thing. This is how much austerity we are talking \nabout: If the savings of the sequester go into effect, total spending \nby the government in 2013 will be greater than spending was in 2012. So \nlet's just be clear about what is going on here. This is not nearly the \namount of savings we need. This is merely one step in the right \ndirection. While government has been growing, the economy has not. We \nhave had all of this spending growth. We have had massive deficits. \nWhat have we gotten in return? The worst economic recovery from any \nrecession since the Great Depression.\n  We have an unemployment rate that is persistently unacceptably high. \nEight percent is the official measure of unemployment, but when we take \ninto\n\n[[Page S978]]\n\naccount the people who have given up looking for work altogether, it is \nmuch higher than that. The fact is economic growth doesn't depend on a \nbloated government that is always growing.\n  In fact, we will have stronger economic growth as soon as we begin to \ndemonstrate that we can get on a sustainable fiscal path, as soon as we \ncan start to take the threat of a fiscal collapse off the table by \nshowing we can get spending under control. It is absolutely essential \nfor the sake of our economy and job growth that we achieve the savings \nof this sequester.\n  I am the first to acknowledge there are a couple of problems with the \nway this legislation goes about it, and that is the reason I introduced \nthis legislation along with Senator Inhofe. The two big problems are, \nfirst, the savings hit our defense budget disproportionately. The \ndefense budget is about 18 percent of total spending, but it is half of \nthis whole sequester, and that is after we have already cut defense \nspending. I am very sympathetic to the concern that this imposes a real \nproblem on our defense budget.\n  The second problem is that the cuts are not very thoughtfully \ndesigned. There is no discretion or flexibility. The categories that \nare subject to the sequestration are spending cuts across the board. \nThere are huge categories that are not subjected, such as the entire \nSocial Security Program and many others that are not affected at all. \nBut for those programs that are cut, there is no ability to discern \nwhich programs ought to be cut more or which ones ought to be cut less \nand which ones, perhaps, should not be cut at all.\n  The bill Senator Inhofe and I have introduced and will be voting on \ntoday--at least the cloture motion--addresses both of these problems. \nIt does require that we achieve the savings of the sequester--and that \nis very important--but it would allow the President flexibility in how \nit is achieved so we don't have these very ham-handed, poorly designed, \nacross-the-board cuts.\n  If the bill passes, the President will be able to go to his service \nchiefs on the defense side, he could go to his agency and department \nheads on the nondefense side and say: OK. Look, you have been used to \nbudgets that keep growing and growing, and that is what has been \nhappening. This year you are going to have to cut back a little bit. It \nwill be a few pennies of every dollar. Look for the programs that are \nworking least well or not at all. Look for areas where there is waste \nand inefficiency. Look for redundancies, and that is where we are going \nto trim a little bit, and we will hit these goals.\n  That is what competent managers in any business would do. That is \nwhat families have to do, and that is what State and local governments \nhave to do. That is what we need to do here, and that is what this bill \nwould enable the President to do. He would have to find the areas where \nwe can make the cuts without causing great disruption.\n  This is not a blank check for the President. There are constraints on \nwhat the President could do under the legislation that Senator Inhofe \nand I are proposing. For instance, there could be no tax hike. We don't \nthink we need still more tax increases after all the ones we have \nrecently been through. The defense cuts could not be any greater than \nwhat is contemplated in the current sequestration. Under Senator \nInhofe's approach and mine, they could be less. The President could \nchoose to follow the advice of his senior military advisers and cut the \ndefense budget a little bit less and shift this elsewhere.\n  I am one who believes our defense budget should not be exempt from \nscrutiny, from spending discipline, and some cuts, but I think they \nought to be done carefully and thoughtfully.\n  The President would not be able to increase any amounts. This is not \nan exercise in just shifting money to another account. It is a question \nof where we can do the cuts most thoughtfully and sensibly. Any cuts in \nthe defense budget would have to be consistent with the National \nDefense Authorization Act that has been passed. The President would \nhave to achieve 100 percent of the savings; that is part of this. He \ncould not use any gimmicks to do it. There would be no phony cuts in \nthe future offset by promises for cuts at another time. There would be \nnone of that. It would have to be straightforward and honest.\n  Finally--and I think this is an important part--Congress would have a \nfinal say. When the President--under this approach if it were to pass \nand be signed into law--would be required to propose an alternative \nseries of cuts, and then Congress could vote to disapprove them if \nCongress chose to do that. Ultimately, Congress would still control \nthat important element of the purse strings, but we would allow the \nPresident to find the most sensible way to do this.\n  The President is saying he does not want this flexibility. That is \nkind of unbelievable to me. He is going around the country scaring the \nAmerican people and threatening all kinds of disastrous things he says \nhe will have to do. Then in the same breath he says: By the way, don't \ngive me the flexibility to do something else. I don't understand that. \nIt seems to me the obvious thing to do is to do these cuts in a way \nthat would not be disruptive and would not do harm.\n  Let me give one particular example: A good example is the FAA. If the \nsequester goes into effect on the FAA, the budget there will be cut by \n$670 million. That is from a total of just about $17 billion.\n\n  The President and the Transportation Secretary have said if the \nsequester goes into effect, they are going to lay off air traffic \ncontrollers; they might have to shut down control towers; we will have \nlong delays at airports with flights being canceled. All kinds of \nproblems. It is interesting to note, if the sequester goes into effect, \nthe amount of funding available to the FAA will still be more than what \nthe President asked for in his budget.\n  In his budget request was the President planning on laying off air \ntraffic controllers and shutting down airports and control towers? I \nrather doubt it. So if we gave the President the flexibility just \nwithin the FAA budget, the President could adopt the kinds of savings \nthat he proposed in his own budget and have enough money to pay all of \nthe air traffic controllers and keep the airports running. The point is \neven within the FAA's budget, there would be no service disruptions \nwhatsoever. They are not necessary.\n  Our bill would give the President even more flexibility. He would be \nable to achieve savings in other areas. In other words, he would not \nhave to hit a particular savings number for the FAA. He might find \nsavings in other places. Let me suggest we have an unbelievably lengthy \nlist of opportunities to reduce excessive and wasteful government \nspending. Instead of closing down air traffic control facilities or \nmilitary bases or FBI offices, maybe what the President could do is cut \nback on Federal employee travel.\n  We spend $1 billion a year for Federal employees to go on conferences \nand trips. Maybe we could cut back on the cell phone subsidies where we \nbuy cell phones for people, costing $1.5 billion a year. We spend \nmillions of dollars on an old-fashioned style trolley in St. Louis, \nmillions on a sports diplomacy exchange program. We have 14,000 vacant \nand underutilized properties. We spend money for a cowboy poetry \nfestival and $1 million for taste-testing foods to be served on Mars.\n  I don't know about anybody else, but I think some of these are a \nlittle less important than keeping our air control system intact and \nsafe. To me, it seems like common sense that we ought to give the \nPresident the discretion he needs to reduce the spending on the less \nvital things and continue to fund the important things.\n  We don't have to only go after wasteful spending, we have an \nunbelievable number of redundancy in duplicate programs. I have just a \nfew examples. We have 80 different economic development programs spread \nacross the Federal Government. We have 94 different programs to \nencourage the construction of green buildings. We have 47 different job \ntraining programs.\n  Doesn't it make sense if we are going to have some savings that we \nlook to those programs that are not working so well? It cannot be that \nevery program is equal. I guarantee that some of them are not working \nso well. I would like to think that the administration has metrics for \nperformance and it knows which ones are performing better and which \nones are not. We could concentrate the cuts on those that are not \nworking or we could decide to consolidate this huge plethora of \nprograms\n\n[[Page S979]]\n\nand save a lot of money and overhead in administrative and bureaucracy \ncosts.\n  There is just any number of ways to achieve savings. Senator Tom \nCoburn has made an enormous contribution to our Federal Government by \nproviding exhaustive litanies of duplication, redundancies, waste, and \nexcesses. In addition to what I have mentioned, that would be a very \nuseful place to begin in terms of finding alternatives.\n  I would simply say we have a simple choice here. This sequester is \ngoing into effect. Nobody here suggests they have the votes or they \nhave a way to prevent it. So the question is, Are we going to achieve \nthese savings through badly designed spending cuts that make no attempt \nwhatsoever to distinguish between more sensible government spending and \nless sensible government spending or will we adopt this bill that \nSenator Inhofe and I have introduced which will give the President the \nflexibility to cut where the cuts would not be painful, where there is \nwaste, and where there are excesses? We are talking about what will \namount in actual outlays to a little over 1 percent of the total \ngovernment spending. This is a government that has doubled in size in \nthe last 12 years.\n  The people in Pennsylvania who I represent don't believe that every \ndollar of government spending is spent wisely and prudently and is \nnecessary. They know that there is a lot of waste.\n  This is all about the next 6 months. As we know, the $1.2 trillion in \nsavings in subsequent years is achieved by statutory spending caps. In \nthose years the savings will be figured out by the Appropriations \nCommittee, which is where this should be happening. I wish we had taken \nup an appropriations bill over this last year, but we didn't. At least \ngiven the reality that we face, we have an opportunity to avoid the \nkind of calamity and disaster that is being threatened and is \ncompletely unnecessary.\n  I hope we will do the commonsense thing and adopt a bill that will \ngive the President the flexibility he needs to make these cuts in a \nrational and sensible fashion. We need to achieve the savings for the \nsake of economic growth and job creation. This is no time to trade \nhigher taxes for more spending, as my Democratic colleagues would \nprefer. This is a time to make sensible cuts in spending. We can do \nthat, and I urge adoption of the measure that Senator Inhofe and I have \nproposed.\n  I yield back the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, in the last 2 weeks we have learned \nmore and more what the across-the-board cuts for sequestration really \nmean for our families and our communities that we all represent. We \nhave heard of workers who are on pins and needles about getting a \nlayoff notice. We have heard from businesses that are expecting fewer \ncustomers. We heard from school superintendents wondering how they are \ngoing to absorb deeper cuts on the budgets that are already extremely \ntight.\n  After 2 years of watching our economy lurch from crisis to crisis, I \nthink we can all agree the American people have dealt with more than \nenough of this. That is why I am here today urging our colleagues to \nsupport the American Family Economic Protection Act which will replace \nthe automatic cuts from sequestration in a responsible and a fair way.\n  Our legislation builds on the precedent that was set in the year-end \ndeal, and it is in line with the balanced approach that the American \npeople favor. It would replace the first year of the sequestration with \nequal amounts of responsible spending cuts and revenue from the \nwealthiest Americans and biggest corporations. Half of the deficit \nreduction would come from responsible cuts evenly divided between \ndomestic and defense spending.\n  As the drawdown from Afghanistan is completed, our bill will make \ntargeted reductions in an overall defense budget which will be phased \nin responsibly as the drawdown from Afghanistan is completed and are in \nline with the strong military strategy for the 21st century.\n  Our bill would eliminate the direct payments to farmers that have \nbeen paid out even during good times for crops that are not \ngrown. Those are the kinds of cuts we can and should make, because \nresponsibly tackling our debt and deficit is crucial to our country's \nlong-term strength and prosperity.\n\n  But to do this in a way that puts American families and our economy \nfirst, we are all going to have to do our fair share, and middle-class \nfamilies and seniors and the most vulnerable Americans shouldn't be \nasked to share the whole burden alone.\n  Our bill would replace half the sequestration with new revenues from \nthe wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations. It calls on the \nwealthiest Americans to pay at least the same marginal tax rate on \ntheir income as our middle-class families pay. It will help reduce the \ndeficit by eliminating a tax break that encourages companies to ship \njobs overseas and by getting rid of a special tax loophole for oil \ncompanies. At a time when there are so many American families \nstruggling just to get their kids off to college or to pay their \nmortgage or to put food on the table, it only seems fair to ask those \nwho can afford it the most to contribute to this national challenge as \nwell.\n  My Republican colleagues will say the year-end deal closed the door \non revenue. Most of them seem to think that closing loopholes for the \nrichest Americans is too high a price to pay--even to replace the \nserious cuts to defense that are going into effect. Instead, they say \nall we need is more spending cuts.\n  But that is not how the American people see it. More than a month \nafter the year-end deal, 76 percent of Americans--and, by the way, 56 \npercent of Republicans--favored a combination of spending cuts and \nrevenue increases to reduce our deficit.\n  We also know the American people want an end to the cycle of looming \ndeadlines and uncertainty and political posturing we are seeing here in \nWashington, DC. They have spent enough time wondering if infighting in \nCongress will affect their paycheck or the businesses they have worked \nhard to rebuild or the future they want for their children. I think we \ncan all agree our constituents deserve a solution and some certainty.\n  So our legislation meets Republicans halfway. It reflects the \nbalanced approach the majority of the American public wants. It \nprotects families and communities we represent from slower economic \ngrowth and fewer jobs and a weakened national defense. And it allows us \nto move past this sequestration debate toward a fair, comprehensive \nbudget deal that provides certainty for American families and \nbusinesses.\n  While the Democrats have taken a balanced and responsible approach in \nour sequestration replacement bill, Republicans have gone in a very \ndifferent direction. They seem to be more focused today on trying to \nmake sure President Obama gets the blame for these cuts than actually \ntrying to stop them. We have all been hearing from our constituents. \nThey want us to come together to solve this problem. They want to see \ncompromise. They want to see a balanced replacement. But the Republican \nInhofe-Toomey bill fails to meet these expectations. It does not solve \nthe problem. It doesn't stop sequestration. It is not a compromise. I \nurge all of our colleagues to oppose it.\n  The Republican Inhofe-Toomey bill would keep in place the massive \ncuts to both domestic and defense spending. It wouldn't replace them; \nit would lock them in. Instead of making the tough decisions required \nto replace those cuts with responsible deficit reduction the way our \nbill does, the Republican bill simply hands the problem off to the \nPresident. Instead of taking a balanced approach--the approach that is \nfavored by the vast majority of the American people--the Republican \nbill would protect the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations \nfrom paying even a penny more in taxes to help us solve this, while \npushing the entire burden of deficit reduction onto the backs of our \nfamilies and our communities and national defense programs. Their bill \nwould protect defense spending from cuts, open up nondefense spending \nto more cuts, and specifically prohibit raising revenue to replace the \ncuts.\n  One of my Republican colleagues who is very concerned about the cuts \nto defense spending that would be locked in by this Republican bill \ncalled this approach ``a complete cop-out.'' That\n\n[[Page S980]]\n\nsame Republican said if something such as this were to pass, \nRepublicans would be forcing President Obama to make impossible choices \nand then ``every decision he'll make, we'll criticize.''\n  Another Republican opposed this approach as well, saying, ``I believe \nthe appropriations process belongs in the legislative branch.'' That is \nus.\n  The Republican bill will be devastating to our economy. The \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated that sequestration would \ncause 750,000 workers to lose their jobs by the end of this year. They \nestimate the economy would shrink by six-tenths of a percent by the end \nof the year. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Tuesday that \nrearranging these cuts would not have any substantial impact on the \nnear-term economic picture.\n  Republicans have spent months talking about how they would not raise \ntaxes on the rich and that we need a cut-only approach. But now they \ncan't even agree on a bill that names a single cut. They want the \nPresident to do it. Leader Reid and Leader McConnell agreed to have \nthese votes we are having today over 2 weeks ago, and it took the \nRepublicans until last night to decide what they were even going to \nbring to the table. After all that time, they decided to play political \ngames and not make any of the tough choices.\n  Tackling our debt and deficit responsibly is a serious issue, so I \nhope Republicans get serious. I hope they will listen to their \nconstituents, come back to the table, and work with us on a responsible \nreplacement to these automatic cuts that are scheduled to begin \ntomorrow.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our approach, the American Family \nEconomic Protection Act, and to oppose the Toomey-Inhofe bill.\n\n\n                                  Vawa\n\n  Before I yield the floor, I wish to say that I am very pleased the \nHouse of Representatives just took up and passed the long delayed, very \nhard-won, and badly needed victory for millions of women in this \ncountry, the Violence Against Women Act that was just passed. That \nmeans that after over 16 months of struggle, tribal women in this \ncountry, the LGBT community, immigrants, and women on colleges campuses \nwill now have the tools and resources this life-saving bill provides.\n  The passage of VAWA today is validation of what we all have been \nsaying on this side, and I am proud of the Senate for its bipartisan \nwork. I see Senator Crapo here today, and I thank him for his \nleadership on this critical issue.\n  I have heard from so many women throughout this months-long battle, \nand I especially want to mention one woman today: Deborah Parker, a \nmember of the Tulalip Tribe from my home State who happened to be here \nthe day many months ago when Congress wanted to dump the tribal \nprovisions in order to move the bill. She stood up with all the courage \nshe could muster and told the story she had never told before about the \nabuse she had suffered while she was a very young girl and watching the \nsame person who abused her abuse other tribal members because she had \nnowhere to go for recourse.\n  Today, that changes, for Deborah Parker and for thousands and \nthousands of other tribal members and other women and men in this \ncountry. I am very proud of the bipartisan work and I am very excited \nthat this President is going to sign this bill into law and pass \nsomething that is going to make a difference in the lives of many \nAmericans.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, as I look at my watch, the clock is \nticking toward midnight. Midnight becomes March 1, and that is the \npoint at which the sequester kicks in, which is the across-the-board \ncuts--hardly massive when this year it will be about 1.2 percent of our \ntotal outlays this year. So, I am not sure how the word ``massive'' can \nbe used with any credibility; but, nevertheless, this is going to \nhappen.\n  Republicans have proposed a way to address the President's concerns--\nthe very concerns that have been stated on this floor--including the \nconcern that across-the-board cuts is no way to govern because it \ndoesn't separate the essential from the nonessential. I think we as \nRepublicans couldn't agree more. It is not the best way to govern, \nbecause it treats everything on an equal basis and basically says that \nevery Federal program, no matter what its performance over the years, \ndoesn't deserve a look at how to adjust it for its lack or strength of \nperformance. It doesn't separate what the essential functions of the \nFederal Government are from the ``this is what we would like to do but \ncan't afford to do right now.'' So, to say that this government and the \nout-of-control spending that has occurred over these last several years \nis totally functional and that every penny we have spent is wisely \nspent and has been done in the interests of the taxpayer and protecting \ntheir hard-earned dollars, and that the money we are extracting from \nthem through ever-increasing taxes--some of which happened less than 2 \nmonths ago on every American; every American's paycheck was reduced. It \nis not just the millionaires and billionaires who took the hit, because \n$620 billion over 10 years of money comes out of Americans' paychecks. \nSo, for someone to say that what we are doing is massive when this year \nit amounts to a 1.2-percent cut in total spending, when virtually every \nbusiness in America, every family in America has had to tighten its \nbelt, given the recession and the slow economic growth, when we \ncontinue to have 23 million unemployed or underemployed people in this \ncountry, and then to simply say we don't have a spending problem, as \nthe President famously said, defies common sense.\n  We don't need fancy explanations or fancy words such as ``sequester'' \nfor the American people to understand what is happening here. They see \ntheir States having to tighten their belt. They see the companies they \nwork for having to tighten their belt. And, as families, they see \nthemselves having to cut back on some of their spending or some of \ntheir future plans because they no longer can afford to do it. The only \nentity they see in the United States not addressing a fiscal imbalance \nis the U.S. Government.\n  In an attempt to deal with this a year and a half ago, Congress \npassed the so-called sequester. The sequester was a fallback in case we \nweren't able to come to grips with the problem we have and reach an \naccommodation, an agreement, on how to address it in the best way \npossible. This was the fail-safe. And all the attempts, starting with \nthe President's own commission, which he rejected, and then the Gang of \nSix proposals, and then the supercommittee of 12, all of the efforts, \nmany of them on a bipartisan basis, for whatever reason did not \nsucceed. So, what was put in place to drive a solution, didn't drive a \nsolution, and as a result, here we are with a sequester. But, to say \nthe sequester cutting, this year, 1.2 percent from total spending, is \ngoing to make the sky fall and cause a total economic meltdown and keep \npeople from getting on their planes and keep us from ordering meat \nbecause meat inspectors can't go to the meat processing plants to \ncertify the quality of the meat, and all of the things the President is \nout campaigning for, for his own program--it was the President's idea. \nMaybe it was his staff, but he certainly had to agree to it. It was \nproposed by the President and now he is out campaigning against it. In \nfact, it wasn't that long ago when he said if it didn't go into effect, \nhe would veto it. So there has been a real change here, and I won't go \ninto the motivation for all of that.\n  There is also talk about balance. Balance is a code word for new \ntaxes and for more taxes. It has been said over the past couple of \nyears, during the campaign and leading all the way up to the fiscal \ncliff vote, that Republicans would refuse to give in on any kind of tax \nincrease, even if it was on millionaires and billionaires. In the end \nthe President won that battle and Republicans supported it. Even though \nwe did not believe that was the best way to go forward to get our \neconomy to grow and to provide the kind of economic growth we are all \nlooking for, we supported that. Now, we here we are just two months \nlater with the same tired phrase that Republicans won't take 1 penny \nfrom the rich when they just took $620 billion from the rich; \ntherefore, what we need are more taxes on the American people to \nachieve balance.\n\n[[Page S981]]\n\n  It seems the White House has an obsession with solving this problem \nthrough increasing taxes and not wanting to make the hard decisions to \ncut even 1.2 percent of our total budget--2.4 in succeeding years. To \nsay we cannot, through our oversight responsibility, find 2.4 percent, \nand this year 1.2 percent, of waste, of corruption, of misuse of \nprograms that no longer are viable--maybe they were well-intended in \nthe past but they certainly have not proven themselves worthy of asking \ntaxpayers to keep sending their hard-earned money to Washington in \norder to cover that spending--when Senator Coburn, Senator Toomey, when \nmany of us--I have been standing here every day in virtually every \nsession basically saying, just through waste and ineffective programs \nwe can easily come up with this amount of money. Everyone else in \nAmerica has had to do it. Why can't we?\n\n  The charge we have heard over and over is that this is such a \nterrible way to address it that we need the flexibility so these \nagencies can move the money around and take the money from the \nnonessential programs to keep the security at the airports with the FAA \nand the air traffic controllers and also keep the meat inspectors and \nthe others who are essential.\n  In order to keep them from having to take the hit, we came up with \nthe idea--Senator Toomey and Senator Inhofe--that gives the executive \nbranch the flexibility. That is what they have been asking for all \nthese years. If we have to have the sequester, just do not do it across \nthe board because it forces us to do things we do not want to do. But \nif we had the flexibility--if you could give us the flexibility--then \nwe could move the money within the accounts and we would still reach \nthe same amount of cuts--the 1.2 percent of this year's budget--but we \nwould have the flexibility to not have to scare people or keep people \nwaiting in lines at airports for 4 hours and do all the things, all the \ndoomsday scenarios that have been proposed by the President and his \nCabinet members.\n  We bring that forward and then suddenly there is a 180-degree \nreversal on the other side, which basically says: No, no, no. We do not \nwant flexibility. That is not the way to do it. Well, what do you want? \nYesterday you wanted flexibility. Today we gave it to you, and today \nyou are saying: No, we do not want that. It sounds like what they want \nis only a solution to this problem if there is a big increase in taxes.\n  This word ``balance,'' which I say, is a code word for taxes. I just \ncame from the Joint Economic Committee where a very respected \neconomist, Michael Boskin, said: Balance is not 50-50 if you want \neconomic growth because every dollar you raise in taxes is a hindrance \nto economic growth. He said: I am not saying there should not be \nincreases in taxes. But the ratio should be ``5 or 6 to 1.'' If you \nwant to position this country for growth, you need about five to six \ntimes the amount of spending cuts as taxes increased.\n  So balance--50-50--according to a very respected economist and many \nothers--I do not know of anybody who said raising taxes encourages \ngrowth because it takes money out of the private sector and gives it to \nthe public sector. But rather than get into that argument today, what \nthe President defines as balance is simply evermore taxes to solve our \nproblem, when we know that after 4 years of effort here that has not \nworked, and it will not work.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Indiana yield for a \nunanimous consent request? I will yield the floor right back.\n  Mr. COATS. I am happy to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the motion to proceed currently pending, at 2:30 p.m. \nthe Senate resume the motion to proceed to S. 16 and the Senate proceed \nto the cloture votes on the motions to proceed as provided under the \nprevious order, with the time until 2:30 p.m. equally divided between \nthe two leaders or their designees; further, all other provisions of \nthe previous order remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am going to wrap up because my colleagues \nwant to speak also.\n  But, let me say this: I have been saying from this platform, and I \nhave been saying from everywhere people will listen that we need to \nmove to a solution to the problem. The solution to the problem \ninvolves, I believe, three or four essential elements, and I think \nthere is widespread consensus on this among liberals, conservatives, \nDemocrats, Republicans, economists, and others. Unless we address that \nwhich is growing out of control--which is our mandatory spending--no \nmatter what we do on the spending level and no matter what else we do, \nwe are not going to solve this problem and we are going to keep \ncareening from short-term fix, short-term measure to the next one, from \nfiscal cliff to fiscal cliff.\n  Already, we have another cliff which people have not paid much \nattention to at the end of this month, where we have to fund the \ngovernment for the rest of the year. That will be another drama, soap \nopera, played out before the American people. In May, we hit the debt \nlimit.\n  None of this is necessary. None of this had to happen if we had taken \nthe steps we knew we needed to take that were presented in the Simpson-\nBowles presentation to the President years ago and, unfortunately, \nrejected that and basically said we are headed for catastrophe, we are \nheaded for insolvency because this mandatory spending is growing out of \ncontrol and the amount of discretionary spending we have which we can \ncontrol is ever shrinking.\n  Yes, we need to sort out the fat, the duplication. My colleagues and \nI have been laying out things that I do think any American who looks at \nit carefully would say: Of course we do not need that, of course that \nis not an essential function of the Federal Government. It has had a \nmiserable performance as a program. Why do we keep throwing money at \nit, particularly at a time of austerity when so many people are out of \nwork.\n  Yes, we need to do that. But that needs to be coupled with what I \nthink there is almost full agreement on: The need for comprehensive tax \nreform. That is where closing the loopholes, which Republicans are \nwilling to do in order to lower the rates, to make us more competitive \nand make our Tax Code much simpler and much fairer--that needs to \nhappen. Of course, it cannot happen if we take closing loophole money \nand use it for spending, which is what the President wants to do \ninstead of using it to make our code simpler, fairer, and make us more \ncompetitive around the world and to promote growth.\n  That is a proven process. Unless we put that together with some \nregulatory reform--but most important of all and most essential of all \nis to address the runaway mandatory spending, which if not addressed \nwill undermine the sanctity and the solvency of entitlement programs \nsuch as Social Security and Medicare. The trustees--do not trust a \nRepublican conservative saying this--the trustees of the programs have \nsaid: ``You have to deal with this, and the longer you put it off, the \ntougher it is and the more painful it will be.''\n  This morning, again, Dr. Boskin and even Dr. Goolsbee--the \nPresident's former Economic Council head--said you have to do this, you \nhave to take it on. You are taking it on to, one, save the programs, \ntwo, save the country from bankruptcy, and, three, give us the \nopportunity to have funds to pay for the essential functions of \ngovernment.\n  We are not against government. We want it to be leaner, more \nefficient, more effective. My State has taken measures that quintuple \nwhat is being talked about here. We ended up achieving a surplus. We \nhave a AAA bond rating. We have made our State government the most \nefficient, effective government with taxpayer dollars of any State in \nthe country.\n\n  It can be done, and it can be done here. But what we have that is \ndifferent from what our States have is the fact that mandatory \nspending--that spending which we have no control over--is eating our \nlunch. Until we step up and deal with it, we are not going to solve \nthis problem; we are going to keep careening from crisis to crisis.\n  The real issue is--at this point, with the sequester going in place--\ncan we step up and sensibly adjust it through flexibility in terms of \nhow we reach\n\n[[Page S982]]\n\nthat goal? Can we summon the will and the political courage to do what \nwe all, I believe, know we need to do; that is, simply to do what is \nright for the future of America--America's interests not our own \npolitical interests?\n  Finally, in my opinion, that cannot be done, despite all the time, \nall the efforts made, many on a bipartisan basis--Simpson-Bowles was \nbipartisan, the Gang of 6 was bipartisan, the Committee of 12 was \nbipartisan. It is not true we are at a standoff in terms of how to go \nforward. What we have not had is leadership from the White House. \nSomething of this magnitude cannot be done without Presidential \nleadership, and the President has refused to do anything other than \nplead on a campaign basis for yet evermore taxes, which he calls \nbalance.\n  So that is our challenge.\n  We need you, Mr. President, to lead the way. We will work together \nwith you in putting together a package which achieves the right ratio. \nWe will work together to do what is right for the future of America and \nnot what is right for our political future this year or next.\n  I guess we are pleading with the President. Similar to Presidents of \nthe past--Ronald Reagan, a Republican, and Bill Clinton, a Democrat, \ntook on the toughest issues and together we worked for the benefit of \nour people and for the future of this country and we made enormous \nstrides in that regard. But it would not have happened had the \nPresident not become engaged. At this point, the only engagement the \nPresident has made is to call for higher taxes and go out and campaign \nagainst those of us who are trying to sincerely address this problem.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                       Violence Against Women Act\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \napplaud the passage by the House, just a little while ago, of the \nViolence Against Women Act.\n  I wish to also congratulate my colleagues, Senator Leahy, my neighbor \nfrom Vermont, and Senator Crapo, who is on the floor today, for their \nleadership in getting this legislation passed so early in this session \nand for helping to see that it got shepherded through the House where \nit had been so challenging.\n  This is legislation that treats all victims equally regardless of \nwhether they are Native Americans, whether they are members of the LGBT \ncommunity, whether they are immigrants. It supports law enforcement by \nproviding critical funding for police officers and prosecutors so they \ncan hold abusers responsible. It supports crisis centers for women and \nfamilies, to provide for immediate needs such as shelter and \ncounseling.\n  On behalf of the thousands of women and families in New Hampshire who \nwill benefit because of this reauthorization, I wish to thank all the \n268 Members of the House who voted for it and all the people in the \nSenate where it had such a broad bipartisan majority.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues, Senators Leahy and Crapo, for the \nleadership they provided in getting this done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I too want to stand to congratulate the \nHouse for their passage of the Violence Against Women Act. I thank the \nSenator from New Hampshire for her kind remarks.\n  I am honored to have worked on this bill with Senator Leahy and my \nother colleagues in the Senate. Senator Leahy and I have worked \ntogether for years on issues of domestic violence and stalking, and \nthis is one of the key endeavors we needed to get across the finish \nline. Now we see that we will, and we will send this important \nlegislation to the President.\n  I would also like to commend the advocates across the Nation and \nspecifically the Idaho Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence \nwho have worked tirelessly on this issue.\n  As a longtime champion of the prevention of domestic violence, I am \nglad to see there are areas in Congress where we can come together to \nsupport these important causes.\n  This act provides critical services to victims of violent crime as \nwell as agencies and organizations that provide important aid to those \nindividuals. For nearly two decades, the Violence Against Women Act has \nbeen the centerpiece of our Nation's commitment to ending domestic \nviolence, dating violence, and sexual violence. This legislation \nprovides access to legal and social services for survivors. It provides \ntraining to law enforcement, prosecutors, judges, attorneys, and \nadvocates to address these crimes in our Nation's communities. It \nprovides intervention for those who have witnessed abuse and are more \nlikely to be involved in this type of violence. It provides shelter and \nresources for victims who have nowhere else to turn.\n  There is significant evidence that these programs are working not \njust in Idaho but nationwide. The U.S. Department of Justice reported \nthat the number of women killed by an intimate partner decreased by 35 \npercent between 1993 and 2008. In 2012 it was reported that in 1 day \nalone, 688 women and their children impacted by violence sought safety \nin an emergency shelter or received counseling, legal advocacy, and \nchildren's support.\n  These important provisions are making a difference in the lives of \npeople across this Nation. I again wish to commend all of my colleagues \nwho supported this legislation and helped to move this critical piece \nof legislation to the President's desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the vote we are \ngoing to have today at 2:30 regarding sequestration, and I wish to \nstrongly support the notion of giving the executive branch the \nflexibility it needs over the next 7 months to work through this \nsituation in a more graceful way.\n  To put this in perspective for the American people, we are going to \nspend $47 trillion of your money over this next decade. It was \nincumbent upon a bipartisan group about a year ago to try to come up \nwith about $1.2 trillion in savings over that 10-year period. Believe \nit or not, that didn't happen. The sequestration was a method to ensure \nthat at least there was some reduction in the growth of spending. I do \nwant to say that there have been a lot of discussions about reductions \nin spending.\n  The overall effect of sequester over this 10-year period is not to \nreduce any spending but to slow the growth of spending over the next 10 \nyears. We are one of the few entities in the world that don't budget \noff of last year's spending. It is not like your city, your county, \nyour State government, your household, or your business. We budget off \nof projections and growth.\n  The task a year or so ago was for six Republicans and six Democrats \nto come up with $1.2 trillion. It is beyond belief that this did not \noccur. The sequester was put in place as a mechanism to ensure that \nthere at least was some slowing of growth. The first 7 months of the \nsequester is the most ham-handed portion of it. It is cut at the PPA \nlevel. It is across the board and focused on two important categories. \nI agree that it is ham-handed, and the only thing worse than \nsequestration, in my opinion, would be kicking the can down the road on \nsome much needed fiscal discipline here in Washington.\n  I hope what we will do today is get behind a very thoughtful proposal \nthat would say: Look, we are still going to reduce spending by this \namount, but we are going to give the executive branch, because this \nfirst 7 months is handled so differently that what happens after that--\nby the way, appropriators live within a top-line number, but they are \nable to weigh in on how that money should be spent, again, in two more \nspecific categories than just the overall budget. So it is just this \nfirst 7 months.\n  I was at home last week in Tennessee and spoke with diverse groups of \ncitizens.\n  Democrats thanked me for being willing to give some flexibility to \nthe President to work through this.\n  Businesses obviously held this as incredibly intelligent. They need \nto deal with these kinds of issues right now. Many of them over the \nlast several years have had to do the same kind of thing. Obviously, to \nthem, it is very intelligent to give the executive branch a degree of \nflexibility where they have some transfer authority to work through \nthis in a more graceful way.\n  Republicans thanked me because it was a way for us to at least begin \nturning the curve in a different direction\n\n[[Page S983]]\n\nand certainly still having the cuts that are necessary in growth, I \nmight add, not in real spending. That is where we are.\n  We have a proposal, the Toomey-Inhofe proposal, which gives the \nexecutive branch the flexibility to work through this. It is my \nunderstanding they don't want that flexibility. I can't imagine being \nPresident of the United States and having something that I thought was \na little bit ham-handed and having Congress say: Look, we will candidly \ndefer to you to make some transfers.\n  I have spoken with some of the folks in our security apparatus in \nthis Nation. They said this to me: Corker, look, we understand we are \ngoing to have some reductions, but if you would just give us some \nflexibility, we could work through this gracefully. We could live \nwithin these constraints.\n  Speaking of these constraints, I want to say that there is a number \nthat has been thrown out of $85 billion over the next 7 months. Again, \nknow that this is Washington's language. We are really only talking \nabout half that in real expected outlays. We have budgeted amounts and \nthen we have outlays. We do things very differently than do most people \nback home. This is not nearly the amount of reduction people are \ntalking about as far as real money flowing out.\n  I strongly support the Toomey proposal, the Inhofe proposal. I hope \nothers will join in and at least move to debate this issue. I have a \nsense that is not going to be the case today. Maybe next week when some \nthings happen, some others will be open to doing this.\n  I can't imagine why anybody in this body, if they think draconian \nthings are happening in a specific area and some judgment could be used \nto really alleviate that, I can't imagine why anybody in this body \nwould not want to give administrators of these various agencies the \nability to have some degree of transfer authority to make it work \nbetter. I don't imagine there is a business in our country, whether \nit is a one-man shop or a large corporation, that wouldn't want that \nflexibility. I can't imagine a Democrat or a Republican really thinking \nit is a bad idea to give the administration the ability to be more \ngraceful in dealing with this.\n\n  Today it looks as though we might have a partisan vote. It is a \nshame.\n  Again, this is ham-handed. We can make it work better. Hopefully, on \nMarch 27, if we continue on this course until that time--obviously, to \nme, the only thing worse than this ham-handed approach is not enacting \nthe $1.2 trillion in cuts. This needs to happen, in my opinion.\n  Maybe on March 27 when the appropriators come forth with a continuing \nresolution, they will have shifted this around to a degree that we end \nup with the same amount of spending reductions. This is the way regular \norder should work here, the way the Senate should work, the way the \nHouse should work. It is not that far down the road.\n  As a matter of fact, I am understanding that if the Appropriations \nCommittee wanted to, they could pass out an omnibus--not a CR but an \nomnibus--that has already gone through the checks. I think the two \nstaffs have been working; I am talking about at the House and the \nSenate. It is my understanding that they could pass something out in a \nweek. I think maybe there are going to be some discussions about this \nlater in the majority leader's office. Hopefully, he will give the \ngreen light to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee to move \nahead with something like this, which would be very sensible, in my \nopinion. I think most people around here would love to see something \nactually happen under regular order.\n  These reductions are necessary, in my opinion, to get our fiscal \nhouse in order. Much more needs to be done beyond this $1.2 trillion--\nmuch, much more. I don't think there is anybody who doesn't believe \nthat deficit reduction greater than $1.2 trillion needs to occur. Right \nnow we are focused on the cuts side. We focused on the income side at \nthe end of the year.\n  As we move ahead and are able to deal with these issues under regular \norder, where committees have looked at the impact, this is the best way \nto go forward.\n  Again, sequester will kick in tomorrow. I think we all understand \nthat. There is a better approach. There is a bill that would allow the \nexecutive branch to have the flexibility it needs to work through this \nin a way that is least harmful to the American people, and if that \ndoesn't work, another step with a continuing resolution in 3 or 4 \nweeks--there is another way of hitting this in an intelligent way.\n  I hope we have the opportunity to work this out in a way that is \nbetter for the American people. At the same time, I hope we will not \nback away at all from at least $1.2 trillion in spending reductions. I \nwish we would move later this year into real tax reform, which is \nreally where all the money is.\n  To the American people, the reason we are moving to sequester and the \nreason we are cutting discretionary spending is we don't have the \ncourage in the Senate to deal with entitlements. When the word \n``entitlement'' comes up, everybody runs for the hills. They know where \nthe money is--62 percent of our spending, which in 10 years, combined \nwith interest, will be 90 percent of our spending.\n  The reason we are here today is this body has not come to terms with \nthe fact that we need to reform entitlements for them to be here for \nfuture generations and certainly people who are getting ready to \nretire.\n  This situation is a shame, and so we are going through this pain \nagain due to a lack of courage in the Senate to address the real issues \nof the day. That is a shame, and what you are going to see playing out \nis solely because of that.\n  I have a bill which would deal with that. Lamar Alexander, my \ncolleague from Tennessee, is a cosponsor. It was based on Bowles-\nSimpson, Domenici-Rivlin--bipartisan concepts.\n  For some reason, when it comes to dealing with the real issues of \nAmerica, this body runs for the hills. Hopefully, soon we will be \nbrought back together and we will deal with this in a mature way, deal \nwith the real issues our Nation is dealing with, solve them, put it in \nthe rearview mirror, and all of us will come together and focus on \nthose things that would make our country stronger.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all quorum calls before the votes at \n2:30 p.m. today be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of discussions \nrecently about the author Bob Woodward and his comments about spending \nand the sequester. It is important for us to understand this. This is \nnot an easy matter. We have a lot of confusion, I think, as to what has \nbeen happening in the Senate. So from my perspective, as ranking member \non the Budget Committee, I wish for all of us to understand the issue \nthat is at stake.\n  Here is what Bob Woodward said in his Washington Post Op-Ed earlier \nthis week:\n\n       So when the President asked that a substitute for the \n     sequester include not just spending cuts but also new \n     revenue, he's moving the goalpost.\n\n  And when the President talks of spending cuts, he's referring to some \nother spending cuts somewhere in the government so that they do not \nfall so hard on defense, for example.\n  But Bob Woodward goes on to say--referring to the President's request \nfor a substitute--that was not the deal he made.\n  So we need to all remember what happened was that in August of 2011, \nafter the American people were aroused and spoke strongly in the 2010 \nelection, the debt ceiling was reached. We couldn't borrow any more \nmoney. Since we are borrowing almost 40 cents out of every dollar, it \namounted to a 40-percent cut in spending, had we not raised the debt \nceiling. So it was important to raise the debt ceiling, but it was also \nimportant to do something about the surging debt. So a bipartisan \nagreement was reached, and the agreement essentially said we will \nreduce spending $2.1 trillion, and we will raise the debt ceiling $2.1 \ntrillion.\n  The good news, for those who wanted to keep spending, was that we \nspread\n\n[[Page S984]]\n\nthe spending cuts over 10 years. But we have already reached the debt \nceiling again. We have already spent $2 trillion more than we took in. \nWe have to deal with that again very soon.\n  I would like to say this to my colleagues: That agreement called for \nno tax increases; it called for a modest reduction in the growth of \nspending. Instead of going up $10 trillion, it would go up $8 trillion. \nInstead of adding $9 trillion to the debt of the United States, we \nwould add $7 trillion to the debt of America by simply constraining the \nrate of growth in spending. It was not cutting spending. Except the way \nthe sequester part of that agreement was reached, the cuts fell \ndisproportionately on defense and maybe a few other programs. And over \n10 years, defense would take a real cut. This isn't war costs. This is \na fundamental problem.\n  What I would say to my colleagues is this: Please don't come in and \nsay, there are loopholes we can close or we can tax the rich more here \nand we can do this, that, and the other in order to bring in more \nrevenue and to spend more. You see? But we agreed to a new baseline in \nspending. It passed the House and the Senate and the President signed \nit into law. He agreed to it. And he was the one who insisted on the \nsequester, even though he has denied it since. He got that, he and his \nbudget director, Mr. Lew, whom he just promoted to Secretary of the \nTreasury. So he agreed to that. And closing loopholes is simply a tax \nincrease, of course.\n  So if we agree at some point to close loopholes, it ought to be part \nof tax reform and it ought to be part of reducing the deficit, not \nfunding new spending. Because, you see, we have agreed to this new \nbaseline. When the President says don't do the sequester, the sequester \namounts to $1.1 trillion out of the $2.1 trillion in reduced spending. \nSo he is talking about increasing spending over the amount he just \nagreed to 19 months ago. He is talking about increasing spending at a \ntime this Nation has never faced a more serious systemic financial debt \ncrisis. And his excuse is that we will close loopholes.\n  But you see, reducing the amount of new debt we incur over 10 years \nfrom $9 trillion in to $7 trillion is not enough. The budget \ncommission, experts, everybody knows--ask anyone in this Senate, \nliberals and conservatives, and I don't think a single one would say \nthat increasing the debt by $7 trillion over 10 years is good. Our \ncurrent debt is $16 trillion. This is not a healthy trend.\n  We know we can't give away the cuts we just agreed to. What would we \ntell the American people? We already told them: We know you are unhappy \nthat we are raising the debt ceiling, we know you are mad at us for \nputting the country in this situation, but we are going to cut \nspending, trust us. Trust us. And then here we waltz in, less than 2 \nyears later, with the President saying that we cannot cut as much as we \npromised, as agreed to and signed into law. He says that is too much. \nHe tells us that he is not going to help us find a smarter, more \neffective way to do the cuts.\n  I don't think that is good policy. What I urge my colleagues to do, \nand I believe it is the right thing, is to make the decision--and we \nhave no choice but to make it--that we are not going to give up the \nlittle bit of spending cuts we achieved in 2011, which are not spending \ncuts but a small reduction in growth in spending. We should advise the \nPresident that we stand ready--and I am confident I can speak for the \nRepublicans in this Chamber that we stand ready--to try and spread \nthose cuts out in a way that is smarter and is less painful, because \neverybody should tighten their belt to help get this country on a sound \npath. We are willing to do that, but we should state we are not willing \nto allow the President to breach his agreement--as Mr. Woodward said, \nthe deal he made--that he signed, that is in law and that has created a \nnew spending baseline. We should not give up on that 19 months after we \nagreed to it. What a mockery that makes of the integrity of our \ngovernment and the commitment to fiscal responsibility.\n  Let's work together on this. We had a big tax increase in January and \na spending agreement in August of 2011. So now let's get on with it and \noperate in the world we are in. I don't believe we will avoid the \nsequester by raising taxes and increasing spending over the level to \nwhich we agreed. It won't happen. So we might as well get serious and \nfigure out a way to help make this work in a more rational way.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today, as we debate proposals for avoiding \nthe so-called sequester, we find ourselves in a uniquely awkward \nposition. Not only is there general disagreement about what brought us \nhere, who is responsible, who is to blame, et cetera, but we also \ndisagree about where ``here'' is to begin with.\n  President Obama has been touring the country giving speeches \ndescribing just how bad the sequester will be and why Republicans are \nto blame for it. This is, of course, par for the course for this \nPresident, whose motto seems to be: Why solve a problem when you can \ncampaign on it? You would think, after having won the election, the \nPresident would be the first to acknowledge the election is over. But \nnearly 4 months after election day, the President's campaign road show \ncontinues.\n  The problem with the President's sequestration campaign is that, once \nagain, his claims are at odds with the facts. Everyone in Washington \nknows that, despite the President's efforts to put the blame on \nRepublicans, the sequester was his idea to begin with. The record is \nclear and it is not in dispute. The idea for the sequester was pitched \nby the President's then-OMB Director Jack Lew as a negotiating tactic \nto get Republicans to vote in favor of raising the debt ceiling. Not \nonly did the idea originate in the White House, the President \nthreatened to veto House-passed legislation designed to replace the \nsequester.\n  Moreover, in these final weeks leading up to the March 1 deadline, \nthe President spent more time on his national sequestration campaign \nthan he has in sitting down with Republicans to reach an agreement on a \nreplacement package. So if the sequester goes into effect--and at this \npoint it appears it will--the American people should not blame \nRepublicans in Congress, who have been working in earnest to replace \nit. No, the blame should fall squarely on President Obama, who proposed \nthe idea in the first place and has refused to work on a passable \nsolution.\n  So that is how we got here. The bigger, more complicated problem is \ndetermining where ``here'' actually is. The President and his allies \nhave spent a lot of time misleading the American people on that as \nwell.\n  If you describe the sequester using the worst possible numbers, it is \nan $85 billion reduction from $3.5 trillion of yearly Federal outlays--\nyes, that is $85 billion out of $3.500 trillion. When all is said and \ndone, it is a reduction of less than 2.5 percent from overall Federal \nspending. And, as the Congressional Budget Office has made clear, not \nall of the $85 billion in reduction will even take the form of reduced \nspending this year. Even if it did, keep in mind that $85 billion would \nrepresent less than 9 days of Federal spending, based on the rate of \nspending last year. Once again, that is if you describe it in the worst \npossible terms.\n  For a moment, let's go with those numbers.\n  The President would have the American people believe that a 2.4-\npercent reduction in Federal spending out of $3.6 trillion will cripple \nour government and irreparably damage our economy, even an economy that \nthe President must have felt was strong enough to absorb a $600 billion \ntax hike back on New Year's Day. The ramifications of the 2.4-percent \nspending reduction are so great, according to the President and his \nallies here in Congress, that the only alternative is to raise taxes \nyet again.\n  I will be the first to admit there are better, more responsible ways \nto reduce the deficit than the President's indiscriminate sequester. \nBut these scare tactics don't even pass the laugh test. Does the \nPresident really expect the American people to believe our government \nis so fragile it cannot absorb a 2.4-percent spending cut--less than 9 \ndays' worth of Federal spending--without inflicting massive damage on \nthe American people and our economy? Apparently so.\n\n[[Page S985]]\n\n  Once again, I am describing the sequester in the worst possible terms \njust to demonstrate the outlandish nature of the President's arguments. \nHowever, when you look at whether the sequester even represents a \nreduction in spending, you find the claims are even more absurd. In \nfact, when you look at whether we are cutting spending at all relative \nto past periods, you can easily see we are not, even with the \nsequester.\n  The so-called spending cuts in the sequester are measured against \n2010 spending levels. We should all remember that in fiscal year 2010, \nspending levels were highly elevated as a result of the President's \nstimulus and other ``temporary'' spending measures passed in response \nto the financial crisis and recession. So, in other words, the \nsequester reduces spending only if you are measuring against an \nextremely high baseline that was, at that time, supposed to be \ntemporary.\n  Whether something is an increase or decrease depends on what you are \nmeasuring against. If you measure relative to a big number--such as the \nDemocrat-fueled spending of 2010--then proposed spending looks like a \ncut. But if you look at spending levels relative to more reasonable \nspending baselines, you will find that future spending will actually be \nup even with the sequester in place. For example, you will see what \npost-sequestration spending looks like relative to a more reasonable \nbaseline.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, baseline estimates for \npost-sequester discretionary budget authority total $978 billion for \nfiscal year 2013. The average during the Bush years, in inflation-\nadjusted fiscal year 2013 dollars, was $957 billion. Neither of these \nfigures includes spending on wars or emergencies, so this is an apples-\nto-apples comparison.\n  In adjusted current dollar terms, post-sequester spending this year \nwill be more than $20 billion higher than the average during the Bush \nyears. Someone may have to refresh my memory, but I don't believe the \ngovernment ceased to function during the Bush years. I certainly don't \nremember hearing anyone express concern about the elimination of basic \ngovernmental services. In fact, I don't think anyone remembers the Bush \nyears as being a time of spending restraint here in Washington. Indeed, \nwe have all heard President Obama claim it was the extravagant spending \nof the Bush administration that, in part, caused our current budget \nwoes. Yet now the President is telling the American people that a \nreturn to those spending levels will devastate our country, leaving \nchildren hungry and our border unprotected.\n  Not surprisingly, the President and the Democratic leadership's \nsolution to this problem is more tax hikes, which makes these claims \nabout the impact of sequestration all the more transparent. Indeed, it \nappears that the President's current campaign on the sequester is less \nabout reaching an agreement to replace the sequester than it is about \nsatisfying his drive to once again raise Americans' taxes while also \nserving his desire to vilify Republicans, no matter what the costs to \nthe American people.\n  I don't want to minimize the negative impact the sequester may have \nin some areas. I think there are very few of us who would not like to \nsee the President's indiscriminate sequester replaced with more \nresponsible spending reduction alternatives. There are alternatives to \nthe approach we are debating today. But whatever we do, we should do it \nthrough regular order.\n  Today we are yet again debating a bill that has bypassed the relevant \ncommittees of jurisdiction. Regular order has become the exception \nrather than the rule around here, which is extremely frustrating I \nthink to both sides. There are consequences to skipping the established \ncommittee process. If legislation does not go through the relevant \ncommittee, it is not studied and vetted. It simply shows up out of the \nmajority leader's office before anyone has a chance to even look it \nover. Bypassing regular order is simply shortsighted. Yes, short-\ncircuiting the committee process prevents Members from having to take \ntough votes in committee. But taking tough votes to enact legislation \nis part of being in the Senate--or at least it used to be. These days, \nno one in the majority has to take a difficult vote. The majority \nleader has made sure of that.\n  I have a chart that has the title ``Honest Leadership and Open \nGovernment.'' You can see the large letters at the top and the small \nletters right against the podium Senator Reid is at. My friends on the \nother side of the aisle won the Senate majority in the 2006 elections \nby campaigning on this theme. Unfortunately, in the 6 years since they \nhave been running things here in the Senate, things have gone exactly \nthe other way. Backroom deals are the rule, regular order is the \nexception, open government is the casualty, and committees are ignored \nwith aplomb.\n  I have and will continue to urge my colleagues to support the \nrestoration of regular order here in the Senate because, in the end, it \nyields better legislative results, and it is a much more fair way to \nlegislate and involves everybody, not just a few people in one office.\n  Despite the fact that the President and congressional Democrats just \ngot over $600 billion in tax increases out of the fiscal cliff deal, \nthe Democratic leadership's bill that we are debating today contains \neven more tax increases.\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office wrote earlier this month that over \nthe next 10 years, revenues as a percent of GDP will average 18.9 \npercent. Over the last 40 years, according to CBO, revenues have \naveraged 17.9 percent of GDP. So over the next 10 years, Federal \nrevenues are set to exceed the historical average.\n  At the same time, government spending, which is projected by CBO to \nreach about 23 percent of GDP in 2023--an historical average--will be \non an upward trajectory and will remain far in excess of the 40-year \naverage of 21 percent. So the problem is not that the American people \nare undertaxed, it is that Washington is overspending.\n  Given this basic point, I have filed a motion to commit the \nDemocratic leadership's bill to the Finance Committee to strike all the \nrevenue increases and replace them with spending cuts. And to help \nfurther the process, I have prepared a menu of spending cut options to \nselect from. These proposals come from Dr. Tom Coburn's book, ``Back in \nBlack: A Deficit Reduction Plan.''\n  During the 2008 campaign, the President promised to find spending \ncuts by going through the budget, line by line. Dr. Coburn has done \nwhat the President promised but failed to do. Today, I am drawing from \na small body of Dr. Coburn's hard work.\n  For instance, instead of the latest incarnation of the Buffett tax, \nwe could, according to ``Back in Black,'' save $71 billion over 10 \nyears by instituting a 5-year freeze on locality pay adjustments for \nFederal workers or we could reduce travel budgets of Federal agencies. \nThat would save just over $43 billion over 10 years.\n  Another revenue increase in the majority leader's bill that could be \nreplaced with a spending cut is the elimination of what some Democrats \nhave described as a tax break for shipping jobs overseas. Indeed, we \nhave seen this proposal pop up several times over the last few years.\n  However, as some may recall, the Chief of Staff of the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation wrote a letter to Senator Stabenow and \nRepresentative Pascrell, the authors of a bill to close this so-called \nloophole, that stated,\n\n       Under present law, there are no specific tax credits or \n     disallowances of deductions solely for locating jobs in the \n     United States or overseas.\n\n  I previously challenged my colleagues to come and point out to me if \nthey thought that was incorrect. To date, no one has tried to meet that \nchallenge. Yet efforts continue to raise a tax under the guise of \nclosing a loophole where no loophole exists.\n  One spending cut from Dr. Coburn's book that could be used as a \nsubstitute for closing the Democrats' phantom loophole is to reduce the \nFederal limousine fleet back to the level it was in 2008. According to \nDr. Coburn's book, the government owned 238 limousines in 2008. By \n2010, that number had grown to 412. What changed in government between \n2008 and 2010 that required an increase of over 73 percent in the \nnumber of limousines needed to shuttle bureaucrats? If anyone knows, \nplease let the American people know. Going back to the 2008 level of \nFederal limousines\n\n[[Page S986]]\n\nwould save the government $115.5 million over 10 years.\n  There are numerous other places where we can cut spending \nimmediately. Instead of pursuing the Democrats' tax hike strategy or \nthe President's indiscriminate sequester, we should instead sensibly \nrestrain spending through proposals such as these.\n  I anticipate that some of my friends on the other side will argue we \nshould pursue these spending cuts in addition to passing more tax \nhikes. My response is that we should be saving all of these revenue \nraisers for future tax reform efforts.\n  There is a growing bipartisan consensus here in Congress in favor of \ncomprehensive tax reform. The leaders in both the tax-writing \ncommittees are committed to this effort, and I believe we have a real \nopportunity to accomplish something on tax reform this year. However, \nif we start closing loopholes and eliminating preferences now in order \nto raise revenue to avoid the sequester, they won't be there to help us \nlower marginal tax rates later on when we are working on tax reform, \nwhich will make an already difficult process that much harder.\n  Ultimately, if we follow the path my Democratic colleagues want us to \ntake, we will be raising taxes on the American people while at the same \ntime hampering future tax reform efforts. This is simply not the way to \ngo, particularly when there are perfectly reasonable spending cuts \navailable to replace the President's sequester.\n  As I said, whatever we do, we ought to do it through regular order. \nThat is why I have filed this motion to commit and why I hope my \ncolleagues will support it.\n  While I am waiting for someone to represent the majority, because I \nam going to have a unanimous consent request that I understand will be \nobjected to and I want to protect the majority's right to do that, as \nmuch as I don't agree with it. I know there is an agreement in place \nfor consideration of the sequestration bill and I don't want to stand \nin the way. But at some point we need to have a real bipartisan \nconversation about a return to regular order. For too long we have been \navoiding the committee process here in the Senate and I think the \nresults speak for themselves.\n  I want to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find \na way to restore the deliberative traditions of the Senate by allowing \nthe committees to do its work. If we can return to regular order, the \nwords ``honest leadership and open government'' will be more than a \ncampaign slogan. The American people should expect nothing else.\n  I understand my unanimous consent will be objected to, and so I ask \nunanimous consent that I be immediately recognized to make this \nunanimous consent as soon as the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee arrives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I thank my friend from Utah for his \ncomments. I think it is important, since we have two votes coming up \nstarting in less than 30 minutes, that we talk a little bit about the \nbackground, where we are today and what we are going to be faced with \nin these votes and what the options are.\n  Back about 5 weeks ago, when it looked as though sequestration was \ngoing to kick in, there was concern. I understand there is a lot of \nconcern on the domestic side and on the defense side, but my concern is \nmainly on the defense side. I am the ranking member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. I am concerned about what has been happening under \nthis administration in the last 4 years, the disarming of America and \nthe devastation that has taken place already. A lot of people do not \nrealize, under this administration we are now projecting cuts already \nto hit $487 billion in defense.\n  If sequestration should come in, it would raise that to $1 trillion, \nand $1 trillion over that period of time is, in fact, devastating. The \nSecretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, came out immediately and said: This \ncannot happen; we cannot adequately defend America if we allow this to \ntake place. He was talking about sequestration.\n  Sequestration, I think people kind of lose sight of what it is. It is \nthe equal cutting all the way across all of these accounts in order to \ncome up with a savings, which I think is kind of interesting. Here we \nare talking about all this anguish we are going through right now just \nfor $1.2 trillion, when you stop and realize in the President's own \nbudget, over 4 years he has a $5.3 trillion increase. So we are talking \nabout 10 years to come up with $1.2 trillion when he was accountable \nfor $5.3 trillion in 4 years. That is not even believable. When I say \nit back in my State of Oklahoma they shake their heads and think there \nmust be some miscommunication, it cannot be right.\n  The problem has been, in this administration, over the past 4 years \nall the cuts have come from the military. They have not come from \nanywhere else. It is an oversimplification, but you can make the \nstatement that they are cutting--I will yield to my friend from Utah \nbecause I understand he has a unanimous consent request. I will be \nhappy to do that, but I ask unanimous consent the floor be returned to \nme.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague for his courtesy. I appreciate it.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following the two \ncloture votes today, it be in order for me to make a motion to commit \nS. 388 to the Finance Committee, the text of which is at the desk, and \nthe Senate proceed immediately to vote on the motion without \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this Senator was probably not paying \nenough attention. This is the Senator's motion to recommit?\n  Mr. HATCH. It is the motion to recommit.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I respect my Ranking Member's attempt to \nalter the leader's bill to strike the revenue increases in this \nlegislation.\n  However, I think time is at a premium and we need to consider the \nReid legislation today.\n  Recommitting the bill to the Finance Committee will delay a solution \nto the sequestration cuts for weeks, if not months, and I believe most \nMembers believe we should address the issue here and now. There is no \ntime to waste.\n  We will have a full opportunity to discuss additional deficit \nreduction ideas in the coming weeks when we consider the budget \nresolution, the continuing resolution and the extension of the debt \nlimit.\n  I agree we need to cut our debt and get our fiscal house in order. We \nknow there are places to trim the fat in Federal programs.\n  To give families and businesses certainty, we must agree on a \nbalanced, comprehensive plan to cut the debt that includes both revenue \nand spending cuts. The math will not work any other way.\n  A long-term balanced plan will bridge the budget battles and make \nreal progress solving our deficit problem.\n  A balanced plan will also encourage businesses to invest, enable \ninvestors to return to the markets with confidence, and, most \nimportantly, put Americans back to work in a growing economy.\n  And I look forward to working with Senator Hatch, taking on these \nfiscal challenges and crafting policies that create more jobs and spark \neconomic growth.\n  The only way we will be able to get past these budget battles is by \nworking together--Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate. We need \nto work together.\n  However, at this time I object to the motion to recommit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Look, this place is not being run on regular order. The \ncommittees are being ignored. The committees are established to be able \nto intentionally look at these matters\n\n[[Page S987]]\n\nand hear both sides and hear the top experts in the country. I feel \nvery badly that this simple motion has to be objected to. I feel badly \nbecause I know neither of the amendments that will be filed, that will \nbe heard or voted on, are going to pass. One reason they will not is \nbecause we have not followed the regular order.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I asked unanimous consent I be recognized after the two \nof you went through this. Can I inquire as to about how much longer it \nwill be? I am the author of the bill that is coming up in just a few \nminutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Chair indicate the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 22 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask which side has the 22 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will be glad to yield time to my friend from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate that. It is my understanding, responding to \nmy friend, that the other author of this bill, Senator Toomey, wants to \nbe heard for 2 minutes prior to the vote. I would like to be heard for \na few minutes of time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. At this time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Right after his time, yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I don't fully understand. I am happy to yield 10 minutes \nto the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate that.\n  Prior to the time we propounded the unanimous consent request, I was \ntalking about my frustration about what has been happening fiscally in \nthis Senate during the last 4 years and the mere fact that under this \nadministration we have increased deficits by $5.3 trillion. Now we are \ntrying to come up with something far less than that in a period of 10 \nyears. To me, people look at that and say: What is this all about? But \nthat is not the reason I bring this up.\n  I bring this up because the amount of money that has come out of the \nmilitary is actually a reduction. If you look at the increase in the \nspending in the last 4 years, it has all come out of defense accounts, \nso it is defense that has taken the hits on this. Government has \nexpanded approximately 30 percent across the board. At the same time \nour military has been reduced in terms of our budget for defense \naccounts.\n  Anyway, when this came up a few weeks ago, I thought it was not going \nto happen. I thought we were going to have something come up and change \nthis whole idea of having to make these reductions. So what I did at \nthat time was draft a bill. The bill merely said if we are stuck with \nsequestration, let's allow the chiefs--speaking of the military--to \nreevaluate everything that is included so they can look and see where \nwe can take cuts and it will not be as devastating.\n  In fact, I called each one of the five service chiefs and I said: \nWould it be less devastating if you were able to take the same amount \nof money out but take it out selectively, out of accounts where it \nwould be not as significant?\n  They said: Yes, it would.\n  I said: Would you be able to prepare for this in the next 4 years?\n  The answer is yes. That is where we are today. They said they are \nable to do that.\n  The frustrating fact is this President--I am getting criticized on \nboth sides. People are saying you are giving too much to the President. \nWe are not because we have safeguards in here, which I will explain in \na minute. But at the same time, the President comes out and says he \nwill issue a veto threat against this bill. What does this do? It gives \nflexibility for the President.\n  I am going to read something. This is a statement that President \nObama said on February 19, 2013. He said:\n\n       Now, if Congress allows this meat-cleaver approach to take \n     place, it will jeopardize our military readiness; it will \n     eviscerate job-creating investments in education and energy \n     and medical research. It won't consider whether we are \n     cutting some bloated program that has outlived its \n     usefulness, or a vital service that Americans depend on every \n     single day. It doesn't make those distinctions.\n\n  He goes on to say that he wants that flexibility. This is the \nPresident asking for it on February 19, 2013. Here we come along with a \nbill that gives him that flexibility with certain restrictions so that \nhe can't pick and choose areas that we find are against the policy that \nhas been set. I will give an example.\n  We had the National Defense Authorization Act. It was one that took \nmonths and months to put together. It took a long time to put together, \nand we made evaluations, with a limited budget, on what we could do. \nAll this does is say if we have to make some changes from the across-\nthe-board cut, let's make them consistent with the National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  In other words, all those weeks and months of work by the Senate \nArmed Services Committee and, I might say, the House Armed Services \nCommittee would not be in vain. Those cuts would be consistent with the \nintent, to make sure the President would do this.\n  A lot of people say we can't trust the President; he is going to put \nmore cuts in places where it would not be in keeping with what the \nSenate Armed Services Committee wants. But we have a provision called a \ncongressional disapproval mechanism. That means if the President \ndoesn't do what the intent of this legislation is, then we can go ahead \nand disapprove it.\n  We have those two safeguards. One is they have to follow the criteria \nthat is consistent with the Senate Armed Services Committee, the \nnational defense authorization bill, which is the House and the Senate. \nTo be sure we will be able to do that it has the disapproval mechanism.\n  People do not realize the costs of this. If you take the same amount \nof money that we are talking about in sequestration and allow the \nservice chiefs to massage this and make changes, give them flexibility \nto go after programs that are not as significant as some that might \notherwise be cut--the bill allows the President to listen to the advice \nof his military leadership and offset some of the devastating impacts \nof sequestration. If the sequester is allowed to take place and the \ncongressional resolution is not fixed, the Department of Defense stands \nto waste billions of dollars through the cancellation of contracts.\n  People don't think about this. We make commitments backed by the \nUnited Sates of America that we are going to do certain things. A lot \nof these are contracts such that if they are terminated it could cost \nquite a bit of money.\n  The termination of multiyear contracts is something that we would be \nconcerned about. Providing the Department of Defense flexibility to \ndetermine how these cuts will be implemented will let us take this into \nconsideration.\n  At this point, I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania how much time he \nwould like for his concluding remarks.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I \nwill only ask for a minute or two to make my closing comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I appreciate that very much. He has been \na great partner. I have given a background of what went on 5 weeks ago \nand our discussions with the service chiefs. I was hoping this day \nwould not come and that we would not be faced with the continued \ndevastation of our military, but the time is here. Tomorrow is the 1st \nof the month.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania and I have come up with a bill that \nwill be voted on, and it will minimize the damage and still preserve \nthe cuts that are mandated and are out there.\n  One of the problems we have not talked about is the continuing \nresolution. When I was talking to the different service chiefs, one was \nGeneral Odierno, who is in the Army. He said that just as devastating \nas how the CR is set up, this corrects that problem at the same time. \nWe have something that is not going to cost any more money. Believe me, \na lot of my closest friends--for instance, in the House of \nRepresentatives--think it is a good thing that we are making these \nmandatory cuts. They cannot argue with that, but we can at least \nminimize the damage in these cuts.\n  I will read something that shocked me when I saw the President had \nissued--I am not sure if it is a veto message. I am told it was a veto \nmessage.\n  Here we have a bill that gives him flexibility with the restrictions \nwe\n\n[[Page S988]]\n\ntalked about. Yet he says he is now going to veto it. It is worth \nreading this again, and we need to make sure we get this in the Record.\n  This is his quote on February 19, 2013. This is the President \nspeaking.\n\n       Now, if Congress allows this meat-cleaver approach to take \n     place, it will jeopardize our military readiness; it will \n     eviscerate job-creating investments in education and energy \n     and medical research. It won't consider whether we're cutting \n     some bloated program that has outlived its usefulness, or a \n     vital service that Americans depend on every single day. It \n     doesn't make those distinctions.\n\n  We are now giving him a vehicle that makes those distinctions so we \nhave that flexibility. It has the safeguards to take care of the \nproblems that have been brought up. I think it is not a good solution, \nbut right now it is the only solution.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I would like to thank and compliment the \nSenator from Oklahoma, who has been a terrific leader and ally. I \nappreciate his hard work and the work product we have come up with.\n  At the end of the day, it is not complicated. It is pretty simple. Do \nwe go ahead with indiscriminate across-the-board cuts that give us no \nability whatsoever to establish priorities, to recognize that some \nspending is more important than others, or do we adopt this flexibility \napproach and give to the President of the United States the flexibility \nfor him to turn to his service chiefs and say to them: Folks, is there \na better way to do this? I am sure they know best what their needs are. \nI am sure they can come up with a better set of spending cuts than \nthese across-the-board cuts that are in law.\n  Similarly, on the nondefense side, any competent middle manager of \nany business in America knows that when they have to tighten their \nbelt, they go through and prioritize. So when the President and the \nSecretary of Transportation go around the country saying: Oh, we are \ngoing to have to lay off air traffic controllers; we are going to have \nto shut down towers; we are going to have delays, none of it is \nnecessary. It is not necessary if we pass this legislation because it \nwould give the President the flexibility to cut the items that would \nnot be disruptive to our economy, and it would not be disruptive in any \nmeaningful way.\n  I gave the example earlier of the FAA. The FAA would have more money \npostsequester than what the President even asked for. Obviously, what \nthe President needs is the discretion to be able to make some cuts \nwhere they can be best be borne.\n  After having a total budget that has grown 100 percent over the last \n12 years, we can find the 2.3 percent that is needed now. These are \nflexibility measures we would give the President for the remainder of \nthis fiscal year. Thereafter, the savings we will achieve will happen \nthrough the spending caps and, therefore, will be decided by the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Republican alternative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, earlier this week, I shared with the \nSenate the consequences of sequestration for the budget of the \nDepartment of State and foreign operations and its impact on the \nsecurity of the United States. Funding for the entire Department of \nState and foreign operations budget amounts to only about 1 percent of \nthe Federal budget, not the 15 or 20 percent some mistakenly believe.\n  That 1 percent includes funding to operate our embassies and \nconsulates in over 290 countries, to carry out diplomacy in dangerous \nenvironments like Syria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, respond to \nhumanitarian crises, and build alliances with security and trading \npartners. Sequestration would harm these efforts by cutting assistance \nfor diplomatic security at a time when everyone agrees we need to do \nmore to protect our Foreign Service officers overseas.\n  On the development side, sequestration will mean cuts to global \nhealth programs that prevent the spread of AIDS and pay for vaccines \nfor children, protect maternal health, and combat malaria and \ntuberculosis. It will also mean reductions for funding for disaster and \nrefugee aid at a time when an increasing number of victims of drought, \nfamine, and extremist violence around the world need assistance.\n  As has been pointed out repeatedly, sequestration was included in the \nBudget Control Act as an incentive to negotiate. The idea was that it \nwould have such catastrophic consequences that rational minds would \nreplace it with a thoughtful and balanced approach to deficit \nreduction.\n  That has not happened. To the contrary, just 1 day before the \nsequester is to take effect, our friends on the other side of the \naisle, who favor cutting government programs and particularly those \nthat help the neediest, seem to have decided that they would rather see \nsequestration take effect rather than close tax loopholes that only \nbenefit the wealthy and pad growing corporate profits.\n  However, as President Obama and others have been warning for weeks, \nallowing these Draconian cuts to go into effect tomorrow will have a \ntremendously negative impact on jobs all across the country and on \nessential services provided by our government.\n  The American people elected us to come to Washington to work together \nand make tough decisions. It is well past time for a certain amount of \nreasonableness to come back to Congress. I have always believed that a \nbalanced approach of pairing decreased spending with increased revenues \nis a far better way to deal with our budget deficits than \nsequestration. That is what we did with President Clinton in the 1990s, \nand we saw record budget surpluses.\n  We simply cannot cut our way out of this deficit. We created this \nsituation partly by putting two wars on the Nation's credit card. We \nalready have reduced the debt by $2.5 trillion, with the vast majority \nof those savings coming from spending cuts. Just as most private \nbusinesses adjust their prices prudently over time, we cannot finish \nthe job of deficit reduction through spending cuts alone.\n  We must understand that even in these difficult budgetary times we \ncannot sacrifice the future of critical Federal programs in education, \nin health care, and in national security that affect hard-working \nfamilies across the country, every single day. The American people want \nand expect us to take a balanced approach. They know it isn't wise to \nprotect endless corporate loopholes and tax breaks for the wealthiest \nAmericans instead of investing in our schools, our factories, our \nroads, and our workers. Yes, they want us to get our books in order--\nbut in a balanced way where everyone pulls equally.\n  Today the Senate has the opportunity to avoid this devastating \nsequester by voting for the American Family Economic Protection Act, \nwhich does just that. This balanced legislation will delay \nsequestration by replacing it with a combination of new revenues and \ntargeted spending cuts. These spending cuts would reduce the deficit in \na responsible way, eliminating unnecessary direct payments and farm \nsubsidies and implementing reasonable and responsible defense spending \nreductions beginning when the war in Afghanistan is expected to end. \nThis legislation would also generate revenue, equal to the amount of \nspending cuts included, by eliminating oil industry tax loopholes, \ndenying deductions to companies that ship jobs overseas, and ensuring \nthat millionaires do not pay a smaller share of their incomes in taxes \nthan the typical middle-class family.\n  The American Family Economic Protection Act provides us with a clear, \nbalanced proposal that would avoid the devastation of sequestration. I \nlook forward to the opportunity to support this responsible approach to \ndeficit reduction and hope all Senators will join me in doing the same.\n  If we choose to not act responsibly and do not pass this legislation \ntoday, I am afraid sequestration will go forward and would mean \ndevastating cuts around the country and for Vermont. Without action, \nsequestration would mean that Vermont schools would lose more than $2.5 \nmillion for primary and secondary education and the education of \nchildren with disabilities, while putting the jobs of teachers and \naides at risk. Vermont would stand to lose more than $1 million in \nenvironmental funding to ensure clean water and air quality, as well as \nprevent pollution from pesticides and hazardous waste.\n  Vermont would lose roughly $2.6 million in funding for medical \nresearch\n\n[[Page S989]]\n\nand innovation funding from NIH and $400,000 in funding from the \nNational Science Foundation, costing the State 53 jobs. Vermont would \nlose funding for the grants that support law enforcement, prosecution \nand courts, crime prevention and education, corrections, drug treatment \nand enforcement, and crime victim and witness initiatives. \nSequestration would mean Vermont would lose $101,000 in funding for job \nsearch assistance, referral, and placement, meaning 3,700 fewer people \nwill get the help and skills they need to find employment, just when \nthey need it most.\n  In Vermont, sequestration would impact public health. Fewer children \nwill receive vaccines for diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, \ntetanus, whooping cough, influenza, and hepatitis B due to reduced \nfunding for vaccinations. Across-the-board cuts mean Vermont will lose \nabout $270,000 in grants to help prevent and treat substance abuse, \nresulting in around 500 fewer admissions to substance abuse programs. \nAnd the Vermont Department of Health will lose about $55,000 resulting \nin around 1,400 fewer HIV tests. Sequestration would mean the state \nwould lose funding used to provide meals for seniors and services to \nvictims of domestic violence.\n  If we do not pass the American Family Economic Protection Act today, \nour States will lose funding for community development block grants and \nhousing vouchers helping to put a roof over families' heads, we will \nlose funding for cancer screenings, childcare, and Head Start programs \nhelping to get our Nation's children ready for school.\n  We cannot afford to allow this self-inflicted devastation move to \nforward. The bottom line is that getting our fiscal house in order must \ngo hand in hand with policies that promote economic growth, create \njobs, and strengthen the middle class--all things that President Obama \nand Democrats in both Houses of Congress are eager to do if only we had \nmore cooperation from our friends across the aisle. We simply cannot \ncut our way out of this. We cannot allow an unbalanced approach that \nwould once again require that deficit reduction be achieved solely \nthrough spending cuts, and would disproportionately impact low-income \nAmericans and middle-class families. And we should not allow politics \nand posturing to dictate our actions here today. The American people \nexpect more from us. I hope the Senate will end the filibuster of this \nlegislation and allow an up-or-down vote so that we can show our \nconstituents that we are capable of putting the interests of the Nation \nfirst.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the sequestration spending cuts that \nare scheduled to begin tomorrow would cause pain and hardship across \nour country. These cuts will be devastating to workers, small \nbusinesses, middle class families, and children.\n  The list of essential programs and services that will be affected by \nsequestration is long. So today, I would like to focus on just a few of \nthe more than 50 agencies funded by the Financial Services and General \nGovernment Appropriations Subcommittee, which I chair.\n  My subcommittee helps small businesses get the loans they need. It \nkeeps Wall Street watchdogs on the job. And it funds the agencies that \nstand up for consumers and stand guard against unfair and deceptive \nbusiness practices. But the largest single appropriation in my \nsubcommittee goes to our Nation's tax collector--the IRS.\n  At about $12 billion, the IRS budget is a major expense. But cutting \nthe IRS budget is short-sighted instead of reducing our deficit, \nshrinking the IRS makes our deficit larger.\n  That's because short-changing the IRS makes it easier for tax cheats \nto avoid paying what they owe.\n  Last year alone, about $400 billion in taxes owed were never paid.\n  Mr. President, I was a CEO for many years. If there is one thing I \nlearned in my time at ADP, it is that you can't run a company without \nrevenues. And you surely can't run a country without revenues. The \nsequestration plan Republicans insisted on will slash the IRS and \nsacrifice revenues. In fact, for every dollar the sequester cuts from \nthe IRS, our deficit will increase by at least $4.\n  These cuts make no sense. But these IRS budget cuts are just the \nbeginning of our problems. Under sequestration, as many as 1,900 small \nbusinesses won't get loans, which would mean 22,000 fewer jobs at a \ntime when millions are looking for work. Wall Street watchdogs like the \nSEC and CFTC will be forced to go home, leaving investors on Main \nStreet vulnerable to wolves on Wall Street. And cuts to the Judiciary \ncould jeopardize one of the most important aspects of our life: the \nsafety of our families. That is because we will have fewer probation \nofficers to supervise criminal offenders in our communities. Courtrooms \nwill be less safe because of cuts to their security systems. And cuts \nto mental health and drug treatment programs could lead to more \noffenders relapsing into lives of crime.\n  The Federal Bar Association agrees. They wrote in a letter last week \nto Chairman Mikulski and me that, Funding reductions could jeopardize \nthe supervision of thousands of persons under pretrial release and \nconvicted felons released from federal prisons, compromising public \nsafety in communities across the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I voted against the legislation that put us on the \npath to sequestration because I was concerned about the effects of \nreckless cuts on everyday Americans. Just look at what sequestration \nwill do to Head Start a program that helps our most vulnerable children \nlearn how to learn: 70,000 kids could be kicked out of Head Start, \nincluding 1,300 in New Jersey.\n  We had a chance today to vote on a bill to replace these cuts with a \nbalanced approach to deficit reduction, but our Republican colleagues \ninsisted on protecting loopholes for the wealthy and big corporations. \nI hope that they will reconsider their position in the coming weeks, \nand work with us to undo these damaging cuts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask for an opportunity to respond to \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania and then yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, we just met with Secretary of \nTransportation Ray LaHood, a former Congressman from Illinois. He said \nthe opposite of what the Senator from Pennsylvania said. The Secretary \nof Transportation said exactly the opposite of what the Senator just \nsaid.\n  The sequestration is going to force him to reduce the payroll in his \ndepartment. The largest payroll source is the Federal Aviation \nAdministration and the largest cohort within that administration is the \nair traffic controllers. Sequestration is going to result in an \nannouncement by the Department of Transportation within the next \nseveral days--if we don't avoid it with a vote on this Senate floor--of \nrestrictions on airports across the United States because of \nsequestered air traffic controllers.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I will when I am finished.\n  We know we are going to have to tell them they are only going to be \nable to work 4 days out of the week. It is mindless to stand on the \nSenate floor and say we can cut $1 billion out of the Department of \nTransportation and no one will feel it. Come on. Get real. We have 7 \nmonths left in this year. These agencies are trying to come up with the \nsavings, and the only places they can turn are very limited.\n  Ashton Carter, Deputy Secretary of Defense, just went through with \nwhat they are facing. These are not easy because the sequestration was \nnever meant to be easy. It is hard.\n  Please don't sugarcoat it and say there is a magic wand out there to \nfind $1 billion in the Department of Transportation and that if the \nPresident would just look closely, I am sure we can do it. It is not \nthat simple.\n  The Senator has been involved in the supercommittee, and he has been \ninvolved in looking at this budget. He knows that on a bipartisan basis \nwe can find savings. There is money to be saved in every single agency \nof government, but you don't do it with a heavy-handed sequester \napproach.\n  Please don't suggest we are favoring the idea of air traffic control \nbeing limited in America. I want it expanded. Unfortunately, the \nsequestration is going to limit it in the State of Illinois\n\n[[Page S990]]\n\nand in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n  I will yield for the Senator's question.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, it is hard for me to follow this. The \nSenator is decrying the effects of the sequestration, and what Senator \nInhofe and I are offering is a way to minimize the damage.\n  In the President's submitted request for the FAA, did he contemplate \nlaying off air traffic controllers or closing towers? I know the \nanswer. The President's budget--which he submitted to Congress and is a \npublic document--requested a certain funding for the FAA.\n  Mr. DURBIN. For the next fiscal year?\n  Mr. TOOMEY. For the current fiscal year, the President's most recent \nrequest. The President's request was for less money than the FAA will \nhave if the sequester goes through. I don't think the President was \nplanning to lay off air traffic controllers.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reclaiming my time, this is getting perilously close to a \ndebate, which I will tell those in attendance never happens on the \nfloor of the Senate. I will tell the Senator at this time we are \ndealing with the CR and last year's appropriations for the Department \nof Transportation; that is what Secretary LaHood is using. He is using \nthe Budget Control Act numbers. So the President's request, \nnotwithstanding--I am not sure how the Senator voted, but there was a \nbipartisan vote for limiting the amount of money that could be spent in \nthis fiscal year. I voted for it, and that is what the Secretary is \noperating under.\n  The reality is this: Even with the Inhofe amendment, $1 billion has \nto be cut from the Department of Transportation, and the flexibility \nnotwithstanding, the options are so limited at this point in time.\n  I will tell the Senator pointblank that I believe we need to reduce \nthis deficit. Sequestration is a terrible way, but there is an \nalternative. There will be an alternative this afternoon, and we will \nask the Senator from Pennsylvania and to the Senator from Oklahoma: Are \nthey prepared to say we are going to limit the direct agriculture \nsupport payments to farmers who have had the most profitable years in \ntheir lives and don't need them? Are they prepared to say that people \nmaking $5 million a year in income ought to pay the same tax rate as \nthe secretaries who work for them? If they are, we can avoid the worst \nparts of the sequestration. If they are not, be prepared, we are in for \na pretty rough ride.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. This has been very interesting. This is not what I was \ngoing to speak on. I was going to speak on the amount of cuts we have \nalready taken in our appropriations bill on Labor, Health, Human \nServices, Education, NIH, and Centers for Disease Control.\n  I could not help but hear my friend from Pennsylvania talk about the \nPresident's budget as though that is controlling this. Would the \nRepublicans want to adopt everything in the President's budget? I don't \nthink so. They might want to select this or that or this or that, but \nare we now hearing from my friends on the other side that we should \njust carte blanche rubberstamp the President's budget? I sure hope not.\n  I remind my friends that the Constitution of the United States \nclearly says this body has two functions: taxing and spending--not the \nPresident and not the executive branch. The executive branch can \npropose whatever budget they want, it is up to us to decide both how to \ncollect the taxpayers' money and how to spend it. It does not matter to \nme exactly what the President proposes. What I want to know is how do \nwe--as Senators and as Congressmen--feel about where we should be \ninvesting our money and on what we ought to be spending the taxpayers' \nmoney.\n  The idea that somehow the President's budget says this or that and \nthat people can pick and choose whatever they want with it, I submit \nagain, I will bet my friends on the other side will not say: We will \njust adopt the President's budget as it is and we will go with that. I \ndon't think they are ready to do that. I would not even do that for a \nPresident of my own party.\n  I wish to talk a second, again, about sort of the intransigence on \nthe part of my friends on the Republican side--not only in this body \nbut in the other body--of not countenancing any other funding or \nraising of revenues. I keep hearing the Speaker say: We gave revenues \nlast month, that we had $700 billion of revenues last month; now it is \ntime to talk about spending cuts.\n  What the Speaker has done is he has drawn an arbitrary starting line \nof January 2013. What about last year and the year before when we \nadopted over $1.4 trillion in spending cuts that have already been \nadopted? What about the starting line there? That is when we started to \naddress the $4 trillion we needed by 2020 to stabilize our debt.\n  We have come up with about $1.4 trillion in spending cuts and about \n$700 billion in revenue. It is not the idea that we have already given \nup and that we have collected enough revenue. That is not it at all. \nGoing forward we need a balance between revenues and spending cuts.\n  I want to read some of the things we have done in our own committee \nlast year. We had $1.3 billion in cuts. We eliminated the education \ntechnology state grants, which a lot of people kind of liked. The Even \nStart Program was eliminated. The tech-prep education state grants were \neliminated. The mentoring children of prisoners was eliminated; the \nforeign language assistance was eliminated; the civic education was \neliminated; The Alcohol Abuse Reduction Program was eliminated. The \ncareer pathways innovation fund was eliminated.\n  Many of these programs were started by my friends on the Republican \nside at some time in the past, some were started by Democrats, but most \nof them were started jointly with Republican and Democrats. What I am \npointing out is that we have already cut a lot of things out of Health \nand Human Services, education, NIH, and the Centers for Disease \nControl. I can tell that you Dr. Francis Collins, the head of NIH, \nwarned that the sequester will slash another $1.6 billion from NIH's \nbudget at the very time when we are on the cusp of having some good \nbreakthroughs in medical research. A lot of medical researchers have \nbeen lined up and doing some great programs out there. Now all of a \nsudden they are going to have the rug pulled out from underneath them, \nbut that is what is going to happen.\n  I might mention the kids with disabilities and what is going to \nhappen with the funding for the IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act. I am told about 7,200 teachers, aides, and other staff \nwho help our communities and our schools cope with kids with \ndisabilities who come into schools--because under IDEA we are providing \nthat kind of support--are going to be cut. But it is going to be cut.\n\n  So this idea that somehow we can keep cutting and cutting and cutting \nand we are going to get to some magic land where we can continue to \nfunction as a society just isn't so. We need revenues. That is what is \nin the bill the majority leader has proposed, revenues that will help \nus reach that point where we can have both spending cuts and revenues \nand stabilize our debt at a reasonable percentage of our GDP.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to waive the \nmandatory quorum call in relation to the cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed to S. 16.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as we all know, our country faces \ntremendous fiscal challenges. We expect our President, our leaders, and \nthose of us in Congress to engage in a meaningful and honest discussion \nabout debt, deficits, and the direction of our Nation. Unfortunately, I \nthink what Americans--certainly Kansans--are hearing from the White \nHouse and from some prominent Democrats is a relentless focus on \npolitical gimmicks to solve our problems.\n  An example of one of those is the so-called corporate jet loophole. \nWe are focused on that instead of a serious plan to address the looming \nsequestration cuts that threaten to harm our economy. The President's \nfixation on corporate jets stands in direct contrast with his supposed \ndesire to help the aviation industry and create jobs. Ending the \naccelerated depreciation schedule for general aviation aircraft will \nsend hundreds if not thousands of hard-working Kansans straight to the \nunemployment line. My State is blessed with a significant number of \npeople who work in the aviation industry.\n  This rhetoric is dangerous. It is certainly hypocritical. The 5-year \ndepreciation schedule has been law for nearly a quarter of a century, \nand it was not created for the benefit of the ``rich'' or ``wealthy'' \nbut was created for the benefit of the 1.2 million Americans who make a \nliving building and servicing these airplanes. Accelerated depreciation \nhelps spur manufacturing and creates jobs.\n  I am disappointed that the President continues his endless campaign \nto score political points rather than to work toward a real solution to \nsolve our Nation's fiscal challenges. When 23 million Americans are \nlooking for work, our government's first priority should be to create \nan environment where business can grow and hire additional workers. \nIncreasing taxes on corporate jets and other general aviation aircraft \nsales will only further stifle economic recovery and result in \nadditional job losses.\n  According to our Joint Committee on Taxation, closing the \n``loophole,''\n\n[[Page S992]]\n\nwould only generate $3 billion in revenue over the next 10 years, less \nthan the government borrows on a single day. Kansans in particular, \nalong with the rest of rural America, would be negatively impacted by \nany change in the depreciation schedules for noncommercial aircraft. \nFarmers use general aviation aircraft to dust their crops, and rural \nsmall business owners rely on these planes to connect their businesses \nwith the rest of the world. It makes no sense for a commercial jumbo \njet liner to be depreciated on the same schedule as a farmer's air \ntractor.\n  This distinction between general and commercial aircraft is neither a \nloophole nor unique, as the 5-year depreciation schedule is applicable \nto many other depreciable transportation assets, such as cars and \ntrucks. If the President wants Congress to review the depreciation \nperiods associated with certain assets, then why single out one \nspecific industry instead of taking a comprehensive approach? Because \nattacking corporate jets is apparently a nice political sound bite. But \npolitical sound bites don't solve our problems.\n  Because of the expiration of the Bush tax cuts on January 1 of this \nyear, President Obama received $600 billion in tax hikes to help fund \nhis vision for government expansion. Yet less than 2 months later he is \nback on the campaign stump asking American taxpayers for more.\n  While the amount of revenue our government currently brings in is \nnear historical averages, spending remains well above those historical \nnorms and is projected to escalate dramatically in the years ahead. It \nis long past time to address the real problem with meaningful spending \nreductions, and every moment spent talking about corporate jet \nloopholes is a wasted moment.\n  Americans expect leadership from their elected officials here in \nWashington, DC. If we fail to take action now and leave it for a future \nPresident and a future Congress to solve, we will reduce the \nopportunities of the next generation to experience the country we know \nand love, and we will diminish the chance that every American has the \nchance to pursue the American dream.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 minutes as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the last 2 days in the debate here, a \nlot has been said about the sequestration that presumably is going to \nhappen tomorrow. I would like to speak on that subject because it is \nvery important, particularly the history of sequestration and what has \ngone on here in recent weeks as we discuss this issue.\n  In August 2011 a compromise was reached to grant President Obama's \nrequest to raise the debt ceiling by $2.1 trillion. I believe that was \nbecause we had a feeling that there ought to be a $1 decrease in \nspending for every $1 increase in the ceiling. So that adds up to $2.1 \ntrillion. In exchange for an increase in the debt ceiling, we \nRepublicans in Congress asked for spending reductions. This all added \nup to the Budget Control Act passed on August 2, 2011. Decisions we are \ndebating today were decided 18 months ago, so if you didn't like them \nin 18 months, you had an opportunity to change them. But here we are at \nthe last minute talking about some changes.\n  The Budget Control Act of August 2, 2011, included budget caps to cut \nabout $900 billion in spending immediately--August 2, 2011--and then it \nset up a supercommittee to find at least $1.2 trillion in additional \ndeficit reduction. History shows that the supercommittee could not \nreach an agreement. So the failure of the supercommittee to reach an \nagreement led to the sequestration we are now debating and facing \ntomorrow, which is, as we know, automatic spending reductions of $1.2 \ntrillion over the next 10 years.\n  I didn't support the Budget Control Act. I don't criticize those who \ndid, and to be fair, it was a bipartisan vote that got the Budget \nControl Act adopted. I knew at the time--and one of the reasons I voted \nagainst it--that the supercommittee was unlikely to reach an agreement \nand that it would ultimately only further delay difficult fiscal \ndecisions that needed to be made. But at the end of the day the \nbipartisan majority in the Senate and the House passed and President \nObama signed the Budget Control Act--a bill to bring about $2.1 \ntrillion in spending reductions over the next 10 years.\n  Most believe sequestration is a terrible way to reduce spending. I \nagree. There are surely better ways to reduce spending by the $85 \nbillion that is going to happen this year--of which, by the way, only \n$44 billion is going to be spent between now and September 30.\n  When that is done, we are going to have a situation where every year \nthere is going to be some decision made on whether to continue the $1.2 \ntrillion, and I hope for the good of the country that continues, \nwhether it is by across-the-board automatic cuts or maybe there will be \na compromise that can be reached to do it in a more studied way.\n  The Republican-led House of Representatives, soon after the 2011 \ndecision, recognized that the automatic reductions weren't the best way \nto do it. So last year they passed two bills to reorganize those cuts \nin a more structured way. Did the Senate consider those two bills? No. \nThe Democratic-led Senate produced or considered no bill prior to today \nto avert the sequester.\n  So I think it is fair to say that for the 18 months we could have \nbeen working together to find an agreement, nothing was done after the \nHouse of Representatives worked that agreement. Now we have all these \ncrocodile tears flowing from the majority here in the Senate because of \nthe terrible hardship this sequester may cause. Well, where have they \nbeen for the last 18 months? Why have they not proposed a single piece \nof legislation to avert sequestration until this very last minute? The \ntwo votes we just had today are an example.\n  Why has the Senate avoided regular order with such vigor? In other \nwords, regular order--let the committees hold hearings; let the \ncommittees debate, amend, vote a bill out; let it come to the Senate \nfloor; debate, amend, and vote it to a conference with the House of \nRepresentatives. But no regular order. Under regular order, you work to \ncompromise. But the Senate failed to act after the House acted. So here \nwe are at the eleventh hour to consider an alternative.\n  Just like their inability to produce a budget in nearly 4 years, this \nSenate majority has again failed to act. A budget is a very important \npart of fiscal discipline, but we haven't had a budget debate for 3 \nyears even though the 1974 law requires us to have such debate and \npassage.\n  Tomorrow the President is going to meet with leaders in the Congress \nto see what can be done about sequestration, but why the very same day \nsequestration is taking place? What has the President been doing?\n  Well, we have seen him traveling around the country generating mass \nhysteria about what might happen--and wouldn't have had to do it if we \nhad regular order here in the Senate in the meantime.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that not only is the sequester a \nproduct that came from the White House, he explicitly pledged to veto a \nproposal to replace the cuts sometime when it was brought up in late \n2011 and 2012. This is what the President said on November 2011:\n\n       Some in Congress are trying to undo these automatic \n     spending cuts. My message to them is simple. No. I will veto \n     any effort to get rid of those automatic spending cuts to \n     domestic and defense spending. There will be no easy off-\n     ramps on this one.\n\n  Now the President and the Democrats here in the Senate want us to \nagree to more tax hikes on the American people rather than to cut the \n$3.6 trillion budget by just 2.4 percent, which they agreed to as part \nof the 2011 deal. Tax hikes were not included in that deal. They \nweren't included because we know that spending is the problem, not \nrevenues.\n  The President must be absolutely frustrated. He apparently can't \nmanage\n\n[[Page S993]]\n\na meager 2\\1/2\\-percent reduction even though just a few years ago he \nstated:\n\n       I want to go line by line through every item in the federal \n     budget and eliminate programs that don't work and make sure \n     that those that do work, work better and cheaper.\n\n  He must not have had any success because once again he is asking for \na tax hike to reduce the deficits rather than addressing the real cause \nof the problem, which is spending.\n  Over the past several years we have heard a lot from the other side \nabout increasing taxes on the so-called wealthy. The President and my \nDemocratic colleagues argued that this was necessary to make the rich \npay their fair share. Well, on January 1 the other side got their wish. \nThe top statutory tax rate increased from 35 to 39.6 percent. When this \nstatutory rate increase is coupled with the hidden rate increase from \nreinstituting the personal exemptions phaseout and the limitation on \nitemized deductions, the top marginal effective tax rate is not 39.6 \npercent but near 41 percent.\n  Not only did we see an increase in the income tax on January 1, but \nwe also saw a significant tax increase on capital gains and dividends. \nThe fiscal cliff bill instituted a top 20 percent tax rate on capital \ngains and dividends. However, this is not the whole story. A provision \nfrom the health care reform bill that imposes a 3.8-percent surtax on \ninvestment income also went into effect at the start of the year. Thus, \nthe top rate has jumped not from 15 percent to 20 percent but instead \nto 23.8 percent. That, of course, is nearly a 60-percent rate hike. You \nwould think, after securing these tax hikes on the so-called wealthy, \nthe other side would claim victory and move on. At least one would \nthink they would move on from the tired old rhetoric that the wealthy \ndo not pay their fair share.\n\n  Even before the most recent tax hikes, that claim was dubious at \nbest. According to the Congressional Budget Office--remember, that is a \nnonpartisan study group that gives us basic information on changes of \nlaw--they say the top 1 percent already had an average Federal tax rate \nof 29 percent compared to 11 percent for the middle 20 percent of \nhouseholds. Yet the other side continues their politics of division. \nThey continue to pit American against American and single out \npolitically unpopular industries for tax hikes. While this may be good \npolitics, it does not make good policy. You know, it is the other rule \nwe ought to follow: Good policy is good politics.\n  The other side has resurrected in addition as part of this package \nbefore us the so-called Buffett rule, which would phase in a minimum \n30-percent tax rate for taxpayers earning more than $1 million. This is \ndespite the fact that this proposal was voted down by this body less \nthan a year ago and they know there is no chance of it passing at this \npoint. Moreover, their argument for this provision makes even less \nsense now, given the tax increases that went into effect on January 1.\n  It also is not clear to me why, when we are talking about reforming \nthe Tax Code, we are now seeking to add an additional layer of \ncomplexity onto a Tax Code we already agree is too complicated.\n  At the end of the day, all the Buffett rule will accomplish is \nsiphoning off more job-creating capital and investment for Main Street \nso that we can spend it here in Washington, DC. I hope we all know that \ngovernment consumes wealth, it does not create wealth. The wealth is \ncreated outside of this city of Washington, the seat of our government. \nWe have to take that into consideration. It takes capital to create \njobs. If you want to get unemployment down, you do not take capital out \nof the private sector.\n  In addition to the Buffett rule, the other side has resurrected \nanother proposal voted down by this body less than a year ago. This \nproposal has to do with businesses deducting ordinary and necessary \nbusiness expenses. The rhetoric from the other side is that their \nproposal would close a loophole that incentivizes companies to ship \njobs overseas. The problem is no such provision exists. The deduction \nfor ordinary and necessary business expenses is a mainstay of our Tax \nCode. It is an income-defining provision that accounts for the cost of \ndoing business. What the proposal before us actually does is target \ncompanies doing business on a worldwide scale for a tax hike. This will \nnot create jobs in America. It will not bring jobs that have relocated \noffshore back home. What it will do is punish businesses that seek to \nexpand in the international markets, which in turn could actually cost \nus jobs here at home.\n  The final tax increase included in the other side's proposal today is \nmore of a budget gimmick than a serious proposal to help pay for the \ndelay in the sequester. The proposal would subject oil from tar sands \nto taxes that support the oilspill liability trust fund. However, if \nthe revenue raised from this proposal is dedicated to this trust fund, \nhow can it at the same time be dedicated to deficit reduction? If we \nare going to get serious about deficit reduction, we need to put an end \nto this double-counting charade.\n  The only spending the other side is willing to cut is farm subsidies. \nUsing farm subsidies to help pay for sequester replacement puts the \nAgriculture Committee in quite a tough position. I want to remind my \ncolleagues, though, that when we wrote a farm bill last year that \npassed the Senate by a bipartisan majority--it didn't pass the House of \nRepresentatives--but we cut $23 billion from that. We did away with \ndirect payments, we maintained the crop insurance program, we put money \nin other programs and in food stamps as well.\n  There is broad support for the farm bill here in the Senate from both \nDemocrats and Republicans and there is broad support for making \nspending reductions. But for Democrats to include cutting subsidies \noutside the context of a farm bill will make it difficult for us to \nwrite a farm bill. As we all know, there has been a lot of history of \nrural and urban legislators working together on farm and nutrition \nissues in the farm bill. By cutting farm programs in this sequestration \nreplacement, my Democratic colleagues are undermining the ability of \nthe Agriculture Committee to craft a bill that will gain the needed \nsupport to move through the Senate in a bipartisan way as it did last \nJune.\n  I think the proposal will hurt our agriculture communities and I \nthink those involved in American agriculture will oppose it.\n  At the end of the day, though, there will be money saved in the farm \nbill. If, given that opportunity, we can provide savings from a lot of \nprograms, we should. We showed that ability last year. We all know the \nfarm bill faced big challenges in the House last year. The challenges \nprobably still exist in that Chamber, but we should not put ourselves \nin a position where we cannot even get a bill through the Senate.\n  For those of us who support the farm bill, we should be very \nconcerned that this plan the Democrats are putting forward to avoid \nsequestration could seriously undermine the ability to pass a farm bill \nin either Chamber this time around. We just had an opportunity to vote \non the Democrats' tax increase. This was the first vote in the Senate \non an alternative to sequestration and the first alternative offered by \nthe Senate majority. Over a period of 18 months, they had an \nopportunity to offer that alternative, just as the House Republicans \noffered us two alternatives we never took up.\n  We also had the opportunity to vote on one alternative from the \nRepublican side of the aisle, but both of these votes were for show. I \nhope we can now work together in a bipartisan way, in regular order, to \nmake sensible spending reductions. It is time to end the incessant talk \nof more tax hikes on Americans when those tax hikes already took place \non January 1, when we know that the problem is in fact runaway \nspending. It is time to end the constant campaigning and do the work \nthe American people expect us to do so we can leave the next generation \na better life than the present generation has.\n  I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I welcome Senator Vitter and his \ncooperation in this matter. I appreciate the work he has done on the \nissue. He and I are going to address the concentration of the financial \nsystem in this country and what that means to the middle class, what it \nmeans to business lending for small businesses, and again what it means \nto the potential of too big to fail, which is something Senator Vitter \nhas been a leader on for a number of years. Both of us are members of \nthe Senate Banking Committee.\n  More than 100 years ago, in 1889, one of my predecessors, Senator \nJohn Sherman, a Republican, and author of the Sherman Antitrust Act--\nwho actually lived in my hometown of Mansfield, OH, and was the only \nother Senator from that city who served here--said:\n\n       I do not wish to single out Standard Oil Company . . . \n     [s]till, they are controlling and can control the market so \n     absolutely as they choose to do it; it is a question of their \n     will. The point for us to consider is whether, on the whole, \n     it is safe in this country to leave the production of \n     property, the transportation of our whole country, to depend \n     upon the will of a few men sitting at their council board in \n     the city of New York, for there the whole machine is \n     operated?\n\n  At the time, Senator Sherman was speaking about the trusts--\nspecifically Standard Oil but other trusts as well--that were large, \ndiverse industrial organizations with outsized economic and political \npower, not just economic power but also political power. His words are \nas true then as they are today. Today our economy is being threatened \nby multitrillion dollar--that is trillion dollar--financial \ninstitutions. Wall Street megabanks are so large that should they fail, \nthey could take the rest of the economy with them.\n  If this were to happen, instead of failure, taxpayers are likely to \nbe asked again to cover their losses and to bail them out just as we \ndid 5 years ago. This is a disastrous outcome because it transfers \nwealth from the rest of the economy into these megabanks and suspends \nthe rules of capitalism and perpetuates the moral hazard that comes \nfrom saving risk-takers from the consequences of their behavior.\n  Just as Senator Sherman spoke against the trusts in the late 19th \ncentury, today people across the political spectrum--both parties and \nall ideologies--are speaking about the dangers of the large, \nconcentrated wealth of Wall Street megabanks.\n  In 2009, another Republican--and one a little more familiar to a \nmodern audience--Alan Greenspan said:\n\n       If they're too big to fail, they're too big . . . in 1911 \n     we broke up Standard Oil. . . . Maybe that's what we need to \n     do.\n\n  If anyone thought the biggest banks were too big to fail before the \ncrisis, then I have bad news: They have only gotten bigger.\n  These are the six largest banks and their growth patterns in 1995--18 \nyears ago--had combined assets that were 18 percent of GDP. Today they \nhave combined assets over 60 percent of GDP. Over that time, 37 banks \nmerged 33 times to become the top 4 largest behemoths, which now range \nfrom $1.4 trillion in assets to the largest, Bank of America and \nJPMorgan Chase, which is around $2.3 or $2.4 trillion in assets. That \nis $2.3 trillion in assets. Since the beginning of the fiscal crisis, \nthree of these four megabanks have grown through mergers by an average \nof more than $500 billion.\n\n  The 6 largest banks now have twice the combined assets of the rest of \nthe 50 largest U.S. banks. These 6 banks--Morgan Stanley, Goldman \nSachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America--the \ncombined assets of 6 banks, are larger than the next 50 largest banks. \nPut another way, if we add up the assets of banks 7 through 50, the \nbank that resulted would only be half the size of a bank made from the \nassets of the top 6.\n  As astonishing as these numbers are, they don't tell the whole story. \nMany megabank supporters argue that U.S. banks are small relative to \ninternational banks.\n  But as Bloomberg reported last week, FDIC Board member Tom Hoenig has \nexposed a double standard in our accounting system that allows U.S. \nbanks to actually shrink themselves on paper. Under the accounting \nrules applied by the rest of the world, the 6 largest banks are 39 \npercent larger than we think they are. That is a difference of about $4 \ntrillion. If that is the case, instead of being 63 percent of GDP under \ninternational accounting rules, these 6 banks are actually 102 percent \nof GDP. Let me say that again. The six biggest banks' combined assets \nare slightly larger than the entire size of our economy. When measured \nagainst the same standard as every other institution in the world, we \nsee the United States has the three largest banks in the world. These \ninstitutions are not just big, they are extremely complex.\n  According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the 5 largest U.S. \nbanks now have 19,654 subsidiaries. On average, they have 3,900 \nsubsidiaries each and operate in 68 different countries. These \ninstitutions are not just massive and complex--I don't object so much \nto that--it is they are also risky.\n  According to their regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the \nCurrency--and I met with them today--none of these institutions has \nadequate risk management. Let me say that again. In stress tests, not \none of the largest 19 banks has shown adequate risk management.\n  It is simply impossible to believe that these behemoths will not get \ninto trouble again. We saw what happened with one of the best managed \nbanks with a lot of employees--some 16,000, 17,000, 18,000 employees in \nmy State alone--at one site with 10,000 employees in Columbus: JPMorgan \nChase, a well-managed bank with a very competent CEO but a bank that \nnot so long ago lost $6 billion or $7 billion.\n  It is impossible to believe they will not get into trouble again and \nthey will not be unwound in an orderly fashion should they approach the \nbrink of failure.\n  If you don't believe me, ask Bill Dudley, President of the Federal \nReserve Bank of New York. He said recently that ``we have a \nconsiderable ways to go to finish the job and reduce to intolerable \nlevels the social costs'' of a megabank's failure. He said that more \ndrastic steps ``could yet prove necessary.''\n  Governor Dan Tarullo, from the Federal Reserve, threw his support \nbehind a proposal first introduced by the Presiding Officer's \npredecessor, Senator Ted Kaufman, and me to cap the nondeposit \nliabilities of the megabanks some 3 years ago in this body.\n  These men are not radicals; they are some of the Nation's foremost \nbanking experts.\n  History has taught us we never see the next threat coming until it is \ntoo late and almost upon us. When we passed the Dodd-Frank Act, it \ncontained tools that regulators can use to rein in risk taking.\n  Unfortunately, many of those rules have stalled, and most will not \ntake effect for years, because it is not just the economic power of the \nbanks but the political powers so often having their way in this city \nand with regulators all over the country.\n  Dodd-Frank focuses on improving regulators' ability to monitor risks \nand enhancing the actions that regulators can take if they believe the \nrisk has grown too great. Over the last 5 years alone we have seen \nfaulty mortgage-related securities, we have seen foreclosure fraud, and \nwe have seen big losses from risky trading, money laundering, and LIBOR \nrate digging.\n  Until the Dodd-Frank rules take effect, the rest of us more or less \nhave to stand by idly as megabanks take more risks that almost \ninevitably and eventually lead to failure.\n  We shouldn't tolerate business as usual, monitoring risk until we are \nonce again near the brink of disaster. We should learn from our recent \nhistory. We should correct our mistakes by dealing with the problem \nhead on. That means preventing the anticompetitive concentration of \nbanks that are too big to fail and whose favored status encourages them \nto engage in high-risk behavior.\n  How many more scandals will it take before we acknowledge that we \ncan't rely on regulators to prevent subprime lending, dangerous \nderivatives, risky proprietary trading, financial instruments that \nnobody understands, including the people running the banks in many \ncases, and even fraud and manipulation.\n\n[[Page S995]]\n\n  Wall Street has been allowed to run wild for years. We simply cannot \nwait any longer for regulators to act. These institutions are too big \nto manage, they are too big to regulate, and they are surely still too \nbig to fail.\n  We can't rely on the financial market to fix itself because the rules \nof competitive markets and creative destruction don't apply to Wall \nStreet megabanks as they do to businesses in Louisiana or Delaware or \nOhio. Megabanks' shareholders and creditors have no incentive to end \ntoo big to fail. As a result, they will engage in ever-riskier \nbehavior. In the end, they get paid out when banks are bailed out.\n  Taking the appropriate steps will lead to more midsized banks--not a \nfew magabanks--creating competition, increasing lending, and providing \nincentives for banks to lend the right way.\n  If there is one thing the people in Washington love, it is community \nbanks. Senator Vitter has been very involved in helping community banks \ndeal with regulations and other kinds of rules. Cam Fine, the head of \nthe Independent Community Bankers of America, is calling for the \nlargest banks to be downsized because he sees that his members, the \ncommunity banks--there might be 50 million, 100 million, or less than \nthat in assets--are at a disadvantage.\n  Just about the only people who will not benefit from reining in these \nmegabanks are a few Wall Street executives. Congress needs to take \naction now to prevent future economic collapse and future taxpayer-\nfunded liabilities.\n  Before yielding, I wish to thank Senator Vitter, who recognizes this \nproblem with an acuity that most don't have, and for joining me in \ndoing something about it. I am pleased to announce today that we are \nworking on bipartisan legislation to address this too-big-to-fail \nproblem. It will incorporate ideas put forward by Tom Hoenig, Richard \nFisher, and Sheila Bair. Senator Vitter will talk about his views in a \nmoment.\n  The American public doesn't want us to wait. They want us to ensure \nthat Wall Street megabanks will never again monopolize our Nation's \nwealth or gamble away the American dream.\n  To those who say that our work is done, I say we passed seven \nfinancial reform laws in the 8 years following the Depression, so it is \nclear there is precedent for not just one time, one fix, but a \ncontinued addressing of this problem until we know we have the strength \nof the American financial system returned to the way it once was.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Brown on the \nSenate floor to echo those comments. I agree that too big to fail, \nunfortunately, is alive and well, and that poses a real threat to all \nof us--to consumers and citizens everywhere and fundamentally to the \nAmerican economy.\n  Coming out of the financial crisis, it seemed to me that the biggest \nthreat and the biggest problem was continuing too big to fail. I think \nnow, several years after the passage of Dodd-Frank, we have objective \nnumbers and evidence that it did not bury too big to fail. Again, they \nare objective numbers and evidence and pricing in the market that too \nbig to fail is alive and well.\n  I think the fact that Senator Brown and I are both here on the floor \nechoing each other's concerns, virtually repeating each other's \narguments, is pretty significant. I don't know if we quite define the \npolitical spectrum of the Senate, but we come pretty darn close. Yet we \nabsolutely agree about this threat.\n  I think Senator Brown's historical analogy is right. It is like the \nunfettered growth and power of the trusts in the late 19th century, and \nthere too folks of all sorts of ideologies correctly recognized that \nthreat--liberal Democrats as well as Senator Brown's Republican \npredecessor, Senator Sherman, and, of course, the biggest Republican \ntrust-buster of all, Teddy Roosevelt. It is the same issue. It is the \nintense concentration of power. As a conservative, I am very suspicious \nand nervous about that, whether it is when it is in government or \nwhether it is when it is in the private sector.\n  I think the sort of bipartisan consensus that, perhaps, we personify \non the Senate floor is also growing outside Congress and outside this \ninstitution. Senator Brown alluded to some of it, but let me flesh that \nout.\n  We have, for instance, the Federal Reserve Board Governor, Dan \nTarullo. He was appointed by President Obama. He was a prominent figure \nin drafting and implementing Dodd-Frank. He recently lamented:\n\n       . . . to the extent that a growing systemic footprint \n     increases perceptions of at least some residual too-big-to-\n     fail quality in such a firm--\n\n  Meaning a megabank--\n\n     notwithstanding the panoply of measures in Dodd-Frank and our \n     regulations, there may be funding advantages for the firm, \n     which reinforces the impulse to grow.\n\n  In a little more blunt terms, our colleague, Senator Elizabeth \nWarren, who is also a figure in coming up with Dodd-Frank, said \nrecently in our Banking Committee hearing with Chairman Bernanke:\n\n       I'd like to go to the question about too-big-to-fail; that \n     we haven't gotten rid of it yet. And so now we have a double \n     problem, and that is that the big banks--big at the time that \n     they were bailed out the first time--have gotten bigger, and \n     at the same time that investors believe that too-big-to-fail \n     out there, that it's safer to put your money into the big \n     banks and not the little banks, in effect creating an \n     insurance policy for the big banks that the government is \n     creating this insurance policy--not there for the small \n     banks.\n\n  In a similar way, we have those concerns echoed in the real world \noutside this body on the right as well.\n  Recently, George Will said:\n\n       By breaking up the biggest banks, conservatives will not be \n     putting asunder what the free market has joined together. \n     Government nurtured these behemoths by weaving an improvident \n     safety net and by practicing crony capitalism.\n\n  Peggy Noonan, another well-known conservative, has said:\n\n       If you are conservative you are skeptical of concentrated \n     power. You know the bullying and bossism it can lead to. . . \n     . Too big to fail is too big to continue. The megabanks have \n     too much power in Washington and too much weight within the \n     financial system.\n\n  So I do think there is a real and growing consensus in this body, in \nWashington, and in the real world, as I have suggested by those \nobservers' quotes, and I think we need to build on that consensus and \nact in a responsible way.\n  Senator Brown and I have been doing that, first with joint letters to \nChairman Bernanke and others, focusing on the need for significantly \ngreater capital requirements for the biggest banks. We think this would \nbe the best and first way we should try to rein in too big to fail, to \nput more protection between megabank failure and the taxpayer, more \nincentive for the megabanks to perhaps diversify, perhaps break up, or \nat least correctly price their size and risk to the financial system.\n  We are following up on that initial work that was reflected in \nletters and specific suggestions to Chairman Bernanke with legislation \nthat is quite far along, and I know we will be talking about more both \ntoday and in the near future.\n  With that, let me invite Senator Brown to round out his comments, and \nthen I will have a few more words to say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. I know Senator Alexander is waiting to speak. I thank \nSenator Vitter for his work on this issue. I remember the first \ndiscussions Senator Vitter and I had about this when he was asking some \ntough questions of a couple of regulators--it might have been the \nSecretary of the Treasury as well as a couple of other regulators--on \ncapital standards and how important it was that, as he just mentioned, \nthese banks have the kinds of capital standards, have the kinds of \ncapital reserves that are so important in making sure these banks are \nhealthy. Probably most of us in our lives have seen the movie ``It's a \nWonderful Life,'' and we know what happens to a bank that is not \ncapitalized; a small-town example of a bank that served the country in \nways that community banks do. It is a very different story today, \nperhaps.\n  But I think his insight into the importance of capital reserves and \nthen continuing these discussions, we both came to the realization \nthat, as he pointed out, people all across the political spectrum--some \nof my more Democratic colleagues, people such as George Will and \nothers--have been very involved as business leaders and speaking out on \nissues that matter.\n\n[[Page S996]]\n\n  So I thank Senator Vitter for his work. We will be working on \nlegislation, and I am hopeful more of my colleagues see how important \nthis issue is so we can continue to work together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. VITTER. Again, I thank Senator Brown for his partnership. Senator \nBrown, with those posters, made crystal clear the facts. The fact is \nthat since the financial crisis, the megabanks have only continued to \ngrow in size, in dominance, and in market share. In fact, that has \naccelerated significantly.\n  Some folks will say: Oh, well, that was a preexisting trend. That is \nbecause of a number of factors.\n  It is certainly true there are a number of factors at issue. But the \ngrowth has only accelerated since the crisis and Dodd-Frank. It has not \nlet up. In addition, there have been several recent studies that \nactually quantify the fact that too big to fail is a market advantage, \nis, in essence, a taxpayer subsidy, as Elizabeth Warren suggested, for \nthe megabanks.\n  An FDIC study released in September says that. It says:\n\n       The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection \n     Act of 2010 was explicitly intended to, in part, put an end \n     to the TBTF [too big to fail] de facto policy.\n\n  But it concludes that:\n\n       The largest banks do, in fact, pay less for comparable \n     deposits. Furthermore, we show that some of the difference in \n     the cost of funding cannot be attributed to either \n     differences in balance sheet risk or any non-risk related \n     factors. The remaining unexplained risk premium gap is on the \n     order of 45 bps [basis points]. Such a gap is consistent with \n     an economically significant ``too-big-to-fail'' . . . subsidy \n     paid to the largest banks.\n\n  Another recent study and working paper is an IMF working paper. It \nsimply attempted to quantify that taxpayer too-big-to-fail subsidy. \nAccording to that study, before that financial crisis, the subsidy:\n\n       . . . was already sizable, 60 basis points. . . . It \n     increased to 80 basis points by the end [of] 2009.\n\n  Then, most recently, Bloomberg has tried to put pen to paper and \nrefine that calculation, and Bloomberg's calculation is $83 billion--an \n$83 billion subsidy of the five biggest U.S. banks, specifically \nbecause of artificially cheap rates created by the market believing \nthey are too big to fail.\n  I do not like huge size and dominance in market share, period. But \ncertainly--certainly--we should not have government policy that is \ndriving it, that is exacerbating it. It seems to me that should be a \nsolid consensus left and right, Democrat and Republican.\n  Senator Brown and I are following up on our previous work and \ndrafting legislation. Of course, we are not ready to introduce that \ntoday. But it would fundamentally require significantly more capital \nfor the megabanks and would distinguish between megabanks and other \nsize banks; namely, community banks, midsized banks, and regional \nbanks. The largest banks would have that significantly higher capital \nrequirement.\n  It would also try to walk regulators away from Basel III and \ninstitute new capital rules that do not rely on risk weights and are \nsimple and easy to understand and are transparent and cannot be gamed \nthe way we think Basel III can be manipulated and gamed.\n  Requiring this would do one or both of two things. It would better \nensure the taxpayer against bailouts and/or it would push the megabanks \nto restructure because they would be bearing more cost of that risk to \nthe financial system.\n  In addition, we are contemplating and discussing another section of \nthis bill that would do something that I think is very important to do \nat the same time: create an easier--not a lax but a more appropriate \nregulatory framework for clearly smaller and less risky financial \ninstitutions such as community banks.\n  Again, I thank Senator Brown for his partnership. I thank him for his \nwords today. I look forward to continuing to work on this project, as I \nbelieve a true bipartisan consensus continues to grow on this issue.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I will speak briefly, and then I will \ncertainly yield to Senator Alexander.\n  I appreciate very much Senator Vitter's words and comments and \ninsight. I wish to expand for 2 or 3 minutes on one thing he said about \nthe subsidy that these largest six banks get.\n  We can see again on this chart that 18 years ago these six banks' \ntotal assets were 18 percent; 18 years ago it was 18 percent of GDP. \nToday, through mergers and growth--and I would argue unfair competition \nin many cases--they are over 60 percent. But what Senator Vitter said, \nwhich I think is important to expand on a bit, is the subsidies these \nbanks get--Bloomberg said it was about $83 billion a year in subsidies \nthey get because of government action or inaction, frankly. It is \ninteresting, that $83 billion, when we are talking about the sequester \ntoday is about $85 billion, is not relevant, except putting it in some \ncontext.\n  But the reason they have this $83 billion subsidy, $85 billion \nsubsidy or so--$83, $84, $85 billion--or they have the advantage, when \nthey go in the capital markets, of getting the advantage of 50, 60, 70, \n80 basis points--and 80 basis points is eight-tenths of 1 percent in \ninterest rate advantage--is because the capital markets believe their \ninvestments in these banks are not very risky because the markets \nbelieve these banks are too big to fail because they have the \ngovernment backup for them.\n  So if they have no risk, people are willing to lend money to them at \nlower interest rates. That is why the Huntington Bank in Columbus, OH, \na large regional bank with about $50 billion in assets, or Key, a \nlarger bank in Ohio--still, though, a regional bank--or banks in \nColdwater, OH, or Sycamore, OH, or Third Federal in Cleveland--banks \nthat maybe own only a few tens of millions or even up to $1 billion in \nassets--do not have that advantage. They pay higher interest rates when \nthey borrow because the people who lend to them know they are not going \nto get bailed out if something bad happens.\n  It is only these six largest banks that have that advantage. So \nbecause they can borrow money from the markets at a lower rate, they \nare, in effect, being subsidized because we have not fixed this too-\nbig-to-fail problem for the Nation's banks.\n  So it is not a Senator or a conservative Republican or a progressive \nDemocrat from Louisiana or Ohio making this case that they are getting \nthis advantage; it is the capital markets that have decided, yes, these \nare too big to fail, so we are going to lend them money at lower rates \nthan we would lend to the Huntington or Key or Third Federal or \nFirstMerit in Ohio.\n  Fundamentally, that is the issue; that it is our actions or inactions \nthat have given these banks a competitive edge that nobody through acts \nof government--whether you are a liberal or a conservative--should \nbelieve it should be part of our economic system and our financial \nsystem.\n  I thank Senator Vitter and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cowan).

Mr. President, I am pleased to stand with so many \ncolleagues not only here on the Senate side but over in the House to \nrecognize an accomplishment--an accomplishment of the Congress. I think \nit is important to recognize that in these times that are so \ncontentious, where a lot of messages go back and forth but at the end \nof the day we haven't governed, we haven't done what we had hoped \nlegislatively, we haven't really helped people, today we can be proud \nthat we have worked to help people, particularly women, and that is \nthrough final passage of the Violence Against Women Act. It has been a \nlong time coming.\n  We successfully moved that legislation through this body last year. I \nwas a proud cosponsor, an early cosponsor. This ought not to be a \nRepublican issue or a Democratic issue. It ought not be a woman's \nissue. It is an issue that should bother all of us when we cannot stand \ntogether and help those who have been victims of domestic violence. If\n\n[[Page S997]]\n\nwe can't do that as a minimum, we really aren't doing our job, we \nreally aren't doing service to people.\n  It is exceptionally good news that not only have we seen final \npassage in the Senate again this Congress with 78 Senators in support, \nbut today the House on a vote of 286 ayes to 138 nays advanced the \nViolence Against Women Act reauthorization.\n  I wish to acknowledge the good work of the Judiciary chairman, \nSenator Leahy, for his leadership and for continually pushing. \nSometimes you need to keep going at it until it is recognized that the \ntime has long passed, come and gone, that we should act.\n  I am pleased that we heard the call of some 1,300 organizations \nrepresenting domestic and sexual violence groups, such as the AWAIC \nshelter in Anchorage. So many of the shelters across my State--truly, \nthose agencies, those people have done so much to help so many.\n  There is cause for celebration that the Congress has finally taken \nthe right action to help those victims of domestic violence. I am \npleased to acknowledge that accomplishment today.\n\n\n                           King Cove, Alaska\n\n  Mr. President, I want to continue with a story I began a few weeks \nago. I stood before this body and decried the actions of the Fish and \nWildlife Service when they announced they were moving forward with a \nno-action alternative in an area of the State of Alaska on the Aleutian \nchain, in the Aleutians East Borough where the small community of King \nCove, a small community of less than 1,000 people, was being denied \naccess to an all-weather airport--an airport that could help relieve \nthe suffering, the anxiety. Truly, there is trauma that comes when \nthere is a medical emergency in your community and you are trapped \nbecause of the weather: You can't get a plane, you can't get a boat \nsafely to you. There is an option, and that option would require that a \n10-mile stretch of road, a one-lane gravel road designed for \nnoncommercial use, be placed on the edge of the refuge to allow for \nthis Aleut community to access the rest of the world for help, for \nmedical help.\n  I stood and I told my story, and I wanted to update the Senate as to \nwhere we stand today because as much as I would like to say that I was \nsuccessful down here on floor in encouraging the Secretary of the \nInterior to act in the best interests of the people who live in King \nCove, respect their safety, respect their lives as much as the refuge \nis being respected--I wouldn't need to update you; I would just say it \nwas a good win for all. The fact is that we are not there yet. So I \nthink it is important that people understand where exactly we are.\n  I think this is about the sixth visit the people of King Cove have \nmade from King Cove, AK--some 4,000-plus miles--to Washington, DC. They \nwere given an opportunity to meet with Secretary Salazar this morning. \nI had an opportunity, along with Senator Begich, to get an update on \nthat meeting, and I heard that it was good and the Secretary listened. \nI hope the Secretary listened not only with his ears but with his eyes \nas he saw the tears of those people, with his soul as he heard their \nfears, their anxieties. I so hope that the Secretary appreciates that \nwhen he says his highest moral responsibility is to the Native and \nIndian people, he is able to translate that into action, into positive \naction for these people in King Cove.\n  I would like to share with you in the few minutes I have remaining \nsome of the stories the Secretary heard this morning.\n  The community of King Cove is out in the Aleutians, about 600 air \nmiles from Anchorage. It is about a $1,000 roundtrip ticket to get to \nAnchorage. Why do you need to get to Anchorage? King Cove has a medical \nclinic, it has a physician's assistant. If you have anything more \nserious than a need to set a broken bone, for instance, you must leave \nthe village for care in Anchorage, so you need to make that trip.\n  A community such as King Cove has real mountains. It is tough to get \nin and out by plane. In fact, the Coast Guard, which was called in to \ndo five rescues last year, says that getting in and out of the King \nCove airstrip is one of the worst places in Alaska because of the \nterrain, the weather, the wind shears that come off the mountains, the \nturbulence that pushes a helicopter down. It is just a bad-case \nscenario. Fixed wing, helicopter--it doesn't make any difference. It is \ntough.\n  There is an option. King Cove is on the water, but the waters in King \nCove are not always calm. In this picture, unfortunately, it seems \nalmost tropical looking with the blue waters. This is the dock in King \nCove. You might not be able to see it from where you are sitting, Mr. \nPresident, but each one of these rungs up this steep metal ladder is \nabout 2 feet. So if you were down here in your boat, if you had been \ndelivered by crab boat to King Cove--about a 2\\1/2\\ or 3 hour ride \nacross waters that can be about 20 feet high in the blowing gale--you \nthen have an opportunity to come to the dock, and this is the way you \nget up the dock.\n  However, if you are like Lonnie's father--Lonnie was here to speak to \nthe Secretary today. His father, a 67-year-old man, had double \npneumonia. They had to get him out of King Cove and into Anchorage. In \norder for this very sick man to get up this ladder, his son, who is \nright down here, is pushing him up from behind. They have a line from a \ncrab pot around his upper body. This gentleman just had shoulder \nsurgery a couple months prior to this, and they literally hauled him \nup.\n\n  This was several years ago. You might think, well, maybe things have \ngotten better in King Cove. This picture is an individual being hauled \nup off the docks in a gurney-type of sled. This dock is where he is \nbeing hauled up. This is how we haul the crab pots out of the water. \nTwo weeks ago this gentleman broke his leg in four different places and \nwas in danger of losing his foot if he couldn't be medevaced to \nAnchorage.\n  The technology hasn't gotten better. We haven't been able to figure \nout how to move people safely if they are injured.\n  There are situations with aircraft where, because of the wind shears \nand the topography, there are landings like this. This is the landing \nthat Della Trumble, who came back to speak to the Secretary this \nmorning, witnessed as her daughter, who was in this plane, was on \napproach. All of a sudden gusts came out of nowhere and this aircraft \nwas pushed down, smashed into the runway. Fortunately, there were no \nfatalities. But Trisha, her daughter, who also came back to talk with \nthe Secretary, is so frightened to fly anymore that it is pretty \namazing that she was even able to make the trip back.\n  The stories are so real, and the stories are so much in the present. \nWe think about those who aren't here to tell the stories. These are \nsome of the individuals who over the course of years have died, whether \nin an airplane crash some years ago where four individuals died, \nwhether it is Christine or Mary or Ernest or Walter. These are folks \nwho didn't make it out. But what we don't have here are those people \nliving now who have their foot, barely, or who recovered from that \ndouble pneumonia, barely. They are living to tell the story or their \nfamily members are living to tell the story, but they are horror \nstories.\n  There is a simple answer, and a simple answer is a 10-mile, one-lane \ngravel road with a cable along the length of the road so that you can't \ngo off the road and go joyriding in the refuge.\n  We are talking about a small community of less than 1,000 people \nbeing attached to another community where there are less than 100 \npeople. You are never going to have the volume of traffic you have in \nyour State or that I have in the more urban areas of Alaska. We are \ntalking about a connector road to be used for noncommercial uses.\n  When a woman like Annette needs to travel up this ladder--I don't \ncare even if it is good weather like this--if a pregnant woman needs to \nget out of town by getting on a crab boat and going 3 hours across \nturbulent waters, hauling her up a metal ladder like this to get to an \nairplane, where she may fly out and make that connection to Anchorage--\nwhen you put her through this, you wonder why that pregnant woman is \ndoing that. You cannot deliver a baby in King Cove. We don't have \ndoctors, and we don't have anesthesiologists. Six weeks before your due \ndate, you are told to go to town. ``Town'' is Anchorage, AK--600 miles \naway. When they are 8 months pregnant, every pregnant woman in King \nCove must get out. This is what we are putting these people \nthrough. And the answer is so simple.\n\n[[Page S998]]\n\n  So I stand before you today with a call--a call to Secretary Salazar, \na call to this administration to listen to the people. Listen to the \npeople who have lived in an area for a thousand-plus years who want to \ncontinue to call this place home and who are looking for very basic \naccommodations--very basic accommodations.\n  We have refuges all over this country. I got an e-mail from a friend \nof mine who said, as I am sending you this text, I am driving through a \nrefuge in Florida--driving through a refuge in Florida. It is a paved \nroad. There are signs along the road. There are two lanes and it is a \nrefuge. We are asking for a 10-mile, 1-lane gravel, basically emergency \naccess road for the people of King Cove.\n  Sometimes I think because King Cove is so far out of the way--at the \nend of the world as far as some people are concerned--it is kind of out \nof sight, out of mind, and that maybe what we do is we say in this part \nof the country the birds are more important than the people. There is \nsensitive habitat out there, I agree, and we need to be responsible in \nhow we protect habitat. But we can protect habitat and we can also let \nthe human beings who live there exist or coexist side by side and do it \nrespectfully. The people in King Cove respect the land more than you \nand I can ever appreciate, because if they fail to respect the land, \nthey do not live.\n  So when we talk about how we can reach an accommodation, the people \nof King Cove say, we are asking for a simple level of safety, and in \norder to gain this level of safety, we are willing to give up our \nlands. We are willing to give up other lands we own in exchange for \nthis small corridor. So when we are talking about this trade, this land \nconveyance exchange we signed off on in 2009, it is a 300-to-1 \nexchange. The Federal Government gets 300 times more than the Aleuts \nget--300 times more--or basically 56,000-plus acres going to the \nFederal Government. This will be the first new wilderness created in \nAlaska since INILKA back in the 1980s.\n  What is being asked for is this small corridor, basically 206 acres, \nall told. Yet the Fish and Wildlife Service has said, Nope, 300-to-1 \nisn't good enough for us. They think there are other alternatives. They \nsay: Well, why can't you have a ferry? Put a lightweight aluminum ferry \nout there. And do you know what the Fish and Wildlife Service did? They \nactually went out, when they were looking at the EIS, and they decided \nthey were going to cost out what an aluminum ferry might cost. So when \nthe Director of Fish and Wildlife sat down with me, he said: Senator, \nthere is another alternative out there.\n  Well, he should talk to the people of King Cove about how viable an \nacross-water alternative is when, during the wintertime, you can't get \ninto these areas because it is all iced over. You can't get into that \narea. Talk to the people in King Cove about what it means to be very \nsick, to have double pneumonia, to be 8\\1/2\\ months pregnant, to have \nbroken bones or a broken body, and have to fight 20-foot waves for 3 \nhours and then climb up a ladder, such as the one I have shown here, in \nthose elements, to get to an all-weather airport that can get you \nsafely to Anchorage. All they are asking for is a 10-mile gravel road.\n  I have suggested to the Secretary--and I have suggested this to the \nPresident's nominee to be Secretary of the Interior--that sometimes I \nthink there is a double standard; that we allow things to go on in \nother parts of the country, but in Alaska there is a different \nstandard. The standard for the safety of an American should never be \nchanged. It should not be higher for someone in the eastern part of the \ncountry than it is for somebody out in King Cove. We are talking about \nthe safety of Americans, with a reasonable alternative. We shouldn't be \nhaving to fight our government this way.\n  But the people of King Cove are willing to travel all the way to make \ntheir case. I thank the Secretary for hearing them out. I think the \nSecretary is a compassionate man, and my hope is that when he looked in \ntheir eyes and he heard their stories his heart was moved to respect \nthe people of King Cove, to respect the Alaska Natives, to respect them \nas much as he has shown respect for the public lands he has been \nentrusted to protect these past 4 years. Here is an opportunity to \nissue this best-interest finding and to reverse the decision from the \nFish and Wildlife Service which says that no action is the way we go \nforward.\n  No action compromises the safety of these Americans. That is not \nacceptable.\n  We will keep working. We will keep fighting. But I believe that in \nthe end, right will prevail and the people of King Cove will have their \nsafety.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  (Mrs. GILLIBRAND assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/28/senate-section/article/S998-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S998-S999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, tomorrow we will begin commemoration of \nWomen's History Month--an annual occasion to celebrate and honor the \nmany contributions of women to American history, culture, and society. \nSince our Nation's founding, generations of women have fought injustice \nand broken down barriers at home, in the workplace, and in their \ncommunities in pursuit of the American dream. During Women's History \nMonth, we remember these struggles, celebrate our collective progress, \nand renew our commitment to protecting the rights of all women.\n  Earlier this month, the Senate came together in the best tradition of \nthe Chamber to pass the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act with a strong bipartisan vote. This bill would not \nhave passed without the strong leadership and support of every woman \ncurrently serving in the Senate. And today the House of Representatives \npassed our bipartisan bill to help survivors of rape, domestic \nviolence, stalking, and human trafficking. On the eve of Women's \nHistory month, Congress's actions will prevent terrible crimes and help \ncountless victims rebuild their lives.\n  A few days from now, on March 3, 2013, we will mark the centennial \ncelebration of the 1913 women's suffrage procession--a watershed moment \nin the struggle for women's right to vote. On March 3, 1913--the eve of \nthe inauguration of President Woodrow Wilson--more than 5,000 women \nfrom every State in the Union assembled in Washington, DC, to march for \nthe right to vote. They did so in the face of widespread opposition to \ntheir cause, and some were hospitalized after violence erupted along \nthe parade route. A century later, this courageous public act is \nrecognized as the key turning point that led to the ratification of the \n19th amendment to the Constitution, giving women the right to vote in \n1920.\n  In the coming days, we will witness the arc of American history, as \nthousands of women retrace the steps of the heroines of 1913, by \nreenacting the Women's Suffrage March. This ``Centennial Women's \nSuffrage March'' will be led by the women of Delta Sigma Theta \nSorority, Incorporated--the only African-American women's organization \nto participate in the 1913 march. I commend Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, \nUniteWomen.org, the American Association of University Women, the \nDaughters of the American Revolution and the many other women's \norganizations that will join forces to reenact this historic event. I \nalso commend the many government and private sector institutions that \nwill support this event, including the National Archives and Records \nAdministration, the National Park Service, the National Women's History \nMuseum, and the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History.\n  Like the many Americans who will commemorate the women's suffrage \nmarch this weekend, I celebrate the progress that we have made towards \njustice, fairness, and equality for women--and for all of our citizens. \nBut, while we have made remarkable strides towards gender equality, \ngender discrimination still exists. According to a recent study by the \nAmerican Association of University of Women, full-time working women \nwho are recent college graduates earn, on average, just 82 percent of \nwhat their male counterparts earn in the workplace. This gender wage \ngap directly affects the economic stability of American families. A \nCenter for American Progress report on women in the workplace found \nthat in 2010 nearly two-thirds of all American mothers were either the \nprimary breadwinner for their family or shared that financial \nresponsibility with a spouse or a partner.\n\n[[Page S999]]\n\n  As we celebrate Women's History Month, the courageous acts of the \nAmerican heroines of 1913 should inspire us all to work to eliminate \nthe gender inequalities that still exist in our society today. I join \nall Americans in celebrating the countless contributions of women to \nour Nation's history and culture and in working towards a more just and \nfair society for future generations of American women and girls.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/28/senate-section/article/S999-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING LORI ACTON\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it is with deep regret and grief that \nI inform my fellow senators of the passing of my personal friend, Lori \nActon. Mrs. Acton was a dynamic and dedicated woman whose absence in \nthe community of Laurel County will be immediately and acutely felt.\n  Lori is someone who cannot be replaced. As the executive director of \nthe Laurel County Public Library, she was a passionate leader who was \nvisionary without being reckless, infectiously funny without being \nfrivolous, direct and driven without being rude or mean-spirited, and a \ntireless worker who fully enjoyed the life and work she participated \nin. Her work with the library spanned nearly three decades, but the \nimpact of her influence and passion cannot be measured by the usual \nmetrics. Indeed, as one local writer noted, ``what people like Lori \nmean to a community cannot be seen by those who do not know her.'' She \nrevolutionized the library system through hiring a stellar staff, \ninstituting new, creative, and interesting programs, and constantly \nimproving every issue she addressed.\n  Lori made an impact on people's lives. Not only did the library \nbenefit from her enthusiastic approach to fostering a love of reading \nand learning, but her very presence and constant smile became \nsignatures of her community. Countless testimonies from those who knew \nher speak to what an incredible impact she had as both a librarian and \na friend.\n  At this time, I ask that we join together with the community of \nLaurel County, KY, in mourning the loss of my friend Mrs. Lori Acton. I \nbelieve that others can aspire to emulate Lori's character, enthusiasm, \nlove and involvement with the community she lived in.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that an article lauding Lori from the \nLaurel County-area publication the Sentinel Echo appear in today's \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Sentinel Echo, January 30, 2013]\n\n                  Laurel Library Director Dies Monday\n\n                            (By Jeff Noble)\n\n       Corbin.--For more than a quarter-century, Lori Acton gave \n     people of all ages a window to the world and beyond by \n     opening the doors to them at the Laurel County Public \n     Library.\n       On Wednesday, her colleagues and friends remembered Acton \n     as a passionate advocate for inspiring others through the \n     library's staff, service, and outreach programs.\n       Acton, the library's district director since 1985, died \n     Monday at her home in London. She was 57.\n       ``The library was more than a job to Lori--it was her \n     passion, and she worked tirelessly to make the library a \n     place everyone could come and enjoy and learn. From babies to \n     seniors, she wanted this library to offer whatever it could \n     to enrich their lives and the community. We plan on working \n     our hardest to make sure that Lori's vision to the future \n     continues,'' the library's deputy director, Peggy Mershon, \n     said Wednesday.\n       Another who knew Acton said she was the driving force in \n     moving the library from its 4th Street location to its \n     present home on College Park Drive in London, which opened in \n     2003.\n       ``Her visionary leadership, enthusiasm, and energy have \n     been pivotal in creating a model of what a library can become \n     in the 21st century,'' said R.  W. Dyche III, president of \n     the Laurel County Public Library's Board of Trustees.\n       In a phone interview Wednesday, Dyche said two traits made \n     Acton stand out above the crowd.\n       ``Number one, she was full of enthusiasm. Lori pursued all \n     goals with enthusiasm. It was her determination that led \n     directly to the opening of the new library. Second, she had a \n     lot of strengths. One of them was she was not afraid to hire \n     extremely talented people to work for her. She'll be \n     remembered as a very happy person, so pleased to help people \n     in Laurel and surrounding areas with their educational \n     needs.''\n       To honor her memory, the main library and their branches in \n     Corbin and North London were closed Tuesday.\n       A picture of Acton, along with the dates of her birth and \n     death in white letters over a black background, was posted on \n     the home page of the library's website.\n       Kathryn Hardman was one of Acton's closest friends. \n     Together the two worked on improving literacy in the county, \n     and also were active in community activities as members of \n     the London Rotary Club.\n       She said in a phone interview Wednesday the news of Acton's \n     passing was still echoing over London and Laurel County.\n       ``We're all pretty shocked. It's incomprehensible. She had \n     a lot of friends in the community. She's been a vital part of \n     our community for 28 years. The community mourns this loss,'' \n     noted Hardman, who is the executive director of Laurel County \n     Adult Education.\n       Hardman pointed out that because of Acton's direction, the \n     library spearheaded the creation of the program in 1986 to \n     promote adult literacy. Acton was also on the board of \n     directors of the Saint Joseph London Foundation.\n       There were other roles in Acton's life. Hardman added, \n     ``Her most significant role was as mother, wife, daughter, \n     sister, and friend.''\n       ``We've been having lunch for 25 years. We talked about our \n     careers, our community, our nation, our families, and of \n     course, politics. We both loved to talk about politics. It \n     would be fair to say we both had strong opinions.''\n       Acton's role as a Rotary member was extensive. At the time \n     of her passing, she was looking forward to working on the \n     annual Rotary International Dinner, a project Acton had \n     headed for the past five years, and is sponsored by both the \n     London and Corbin Rotary Clubs.\n       That passion Acton had with the library extended to her \n     planning the dinner and to helping worthy causes, said Corbin \n     Rotary Club member the Rev.

Madam President, I rise today to reflect on the loss \nof Mr. Jack Sizemore, an exemplary citizen of Kentucky and a genuinely \ngood man. Mr. Sizemore, of Laurel County, was laid to rest on February \n12, 2013, and is survived by his wife, 7 children, 20 grand-children, \n16 great-grandchildren, and two sisters.\n  The words, ``let me tell you what Jack Sizemore did for me'' are \ncommonly heard in Jack's beloved town of London, and represent just how \nsorely his presence will be missed. His legacy of goodwill is firmly \nestablished after years working in the Laurel County Detention Center, \nas he chose to build a reputation as a jailer who ``liked the job he \nwas doing and [who] took care of the prisoners in a humane way and with \nthe utmost courtesy.'' This testimony comes from his former supervisor \nEdd Parsley, who admits that ``you don't find many men like that.''\n  Jack was known to always have people laughing, and the community he \nloved so much has looked back and seen all the ways he touched their \nlives. The health problems that plagued his final years cannot begin to \ntake attention away from his legacy and reputation.\n  At this time, I ask that my colleagues in this United States Senate \njoin me in honoring Mr. Jack Sizemore. Along with our condolences to \nhis friends and family, we simultaneously offer our gratitude and \npraise of this truly wonderful man.\n\n[[Page S1000]]\n\n  I also ask unanimous consent that an article on the life and service \nof Mr. Jack Sizemore that appeared in the Laurel County-area \npublication the Sentinel Echo be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the following article was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Sentinel Echo, February 15, 2013]\n\n                 Former Jailer Remembered as `Good Man'\n\n                           (By Nita Johnson)\n\n       Laurel County, Kentucky.--A former Laurel County jailer, \n     chief administrator of the jail, and deputy sheriff was laid \n     to rest on Tuesday after ongoing health problems.\n       Jack Sizemore, 76, died Saturday at his home from \n     frontotemporal dementia, which left him unable to communicate \n     with others. Sizemore left a legacy of goodwill for his \n     family, friends and co-workers.\n       Edd Parsley worked with Sizemore after Parsley was \n     appointed as jailer in 1997. Sizemore stayed on as chief \n     administrator of the Laurel County Detention Center when \n     Parsley was elected to a four-year term as jailer.\n       ``Jack worked for me for six years as chief administrator \n     of the jail, and he was one of those people that if you told \n     him to do something, you could very well rest assured that he \n     would carry it out,'' Parsley said. ``He liked the job he was \n     doing and he took care of the prisoners in a humane way and \n     with the utmost courtesy. You don't find many men like \n     that.''\n       Describing Sizemore as ``a good man,'' Parsley reviewed \n     Sizemore's background that made him invaluable at the jail.\n       ``He was experienced in law enforcement. He was a deputy \n     under several sheriffs,'' Parsley said. ``He realized what \n     had to be done and did it. He served this county well as a \n     jailer, chief administrator and deputy.''\n       Barb Rudder, who has worked in the booking department of \n     the jail for nearly 20 years, said Sizemore was ``a good \n     person to work with.''\n       ``He always used to have people laughing and he would tell \n     everyone that I was his babysitter.''\n       After Sizemore retired, Rudder said she visited him during \n     his illness the past two years.\n       ``It's a sad loss for the community and for his family,'' \n     she said.\n       That loss is indeed sad for Madgel Miller, who was one of \n     Sizemore's stepchildren.\n       ``Jack was my stepdad, but we didn't use `step' in our \n     family,'' Miller said. ``He had seven kids, 20 grandchildren, \n     16 great-grandchildren, some of whom were step. But step was \n     never considered in the family.''\n       Sizemore faced several health issues during the latter part \n     of his life, Miller said, including a quadruple bypass in \n     2008.\n       ``But he came through that very well and since he did, we \n     were expecting him to have a long retirement.''\n       But other health problems came with the frontotemporal \n     dementia, which affects one's communication skills.\n       ``It is a rare form of dementia, but he and my mother never \n     had a problem communicating,'' she said. ``He loved my mother \n     unconditionally, and they had their own form of \n     communicating.''\n       But the past several months had taken its toll on the \n     former jailer, and Miller said by Christmas, Sizemore was \n     very ill.\n       ``He had a rapid decline from it [dementia]. Last week, he \n     had a real hard time of it, and my mother made a doctor's \n     appointment for him,'' Miller added. ``He was in the hospital \n     Wednesday because the doctor said he was weak and dehydrated. \n     But he was able to walk in the hospital. He went home Friday \n     and had a good night with family, and some friends came over. \n     He couldn't communicate with us. He died in his sleep that \n     night, with Mom and me beside him.''\n       Choking back tears, Miller described Sizemore as a man with \n     ``a good heart'' who was also ``very intelligent.''\n       Miller said many people had come to tell the family how \n     Sizemore had touched their lives.\n       ``It was good to hear people say, `Let me tell you what \n     Jack Sizemore did for me,' and it was stories that he never \n     told. Jack was always telling stories, but these were about \n     what he did for people,'' Miller said. ``I remember when I \n     was going to college, he would tell me, `This is a good place \n     to raise kids. This is a good place to live.' He loved this \n     town.''\n       Hearing the impact that her father had had on the people he \n     dealt with during his lifetime, Miller said her opinion of \n     Sizemore's goodwill towards others was reinforced.\n       ``He was a very private person and didn't tell people about \n     the dementia,'' she said. ``He knew how to handle people and \n     how to keep his own life private and personal. We made the \n     arrangements quickly because he would rather be remembered in \n     better times. Knowing Jack Sizemore, he would have had it no \n     other way.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/28/senate-section/article/S1000-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1000-S1001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SHELBY COUNTY V. HOLDER\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, in 2005, I was honored to join \nCongressman John Lewis on a trip to Selma, AL, for a ceremonial walk \nover the Edmund Pettus Bridge to mark the 40th anniversary of what has \ncome to be known as ``Bloody Sunday.''\n  In March of 1965, Congressman Lewis, Rev. Hosea Williams, and 600 \nother brave civil rights activists led a voting rights march over that \nbridge.\n  These courageous men, women, and children were marching for civil \nrights and voting rights. All they would receive that day, however, \nwere beatings and bruises from police batons as they were turned back \nand chased down by State troopers.\n  A few days after ``Bloody Sunday,'' President Johnson addressed the \nNation and called on the House and the Senate to pass the Voting Rights \nAct.\n  Shortly thereafter, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law, \nguaranteeing that the fundamental right to vote would never again be \ncanceled out by clever schemes--like poll taxes and literacy tests--\ndevised to keep African Americans from voting.\n  The Voting Rights Act is the cornerstone of the civil rights movement \nand one of the most effective laws on the books when it comes to \nprotecting the right to vote for all Americans.\n  On Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Shelby County \nv. Holder, a case challenging the constitutionality of section 5, which \nis the very heart of the Voting Rights Act.\n  That section requires jurisdictions in all or part of 16 States with \na history of discrimination to get approval from the Department of \nJustice or a Federal court before making any changes to congressional \ndistricts or voting procedures.\n  This is not the first time that the Supreme Court has heard a \nchallenge to the Voting Rights Act. Though it has been subject to four \nprior Supreme Court challenges, the Voting Rights Act has always \nemerged intact and on sound legal and constitutional ground.\n  Each of the four times that the Voting Rights Act has been \nreauthorized--in 1970, 1975, 1982, and most recently in 2006--Congress \nhas done so with the broad bipartisan support and overwhelming \nmajorities that are all too rare these days.\n  That is because protecting the right to vote should not be a partisan \nprerogative. It is not a Democratic or Republican issue. It is a \nfundamental right for every eligible voter, and it is a core value of \nour American democracy.\n  In 2006, the House of Representatives voted 390 to 33 in favor of \nreauthorizing the law. The Senate voted unanimously, 98 to 0, to \nreauthorize the law. And the final bill was signed into law by \nPresident George W. Bush.\n  There was good reason for this bipartisan support for reauthorizing \nthe Voting Rights Act. Congress developed an extensive record, holding \n21 hearings, reviewing more than 15,000 pages in the Congressional \nRecord, and hearing from more than 90 witnesses about the need to \nreauthorize the law.\n  Conservative Republican Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner is one example. \nCongressman Sensenbrenner was the chairman of the House Judiciary \nCommittee when Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights Act. He strongly \nbelieves that section 5 is constitutional, and he has filed a brief \nasking the Supreme Court to uphold the law.\n  My hope is that the Supreme Court will look at the extensive evidence \nCongress reviewed in 2006 and defer to the judgment of an overwhelming \nmajority of the House and a unanimous Senate.\n  The Court should affirm the constitutionality of this critical tool \nfor protecting the right to vote.\n  We all acknowledge the progress that our great country has made on \ncivil rights and voting rights issues. The current occupant of 1600 \nPennsylvania Ave., is a symbol and timely reminder that our Nation has \nindeed grown to be more perfect--and more inclusive in many ways--than \njust a few generations ago.\n  We are not yet, however, a perfect union. And some of the \njurisdictions covered by the Voting Rights Act have both a demonstrated \nhistory and a contemporary record of implementing discriminatory \nrestrictions on voting.\n  The Voting Rights Act has been essential in securing the progress we \nhave made as a nation over the last five decades.\n  And as my Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights \nand Human Rights found during a series of hearings last Congress, the \nVoting Rights Act remains a relevant and critical tool in protecting \nthe right to vote.\n\n[[Page S1001]]\n\n  After a careful analysis of new voter ID laws in Texas and South \nCarolina, the Department of Justice used its authority under section 5 \nof the Voting Rights Act to object to the implementation of new photo \nidentification requirements.\n  In Texas, according to the State's own data, more than 790,000 \nregistered voters did not have the ID required to vote under the new \nTexas law.\n  That law would have had a disproportionate impact on Latino voters \nbecause 38.2 percent of registered Hispanic voters did not have the \ntype of ID required by the law.\n  In South Carolina, the State's own data indicated that almost 240,000 \nregistered voters did not have the identification required to vote \nunder the State's new law.\n  That included 10 percent of all registered minorities in South \nCarolina who would not be able to vote under the new law.\n  That is more than 1 million registered voters who would have been \nturned away from the polls in Texas and South Carolina if the \nDepartment of Justice did not have the authority to object to those \nphoto identification laws under the Voting Rights Act.\n  Opponents of the Voting Rights Act claim that some of the \njurisdictions covered by the law should no longer be subject to it.\n  They rarely mention, however, that the Voting Rights Act itself \ncontains a provision allowing jurisdictions to ``bail out'' or be \nexcused from coverage under the law if they demonstrate compliance with \nthe law for the previous 10 years.\n  In 2006, the Supreme Court clarified and expanded this bailout \nprovision.\n  As a result, more than 190 jurisdictions have bailed out of coverage \nunder the Voting Rights Act. The fact that so many jurisdictions have \nbeen excused from coverage under the law proves two very important \npoints.\n  First, the Voting Rights Act is having its intended effect. States \nand localities that previously had a record of discriminating against \nminority voters are no longer doing so thanks to the scrutiny of the \nVoting Rights Act.\n  Second, the Voting Rights Act is not over-inclusive. Jurisdictions \nthat can prove they are not discriminating--over a reasonable period of \ntime--will be excused from coverage under the law.\n  The Voting Rights Act is not about who wins an election. It is not \nabout political advantage. It is about ensuring that every eligible \nAmerican can vote and that their vote will be counted.\n  As long as there continues to be evidence that some people are being \ndenied the right to vote, we have an obligation to remedy that problem.\n  The Voting Rights Act has done its job of protecting the right to \nvote for almost 50 years. Congress did its job in 2006 by developing an \nextensive record and reauthorizing the law in an overwhelming and \nbipartisan manner.\n  It is my hope the Supreme Court will now do its job and affirm the \nconstitutionality of this critical law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/28/senate-section/article/S1001-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SOUTHERN ILLINOIS TORNADO ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this week marks the 1-year anniversary \nof the deadly tornado that devastated the towns of Harrisburg and \nRidgway in Saline and Gallatin Counties.\n  I visited both of those towns right after the tornado.\n  I have seen my fair share of tornado damage in my life. But when I \nvisited Harrisburg and Ridgway, I saw some things I have never seen \nbefore. I expected to see some trees blown down and shingles torn off \nroofs. Instead, I saw entire houses lifted from their concrete \nfoundation and tossed on top of the neighboring house.\n  The loss of homes and property was really difficult to bear, but the \nreal tragedy lies in the lives that were claimed by this tornado. Eight \npeople died as a result of this violent storm: Randy Rann, Donna Rann, \nJaylynn Ferrell, Mary Osman, Linda Hull, Greg Swierk, Don Smith and R. \nBlaine Mauney.\n  But despite this incredible loss, when I visited Harrisburg and \nRidgway, what I didn't see were broken spirits. Instead, from the very \nminute this disaster took place, people came together to rebuild the \ncommunity. The outpouring of support was amazing almost 6,000 people \npitched in before it was all over.\n  And I can't say enough about the tireless efforts the emergency \npersonnel who were there from the minute that the sirens went off. They \nwere there to help under the most extraordinary circumstances.\n  I went to Harrisburg 5 weeks after my first visit and I was amazed at \nhow much better the community looked.\n  Today, both communities have made incredible progress moving forward, \nthanks again to everyone engaged in the rescue and cleanup at every \nlevel, and during this entire past year.\n  I also want to recognize the hard work and dedication of: Jonathan \nMonken, head of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency; Eric Gregg, \nMayor of Harrisburg; Becky Mitchell, Mayor of Ridgway; State Senator \nGary Forby; and State Representative Brandon Phelps. They were there \nwhen their constituents and their communities needed them the most.\n  Today, when I see how much the residents of Harrisburg and Ridgway \nhave done to rebuild their communities over the past year, I am proud \nto be from Illinois and proud to be part of this great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/28/senate-section/article/S1001-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DIANNE JONES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a friend \nand exceptional Illinoisan who recently passed away.\n  In 1949, a young woman from New York moved to Chicago to attend \ncollege at Roosevelt University. Her name was Dianne Jones, and she \nstayed for the next 63 years.\n  After graduating from Roosevelt, Dianne decided she wanted to teach, \nand she began planting her roots in the civil rights and labor \ncommunities. Along with her husband Linzey, she fought for civil rights \nand equality by helping to organize two Chicago-area chapters of the \nNAACP. Dianne then led the successful effort to desegregate the city's \nRainbow Beach, and she even attended the 1963 March on Washington where \nMartin Luther King, Jr. delivered his famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech.\n  As a teacher, Dianne established herself as an advocate for educators \nand children by helping to found one of the first teachers unions in \nIllinois. She later served as that union's local president, as well as \nvice president of the Illinois Federation of Teachers. As a teacher and \nan advocate, Dianne spent her life fighting to promote equality, \njustice, civil rights and education in Illinois. And she enjoyed it.\n  Once, when asked about her career, Dianne said, ``Everyone should get \nto work at what they would volunteer to do.''\n  Dianne Jones was one of the lucky people who got to do just that. \nThose roots that she planted 50 years ago have continued to grow and \nmultiply ever since.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/28/senate-section/article/S1001-3", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1001-S1002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

No proposed legislation shall be referred to such \n     committee, and such committee shall not have power to report \n     by bill, or otherwise have legislative jurisdiction.\n       (2) The special committee shall, from time to time (but not \n     less than once a year), report to the Senate the results of \n     the study conducted pursuant to paragraph (1), together with \n     such recommendation as it considers appropriate.\n       (c)(1) For the purposes of this section, the special \n     committee is authorized, in its discretion, (A) to make \n     investigations into any matter within its jurisdiction, (B) \n     to make expenditures from the contingent fund of the Senate, \n     (C) to employ personnel, (D) to hold hearings, (E) to sit and \n     act at any time or place during the sessions, recesses, and \n     adjourned periods of the Senate, (F) to require, by subpoena \n     or otherwise, the attendance of witnesses and the production \n     of correspondence books, papers, and documents, (G) to take \n     depositions and other testimony, (H) to procure the service \n     of individual consultants or organizations thereof (as \n     authorized by section 202(I) of the Legislative \n     Reorganization Act of 1946, as amended) and (I) with the \n     prior consent of the Government department or agency \n     concerned and the Committee on Rules and Administration, to \n     use on a reimbursable basis the services of personnel of any \n     such department or agency.\n       (2) The chairman of the special committee or any Member \n     thereof may administer oaths to witnesses.\n       (3) Subpoenas authorized by the special committee may be \n     issued over the signature of the chairman, or any Member of \n     the special committee designated by the chairman, and may be \n     served by any person designated by the chairman or the Member \n     signing the subpoena.\n       (d) All records and papers of the temporary Special \n     Committee on Aging established by Senate Resolution 33, \n     Eighty-seventh Congress, are transferred to the special \n     committee.\n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n                        I. Convening of Meetings\n\n       1. Meetings. The Committee shall meet to conduct Committee \n     business at the call of the Chairman. The Members of the \n     Committee may call additional meetings as provided in Senate \n     Rule XXVI (3).\n       2. Notice and Agenda: \n       (a) Written or Electronic Notice. The Chairman shall give \n     the Members written or electronic notice of any Committee \n     meeting, accompanied by an agenda enumerating the items of \n     business to be considered, at least 5 days in advance of such \n     meeting.\n       (b) Shortened Notice. A meeting may be called on not less \n     than 24 hours notice if the Chairman, with the concurrence of \n     the Ranking Minority Member, determines that there is good \n     cause to begin the meeting on shortened notice. An agenda \n     will be furnished prior to such a meeting.\n       3. Presiding Officer. The Chairman shall preside when \n     present. If the Chairman is not present at any meeting, the \n     Ranking Majority Member present shall preside.\n\n                       II. Convening of Hearings\n\n       1. Notice. The Committee shall make public announcement of \n     the date, place and subject matter of any hearing at least \n     one week before its commencement. A hearing may be called on \n     not less than 24 hours notice if the Chairman, with the \n     concurrence of the Ranking Minority Member, determines that \n     there is good cause to begin the hearing on shortened notice.\n       2. Presiding Officer. The Chairman shall preside over the \n     conduct of a hearing when present, or, whether present or \n     not, may delegate authority to preside to any Member of the \n     Committee.\n       3. Witnesses. Witnesses called before the Committee shall \n     be given, absent extraordinary circumstances, at least 48 \n     hours notice, and all witnesses called shall be furnished \n     with a copy of these rules upon request.\n       4. Oath. All witnesses who testify to matters of fact shall \n     be sworn unless the Committee waives the oath. The Chairman, \n     or any Member, may request and administer the oath.\n       5. Testimony. At least 48 hours in advance of a hearing, \n     each witness who is to appear before the Committee shall \n     submit his or her testimony by way of electronic mail, in a \n     format determined by the Committee and sent to an electronic \n     mail address specified by the Committee, unless the Chairman \n     and Ranking Minority Member determine that there is good \n     cause for a witness's failure to do so. A witness shall be \n     allowed no more than five minutes to orally summarize his or \n     her prepared statement. Officials of the federal government \n     shall file 40 copies of such statement with the clerk of the \n     Committee 48 hours in advance of their appearance, unless the \n     Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member determine there is \n     good cause for noncompliance.\n       6. Counsel. A witness's counsel shall be permitted to be \n     present during his testimony at any public or closed hearing \n     or depositions or staff interview to advise such witness of \n     his or her rights, provided, however, that in the case of any \n     witness who is an officer or employee of the government, or \n     of a corporation or association, the Chairman may rule that \n     representation by counsel from the government, corporation, \n     or association creates a conflict of interest, and that the \n     witness shall be represented by personal counsel not from the \n     government, corporation, or association.\n       7. Transcript. An accurate electronic or stenographic \n     record shall be kept of the testimony of all witnesses in \n     closed sessions and public hearings. Any witness shall be \n     afforded, upon request, the right to review that portion of \n     such record, and for this purpose, a copy of a witness's \n     testimony in public or closed session shall be provided to \n     the witness. Upon inspecting his or her transcript, within a \n     time limit set by the committee clerk, a witness may request \n     changes in testimony to correct errors of transcription, \n     grammatical errors, and obvious\n\n[[Page S1003]]\n\n     errors of fact. The Chairman or a staff officer designated \n     by him shall rule on such request.\n       8. Impugned Persons. Any person who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a Member or staff, at a public \n     hearing or at a closed hearing concerning which there have \n     been public reports, tends to impugn his or her character or \n     adversely affect his or her reputation may:\n       (a) file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which shall be placed in the hearing \n     record; and\n       (b) request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     Committee to testify in his or her own behalf.\n       9. Minority Witnesses. Whenever any hearing is conducted by \n     the Committee, the Ranking Member shall be entitled to call \n     at least one witness to testify or produce documents with \n     respect to the measure or matter under consideration at the \n     hearing. Such request must be made before the completion of \n     the hearing or, if subpoenas are required to call the \n     minority witnesses, no later than three days before the \n     hearing.\n       10. Conduct of Witnesses, Counsel and Members of the \n     Audience. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, \n     his or her counsel, or any spectator conducts him or herself \n     in such a manner as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or \n     interfere with the orderly administration of such hearing the \n     Chairman or presiding Member of the Committee present during \n     such hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, \n     his representative or any law enforcement official to eject \n     said person from the hearing room.\n\n            III. Closed Sessions and Confidential Materials\n\n       1. Procedure. All meetings and hearings shall be open to \n     the public unless closed. To close a meeting or hearing or \n     portion thereof, a motion shall be made and seconded to go \n     into closed discussion of whether the meeting or hearing will \n     concern Committee investigations or matters enumerated in \n     Senate Rule XXVI(5)(b). Immediately after such discussion, \n     the meeting or hearing or portion thereof may be closed by a \n     vote in open session of a majority of the Members of the \n     Committee present.\n       2. Witness Request. Any witness called for a hearing may \n     submit a written or an electronic request to the Chairman no \n     later than twenty-four hours in advance for his or her \n     examination to be in closed or open session. The Chairman \n     shall inform the Committee of any such request.\n       3. Confidential Matter. No record made of a closed session, \n     or material declared confidential by a majority of the \n     Committee, or report of the proceedings of a closed session, \n     shall be made public, in whole or in part or by way of \n     summary, unless specifically authorized by the Chairman and \n     Ranking Minority Member.\n\n                            IV. Broadcasting\n\n       1. Control. Any meeting or hearing open to the public may \n     be covered by television, radio, or still photography. Such \n     coverage must be conducted in an orderly and unobtrusive \n     manner, and the Chairman may for good cause terminate such \n     coverage in whole or in part, or take such other action to \n     control it as the circumstances may warrant.\n       2. Request. A witness may request of the Chairman, on \n     grounds of distraction, harassment, personal safety, or \n     physical discomfort, that during his or her testimony \n     cameras, media microphones, and lights shall not be directed \n     at him or her.\n\n                         V. Quorums and Voting\n\n       1. Reporting. A majority shall constitute a quorum for \n     reporting a resolution, recommendation or report to the \n     Senate.\n       2. Committee Business. A third shall constitute a quorum \n     for the conduct of Committee business, other than a final \n     vote on reporting, providing a minority Member is present.\n       3. Hearings. One Member shall constitute a quorum for the \n     receipt of evidence, the swearing of witnesses, and the \n     taking of testimony at hearings.\n       4. Polling:\n       (a) Subjects. The Committee may poll (1) internal Committee \n     matters including those concerning the Committee's staff, \n     records, and budget; (2) Committee rules changes and (3) \n     other Committee business which has been designated for \n     polling at a meeting.\n       (b) Procedure. The Chairman shall circulate polling sheets \n     to each Member specifying the matter being polled and the \n     time limit for completion of the poll. If any Member so \n     requests in advance of the meeting, the matter shall be held \n     for meeting rather than being polled. The clerk shall keep a \n     record of polls. If the Chairman determines that the polled \n     matter is one of the areas enumerated in Rule III(1), the \n     record of the poll shall be confidential. Any Member may \n     request a Committee meeting following a poll for a vote on \n     the polled decision.\n\n                           VI. Investigations\n\n       1. Authorization for Investigations. All investigations \n     shall be conducted on a bipartisan basis by Committee staff. \n     Investigations may be initiated by the Committee staff upon \n     the approval of the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member. \n     Staff shall keep the Committee fully informed of the progress \n     of continuing investigations, except where the Chairman and \n     the Ranking Minority Member agree that there exists temporary \n     cause for more limited knowledge.\n       2. Subpoenas. The Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, \n     acting together, shall authorize a subpoena. Subpoenas for \n     the attendance of witnesses or the production of memoranda, \n     documents, records, or any other materials shall be issued by \n     the Chairman, or by any other Member of the Committee \n     designated by him. Prior to the issuance of each subpoena, \n     the Ranking Minority Member, and any other Member so \n     requesting, shall be notified regarding the identity of the \n     person to whom the subpoena will be issued and the nature of \n     the information sought, and its relationship to the \n     investigation.\n       3. Investigative Reports. All reports containing findings \n     or recommendations stemming from Committee investigations \n     shall be printed only with the approval of a majority of the \n     Members of the Committee.\n\n                    VII. Depositions and Commissions\n\n       1. Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an \n     investigation authorized by the Committee shall be authorized \n     and issued by the Chairman or by a staff officer designated \n     by him. Such notices shall specify a time and place for \n     examination, and the name of the staff officer or officers \n     who will take the deposition. Unless otherwise specified, the \n     deposition shall be in private. The Committee shall not \n     initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil enforcement \n     proceedings for a witness's failure to appear unless the \n     deposition notice was accompanied by a Committee subpoena.\n       2. Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by \n     counsel to advise them of their rights, subject to the \n     provisions of Rule II(6).\n       3. Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by an individual authorized by local law to \n     administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by \n     Committee staff. Objections by the witnesses as to the form \n     of questions shall be noted by the record. If a witness \n     objects to a question and refuses to testify on the basis of \n     relevance or privilege, the Committee staff may proceed with \n     the deposition, or may at that time or at a subsequent time, \n     seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from \n     a Member of the Committee. If the Member overrules the \n     objection, he or she may refer the matter to the Committee or \n     the Member may order and direct the witness to answer the \n     question, but the Committee shall not initiate the procedures \n     leading to civil or criminal enforcement unless the witness \n     refuses to testify after he or she has been ordered and \n     directed to answer by a Member of the Committee.\n       4. Filing. The Committee staff shall see that the testimony \n     is transcribed or electronically recorded.\n       5. Commissions. The Committee may authorize the staff, by \n     issuance of commissions, to fill in prepared subpoenas, \n     conduct field hearings, inspect locations, facilities, or \n     systems of records, or otherwise act on behalf of the \n     Committee. Commissions shall be accompanied by instructions \n     from the Committee regulating their use.\n\n                          VIII. Subcommittees\n\n       1. Establishment. The Committee will operate as a Committee \n     of the Whole, reserving to itself the right to establish \n     temporary subcommittees at any time by majority vote. The \n     Chairman of the full Committee and the Ranking Minority \n     Member shall be ex officio Members of all subcommittees.\n       2. Jurisdiction. Within its jurisdiction as described in \n     the Standing Rules of the Senate, each subcommittee is \n     authorized to conduct investigations, including use of \n     subpoenas, depositions, and commissions.\n       3. Rules. A subcommittee shall be governed by the Committee \n     rules, except that its quorum for all business shall be one-\n     third of the subcommittee Membership, and for hearings shall \n     be one Member.\n\n                              IX. Reports\n\n       Committee reports incorporating Committee findings and \n     recommendations shall be printed only with the prior approval \n     of a majority of the Committee, after an adequate period for \n     review and comment. The printing, as Committee documents, of \n     materials prepared by staff for informational purposes, or \n     the printing of materials not originating with the Committee \n     or staff, shall require prior consultation with the minority \n     staff; these publications shall have the following language \n     printed on the cover of the document: ``Note: This document \n     has been printed for informational purposes. It does not \n     represent either findings or recommendations formally adopted \n     by the Committee.''\n\n                         X. Amendment of Rules\n\n       The rules of the Committee may be amended or revised at any \n     time, provided that not less than a majority of the Committee \n     present so determine at a Committee meeting preceded by at \n     least 3 days notice of the amendments or revisions proposed \n     or via polling, subject to Rule V (4)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/28/senate-section/article/S1003-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1003-S1004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HOMELAND SECURITY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          SUBCOMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL AND CONTRACTING OVERSIGHT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. CARPER.

Madam President, Senate Standing rule XXVI requires each \ncommittee to adopt rules to govern the procedure of the committee and \nto publish those rules in the Record not later than March 1 of the \nfirst year of each Congress. On February 27, 2013, a majority of the \nmembers of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs' \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations adopted subcommittee rules of \nprocedure.\n  Consistent with Standing rule XXVI, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a copy of the rules of procedure of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR THE SENATE PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON \n  INVESTIGATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE HOMELAND SECURITY AND GOVERNMENTAL \n                                AFFAIRS\n\n       1. No public hearing connected with an investigation may be \n     held without the approval of either the Chairman and the \n     Ranking Minority Member or the approval of a Majority of the \n     Members of the Subcommittee. In all cases, notification to \n     all Members of the intent to hold hearings must be given at \n     least 7 days in advance to the date of the hearing. The \n     Ranking Minority Member should be kept fully apprised of \n     preliminary inquiries, investigations, and hearings. \n     Preliminary inquiries may be initiated by the Subcommittee \n     Majority staff upon the approval of the Chairman and notice \n     of such approval to the Ranking Minority Member or the \n     Minority counsel. Preliminary inquiries may be undertaken by \n     the Minority staff upon the approval of the Ranking Minority \n     Member and notice of such approval to the Chairman or Chief \n     Counsel. Investigations may be undertaken upon the approval \n     of the Chairman of the Subcommittee and the Ranking Minority \n     Member with notice of such approval to all Members.\n       No public hearing shall be held if the Minority Members \n     unanimously object, unless the full Committee on Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs by a majority vote approves \n     of such public hearing.\n       Senate Rules will govern all closed sessions convened by \n     the Subcommittee (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate).\n       2. Subpoenas for witnesses, as well as documents and \n     records, may be authorized and issued by the Chairman, or any \n     other Member of the Subcommittee designated by him or her, \n     with notice to the Ranking Minority Member. A written notice \n     of intent to issue a subpoena shall be provided to the \n     Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee, or \n     staff officers designated by them, by the Subcommittee \n     Chairman or a staff officer designated by him or her, \n     immediately upon such authorization, and no subpoena shall be \n     issued for at least 48 hours, excluding Saturdays and \n     Sundays, from delivery to the appropriate offices, unless the \n     Chairman and Ranking Minority Member waive the 48 hour \n     waiting period or unless the Subcommittee Chairman certifies \n     in writing to the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member that, \n     in his or her opinion, it is necessary to issue a subpoena \n     immediately.\n       3. The Chairman shall have the authority to call meetings \n     of the Subcommittee. This authority may be delegated by the \n     Chairman to any other Member of the Subcommittee when \n     necessary.\n       4. If at least three Members of the Subcommittee desire the \n     Chairman to call a special meeting, they may file in the \n     office of the Subcommittee, a written request therefor, \n     addressed to the Chairman. Immediately thereafter, the clerk \n     of the Subcommittee shall notify the Chairman of such \n     request. If, within 3 calendar days after the filing of such \n     request, the Chairman fails to call the requested special \n     meeting, which is to be held within 7 calendar days after the \n     filing of such request, a majority of the Subcommittee \n     Members may file in the office of the Subcommittee their \n     written notice that a special Subcommittee meeting will be \n     held, specifying the date and hour thereof, and the \n     Subcommittee shall meet on that date and hour. Immediately \n     upon the filing of such notice, the Subcommittee clerk shall \n     notify all Subcommittee Members that such special meeting \n     will be held and inform them of its date and hour. If the \n     Chairman is not present at any regular, additional or special \n     meeting, the Ranking Majority Member present shall preside.\n       5. For public or executive sessions, one Member of the \n     Subcommittee shall constitute a quorum for the administering \n     of oaths and the taking of testimony in any given case or \n     subject matter.\n       One-third of the Members of the Subcommittee shall \n     constitute a quorum for the transaction of Subcommittee \n     business other than the administering of oaths and the taking \n     of testimony, provided that one member of the minority is \n     present.\n       6. All witnesses at public or executive hearings who \n     testify to matters of fact shall be sworn.\n       7. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, his \n     or her counsel, or any spectator conducts himself or herself \n     in such a manner as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or \n     interfere with the orderly administration of such hearing, \n     the Chairman or presiding Member of the Subcommittee present \n     during such hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the \n     Senate, his or her representative or any law enforcement \n     official to eject said person from the hearing room.\n       8. Counsel retained by any witness and accompanying such \n     witness shall be permitted to be present during the testimony \n     of such witness at any public or executive hearing, and to \n     advise such witness while he or she is testifying, of his or \n     her legal rights; provided, however, that in the case of any \n     witness who is an officer or employee of the government, or \n     of a corporation or association, the Subcommittee Chairman \n     may rule that representation by counsel from the government, \n     corporation, or association, or by counsel representing other \n     witnesses, creates a conflict of interest, and that the \n     witness may only be represented during interrogation by staff \n     or during testimony before the Subcommittee by personal \n     counsel not from the government, corporation, or association, \n     or by personal counsel not representing other witnesses. This \n     rule shall not be construed to excuse a witness from \n     testifying in the event his or her counsel is ejected for \n     conducting himself or herself in such a manner so as to \n     prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere with the \n     orderly administration of the hearings; nor shall this rule \n     be construed as authorizing counsel to coach the witness or \n     answer for the witness. The failure of any witness to secure \n     counsel shall not excuse such witness from complying with a \n     subpoena or deposition notice.\n       9. Depositions.\n       9.1  Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an \n     investigation authorized by the Subcommittee shall be \n     authorized and issued by the Chairman. The Chairman of the \n     full Committee and the Ranking Minority Member of the \n     Subcommittee shall be kept fully apprised of the \n     authorization for the taking of depositions. Such notices \n     shall specify a time and place of examination, and the name \n     of the Subcommittee Member or Members or staff officer or \n     officers who will take the deposition. The deposition shall \n     be in private. The Subcommittee shall not initiate procedures \n     leading to criminal or civil enforcement proceedings for a \n     witness' failure to appear unless the deposition notice was \n     accompanied by a Subcommittee subpoena.\n       9.2  Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition \n     by counsel to advise them of their legal rights, subject to \n     the provisions of Rule 8.\n       9.3  Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by an individual authorized by local law to \n     administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by \n     Subcommittee Members or staff. Objections by the witness as \n     to the form of questions shall be noted for the record. If a \n     witness objects to a question and refuses to testify on the \n     basis of relevance or privilege, the Subcommittee Members or \n     staff may proceed with the deposition, or may, at that time \n     or at a subsequent time, seek a ruling by telephone or \n     otherwise on the objection from the Chairman or such \n     Subcommittee Member as designated by him or her. If the \n     Chairman or designated Member overrules the objection, he or \n     she may refer the matter\n\n[[Page S1006]]\n\n     to the Subcommittee or he or she may order and direct the \n     witness to answer the question, but the Subcommittee shall \n     not initiate procedures leading to civil or criminal \n     enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify after he or \n     she has been ordered and directed to answer by a Member of \n     the Subcommittee.\n       9.4  Filing. The Subcommittee staff shall see that the \n     testimony is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is \n     transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for \n     review pursuant to the provisions of Rule 12. The individual \n     administering the oath shall certify on the transcript that \n     the witness was duly sworn in his or her presence, the \n     transcriber shall certify that the transcript is a true \n     record of the testimony, and the transcript shall then be \n     filed with the Subcommittee clerk. Subcommittee staff may \n     stipulate with the witness to changes in this procedure; \n     deviations from this procedure which do not substantially \n     impair the reliability of the record shall not relieve the \n     witness from his or her obligation to testify truthfully.\n       10. Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Chief Counsel or Chairman of the \n     Subcommittee 48 hours in advance of the hearings at which the \n     statement is to be presented unless the Chairman and the \n     Ranking Minority Member waive this requirement. The \n     Subcommittee shall determine whether such statement may be \n     read or placed in the record of the hearing.\n       11. A witness may request, on grounds of distraction, \n     harassment, personal safety, or physical discomfort, that \n     during the testimony, television, motion picture, and other \n     cameras and lights, shall not be directed at him or her. Such \n     requests shall be ruled on by the Subcommittee Members \n     present at the hearing.\n       12. An accurate stenographic record shall be kept of the \n     testimony of all witnesses in executive and public hearings. \n     The record of his or her own testimony, whether in public or \n     executive session, shall be made available for inspection by \n     witness or his or her counsel under Subcommittee supervision; \n     a copy of any testimony given in public session or that part \n     of the testimony given by the witness in executive session \n     and subsequently quoted or made part of the record in a \n     public session shall be made available to any witness at his \n     or her expense if he or she so requests.\n       13. Interrogation of witnesses at Subcommittee hearings \n     shall be conducted on behalf of the Subcommittee by Members \n     and authorized Subcommittee staff personnel only.\n       14. Any person who is the subject of an investigation in \n     public hearings may submit to the Chairman of the \n     Subcommittee questions in writing for the cross-examination \n     of other witnesses called by the Subcommittee. With the \n     consent of a majority of the Members of the Subcommittee \n     present and voting, these questions, or paraphrased versions \n     of them, shall be put to the witness by the Chairman, by a \n     Member of the Subcommittee, or by counsel of the \n     Subcommittee.\n       15. Any person whose name is mentioned or who is \n     specifically identified, and who believes that testimony or \n     other evidence presented at a public hearing, or comment made \n     by a Subcommittee Member or counsel, tends to defame him or \n     her or otherwise adversely affect his or her reputation, may \n     (a) request to appear personally before the Subcommittee to \n     testify in his or her own behalf, or, in the alternative, (b) \n     file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the testimony or \n     other evidence or comment complained of. Such request and \n     such statement shall be submitted to the Subcommittee for its \n     consideration and action.\n       If a person requests to appear personally before the \n     Subcommittee pursuant to alternative (a) referred to herein, \n     said request shall be considered untimely if it is not \n     received by the Chairman of the Subcommittee or its counsel \n     in writing on or before thirty (30) days subsequent to the \n     day on which said person's name was mentioned or otherwise \n     specifically identified during a public hearing held before \n     the Subcommittee, unless the Chairman and the Ranking \n     Minority Member waive this requirement.\n       If a person requests the filing of his or her sworn \n     statement pursuant to alternative (b) referred to herein, the \n     Subcommittee may condition the filing of said sworn statement \n     upon said person agreeing to appear personally before the \n     Subcommittee and to testify concerning the matters contained \n     in his or her sworn statement, as well as any other matters \n     related to the subject of the investigation before the \n     Subcommittee.\n       16. All testimony taken in executive session shall be kept \n     secret and will not be released for public information \n     without the approval of a majority of the Subcommittee.\n       17. No Subcommittee report shall be released to the public \n     unless approved by a majority of the Subcommittee and after \n     no less than 10 days' notice and opportunity for comment by \n     the Members of the Subcommittee unless the need for such \n     notice and opportunity to comment has been waived in writing \n     by a majority of the Minority Members.\n       18. The Ranking Minority Member may select for appointment \n     to the Subcommittee staff a Chief Counsel for the Minority \n     and such other professional staff members and clerical \n     assistants as he or she deems advisable. The total \n     compensation allocated to such Minority staff members shall \n     be not less than one-third the total amount allocated for all \n     Subcommittee staff salaries during any given year. The \n     Minority staff members shall work under the direction and \n     supervision of the Ranking Minority Member. The Chief Counsel \n     for the Minority shall be kept fully informed as to \n     preliminary inquiries, investigations, and hearings, and \n     shall have access to all material in the files of the \n     Subcommittee.\n       19. When it is determined by the Chairman and Ranking \n     Minority Member, or by a majority of the Subcommittee, that \n     there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of law \n     may have occurred, the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member \n     by letter, or the Subcommittee by resolution, are authorized \n     to report such violation to the proper State, local and/or \n     Federal authorities. Such letter or report may recite the \n     basis for the determination of reasonable cause. This rule is \n     not authority for release of documents or testimony.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/28/senate-section/article/S1006-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1006-S1007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DOD APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise to discuss an amendment I have \nfiled to the bills dealing with sequestration. I am pleased that \nSenator King has joined me as a cosponsor.\n  Our amendment is the fiscal year 2013 Department of Defense \nappropriations bill that was approved by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee by a bipartisan vote of 30 to 0 on August 2, 2012.\n  There is no doubt we must find a way to avoid the meat-ax approach to \nbudgeting that will occur under sequestration.\n  At the same time, we must recognize that a continuing resolution also \npresents real challenges for those trying to carry out the necessary \nfunctions of the Federal Government, including providing for the \nnational defense. Continuing resolutions have become far too routine. \nThis familiarity, however, should not blind us from the harm these \nstop-gap measures cause to the effective and efficient functioning of \ngovernment.\n  A yearlong continuing resolution would be just as devastating as \nsequestration. I am not alone in that judgment. After a New York Times \neditorial that claimed the Pentagon can easily absorb the cuts of \nsequestration, Deputy Secretary of Defense Ash Carter wrote the \nfollowing in a letter published on February 27, 2013:\n\n       Good management is undermined by sequestration and by \n     something that your editorial does not mention but that is as \n     much of a problem--the fact that we have no new \n     appropriations bills and are living under last year's law. \n     These two factors together lead to dangerous absurdities like \n     having to curtail soldiers' training, ships' sailing, and \n     airplanes' flying. Our military will therefore not be fully \n     ready to meet contingencies other than Afghanistan.\n\n  Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and the service chiefs have also \nrepeatedly warned that the effects of sequestration or a yearlong \ncontinuing resolution will be devastating to our national security and \ndefense industrial base.\n  On January 14, 2013, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and \nthe heads of each military service signed a letter warning that ``the \nreadiness of our Armed Forces is at a tipping point'' and the unfolding \nbudget conditions, including the continuing resolution, are causing \nthis readiness crisis.\n  Regardless of what happens with sequestration, a continuing \nresolution presents two major problems.\n  First, the readiness of our military will be put at risk unless the \nDepartment of Defense is able to transfer funds from investment \naccounts into readiness accounts. Under the continuing resolution, the \nDepartment cannot do this. That is why the letter signed by seven four-\nstar generals said the current budget uncertainty will ``inevitably \nlead to a hollow force.''\n  Second, a yearlong continuing resolution prevents the Pentagon from \nperforming three responsibilities crucial for national security: \nincreasing production rates for existing weapons, starting new programs \nnot previously funded the year before, and signing multiyear \nprocurement contracts that provide significant savings while reducing \nthe unit cost for taxpayers.\n  There are several examples of these multiyear procurement contracts \nthat cannot move forward without an appropriations bill. For example, \nCongress authorized the Navy to procure 10 destroyers during the next 5 \nyears in the Fiscal Year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act. The \nNavy has the bids for these ships in hand and the Navy is\n\n[[Page S1007]]\n\nready to sign, but the Navy cannot sign these contracts without an \nappropriations bill. We risk throwing away savings on the order of \nhundreds of millions of dollars if we do not enact the fiscal year 2013 \nappropriations bill.\n  The ramifications of inaction on a full-year appropriations bill are \nnot limited to the 6 months remaining in this fiscal year. Failing to \nenact a full-year appropriations bill that allows new starts and cost-\nsaving multiyear procurement contracts will jeopardize the long-term \nstability in the shipbuilding industrial base that the Congress and the \nNavy have worked long and hard to preserve.\n  When I questioned Deputy Secretary Carter on February 14, 2013, at a \nSenate Appropriations Committee hearing about what the continuing \nresolution means for shipbuilding, he testified that ``we're in the \nabsurd position where we're five months into the fiscal year and we \nhave the authority to build the ships that we built last year and no \nauthority to build the ships that we plan to build this year. That's \ncrazy. . . And that has nothing to do with sequester, by the way, \nthat's the C.R.''\n  The existing continuing resolution expires on March 27. That deadline \nis just 4 weeks away, but each week that passes puts our military \nincreasingly at risk and makes it less prepared.\n  I know the chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and its \nranking member, Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby, share my concern \nthat continuing resolutions are not the way to govern. I am also \nencouraged about reports that the House of Representatives may consider \na bill next week which includes a full-year defense and a full-year \nveterans affairs and military construction budget.\n  At least as far back as 1974, Congress has never failed to pass a \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill. Now is not the time, with \ntroops in the field and the looming threat of sequestration, to \nestablish a dangerous precedent of denying our military services the \nsupport they need to accomplish the mission we have asked them to \nperform.\n  This year's continuing resolution hurts our military readiness now \nand, even more, in the future.\n  It is time to show the American people that we can act responsibly \nbefore the very last minute. The men and women who serve our country \nare performing every task we have asked of them. It is long overdue for \nthe Congress to do the same, so I urge the Senate to act to replace the \ncurrent CR with a full-year Department of Defense appropriations bill \nas our amendment would provide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/28/senate-section/article/S1007-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO RICHARD D. DeBOBES\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, today I honor an exceptional public \nservant and patriot. After a lifetime of service to our Nation, Richard \nD. ``Rick'' DeBobes is retiring from his position as staff director of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, effective February 28, 2013. On \nthis occasion, it is fitting to recognize Rick's 50 years of uniformed \nand civilian service to our Nation.\n  Rick began his career as a naval officer, serving 26 exemplary years \nin jobs that included directing the International Negotiations Branch \nof the Navy's Judge Advocate General, commanding the Naval Legal \nService Office, and finally serving as the legal adviser and \nlegislative assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nwhere he helped craft policies that have shaped our modern joint \nmilitary force. Such a career, in and of itself, illustrates a \ncommitment to causes greater than self-interest.\n  Rick's devotion to service and excellence continued long after he \nleft active duty. Upon his retirement from the Navy, he joined the \nSenate Armed Services Committee as counsel, advising committee members \non issues relating to national security strategy, defense policy, \nforeign affairs, and Department of Defense organization and management. \nRick's authoritative analysis and counsel to members distilled complex \nissues and often served as a basis for common understanding and problem \nsolving. Few were surprised then, when in 2003 he was asked by Senator \nCarl Levin to be the committee's staff director. Ten years on, the \nwisdom of that selection is evident. Rick's steady management of the \ncommittee, amidst strong personalities and throughout the occasionally \nanimated policy debates, has yielded the admiration of his professional \ncolleagues in Congress and the Department of Defense, and a long record \nof legislative success. Thoughtful leaders throughout government will \nfeel his absence.\n  I join many past and present members of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee in my gratitude to Rick DeBobes for his outstanding \nleadership in uniform and in Congress, and his unceasing support for \nmembers of the Armed Forces. I wish him and his wife Margaret ``fair \nwinds and following seas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/28/senate-section/article/S1007-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1007-S1008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF WAYNE LEONARD\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Wayne Leonard, who \nserved as Entergy's chief executive officer from 1999 and chairman/CEO \nfrom 2006 until January 2013. Over the course of those years, his \nvisionary leadership as Entergy's top executive also encompassed \nimpassioned advocacy for issues such as climate change, poverty and \nsocial justice. To a great extent, his compassion for people from all \nwalks of life and his desire to protect the environment for future \ngenerations came to define his tenure at Entergy.\n  When Leonard was named CEO in 1999, he began calling for action by \nbusiness, community, and political leaders to break the cycle of \npoverty that has stunted economic growth in the mid-South region for \ngenerations. Since that time, Entergy has donated more than $50 million \nto charitable initiatives and advocacy efforts that successfully helped \nmove low-income residents toward self-sufficiency. Among them were \ncampaigns to improve early childhood education programs and financial \nsupport of a matched-savings program that has helped 19,000 people and \ncreated an economic impact of $69 million over the last decade.\n  Leonard pioneered the pursuit of sustainability within his industry. \nEarly on, he recognized the importance to the industry's future of \noperating in an economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable \nmanner. His achievements include a number of landmarks that set the \nstandard and shaped the future for the energy industry. Under his \nleadership, in 2001 Entergy became the first utility in the United \nStates to commit to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions. At the \nsame time, work force safety, customer satisfaction, and strong \nregulatory relationships were always top priorities for Leonard. \nEntergy has delivered top-quartile shareholder return--the overarching \nfinancial goal Leonard set for the company--since he was announced as \nCEO in 1998.\n  After the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Leonard led the \nrestoration not just of a company but also a city and its surrounding \nregion. Entergy and its charitable foundation donated more than $20 \nmillion to nonprofits working to rebuild the physical, intellectual, \nand cultural assets of New Orleans. When Katrina's damages prompted \nEntergy to consider relocating its corporate headquarters, Leonard \nlobbied to keep Entergy in New Orleans and take a lead role in the \ncity's revitalization and renewal.\n  Leonard has personally received numerous national honors in \nrecognition of his outstanding leadership, including Platts Global \nEnergy CEO of the Year, the Anti-Defamation League Torch of Liberty \nAward, and the National Wildlife Federation Achievement Award. During \nhis tenure, Entergy was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for \n11 consecutive years for demonstrating strong financial performance and \noutstanding leadership in environmental and social commitment.\n  Leonard's passionate commitment to building a strong, sustainable \ncompany, community, and energy industry never wavered in 14 years. In \nhonor of his legacy, Entergy endowed a $5 million charitable fund upon \nhis retirement to continue his work on climate change, poverty, and \nsocial justice issues. The fund is being endowed through shareholder-\nfunded donations to the Entergy Charitable Foundation, with Leonard \nserving as an adviser.\n  While I will miss working with Wayne to improve both New Orleans and \nLouisiana, I applaud the work he has done to leave my city and my State \nstronger, healthier, and on the path to a brighter future.\n\n[[Page S1008]]\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I rise to honor and remember the full \nlife of Marlene ``Linny'' Fowler for her exceptional service to her \ncommunity, commonwealth and country.\n  Marlene was born in New York City, the oldest child of Harold and \nMiriam Oberkotter. Though she was raised in Harrington Park, NJ, \nMarlene spent her adult life living in Pennsylvania. Marlene, known \naffectionately as Linny, was a renowned philanthropist, artist and a \npillar of her adopted community. Today I wish to honor her as such.\n  As a philanthropist, her influence can been seen across Northeast \nPennsylvania, particularly in Bethlehem, the city she had called home \nsince 1965. Upon the passing of her father Harold, a late UPS chief \nexecutive, Marlene became one of the wealthiest individuals in the \nLehigh Valley. Choosing to eschew large homes or fancy cars, Marlene \ninstead gave generously to support the arts, education and children. \nShe helped to establish a childcare center and Hispanic Youth Center at \nNorthampton County Community College as well as the college's Southside \ncampus, which proudly bears her family name. Her generosity also helped \nsend hundreds of students to colleges and universities that they would \notherwise have been unable to afford to attend. Even with her health \nfailing, Marlene worked hard to maintain her involvement with the \ncommunity up until her passing. Although she kept the total of her \ngenerosity a secret, by her own admission she gave away tens of \nmillions of dollars over the course of her life.\n  As an artist, Marlene was trained in the art of stained glass, which \nshe taught throughout her life. She also maintained a studio at the \nBanana Factory in Bethlehem, an institution she helped fund. As a \npillar of her community, Marlene made sure her philanthropic efforts \nalways had a human touch. She met with needy families and non-profit \ndirectors in the living room of her own home, investing herself as much \nas her money. Even as recent economic difficulties forced her to scale \nback some of her giving, she still continued to keep track of all the \nyouth she helped send to school.\n  As Marlene's family and friends mourn her loss, I pray that they will \nbe comforted by the knowledge that this great Nation will never forget \nthe generosity of Marlene ``Linny'' Fowler. May she rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/28/senate-section/article/S1008-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             STEM EDUCATION\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the \ngreat work that afterschool and summer learning programs in California \nand across the country are doing to engage children and youth in \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics, STEM, education.\n  Afterschool and summer programs are a vital part of our country's \neducation tapestry. They provide engaging, hands-on learning \nexperiences that stimulate student interest, develop crucial skills, \nand drive home the relevance of STEM to our daily lives. Out-of-school \nlearning opportunities help children develop the academic and life \nskills, such as problem-solving and determination, which are crucial in \nSTEM fields. Additionally, these programs provide key opportunities for \nmentors and role models to engage with children.\n  High-quality afterschool STEM learning programs are having a \nsignificant impact on the young people who participate in them. A \nrecent study shows participants in afterschool and summer programs have \nimproved attitudes toward STEM fields and careers, increased STEM \ncapacities and skills, and a higher likelihood of graduating from high \nschool and pursuing a STEM major in college.\n  One of these exemplary programs is the Woodcraft Rangers Program in \nLos Angeles, CA. Woodcraft Rangers exposes middle school students to \ncutting-edge STEM activities, including robotics. This highly engaging \nprogram allows students to configure high-tech robotics, enhancing \ntheir STEM skills, unlocking their imaginations, and exposing them to \nreal-world problem-solving situations. Afterschool and summer programs \nare uniquely positioned to deliver valuable enrichment activities like \nrobotics that help children gain valuable creativity, critical \nthinking, and team-building skills.\n  In addition to programs that serve children and youth directly, \norganizations such as the Afterschool Alliance are working to advance \npolicies, research, and partnerships so that all children can access \nrich STEM education experiences through out-of-school programs.\n  Private companies are also embarking on efforts, such as Time Warner \nCable's Connect a Million Minds, CAMM, initiative, to promote youth \ninterest and performance in STEM fields during out-of-school time. \nBusinesses like Time Warner Cable know that investing in STEM education \nnow helps ensure a robust workforce in the future, and they know that \nafterschool, summer, and other out-of-school programs are key venues \nfor students to develop the problem-solving, team-building, and \ncreative thinking skills necessary for a strong STEM workforce.\n  I applaud the afterschool and summer learning programs, advocacy \norganizations, and community partnerships across the country that are \nworking to advance our students' STEM achievement and our country's \nfuture through enriching out-of-school learning. To support the work of \nthese organizations, I hope that the Senate can come together to \nreauthorize the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program--the \nonly Federal program dedicated to supporting afterschool and summer \nlearning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/28/senate-section/article/S1008-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1008-S1009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JIM SYMINGTON\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I ask the Senate to join me \ntoday in honoring the work of Jim Symington, a friend and dedicated \npublic servant who is retiring this year. In the summer of 1974 I came \nto Washington as an intern for Congressman Jim Symington. That \nexperience, and the lessons I learned from this great leader were \ninstrumental in my success as a political candidate and public \nofficial.\n  As a member of a family steeped in public service, and as the son of \nthe great United States Senator Stuart Symington, Jim did not hesitate \nto take up the mantle of serving his country. Jim started his career \nserving others when he enlisted in the Marine Corps as a high school \ngraduate. Following his military service, Jim earned his Bachelor's \ndegree from Yale University and his law degree from Columbia Law \nSchool.\n  Jim served for 2 years following law school as the assistant city \ncounselor for St. Louis before going into private practice. In 1958, \nJim entered the Foreign Service where he served as assistant to the \nUnited States ambassador for the United Kingdom. Upon his return to \nWashington, DC Jim served our Government in various positions including \nadministrative assistant to Attorney General Robert Kennedy and the \nChief of Protocol for the Department of State.\n  In 1968 Jim was elected to represent St. Louis, Missouri's 2nd \nCongressional District, where he served four terms. During his time in \nCongress, Jim served on the House Commerce Committee and the Committee \non Science and Technology. He also served as the chair of the \nSubcommittees on Space Science and Applications; Science, Research & \nTechnology; and International Cooperation. He was an active voice on \nspace exploration during a time when space exploration was a central \ntopic. Upon leaving Congress in 1977, Jim returned to private law \npractice, and has had a distinguished legal career at Nossaman LLP/\nO'Connor & Hannan here in Washington, DC.\n  However Jim Symington has never been an ordinary practicing lawyer. \nHe and his wife Sylvia have been friends, mentors, and highly respected \nmembers of a small group of true leaders in our America's Capitol for \nmany years. They are always in high demand as dinner partners or \nleaders of a civic endeavor. Together, their wit, intelligence, and \nmusical prowess has constantly reminded the most powerful in our Nation \nthat there is always more to learn and it is very dangerous to take \nyourself too seriously.\n  It is my honor to call Jim a mentor and friend. Like no other man I \nknow, I also realize that the number of people who count on his \nfriendship would be a record for a town where Harry Truman famously \nnoted that if you wanted a friend you should turn to a canine. I am \nthankful for his friendship, advice and service to Missouri and this \ngreat\n\n[[Page S1009]]\n\ncountry. While these comments mark his retirement from the practice of \nlaw, I'm confident that he will continue to be a bright light of \nintellect, humor, and friendship for many years to come in our Nation's \nCapital.\n  I ask that the Senate join me in honoring Jim Symington on this \noccasion of his retirement from the practice of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/28/senate-section/article/S1009-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ALASKA LEGISLATURE CENTENNIAL\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I rise today to mark a \nsignificant event in Alaska's history as we commemorate the 100th \nanniversary of the convening of the Alaska State Legislature.\n  Compared to the States that my colleagues represent, Alaska is a \nrelatively young State, so it is remarkable that our legislature has \nexisted for only 100 years. However, creating our State's legislative \nbody was not an easy process. Secretary of State William H. Seward \nacquired Alaska from Russia for $7,200,000 on March 30, 1867. The First \nOrganic Act of 1884 established the District of Alaska and provided us \nwith a Governor and judicial branch but no legislative body to be the \npeople's voice. It was not until after several petitions by Alaskans of \nall backgrounds that Congress passed the Second Organic Act giving \nAlaska territorial status and a legislative body. Our first elections \nwere held November 12, 1912. They produced the first of many civil \nservants who would have the honor to serve in the Alaska Legislature. \nWe did not yet have a capitol building, so eight senators and 16 \nrepresentatives convened at the Elk's Lodge in Juneau, AK. That year, \nthe first territorial legislature passed 83 laws--laws that began \nbuilding our State and uniting us as Alaskans.\n  While Alaska may have been just a territory and seen by many as a \nvast wilderness separated from the rest of the country, our territorial \nlegislature led the Nation in passing the first law in the Nation \ngiving women the right to vote. This was 1913. The 19th amendment \nwouldn't be ratified for another 7 long years. The great Nell Scott was \nthe first woman to serve in the first territorial legislature, way \nbefore other daughters of this country would. The territorial \nlegislature also led the nation in the civil rights movement as it \npassed an antidiscrimination bill providing for full and equal \nenjoyment of public accommodations for all Alaskans. It is noteworthy \nthat before statehood, Alaska's Legislature acted in response to the \npassionate advocacy of Roy and Elizabeth Peratrovich long before \nCongress would on Dr. Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks' advocacy. \nBefore a territorial referendum in 1946 that began the legal quest for \nstatehood, the Alaska Legislature had been advocating admission as \nearly as 1913.\n  This past January, the 28th Session of the Alaska State Legislature \nconvened, consisting of 20 senators and 40 representatives. Under house \nspeaker Mike Chenault, and senate president Charlie Huggins, they \ncontinue to provide representation to an estimated 731,449 residents of \nAlaska. The Alaska Legislature has worked for the past 100 years to \ngive Alaskans the opportunity to enjoy life, liberty, and the pursuit \nof happiness, and they will continue to do so for the many years to \ncome. I extend my congratulations and heartfelt appreciation to the \nsenators and representatives as well as all support staff to our \nlegislature on this special anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/28/senate-section/article/S1009-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:18 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 47.

A bill to amend the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act \nto include the Corps of Engineers as a Federal land management agency, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today Senator Merkley and I are \nintroducing the Corps of Engineers Recreation Improvement Act. This \nlegislation enables the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reinvest \nrecreation fees to improve facilities where the funds are collected. \nOur bill creates an incentive for the Corps to maintain good facilities \nand provide quality recreational opportunities on our public lands. The \nCorps currently collects recreation fees at many sites. This \nlegislation would not change the way the Corps determines use fee \nrates. Existing law provides that users of specialized sites, \nfacilities, equipment, or services provided by Federal expense shall be \nassessed fair and equitable fees. Section 210 of the Flood Control Act \nof 1968 also provides that no entrance fees shall be charged by the \nCorps. Our bill is not intended to and does not make any changes in \nthat regard.\n  In Arkansas, recreation on our public Corps-operated lands is an \nimportant driver of economic activity, job opportunities, and tourism. \nIn fiscal year 2012, over $4.2 million in revenue was collected at \nCorps recreation sites in Arkansas. When citizens spend money at Corps \nrecreation sites in Arkansas, Oregon, or other States, many of them \nexpect that their money will be invested on-site to improve facilities \nand create recreation opportunities. Our bill would ensure those \nexpectations are met.\n  The Corps of Engineers Recreation Improvement Act would also enable \nthe Corps to participate in the interagency America the Beautiful Pass \nprogram to allow customers an alternative payment option at sites where \nentrance or amenity fees are charged. This includes the distribution \nand sale of the passes and the retention of a portion of the revenue \nfor the sales of those passes. It would also allow the Corps to \ndistribute Military Passes. This will make it easier for our men and \nwomen in uniform and their families to acquire passes. The Corps \ncurrently honors these passes but the Corps is not allowed to \ndistribute the passes. Providing the ability for the Corps to offer \npasses to customers is a commonsense solution that will encourage \ncontinued use of Federal recreation sites.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 402. A bill to provide for the addition of certain real property \nto the reservation of the Siletz Tribe in the State of Oregon; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill that will \naddress a cumbersome and time consuming process in place under existing \nlaw within the Bureau of Indian Affairs. This piece of legislation will \nstreamline the land acquisition process for the Confederated Tribes of \nSiletz Indians. The current process for taking land into trust is \nsimply not working, and I believe there are changes that need to be \nmade in the existing process. I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nMerkley in this effort. I want to note that I introduced similar \nlegislation last Congress that was stalled at the Committee level due \nto certain language in that bill--language that, at the time, we \nthought was needed but found later was unnecessary and was preventing \nthe bill from moving forward. In the bill I am introducing today, I \ntook that language out to resolve the needs of the various stakeholders \nand to ensure the bill has a chance to pass the Committee and be signed \ninto law.\n  The original Siletz Coastal Treaty Reservation, established by the \nExecutive Order on November 9, 1855, was diminished and then eliminated \nby the Federal Government's allotment and termination policies. Tribal \nmembers and the tribal government have worked to rebuild the Siletz \ncommunity since the Western Oregon Termination Act of August 1954 \nstripped the Siletz people of Federal tribal recognition. Since then \nthe tribe has been struggling to rebuild its land base. This \nlegislation would work to facilitate the tribe's land into trust \nprocess within the original Siletz coast reservation to overcome \nchronic agency delays in processing applications. Instead of having two \ncumbersome processes to bring each piece of former reservation land \nback into the reservation after purchase, one to bring the land into \ntrust and another to make it reservation land, my legislation would \nallow the tribe to combine the process.\n  In this case, because the original reservation was disassembled, and \nthe tribe terminated and provided a very small land base upon \nrestoration, virtually every tract of land the tribe seeks to place \ninto trust today is considered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs,\n\n[[Page S1014]]\n\nBIA, pursuant to off-reservation fee-to-trust procedures. Off-\nreservation requests would mean that, according the regulations, the \n``. . . secretary gives greater scrutiny to the tribe's justification \nof anticipated benefits. . .''\n  By applying the on-reservation fee-to-trust criteria for lands within \nthe Siletz Tribe's original reservation, this legislation allows the \nTribe to take land into trust that will ultimately provide for vital \ntribal programs such as housing, government administration, and jobs--\nfor both tribal and county residents. In addition, the bill emphasizes \nthe importance and the intent of the Indian Reorganization Act of \n1934--which allows the Secretary of Interior, in his or her discretion, \nto take land into trust for the benefit of an Indian tribe or of \nindividual Indians. Essentially, reversing the loss of tribal lands and \nrestoring some of the tribe's original land base by allowing the Tribe \nto take land into trust under the same provisions as other Indian \ntribes within their reservations.\n  This bill underscores the importance of economic stability and self-\ndetermination for the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians and its \nmembers. Due to failed Termination Era policies, Oregon Tribal \ncommunities suffer some of the greatest hurdles, whether it is health \ncare, education, or crime on reservations. This bill would alleviate \nmuch of the cost and much needed resources associated with the \nbureaucratic hoops the tribe has had to jump through for years--which \nmean a significant savings of time and resources.\n  The Siletz Tribe has approached all the involved counties and has \ndeveloped great communication and working relationships with them. This \nlegislation establishes and confirms a positive and beneficial \npartnership between the Federal Government, Siletz Tribe and local \ncounties Lincoln, Lane, Tillamook, Yamhill, Benton, and Douglas.\n  That is why I am introducing this legislation. The process remains \ncumbersome and costly and I recognize the need for more action. It is \nalways great to see tribes and local counties work together to come up \nwith proactive solutions for their communities to tackle challenging \neconomic conditions.\n  I want to express my thanks to all the citizens and community and \ntribal leaders who have worked to build their communities. They \nrepresent the pioneering spirit and vision that defines my state.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 402\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN PROPERTY OF THE SILETZ TRIBE \n                   OF THE STATE OF OREGON.\n\n       Section 7 of the Siletz Tribe Indian Restoration Act (25 \n     U.S.C. 711e) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(f) Treatment of Certain Property.--\n       ``(1) In general.--\n       ``(A) Title.--The Secretary may accept title to any \n     additional number of acres of real property located within \n     the boundaries of the original 1855 Siletz Coast Reservation \n     established by Executive Order dated November 9, 1855, \n     comprised of land within the political boundaries of Benton, \n     Douglas, Lane, Lincoln, Tillamook, and Yamhill Counties in \n     the State of Oregon, if that real property is conveyed or \n     otherwise transferred to the United States by or on behalf of \n     the tribe.\n       ``(B) Trust.--Land to which title is accepted by the \n     Secretary under this paragraph shall be held in trust by the \n     United States for the benefit of the tribe.\n       ``(2) Treatment as part of reservation.--All real property \n     that is taken into trust under paragraph (1) shall--\n       ``(A) be considered and evaluated as an on-reservation \n     acquisition under part 151.10 of title 25, Code of Federal \n     Regulations (or successor regulations); and\n       ``(B) become part of the reservation of the tribe.\n       ``(3) Prohibition on gaming.--Any real property taken into \n     trust under paragraph (1) shall not be eligible, or used, for \n     any gaming activity carried out under the Indian Gaming \n     Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Cornyn, \n        Mr. Durbin, Ms. Klobuchar, and Mr. Blumenthal):\n  S. 405. A bill to provide for media coverage of Federal court \nproceedings; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Sunshine in \nthe Courtroom Act, a bipartisan bill which permits judges at all \nfederal court levels to open their courtrooms to television cameras and \nradio broadcasts.\n  Openness in our courts improves the public's understanding of what \nhappens inside our courts. Our judicial system remains a mystery to too \nmany people across the country. That doesn't need to continue. Letting \nthe sun shine in on federal courtrooms will give Americans an \nopportunity to better understand the judicial process. Courts are the \nbedrock of the American justice system. I believe that granting the \npublic greater access to an already public proceeding will inspire \ngreater faith in and appreciation for our judges who pledge equal and \nimpartial justice for all.\n  For decades, States such as my home state of Iowa have allowed \ncameras in their courtrooms with great results. As a matter of fact, \nonly the District of Columbia prohibits trial and appellate court \ncoverage entirely. Nineteen states allow news coverage in most courts; \nsixteen allow coverage with slight restrictions; and the remaining \nfifteen allow coverage with stricter rules.\n  The bill I am introducing today, along with Senator Schumer and five \nother cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, including Judiciary \nChairman Leahy, will greatly improve public access to federal courts by \nletting federal judges open their courtrooms to television cameras and \nother forms of electronic media.\n  The Sunshine in the Courtroom Act is full of provisions that ensure \nthat the introduction of cameras and other broadcasting devices into \ncourtrooms goes as smoothly as it has at the state level. First, the \npresence of the cameras in Federal trial and appellate courts is at the \nsole discretion of the judges, it is not mandatory. The bill also \nprovides a mechanism for Congress to study the effects of this \nlegislation on our judiciary before making this change permanent \nthrough a three-year sunset provision. The bill protects the privacy \nand safety of non-party witnesses by giving them the right to have \ntheir faces and voices obscured. The bill prohibits the televising of \njurors. Finally, it includes a provision to protect the due process \nrights of each party.\n  We need to open the doors and let the light shine in on the Federal \nJudiciary. This bill improves public access to and therefore \nunderstanding of our Federal courts.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \ndeliver a meaningful benefit and lower prescription drug prices under \nthe Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week TIME Magazine published an \nextensive piece that took a close look at the hidden costs within our \nhealth care system and how the Medicare program, which is widely \ndisparaged these days, is effective in controlling costs.\n  We as a nation will spend $2.8 trillion this year on health care. \nThat is on average 27 percent more than what is spent per capita in \nother developed countries.\n  According to the TIME article, many hospitals routinely overcharge \npatients and reap profits at the expense of American families. As one \nformer hospital billing officer put it, ``hospitals all know the bills \nare fiction.''\n  Too many families are put on the path to financial ruin because of \nhospital bills.\n  Another thing the TIME piece highlighted was that Medicare is much \nmore effective at controlling costs than private sector providers, \nwhether non-profit or for-profit.\n  Because Medicare sets the prices it is willing to pay providers in \nadvance, patients with Medicare coverage are charged substantially less \nthan patients with private health insurance who have received the same \nservices.\n  In fact, projected Medicare spending over the 2011-2020 period is \nmore than $500 billion lower since late 2010 than CBO projected.\n  But we can do more. Every day, 10,000 Americans turn 65 and become \neligible for Medicare. In 11 years, Medicare's hospital insurance fund \nwill start paying out more in benefits than it takes in.\n  Meaningful reforms that lead to better health care at lower costs are \ngood for America's seniors--and for our entire health care system. And \nthat should start with changes to Part D.\n  Today, I am introducing with Senators Whitehouse and Jack Reed the \nMedicare Prescription Drug Savings and Choice Act.\n  Our bill would save taxpayer dollars by giving Medicare beneficiaries \nthe choice to participate in a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan \nrun by Medicare, not private insurance companies.\n  Seniors want the ability to choose a Medicare-administered drug plan, \nso let's give them this option.\n  In 2010, Americans spent approximately $260 billion on prescription \ndrugs. That figure is projected to double over the next decade. \nHowever, patients in the United States spend 50 percent more than other \ndeveloped countries for the same drugs.\n  The average monthly price of cancer drugs has doubled over the past \n10 years, from about $5,000 to more than $10,000.\n  Of the 12 new cancer drugs approved by the FDA last year, 11 were \npriced above $100,000 a year.\n  About 77 percent of all cancers are diagnosed in persons 55 years of \nage and older.\n  As these people enter the program, Medicare should be allowed to \ncontrol how much it pays for these prescription drugs.\n  While the Affordable Care Act does a lot to control costs in the \nprivate insurance market, current law handcuffs Medicare beneficiaries \nfrom obtaining competitive prices for their prescription drugs.\n  For all other Medicare programs, beneficiaries can choose whether to \nreceive benefits directly through Medicare or through a private \ninsurance plan.\n  The overwhelming majority of seniors choose the Medicare-run option \nfor their hospital and physician coverage.\n  Our bill requires the Secretary of HHS to develop at least one \nnationwide prescription drug plan.\n  Why? Because we should take advantage of the Federal Government's \npurchasing power.\n  The Veterans Administration uses this type of negotiating authority \nand has cut drug prices by as much as 50 percent for our Nation's \nveterans.\n\n[[Page S1016]]\n\n  Savings from negotiating on behalf of seniors in Medicare could be \nused to further reduce costs in the program and ensure the program is \nthere for future generations.\n  America's health care system is burdening families and hindering our \nability to invest in the future.\n  The Affordable Care Act takes important steps to begin bringing down \ncosts in the private market and in Medicare, but there is more we can \ndo. This proposal is a simple and common sense option that should be \navailable for seniors.\n  Allowing Medicare to manage a prescription drug plan and negotiate \nprices, taxpayers will save money and seniors will get high quality \ndrug coverage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 408\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

ESTABLISHMENT OF MEDICARE OPERATED PRESCRIPTION DRUG \n                   PLAN OPTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subpart 2 of part D of title XVIII of the \n     Social Security Act is amended by inserting after section \n     1860D-11 (42 U.S.C. 1395w-111) the following new section:\n\n\n           ``medicare operated prescription drug plan option\n\n       ``Sec. 1860D-11A.

To the extent practicable and \n     consistent with the previous sentence, the Secretary shall \n     implement strategies similar to those used by other Federal \n     purchasers of prescription drugs, and other strategies, \n     including the use of a formulary and formulary incentives in \n     subsection (e), to reduce the purchase cost of covered part D \n     drugs.\n       ``(c) Medicare Operated Prescription Drug Plan Defined.--\n     For purposes of this part, the term `Medicare operated \n     prescription drug plan' means a prescription drug plan that \n     offers qualified prescription drug coverage and access to \n     negotiated prices described in section 1860D-2(a)(1)(A). Such \n     a plan may offer supplemental prescription drug coverage in \n     the same manner as other qualified prescription drug coverage \n     offered by other prescription drug plans.\n       ``(d) Monthly Beneficiary Premium.--\n       ``(1) Qualified prescription drug coverage.--The monthly \n     beneficiary premium for qualified prescription drug coverage \n     and access to negotiated prices described in section 1860D-\n     2(a)(1)(A) to be charged under a Medicare operated \n     prescription drug plan shall be uniform nationally. Such \n     premium for months in 2014 and each succeeding year shall be \n     based on the average monthly per capita actuarial cost of \n     offering the Medicare operated prescription drug plan for the \n     year involved, including administrative expenses.\n       ``(2) Supplemental prescription drug coverage.--Insofar as \n     a Medicare operated prescription drug plan offers \n     supplemental prescription drug coverage, the Secretary may \n     adjust the amount of the premium charged under paragraph (1).\n       ``(e) Use of a Formulary and Formulary Incentives.--\n       ``(1) In general.--With respect to the operation of a \n     Medicare operated prescription drug plan, the Secretary shall \n     establish and apply a formulary (and may include formulary \n     incentives described in paragraph (2)(C)(ii)) in accordance \n     with this subsection in order to--\n       ``(A) increase patient safety;\n       ``(B) increase appropriate use and reduce inappropriate use \n     of drugs; and\n       ``(C) reward value.\n       ``(2) Development of initial formulary.--\n       ``(A) In general.--In selecting covered part D drugs for \n     inclusion in a formulary, the Secretary shall consider \n     clinical benefit and price.\n       ``(B) Role of ahrq.--The Director of the Agency for \n     Healthcare Research and Quality shall be responsible for \n     assessing the clinical benefit of covered part D drugs and \n     making recommendations to the Secretary regarding which drugs \n     should be included in the formulary.

We \n     wish to be clear: We strongly oppose such an approach and \n     believe it to be both unnecessary and a no-growth policy for \n     an economy that remains stagnant.\n       Medicare and Medicaid not only provide critical protections \n     against the economic deprivation caused by illness, \n     especially for older Americans; they also create jobs and \n     boost an economy that is slumbering. Cutting these programs \n     leads this country in the wrong direction.\n       We cannot continue to unravel these critical programs for \n     working families, the elderly, and the poor. If the Congress \n     is unable to move forward without some compromise that \n     reduces our national commitment to quality Medicare and \n     Medicaid programs, there is a source for reductions that will \n     not harm beneficiaries: the cost of prescription drugs.\n       The U.S. pays more for prescriptions than any nation in the \n     world. Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries pay more for \n     medicines than do our veterans and the clients of the \n     National Indian Health Service. Why do these differences in \n     cost persist? They do so because other countries, the VA, and \n     the IHS negotiate the prices for prescriptions, while \n     Medicare and Medicaid programs do not.\n       According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, \n     savings to the federal government over the next decade would \n     be as high as $541.3 billion. The saving to the states would \n     be as high as $72.7 billion, and beneficiaries would save \n     $112.4 billion. These amounts are far in excess of the demand \n     for expenditure reductions being suggested by the most \n     strident deficit reduction advocates.\n       We are more than 275 national and state organizations, and \n     we are opposed to cutting health care benefits for the \n     elderly and the poor. However, saving money by negotiating \n     drug prices would be beneficial to the entire health care \n     system, in addition to saving money for the federal \n     government and the states. We urge you to pursue this policy \n     as a major part of efforts to reduce health care costs.\n           Sincerely,\n\n\n                                National\n\n       9to5, AFL-CIO, AFSCME (American Federation of State, County \n     and Municipal Employees), Alliance for a Just Society, \n     Alliance for Retired Americans, Association of Asian Pacific \n     Community Health Organizations, Campaign for America's \n     Future, Campaign for Community Change, Center for Popular \n     Democracy, Coalition on Human Needs, Community Action \n     Partnership, Community Organizations in Action, Grassroots \n     Policy Project, HCAN (Health Care for America Now!), \n     Institute for Policy Studies, Break the Chain Campaign, Jobs \n     With Justice, Leadership Center for Common Good, National \n     Domestic Workers Alliance, National Education Association.\n       National Legislative Association on Prescription Drug \n     Prices--20 signers (see attached letter): Rep.

In addition, your \n     legislation would require the federal government to use its \n     purchasing power to negotiate lower prices on prescription \n     drugs for beneficiaries who enroll in the Medicare-\n     administered plan. The Department of Veterans Affairs and \n     many state governments are able to deliver lower drug prices \n     because of price negotiation, and we believe that the federal \n     government should be able to receive the best price available \n     for Medicare prescription drugs. Finally, we appreciate that \n     your legislation establishes an advisory committee to assess \n     a public formulary and streamlines the Medicare Part D \n     appeals process, which will help all beneficiaries.\n       Thank you for your continued leadership on Medicare, \n     particularly for identifying ways to reduce Medicare spending \n     without shifting costs to beneficiaries. We look forward to \n     working with you to enact this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Max Richtman,\n                                                President and CEO.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. \n        Moran):\n  S. 411. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nand modify the railroad track maintenance credit; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am joining my colleagues \nSenators, Crapo, Wyden, and Moran in introducing the Short Line \nRailroad Rehabilitation and Investment Act of 2013, legislation to \nextend for 3 years the Section 45G short line freight railroad tax \ncredit.\n  In the 112th Congress, I introduced a 6-year extension of this \ncredit. Despite the often contentious atmosphere of the 112th Congress, \nduring which my colleagues found little they could agree on, the short \nline rail credit was a bipartisan success story, with my legislation \nattracting more than 50 bipartisan cosponsors.\n  ``Short line'' railroads are small freight rail companies responsible \nfor bringing goods to communities that are not directly served by \nlarge, trans-continental railroads. Supporting small railroads allows \nthe communities surrounding them to attract and maintain businesses and \ncreate jobs. The evidence of the success of this credit can be found in \ncommunities across America.\n  This credit has real impact for the people of my state. West Virginia \nis the second biggest producer of railroad ties in the country. Since \nthe credit was enacted, it is estimated 750,000 railroad ties have been \npurchased above what would have otherwise been purchased with no \nincentive. Those railroad ties translate directly into jobs. This \ncredit does not create just West Virginia jobs though. The ties, \nspikes, and rail this credit helps fund are almost entirely American \nmade.\n  Over 12,000 rail customers across America depend on short lines. This \ncredit creates a strong incentive for short lines to invest private \nsector dollars on private-sector freight railroad track rehabilitation \nand improvements. Unfortunately, it is now scheduled to expire at the \nend of 2013.\n  We were unable to enact a full 6-year extension of this important tax \ncredit last Congress, but I was pleased that this credit was extended \nthrough the end of 2013 as part of the December 31st fiscal cliff deal.\n  This Congress I want to do more. This credit, and the short line \nrailroads that serve all of our constituents, deserve a meaningful \nextension. If this credit is allowed to expire at the end of the year, \nprivate-sector investments in infrastructure in our communities will \nfall by hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  This bill would extend the 45G credit through 2016, providing the \nimportant long-term planning certainty necessary to maximize private-\nsector transportation infrastructure investment. Over 50 members of \nthis body sponsored legislation in the last Congress extending this \ncredit and I hope there will be similar support again this year. I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Portman, and Ms. \n        Klobuchar):\n  S. 413. A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \nAct of 1968 to include human trafficking as a part 1 violent crime for \npurposes of the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n                                 S. 413\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Human Trafficking Reporting \n     Act of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Human trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery.\n       (2) According to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of \n     2000 ``severe forms of trafficking in persons'' means--\n       (A) sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is \n     induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person \n     induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age; \n     or\n       (B) the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, \n     or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the \n     use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of \n     subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, \n     or slavery.\n       (3) There is an acute need for better data collection of \n     incidents of human trafficking across the United States in \n     order to effectively combat severe forms of trafficking in \n     persons.\n       (4) The State Department's 2012 Trafficking in Persons \n     report found that--\n       (A) the United States is a ``source, transit and \n     destination country for men, women, and children, subjected \n     to forced labor, debt bondage, domestic servitude and sex \n     trafficking,''; and\n       (B) the United States needs to ``improve data collection on \n     human trafficking cases at the federal, state and local \n     levels''.\n       (5) The International Organization for Migration has \n     reported that in order to effectively combat human \n     trafficking there must be reliable and standardized data, \n     however, the following barriers for data collection exist:\n       (A) The illicit and underground nature of human \n     trafficking.\n       (B) The reluctance of victims to share information with \n     authorities.\n       (C) Insufficient human trafficking data collection and \n     research efforts by governments world-wide.\n       (6) A 2009 report to the Department of Health and Human \n     Services entitled Human Trafficking Into and Within the \n     United States: A Review of the Literature found that ``the \n     data and methodologies for estimating the prevalence of human \n     trafficking globally and nationally are not well developed, \n     and therefore estimates have varied widely and changed \n     significantly over time''.\n       (7) The Federal Bureau of Investigation compiles national \n     crime statistics through the Uniform Crime Reporting Program.\n       (8) Under current law, State and local governments \n     receiving Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance grants are \n     required to share data on part 1 violent crimes with the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation for inclusion in the Uniform \n     Crime Reporting Program.\n       (9) The addition of severe forms of trafficking in persons \n     to the definition of part 1 violent crimes will ensure that \n     statistics on this heinous crime will be compiled and \n     available through the Federal Bureau of Investigation's \n     Uniform Crime Report.\n\n     SEC. 3. HUMAN TRAFFICKING TO BE INCLUDED IN PART 1 VIOLENT \n                   CRIMES FOR PURPOSES OF BYRNE GRANTS.\n\n       Section 505 of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \n     Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3755) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(i) Part 1 Violent Crimes To Include Human Trafficking.--\n     For purposes of this section, the term `part 1 violent \n     crimes' shall include severe forms of trafficking in persons, \n     as defined in section 103(8) of the Trafficking Victims \n     Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7102(8)).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Cochran, Mrs. Gillibrand, and \n        Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 415. A bill to clarify the collateral requirement for certain \nloans under section 7(d) of the Small Business Act, to address \nassistance to out-of-State small business concerns, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on an \nissue that is of great importance to my home State of Louisiana: \nFederal disaster assistance. As you know, along the Gulf Coast, we keep \nan eye trained on the Gulf of Mexico during hurricane season. This is \nfollowing the devastating one-two punch of Hurricanes\n\n[[Page S1020]]\n\nKatrina and Rita of 2005 as well as Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008. \nUnfortunately, our region also has had to deal with the economic and \nenvironmental damage from the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 and \nmore recently Hurricane Isaac. For this reason, as Chair of the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship ensuring Federal \ndisaster programs are effective and responsive to disaster victims is \none of my top priorities. While the Gulf Coast is prone to hurricanes, \nother parts of the country are no strangers to disaster. For example, \nthe Midwest has tornadoes, California experiences earthquakes and \nwildfires, and the Northeast sees crippling snowstorms. So no part of \nour country is spared from disasters--disasters which can and will \nstrike at any moment. This certainly hit home when the northeast was \nstruck by Hurricane Sandy in October of last year. With this in mind, \nwe must ensure that the Federal government is better prepared and has \nthe tools necessary to respond quickly, effectively following a \ndisaster.\n  In order to give the U.S. Small Business Administration, SBA, better \ntools to respond after a future disaster, I am proud that to file the \nSmall Business Disaster Reform Act of 2013. I want to thank my \ncolleague Senator Thad Cochran for cosponsoring the bill and for \nhelping me to make improvements. I am also appreciative that Senator \nKirsten Gillibrand and Senator Mark Pryor also have cosponsored the \nlegislation. This bill will make two important improvements to SBA's \ndisaster assistance programs for businesses. The first provision builds \noff of SBA disaster reforms enacted in 2008 and ensures that SBA is \nresponsive to the needs of small businesses seeking smaller amounts of \ndisaster assistance. These are the businesses that are burdened the \nmost by liens on their primary personal residential homes when they \ncould conceivably provide sufficient business assets as collateral for \nthe loan. The second provision in the bill also authorizes the SBA \nAdministrator to allow out-of-state Small Business Development Centers, \nSBDCs, to provide assistance in to small businesses located in \nPresidentially-declared disaster areas. This provision removes a \nlimitation that, for disasters such as Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane \nSandy, would allow experienced SBDC counselors to come in to a disaster \narea while local SBDCs are being stood back up following a catastrophic \ndisaster. Lastly, to ensure that out-of-state SBDCs are not left paying \nout of pocket for assisting in these disaster areas, there also is \nlegislative language in Section 4 encouraging the SBA to ensure it \nreimburses SBDCs for these disaster-related expenses provided they were \nlegitimate and there are funds available to do so.\n  In particular, Section 2 of the bill that I am filing today would \nclarify that, for SBA disaster business loans less than $200,000 that \nSBA is required to utilize assets other than the primary residence if \nthose assets are available to use as collateral towards the loan. The \nbill is very clear though that these assets should be of equal or \ngreater value than the amount of the loan. Also, to ensure that this is \na targeted improvement, the bill also includes additional language that \nthis bill in no way requires SBA to reduce the amount or quality of \ncollateral it seeks on these types of loans. I want to especially thank \nmy former Ranking Member Olympia Snowe for working with me to improve \nupon previous legislation on this particular issue. The provision that \nI am re-introducing, as part of this disaster legislation, is a direct \nresult of discussions with both her and other stakeholders late last \nyear. I believe that this bill is better because of improvements that \ncame out of these productive discussions.\n  I note that this provision is similar to Section 204 of S. 2731, the \nSmall Business Administration Disaster Recovery and Reform Act of 2009 \nthat Senator Bill Nelson and I introduced during the 111th Congress. A \nsimilar provision also passed the House of Representatives twice that \nCongress. H.R. 3854, which included a modified collateral requirement \nunder Section 801, passed the House on October 29, 2009 by a vote of \n389-32. The provision also passed the House again on November 6, 2009 \nby a voice vote as Section 2 of H.R. 3743. During the 112th Congress, \nthis provision passed the Senate on December 28, 2012 by a vote of 62-\n32 as part of H.R. 1, the Senate-passed Disaster Relief Appropriations \nAct. However, it was not included in H.R. 152, the House-passed \nDisaster Relief Appropriations Act that subsequently was enacted into \nlaw. Despite the setback earlier this year, I remind my colleagues that \nthis provision has a history of bipartisan Congressional support and \nhas previously passed both chambers of Congress.\n  Section 2 addresses a key issue that is serving as a roadblock to \nbusiness owners interested in applying for smaller SBA disaster loans. \nAfter the multiple disasters that hit the Gulf Coast, my staff has \nconsistently heard from business owners, discouraged from applying for \nSBA disaster loans. When we have inquired further on the main reasons \nbehind this hesitation, the top concern related to SBA requiring \nbusiness owners to put up their personal home as collateral for smaller \nSBA disaster loans for their business. This requirement is \nunderstandable for large loans between $750,000 and $2 million. \nHowever, business owners complained about this requirement being \ninstituted for loans of $200,000 or less. I can understand their \nfrustration. Business owners, in many cases who have just lost \neverything, are applying to SBA for a $150,000 loan for their business. \nSBA then responds by asking them to put up their $400,000 personal home \nas collateral when the business may have sufficient business assets \navailable to collateralize the loan. While I also understand the need \nfor SBA to secure the loans, make the program cost effective, and \nminimize risk to the taxpayer, SBA has at its disposal multiple ways to \nsecure loans.\n  Furthermore, SBA has repeatedly said publicly and in testimony before \nmy committee that it will not decline a borrower for a lack of \ncollateral. According to a July 14, 2010 correspondence between SBA and \nmy office, the agency notes that ``SBA is an aggressive lender and its \ncredit thresholds are well below traditional bank standards . . . SBA \ndoes not decline loans for insufficient collateral.'' SBA's current \npractice of making loans is based upon an individual/business \ndemonstrating the ability to repay and income. The agency declines \nborrowers for an inability to repay the loan. In regards to collateral, \nSBA follows traditional lending practices that seek the ``best \navailable collateral.'' Collateral is required for physical loans over \n$14,000 and Economic Injury Disaster Loans, EIDL, loans over $5,000. \nSBA takes real estate as collateral when it is available, but as I \nstated, the agency will not decline a loan for lack of collateral. \nInstead it requires borrowers to pledge what is available. However, in \npractice, SBA is requiring borrowers to put up a personal residence \nworth $300,000 or $400,000 for a business loan of $200,000 or less when \nthere are other assets available for SBA.\n  This provision does not substantively change SBA's current lending \npractices and it will not have a significant cost. I believe that this \nlegislation would not trigger direct spending nor would it have a \nsignificant impact on the subsidy rate for SBA disaster loans. \nCurrently for every $1 loaned out, it costs approximately 10 cents on \nthe dollar. Most importantly, this bill will greatly improve the SBA \ndisaster loan programs for businesses ahead of future disasters. If a \nbusiness comes to the SBA for a loan of less than $200,000 to make \nimmediate repairs or secure working capital, they can be assured that \nthey will not have to put up their personal home if SBA determines that \nthe business has other assets to go towards the loan. However, if \nbusinesses seek larger loans than $200,000 or if their business assets \nare not suitable collateral, then the current requirements will still \napply. This ensures that very small businesses and businesses seeking \nsmaller amounts of recovery loans are able to secure these loans \nwithout significant burdens on their personal property. For the \nbusiness owners we have spoken to, this provides some badly needed \nclarity to one of the Federal government's primary tools for responding \nto disasters.\n  To be clear though, while I do not want to see SBA tie up too much of \na business' collateral, I also believe that if a business is willing \nand able to put up business assets towards its disaster loan, SBA \nshould consider that first before attempting to bring in personal\n\n[[Page S1021]]\n\nresidences. It is unreasonable for SBA to ask business owners operating \nin very different business environments post-disaster to jeopardize not \njust their business but also their home. Loans of $200,000 or less are \nalso the loans most likely to be repaid by the business so personal \nhomes should be collateral of last resort in instances where a business \ncan demonstrate the ability to repay the loan and that it has other \nassets.\n  As previously mentioned, there are also safeguards in the provision \nthat ensures that this provision will not reduce the quality of \ncollateral required by SBA for these disaster loans nor will it reduce \nthe quality of the SBA's general collateral requirements. These changes \nwill assist the SBA in cutting down on waste, fraud and abuse of these \nlegislative reforms. In order to further assist the SBA, I believe it \nis important to clarify what types of business assets we understand \nthey should review. For example, I understand that SBA's current \nlending practices consider the following business assets as suitable \ncollateral: commercial real estate; machinery and equipment; business \ninventory; and furniture and fixtures.\n  Section 3 of this bill removes an unnecessary prohibition in the \nSmall Business Act that currently prohibits SBDCs from other states to \nhelp out in areas impacted by disasters. In particular, this provision \nauthorizes the SBA Administrator to allow out-of-state SBDCs to provide \nassistance in to small businesses located in Presidentially-declared \ndisaster areas. This is because, as you may know, SBDCs are considered \nto be the backbone of the SBA's Office of Entrepreneurial Development \nefforts, and are the largest of the agency's OED programs. SBDCs are \nthe university based resource partners that provide counseling and \ntraining needs for more than 600,000 business clients annually. From \n2007 to 2008, the counseling and technical assistance services they \noffered lead to the creation of 58,501 new jobs, at a cost of $3,462 \nper job. Additionally, they estimate that their counseling services \nhelped to save 88,889 jobs. These centers are even more critical \nfollowing natural or manmade disasters. That is because SBDCs help \nimpacted businesses in navigating Federal disaster programs, insurance \nprograms, and in creating new business plans following a disaster. For \nthat reason, we must ensure that there is continuity to have SBDC \ncounselors on the ground in disaster areas.\n  For example, right after Hurricane Katrina our SBDCs in Louisiana \nwere severely limited in what they could do because of the widespread \ndamage to homes and facilities utilized by their counselors. On the \nother hand, their counterparts at the Florida SBDCs had a wealth of \ndisaster expertise and were willing to assist but were prohibited from \nproviding assistance to small businesses outside their geographic area. \nIn 2012, we experienced similar challenges following Hurricane Sandy \nbut SBDCs in Louisiana, Florida or elsewhere were prohibited from \nhelping their counterparts in the Northeast even if they wanted to help \nrecovery in New York or New Jersey and doing so would not impact their \noperations back home. For smaller scale disasters, local SBDCs will \nrespond to disasters in their own areas. However, for large scale, \ncatastrophic disasters, this provision could make a significant \ndifference for impacted small businesses.\n  In fact, on December 13, 2012, my committee received excellent \ntestimony from Jim King, Chair of the Association of Small Business \nDevelopment Centers, ASBDCs, and State Director of New York State Small \nBusiness Development Center. Mr. King outlined the symbiotic \nrelationship between different SBDC state chapters and how they \ncurrently assist each other after disasters. He specifically noted \nthat, ``I was also privileged to have the opportunity to work with the \nSBDC in Louisiana following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and visited New \nOrleans as one of five State Directors invited to share thoughts with \nmy counterpart there, Mary Lynn Wilkerson, to evolve a strategy for \nrecovery. I should note that Mary Lynn has returned the favor many \ntimes over since Hurricane Sandy devastated our area, with materials, \ninformation and support, which has been greatly appreciated.'' He also \nlater noted that ``Starting almost immediately after the disaster, \nstaff in other states and programs began reaching out with offers of \nassistance and words or experiences of support . . . The experiences \ngained from disasters in Florida, Texas, Colorado, Louisiana and many \nother places reinforce the value of the SBDC network in meeting the \nneeds of small business in times of disaster.'' I believe that these \ncurrent relationships will be further strengthened by enacting this \nlegislation. C.E. ``Tee'' Rowe, President/CEO of ASBDC noted this in \nhis February 10, 2013 letter to my office, noting that, ``Allowing \nSBDCs to share resources across state lines or other boundaries for the \npurposes of disaster recovery is a common sense proposal, little \ndifferent from utilities sharing linemen.'' At the same time, however, \nI encourage SBDC chapters across the country to establish more of these \npartnerships pre-disaster so that their SBDC counterparts can be there \npost-disaster. SBDC chapters that are, unfortunately, battle hardened \nfrom multiple disasters should not be the only chapters that bear fruit \nfrom these partnerships with their counterparts.\n  Furthermore, I note that Section 3 of the bill has previously been \npassed out of committee and has been approved by the full Senate during \npast sessions of Congress. So this provision has a strong record of \nbipartisan support. During the 110th Congress, this provision was \napproved unanimously by the Small Business and Entrepreneurship \nCommittee on May 7, 2007 as Section 104 of S. 163, the ``Small Business \nDisaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2007.'' S. 163 was \nsubsequently passed by the full Senate by unanimous consent on August \n3, 2007. Unfortunately, this provision was not enacted into law before \nthe adjournment of the 110th Congress. In the 111th Congress, this \nprovision was again approved unanimously by the Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee on July 2, 2009 as Section 607 of S. 1229, \nthe ``Entrepreneurial Development Act of 2009'' but was not enacted \ninto law before the adjournment of that Congress. Lastly, during the \n112th Congress, the provision received 57 strong bipartisan votes on \nJuly 12, 2012 as Section 433 of Senate Amendment 2521 to S. 2237, the \n``Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act of 2012.'' My Republican \ncolleagues Senators Snowe, Collins, Vitter, Scott Brown, and Heller all \nvoted in support of the amendment. Although it was not ultimately \nenacted into law, the provision was subsequently included in separate \npieces of legislation introduced by Senator Olympia Snowe and myself. \nThis provision was included as Section 433 of S. 3442, the ``SUCCESS \nAct of 2012'' that I introduced on July 25, 2012 as well as Section 433 \nof S. 3572, the ``Restoring Tax and Regulatory Certainty to Small \nBusiness Act of 2012'' that Senator Snowe introduced on September 9, \n2012.\n  Lastly, Section 4 is a new provision that I worked with my colleague \nSenator Cochran to include in the legislation. This section addresses \npast instances where SBDCs were not sufficiently reimbursed post-\ndisaster by the SBA for disaster-related expenses. Section 3 provides \nclear Congressional intent that, in authorizing the SBA to allow out-\nof-state SBDCs to assist in disaster areas outside their geographic \nlocation, the agency must also ensure that out-of-state SBDCs are not \nleft paying out of pocket for assisting in these disaster areas. If the \nSBA approves for these SBDCs to deploy staff or resources to a disaster \narea, the agency must in turn ensure that it reimburses SBDCs for these \nexpenses provided they were legitimate and there are funds available to \ndo so. I thank Senator Cochran for bringing this to my attention on \nbehalf of his local SBDCs, and look forward to working closely with him \nto enact this provision into law.\n  In closing, I believe that these commonsense disaster reforms will \ngreatly benefit businesses impacted by future disasters. First, the \nmajor proposals in this legislation are neither new nor untested. Next, \nthis approach has already received support from the following groups \nfrom across the country: the Association of Small Business Development \nCenters, the International Economic Development Council, the Southwest \nLouisiana Economic Development Alliance, the St. Tammany Economic \nDevelopment Foundation, the Northeast Louisiana Economic\n\n[[Page S1022]]\n\nPartnership, and the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership. With that \nin mind, the Senate should not make the perfect the enemy of the good. \nIf we can make these reforms today and help one business impacted by a \ndisaster tomorrow, we will have done what our constituents sent us here \nto do: make good laws.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 415\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Disaster \n     Reform Act of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       Section 7(d)(6) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \n     636(d)(6)) is amended by inserting after ``which are made \n     under paragraph (1) of subsection (b)'' the following: ``: \n     Provided further, That the Administrator, in obtaining the \n     best available collateral for a loan of not more than \n     $200,000 under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (b) \n     relating to damage to or destruction of the property of, or \n     economic injury to, a small business concern, shall not \n     require the owner of the small business concern to use the \n     primary residence of the owner as collateral if the \n     Administrator determines that the owner has other assets with \n     a value equal to or greater than the amount of the loan that \n     could be used as collateral for the loan: Provided further, \n     That nothing in the preceding proviso may be construed to \n     reduce the amount of collateral required by the Administrator \n     in connection with a loan described in the preceding proviso \n     or to modify the standards used to evaluate the quality \n     (rather than the type) of such collateral''.\n\n     SEC. 3. ASSISTANCE TO OUT-OF-STATE SMALL BUSINESSES.\n\n       Section 21(b)(3) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \n     648(b)(3)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``(3) At the discretion'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(3) Assistance to out-of-state small businesses.--\n       ``(A) In general.--At the discretion''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) Disaster recovery assistance.--\n       ``(i) In general.--At the discretion of the Administrator, \n     the Administrator may authorize a small business development \n     center to provide assistance, as described in subsection (c), \n     to a small business concern located outside of the State, \n     without regard to geographic proximity, if the small business \n     concern is located in an area for which the President has \n     declared a major disaster under section 401 of the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 5170), during the period of the declaration.\n       ``(ii) Continuity of services.--A small business \n     development center that provides counselors to an area \n     described in clause (i) shall, to the maximum extent \n     practicable, ensure continuity of services in any State in \n     which the small business development center otherwise \n     provides services.\n       ``(iii) Access to disaster recovery facilities.--For \n     purposes of this subparagraph, the Administrator shall, to \n     the maximum extent practicable, permit the personnel of a \n     small business development center to use any site or facility \n     designated by the Administrator for use to provide disaster \n     recovery assistance.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that, subject to the \n     availability of funds, the Administrator of the Small \n     Business Administration shall, to the extent practicable, \n     ensure that a small business development center is \n     appropriately reimbursed for any legitimate expenses incurred \n     in carrying out activities under section 21(b)(3)(B) of the \n     Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 648(b)(3)(B)), as added by this \n     Act.\n                                     Association of Small Business\n\n\n                                          Development Centers,\n\n                                     Burke, VA, February 10, 2013.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Chair, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: Thank you for giving the Association \n     of Small Business Development Centers (ASBDC) the opportunity \n     to comment on your proposed legislative amendments to the \n     disaster assistance provisions in the Small Business Act (15 \n     USC 631 et seq.).\n       While Congress has taken a significant step in addressing \n     the resource issues following Sandy and other disasters there \n     are still restrictions in the SBDC assistance authority and \n     the US Small Business Administration's loan making authority \n     that could complicate future disaster recovery efforts. We \n     applaud your efforts to deal with those issues.\n       Under section 21(b)(3) of the Small Business Act (15 USC \n     648(b)(3)) SBDCs are limited in their ability to provide \n     services across state lines. This prevents SBDCs dealing with \n     disaster recovery, like New York and New Jersey, from being \n     able to draw upon the resources available in our nationwide \n     network of nearly 1,000 centers with over 4,500 business \n     advisors. It likewise prevents states with great experience \n     in disaster recovery assistance like Louisiana and Florida, \n     from providing assistance to their colleagues.\n       Your proposed legislation amends that SBDC geographic \n     service restriction for the purposes of providing disaster \n     support and assistance. Our Association wholeheartedly \n     endorses that change. Allowing SBDCs to share resources \n     across state lines or other boundaries for the purpose of \n     disaster recovery is a common sense proposal, little \n     different from utilities sharing linemen. In addition, we \n     would like to note that this provision has been supported by \n     the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship \n     twice in previous Congresses.\n       In addition, the ASBDC wishes to express its support for \n     your proposals to amend the collateral requirements in the \n     disaster loan program for loans under $200,000. SBDCs \n     routinely assist small business owners with their \n     applications for disaster loan assistance and have often \n     faced clients with qualms about some of those requirements.\n       We share a common goal of putting small business on the \n     road to recovery after disaster strikes and getting capital \n     flowing is a key factor in meeting that goal. To that end, \n     ASBDC supports your efforts to ease collateral requirements \n     and help improve the flow of disaster funds to small business \n     applicants. We believe your proposal to limit the use of \n     personal homes as collateral on smaller loans is consistent \n     with the need to get capital flowing to affected businesses \n     and ease the stress on these businesses. We also agree that \n     this change will not undermine the underwriting standards of \n     the disaster loan program.\n       Thank you again for kind attention and continuing support \n     of small business.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                C.E. ``Tee'' Rowe,\n     President/CEO, ASBDC.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            International Economic\n\n\n                                          Development Council,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 13, 2013.\n     Hon. Mary L. Landrieu,\n     Chair, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, U.S. \n         Senate.\n     Hon. James E. Risch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu and Senator Risch: On behalf of the \n     International Economic Development Council (IEDC), please \n     accept our appreciation for this opportunity to provide \n     comments related to proposed changes to federal disaster \n     assistance programs offered by the United States Small \n     Business Administration (SBA). Your continuing support of \n     these critical programs is worthy of praise and we thank you \n     for your leadership.\n       IEDC has a strong history of supporting disaster planning \n     and recovery. Our organization, with a membership of over \n     4,000 dedicated professionals, responded to communities in \n     need following the 2005 hurricane season, the BP Gulf oil \n     spill and other disaster-related incidents by providing \n     economic development recovery assistance. We have continued \n     our work in this area through technical assistance projects \n     and partnerships with federal agencies and other non-\n     governmental organizations. Our profession is invested in \n     helping our country prepare for and respond to disasters, \n     much the same as you and your colleagues on the Committee on \n     Small Business and Entrepreneurship. To this end, we support \n     proposed changes that will allow SBA to more effectively \n     deliver disaster recovery assistance to local businesses in \n     need of federal aid.\n       Rebuilding the local economy must be a top priority \n     following a disaster, second only to saving lives and homes. \n     IEDC supports the targeted changing of the current collateral \n     requirements that state a business owner must place their \n     home up as collateral in order to secure an SBA disaster \n     business loan of $200,000 or less. In times of crisis, \n     affected business owners are understandably reluctant to \n     place their personal homes up as collateral in order to \n     obtain a much needed loan to rebuild their business. \n     Consequently, SBA loans put in place to help businesses \n     rebuild following a disaster go underutilized. As lawmakers, \n     you have a responsibility to protect the taxpayer, which is \n     why we understand the need for posting collateral of equal or \n     greater value to the amount of the loan. The proposed \n     targeted change that eliminates the specific requirement of \n     using a home as collateral to guarantee a loan of $200,000 or \n     less, and instead allowing business assets to act as \n     collateral, will promote greater utilization of the loans. \n     This is an idea we can all get behind; one that will lead to \n     greater, faster economic recovery.\n       When disaster strikes, we should do everything in our power \n     to bring the full resources of the federal government to bear \n     in the impacted community. This includes, most especially, \n     bringing in top experts who can immediately begin helping \n     businesses and local economies recover. The national network \n     of over 1,100 Small Business Development Centers (SBDC) could \n     be an excellent resource to stricken communities. \n     Unfortunately, current rules prevent SBDC's from assisting \n     their counterparts in other jurisdictions. For example, those \n     communities in the mid-Atlantic and New England impacted by \n     Sandy are not able to benefit from the enormous\n\n[[Page S1023]]\n\n     amount of knowledge and experience in storm recovery held by \n     SBDCs in Florida and the Gulf region. Certainly, we can all \n     agree that disasters warrant an extraordinary response and \n     that response must include qualified expertise from all \n     corners of the federal government.\n       Forty to sixty percent of small businesses that close as a \n     result of a disaster do not reopen. This is an unacceptably \n     high number. We would not accept that level of loss in homes \n     and we cannot accept that level of loss in jobs; our \n     communities cannot sustain such losses and duty dictates we \n     make certain they don't have to. By enacting common sense \n     legislation, like that which is under consideration here, and \n     freeing the flow of capital and expertise, we are taking \n     concrete steps to give our small businesses and local \n     economies the greatest chance to recover.\n       IEDC is your partner in the work of job creation. We thank \n     you for your leadership in support of small business and \n     stand ready to offer our assistance in this and future \n     efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul L. Krutko,\n       Chairman, International Economic Development Council and \n     President and CEO, Ann Arbor SPARK.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                       St. Tammany\n\n\n                              Economic Development Foundation,\n\n                                Mandeville, LA, February 19, 2013.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Chair, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: The St. Tammany Economic Development \n     Foundation thanks you for the opportunity to comment on the \n     proposed amendments to the disaster assistance provisions in \n     the Small Business Act (15 US 631 et seq.). As we learned \n     from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and most recently Isaac, the \n     sooner our small businesses are able to recover, the better \n     it is for the region, the state and the nation.\n       We fully endorse the proposed amendment to Section 1 of the \n     bill regarding collateral on business disaster loans. If \n     approved, no longer would small business owners have to use \n     their primary personal residence for collateral towards SBA \n     disaster business loans less than $200,000 if other assets \n     are available of equal or greater value than the amount of \n     the loan. In times of crisis, affected business owners are \n     understandably reluctant to place their personal homes up as \n     collateral in order to obtain a much needed loan to rebuild \n     their business. Allowing business assets to act as collateral \n     will promote greater utilization of the loans; leading to \n     faster economic recovery.\n       Under Section 2 of the bill, Small Business Development \n     Centers (SBDCs) are limited in their ability to provide \n     services across state lines. This prevents SBDCs in affected \n     areas from being able to draw upon the resources available \n     from their colleagues nationwide. Louisiana SBDCs have great \n     experience in disaster recovery assistance and should not be \n     prevented from providing assistance to their colleagues \n     outside of Louisiana in the event of disaster. Therefore, we \n     fully support this provision.\n       We applaud your efforts to protect small businesses in the \n     wake of disasters and thank you for continuing to be a strong \n     advocate on their behalf. After all, small businesses are the \n     lifeblood of our great nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Brenda Bertus,\n                                   Executive Director, St. Tammany\n     Economic Development Foundation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   North Louisiana\n\n\n                                         economic partnership,\n\n                                                February 26, 2013.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Chair, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu, The North Louisiana Economic \n     Partnership thanks you for the opportunity to comment on the \n     proposed changes to the disaster assistance programs offered \n     by the United States Small Business Administration. The \n     proposed amendments to the Small Business Act (15 USC 631 et \n     seq.) will greatly enhance federal assistance to small \n     businesses recovering from disasters. NLEP applauds your \n     efforts to support our small businesses which make up the \n     backbone of the American economy.\n       As a regional economic development organization promoting \n     North Louisiana, NLEP often works with businesses impacted by \n     natural or manmade disasters. The impact of these disasters \n     can temporarily or permanently shut down small businesses, \n     leaving both small business owners and their employees \n     without a livelihood. The SBA disaster programs offer a real \n     lifeline to these impacted businesses which have very few \n     options available to them. The proposed amendment to Section \n     1 of the bill regarding collateral for business disaster \n     loans would allow more small businesses to utilize the \n     disaster loan programs. If approved, small business owners \n     would no longer have to use their primary residence as \n     collateral toward a SBA disaster business loan of less than \n     $200,000, if other assets are available. During a widespread \n     disaster, the primary residence of business owners may also \n     be impacted and requiring them to use their home as \n     collateral would create an onerous burden and/or be \n     financially unfeasible. Eliminating this collateral \n     requirement opens up assistance to those businesses most \n     impacted by disaster, speeding recovery for businesses and a \n     region's economy.\n       The second proposed change to Section 2 of the Small \n     Business Act would allow Small Business Development Centers \n     (SBDCs) to provide technical assistance to impacted small \n     businesses beyond the current 250 mile limitation. The \n     Louisiana Small Business Development Centers (LSBDCs) have \n     successfully worked with countless small businesses \n     devastated by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav and Ike, and \n     most recently the BP oil spill. The experience and expertise \n     that the LSBDC could have shared with the SBDCs in the New \n     York and New Jersey area would have enhanced their \n     capabilities to cope with Superstorm Sandy. In times of \n     disaster, it is essential to collaborate and pool resources \n     in order to speed up delivery of much needed assistance.\n       For these reasons, the North Louisiana Economic Partnership \n     fully endorses the proposed amendments to the current SBA \n     legislation that would open up, enhance and efficiently \n     deliver disaster assistance to small businesses.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Scott Martinez\n\n                                        President, North Louisiana\n     Economic Partnership.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Bay Area Houston,\n\n\n                                         Economic Partnership,\n\n                                   Houston, TX, February 13, 2013.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Chair, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: The Texas economy has outperformed \n     the rest of the country not only over the long term but also \n     during the recent recession. Our pro-business climate has \n     been a huge contributing factor to that, and so have Texas' \n     small businesses. From 2002-2009, small businesses of fewer \n     than 10 employees fueled the Texas employment engine, adding \n     nearly 800,000 new jobs. When disaster strikes the Gulf \n     Coast, as it did with Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav, and \n     Ike, our small businesses are hit hard. The sooner they are \n     able to recover the better it is for the region, the state, \n     and the nation.\n       This is why I am writing to support your proposed \n     legislative amendments to the disaster assistance provisions \n     in the Small Business Act (15 USC 631 et seq). Section 1 of \n     the bill addresses collateral on business disaster loans. If \n     approved, no longer would small business owners have to use \n     their primary personal residence for collateral towards SBA \n     disaster business loans less than $200,000 if other assets \n     are available of equal or greater value than the amount of \n     the loan. This would certainly help to reduce anxiety on the \n     part of small business owners and their families who have \n     already experienced enough stress through damage to or total \n     destruction of their businesses.\n       Section 2 of the bill includes the provision that \n     authorizes the Small Business Administration to allow out-of-\n     state small business development centers to provide \n     assistance in presidentially-declared disaster areas, which \n     is currently not allowed. When Hurricane Ike devastated our \n     region in September 2008, we welcomed any and all kinds of \n     disaster relief. The northeast just experienced a similar \n     disaster with Hurricane Sandy. Utility crews from across the \n     nation responded quickly to each. State lines should never be \n     used to prevent aid from reaching disaster victims. The \n     majority of the membership of our organization is comprised \n     of small businesses. On their behalf, we fully endorse this \n     provision.\n       Thank you for working to keep America's small businesses \n     strong and helping them to recover from major storms that we \n     know will strike again.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Bob Mitchell,\n\n                                       President, Bay Area Houston\n     Economic Partnership.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     SWLA Economic\n\n\n                                         Development Alliance,\n\n                              Lake Charles, LA, February 25, 2013.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Chair, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu, The Southwest Louisiana Economic \n     Development Alliance welcomes the opportunity to comment on \n     the proposed amendments to the disaster assistance provisions \n     in the Small Business Act (15 US 631 et seq.).

Louisiana SBDCs have great \n     experience in\n\n[[Page S1024]]\n\n     disaster recovery assistance and should not be prevented from \n     providing assistance to their colleagues outside of Louisiana \n     in the event of disaster. Therefore, we fully support this \n     provision.\n       About 85% of the members of the Chamber SWLA are small \n     businesses.

A bill to require the Federal Trade Commission to prescribe \nregulations regarding the collection and use of personal information \nobtained by tracking the online activity of an individual, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Do-Not-Track \nOnline Act of 2013. This bill is a critical step towards furthering \nconsumer privacy. It empowers Americans to control their personal \ninformation online and provides them with the ability to prevent online \ncompanies from collecting and using that information for profit.\n  Do-not-track is a simple concept. It allows consumers, with a simple \nclick of the mouse, to tell every company that participates in the vast \nonline ecosystem, ``Do not collect information about me. I care about \nmy privacy. My personal information is not for sale. And I do not want \nmy information used in ways I do not expect or approve.'' Under this \nbill, online companies would have to honor that user declaration or \nface penalties enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, or State \nAttorneys General.\n  This bill is necessary because the privacy of Americans is \nincreasingly under assault as more and more of their daily lives are \nconducted online. Whether it is a person at home searching for a new \njob or home, a parent researching her sick child's symptoms and \ntreatments using a health application, or a teenager using her \nsmartphone while riding the subway, online companies are collecting \nmassive amounts of information, often without consumers' knowledge or \nconsent. A vast array of companies that consumers have never heard of \nare surreptitiously collecting this information in numerous ways: \nthird-party advertising networks place ``cookies'' on computer web-\nbrowsers to track the websites that consumers have visited; analytic \nand marketing companies identify individual computers by recognizing \nthe unique configuration, or ``fingerprint,'' of web-browsers; and \nsoftware applications installed on mobile devices, colloquially known \nas ``apps,'' collect, use, and share information about consumers' \nprecise locations, contact lists, photographs, and other personal \nmatters. All of this information can be combined and stored on computer \nservers around the world and used for a variety of purposes, ranging \nfrom website analytics to online behavioral advertising to the creation \nof comprehensive dossiers by data brokers that build and sell personal \nprofiles about hundreds of millions of individual Americans.\n  My bill would empower consumers, if they so choose, to stem the tide. \nIt would give them the means to prohibit the collection of their \ninformation from the start. Consumers would be able to tell companies \ncollecting their personal information that they want those collection \npractices to stop. At the same time, the bill would preserve the \nability of those online companies to conduct their business and deliver \nthe content and services that consumers have come to expect and enjoy. \nThe bill would grant the FTC rulemaking authority to use its expertise \nto protect the privacy interests of consumers while addressing the \nlegitimate needs of industry.\n  The key to this bill is its simplicity. For over a decade in the \nSenate Commerce Committee, which I chair, we have tried to determine \nhow online companies can provide clear and conspicuous notice to \nconsumers about their information practices and--once this notice has \nbeen given--further determine how consumers can either opt-in or opt-\nout of those information collection practices. Yet today, privacy \npolicies are still far too long, too complicated, and too full of \ntechnical legalese for any reasonable consumer to read, let alone \nunderstand. The failures of these notices are even clearer when placed \non the exploding number of mobile devices on which consumers have grown \nto rely. My bill avoids this messy ``rabbit hole'' of policy \nconsiderations and creates an easy mechanism that gives consumers the \nopportunity to simply say ``no thank you'' to anyone and everyone \ncollecting their online information. Period.\n  Let me also say a few words about what this bill does not do. My bill \nwould not ``break the Internet,'' as I am sure we will hear from \nopponents. The truth is that my bill makes every necessary \naccommodation for online companies to continue providing content and \nservices to consumers. For instance, websites and applications would \nstill be able collect data to deliver the content and functionality \nthat consumers have requested, perform internal analytics, improve \nperformance, and prevent fraud. My bill would also allow online \ncompanies to collect and maintain consumer information when it has been \nvoluntarily provided by the consumer. They could also collect data that \nis truly anonymous. Finally, consumers could allow companies they trust \nto collect and use their information by giving specific consent that \noverrides a general do-not-track preference. But, when consumers say \nthat they do not want to be tracked, online companies would no longer \nbe allowed to ignore this request and collect and use this information \nfor any extraneous purpose. Moreover, these companies would be \nobligated to immediately destroy or anonymize the information once it \nis no longer needed to provide the service requested.\n  I think it is worth noting that since 2010, the FTC has called for a \ndo-not-track solution. The commission has stated that any effective do-\nnot-track system should be simple, easy to use, and persistent, and \nthat, if implemented, it should prevent the collection of consumers' \nonline data. The private sector has also taken notice and similarly \nrecognized the utility of do-not-track for its users. Nearly every \npopular web browser now allows consumers to affirmatively declare a do-\nnot-track preference to websites. The problem is that online companies \nhave no legal obligation to honor this request and, in fact, many have \ngone so far as to outright refuse to do so. In February 2012, industry \nleaders stood at the White House and publicly declared their commitment \nto honor do-not-track requests from web browsers. Yet since that time, \nindustry has failed to live up to those commitments. The online \nadvertising industry has articulated huge exemptions to its pledge to \nlimit the collection of information--exceptions that undermine the very \nself-regulatory programs the industry has promoted as effective. This \nindustry has emphasized consumer choice yet has made statements \npublicly refusing to honor new do-not-track browser features. My bill \nwould put an end to this gamesmanship and nonsense.\n  My bill is only part of the ongoing discussion on consumer privacy in \nCongress. It is simple, yet powerful. It allows consumers, if they \nchoose, and I should emphasize that many will not make such a choice, \nto stop the mind-boggling number of online companies that are \ncollecting vast amounts of their information. It gives consumers an \neasy-to-use tool that will implement their choices effectively in a \ncomplex, rapidly-changing online world. It prohibits those lurking in \nthe cyber-shadows from profiting off of the personal, private \ninformation of ordinary Americans. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on this and other privacy legislative efforts in the \nCommerce Committee and on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 418\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to limit the use of cluster munitions; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and \ncolleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy to introduce the Cluster \nMunitions Civilian Protection Act of 2013.\n  Our legislation places common sense restrictions on the use of \ncluster munitions. It prevents any funds from being spent to use \ncluster munitions that have a failure rate of more than one percent.\n  In addition, the rules of engagement must specify that the cluster \nmunitions will only be used against clearly defined military targets; \nand will not be used where civilians are known to be present or in \nareas normally inhabited by civilians.\n  Our legislation also includes a national security waiver that allows \nthe President to waive the prohibition on the use of cluster munitions \nwith a failure rate of more than one percent, if he determines it is \nvital to protect the security of the United States to do so.\n  However, if the President decides to waive the prohibition, he must \nissue a report to Congress within 30 days on the failure rate of the \ncluster munitions used and the steps taken to protect innocent \ncivilians.\n  Cluster munitions are large bombs, rockets, or artillery shells that \ncontain up to hundreds of small submunitions, or individual \n``bomblets.''\n  They are intended for attacking enemy troop and armor formations \nspread over a half mile radius.\n  But, in reality, they pose a deadly threat to innocent civilians.\n  In Afghanistan, between October 2001 and November 2002, 127 civilians \nlost their lives due to cluster munitions, 70 percent of them under the \nage of 18.\n  An estimated 1,220 Kuwaitis and 400 Iraqi civilians have been killed \nby cluster munitions since 1991.\n  During the 2006 war in Lebanon, Israeli cluster munitions, many of \nthem manufactured in the U.S., injured and killed 343 civilians.\n  Sadly, Syria is just the latest example.\n  According to Human Rights Watch, the Syrian military has used air-\ndropped and ground-based cluster munitions near or in civilian areas.\n  In October, residents of Taftanaz and Tamane reported that \nhelicopters dropped cluster munitions on or near their towns. One \nresident told Human Rights Watch:\n\n       On October 9, I heard a big explosion followed by several \n     smaller ones coming from Shelakh field located at the north \n     of Taftanaz. We went to see what happened. We saw a big \n     [bomb] cut in half and several [bomblets] that were not \n     detonated. I personally found one that was not exploded. \n     There were small holes in the ground. The holes were \n     dispersed and spread over 300 meters.\n\n  Another resident reported that an air-dropped cluster munitions \nreleased bomblets that landed between two neighboring schools.\n  Last month, Human Rights Watch issued another report that Syrian \nforces used ``notoriously indiscriminate'' ground-based cluster \nmunitions near Idlib and Latamenh, a town near Hama.\n  Not surprisingly, the residents of these towns also reported that \nmany of the bomblets were dispersed over a wide area, failed to \nexplode, and killed or maimed innocent civilians.\n  One resident of Latamneh told Human Rights Watch:\n\n       I heard a big explosion followed by smaller ones. . . . I \n     saw wounded people everywhere and small bombs covering the \n     streets. The damage caused to the buildings was minimal. I \n     saw a lot of unexploded bomblets.\n\n  One civilian was killed during the attack and 15 more, including \nwomen and children, were wounded. Another civilian was later killed by \nan unexploded bomblet. One video shows a baby with shrapnel along his \nright arm.\n  Videos taken after the incident also show that the civilians who came \nacross the munitions were unaware of the deadly power of an unexploded \nbomblet.\n  Men, and even children, can be seen handling these weapons as if they \nwere toys or simply souvenirs from the war.\n  Now, the United States has rightly condemned the Syrian military's \nuse of cluster munitions against innocent civilians.\n  However, our moral leadership is hampered by the fact that we \ncontinue to maintain such a large arsenal of these deadly weapons and \nour continued resistance to international efforts to restrict their \nuse.\n  In fact, the United States maintains an estimated 5.5 million cluster \nmunitions containing 728 million submunitions. These bomblets have an \nestimated failure rate of between 5 and 15 percent.\n  According to the most recent data, only 30,900 of these 728 million \nsubmunitions have self-destruct devices that would ensure a less than \none percent failure rate.\n  That accounts for only 0.00004 percent of the U.S. arsenal.\n  So, the technology exists for the U.S. to meet the one percent \nstandard, but our arsenal still overwhelmingly consists of cluster \nbombs with high failure rates.\n  How then, do we convince Syria not to use these deadly weapons?\n  While we wait, the international community has taken action.\n  On August 1, 2010, the Oslo Convention on Cluster Munitions--which \nwould prohibit the production, use, and export of cluster munitions and \nrequires signatories to eliminate their arsenals within eight years--\nformally came into force. To date, it has been signed by 111 countries \nand ratified by 77 countries.\n  This group includes key NATO allies such as Canada, the United \nKingdom, France, and Germany, who are fighting alongside our troops in \nAfghanistan.\n  It includes 33 countries that have produced or used cluster bombs.\n  But it does not include the United States.\n  The United States chose not to participate in the Oslo process or \nsign the treaty.\n  This is unacceptable.\n  Instead, the Pentagon continues to assert that cluster munitions are \n``legitimate weapons with clear military utility in combat.''\n  Recognizing that the United States could not remain silent in the \nface of widespread international efforts to restrict the use of cluster \nmunitions, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates issued a new policy on \ncluster munitions in June, 2008 stating that, after 2018, the use, \nsale, and transfer of cluster munitions with a failure rate of more \nthan 1 percent would be prohibited.\n  This policy is a step in the right direction, but would still allow \nthe Pentagon to use cluster bombs with high failure rates for five more \nyears.\n  That runs counter to our values. I believe the administration should \ntake another look at this policy.\n  In fact, on September 29, 2009, Senator Leahy and I were joined by 14 \nof our colleagues in sending a letter to President Obama urging him to \nconduct a thorough review of U.S. policy on cluster munitions.\n  On April 14, 2010, we received a response from then National Security \nAdvisor Jim Jones stating that the administration will undertake this \nreview following the policy review on U.S. landmines policy.\n  The administration should complete this review without delay.\n  Until then, we are still prepared to use these weapons with well-\nknown failure rates and significant risks to innocent civilians?\n  What does that say about us?\n  The fact is, cluster munition technologies already exist that meet \nthe one percent standard. Why do we need to wait until 2018?\n  This delay is especially troubling given that in 2001, former \nSecretary of Defense William Cohen issued his own\n\n[[Page S1027]]\n\npolicy on cluster munitions stating that, beginning in fiscal year \n2005, all new cluster munitions must have a failure rate of less than \none percent.\n  Unfortunately, the Pentagon was unable to meet this deadline and \nSecretary Gates' policy essentially postpones any meaningful action \nuntil 2018.\n  If we do nothing, close to twenty years will have passed since the \nPentagon first recognized the threat these deadly weapons pose to \ninnocent civilians.\n  We can do better.\n  First, it should be noted that in 2007, Congress passed, and \nPresident Bush signed into law, the FY 2008 Consolidated Appropriations \nAct, which included a provision that prohibits the sale and transfer of \ncluster bombs with a failure rate of more than one percent.\n  That ban has been renewed on an annual basis and remains on the \nbooks.\n  Our legislation simply moves up the Gates policy by five years and \nextends the ban on the sale and transfer of cluster munitions with high \nfailure rates to our own arsenal.\n  For those of my colleagues who are concerned that it may be too soon \nto enact a ban on the use of cluster munitions with failure rates of \nmore than 1 percent, I point out again that our bill allows the \nPresident to waive this restriction if he determines it is vital to \nprotect the security of the United States to do so.\n  I would also remind my colleagues that the United States has not used \ncluster munitions in Iraq since 2003 and has observed a moratorium on \ntheir use in Afghanistan since 2002.\n  In conclusion, let me say that Senator Leahy and I remain as \ncommitted as ever to raising awareness about the threat posed by \ncluster munitions and to pushing the United States to enact common-\nsense measures to protect innocent civilians. This body constantly \ntalks about America's moral leadership, and this is the perfect \nopportunity to exercise it.\n  Senator Leahy and I continue our efforts for people like Phongsavath \nSouliyalat.\n  Last year, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton traveled \nto Laos and met Phongsavath, a 19-year old Lao man who lost his \neyesight and his hands to a bomblet just three years before.\n  The bomblet that injured Phongsavath was dropped more than 30 years \nago during the Vietnam War. It lay unexploded, a de facto landmine, \nuntil his 16th birthday.\n  Sadly, he is not alone. The U.S. dropped 270 million bomblets over \nLaos, and 30 percent failed to explode.\n  According to an article from the Los Angeles Times, civilians in one-\nthird of Laos are threatened by unexploded ordinance, and only one \npercent of that area has been cleared.\n  Since the Vietnam War, more than 20,000 people have been killed or \ninjured by these deadly weapons. All of them were innocent civilians \nthat the United States did not intend to target.\n  After Phongsavath described the suffering of those who, like him, had \nbeen injured by unexploded bomblets, Secretary Clinton replied: ``We \nhave to do more.''\n  I agree wholeheartedly. As a first step, Congress should pass the \nCluster Munitions Civilian Protection Act of 2013. I urge my colleagues \nto support this important initiative.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, in introducing the Cluster Munitions \nCivilian Protection Act of 2013. It is identical to the bill that she \nand I have introduced in prior years, and I commend her for her \npersistence on this important humanitarian issue.\n  I come to this issue having devoted much effort over many years to \nshining a spotlight on and doing what can be done to help innocent \nvictims of war. In the last century, and continuing into this new \ncentury, noncombatants increasingly have borne the brunt of the \ncasualties in armed conflicts across the globe. Limiting the use of \nweapons that are inherently indiscriminate, such as landmines, and that \nhave indiscriminate effects, such as cluster munitions, are tangible, \npractical, meaningful things we can do to reduce these unnecessary \ncasualties.\n  Cluster munitions, like any weapon, have some military utility. But \nanyone who has seen the indiscriminate devastation that cluster \nmunitions cause over wide areas understands the unacceptable threat \nthey pose to noncombatants. These are not the laser guided weapons the \nPentagon showed destroying their targets during the invasion of \nBaghdad. To the contrary. Cluster munitions can kill and maim anyone \nwithin the 360 degree range of flying shrapnel.\n  There is the horrific problem of cluster munitions that fail to \nexplode as designed and remain as active duds, like landmines, until \nthey are triggered by whoever comes into contact with them. Often it is \nan unsuspecting child, or a farmer.\n  Even now, in Laos today people are still being killed and maimed by \nmillions of U.S. cluster munitions left from the 1970s. That legacy, \nresulting from years of secret bombing of a peaceful, agrarian people \nwho posed no threat to the United States, contaminated more than a \nthird of Laos' agricultural land and cost countless innocent lives. It \nis shameful that we have contributed less in the past 35 years to clean \nup these deadly remnants of war than we spent in a few days of bombing.\n  Current law prohibits U.S. sales, exports and transfers of cluster \nmunitions that have a failure rate exceeding 1 percent. The law also \nrequires any sale, export or transfer agreement to include a \nrequirement that the cluster munitions will be used only against \nmilitary targets.\n  The Pentagon continues to insist that the United States should retain \nthe ability to use millions of cluster munitions in its arsenal which \nhave estimated failure rates of 5 to 20 percent. It has pledged to meet \nthe 1 percent failure rate for U.S. use of cluster munitions in 2018.\n  Like Senator Feinstein I reject the notion that the United States can \njustify using antiquated weapons that so often fail, so often kill and \ninjure innocent people including children, and which many of our allies \nhave renounced. That is not the kind of leadership the world needs and \nexpects from the United States. If we have learned anything from \nAfghanistan it is that harming civilians, even unintentionally, creates \nenemies among those whose support we need, and undermines the mission \nof our troops.\n  Senator Feinstein's and my bill would apply the 1 percent failure \nrate to U.S. use of cluster munitions beginning on the date of \nenactment. However, our bill permits the President to waive the 1 \npercent requirement if the President certifies that it is vital to \nprotect the security of the United States. I would hope the Pentagon \nwould recognize that this is in its best interest, and will work with \nus by supporting this reasonable step.\n  Since December 3, 2008, when the Convention on Cluster Munitions \nopened for signature in Dublin, at least 111 countries have signed the \ntreaty including Great Britain, Germany, Canada, Norway, Australia and \nother allies of the United States. However, the Bush Administration did \nnot participate in the negotiations that culminated in the treaty, and \nthe Obama Administration has not signed it.\n  Some have dismissed the Cluster Munitions Convention as a pointless \nexercise, since it does not yet have the support of the United States \nand other major powers such as Russia, China, Pakistan, India and \nIsrael. These are some of the same critics of the Ottawa treaty banning \nantipersonnel landmines, which the United States and the other \ncountries I named have also refused to sign. But that treaty has \ndramatically reduced the number of landmines produced, used, sold, and \nstockpiled--and the number of mine victims has fallen sharply. Any \ngovernment that contemplates using landmines today does so knowing that \nit will be condemned by the international community. I suspect it is \nonly a matter of time before the same is true for cluster munitions.\n  It is important to note that the United States today has the \ntechnological ability to produce cluster munitions that meet the \nrequirements of our bill, as well as of the treaty. What is lacking is \nthe political will to act. There is no excuse for continuing to use \ncluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.\n  I urge the Obama administration to review its policy on cluster \nmunitions and put the United States on a path to\n\n[[Page S1028]]\n\njoin the treaty as soon as possible. In the meantime, our legislation \nwould be an important step in the right direction.\n  I want again to thank and commend Senator Feinstein, who has shown \nsuch passion and steadfastness in raising this issue and seeking every \nopportunity to protect civilians from these indiscriminate weapons.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Corker, and Mr. \n        Paul):\n  S. 421. A bill to prohibit the Corps of Engineers from taking any \naction to establish a restricted area prohibiting public access to \nwaters downstream of a dam, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nalong with Senator McConnell, Senator Paul, and Senator Corker, to \nprevent the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from restricting fishing \nrights in some of the best fishing areas in the States of Tennessee and \nKentucky below 10 dams along the Cumberland River.\n  I have talked with the Corps several times about this. They have told \nme the only solution is legislation. I am hoping there is some other \nsolution by reasonable compromise.\n  But I am taking the Corps's advice. On Tuesday, Congressman Ed \nWhitfield, of Kentucky, introduced legislation on this matter, and so I \nam introducing similar legislation today.\n  I have also drafted language that could be included in an \nappropriations bill that would prevent the Corps of Engineers from \nusing any funds to restrict fishing in what is called the tailwaters \nbelow these 10 Corps of Engineers dams on the Cumberland River.\n  Today I spoke with the Secretary of the Army, John McHugh. I urged \nhim to have the Corps give Congress enough time to consider this \nmatter, perhaps to work out something with the Corps by compromise or, \nif not, to pass legislation.\n  On Monday, I am meeting with the Assistant Secretary of the Army, Jo-\nEllen Darcy, who is in charge of the Corps of Engineers, to ask that \nthe Corps stop taking any further action to build physical barriers \nalong the Cumberland River.\n  Earlier, I met with James DeLapp, the colonel who is the commander of \nthe Nashville District. Then I met, along with Congressman Whitfield \nand Congressman Cooper of Nashville, TN, with MG Michael Walsh, who is \nthe deputy commanding general. I have had a number of meetings on this \nsubject, and I am determined to get some result, one way or the other.\n  I am delighted to have the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, my \ncolleague, Senator Corker from Tennessee, and Senator Rand Paul of \nKentucky as cosponsors on the legislation.\n  One may say, with a large number of problems facing our country--from \nIran to the sequester--why is a Senator--in fact, four, and a number of \nCongressmen interested in fishing?\n  There are 900,000 Tennesseeans who have fishing licenses, and one of \nmy jobs is to represent them. I know and they know these are some of \nthe best fishing areas in our State.\n  This is an area where grandfathers and grandsons and granddaughters \ngo on Saturdays and go during the week. There are lots of Tennesseeans \nwho consider these prize properties and their lands. These are public \nlands, and they feel they have a right to be there.\n  The problem is that the Corps of Engineers wants to erect physical \nbarriers below the dams to keep the fishermen out of the area that is \njust below the dam.\n  The Corps' goal is laudable. The goal is to improve safety, they say. \nWe all support safety, but there are much better solutions than this.\n  Let me give an analogy. When you have a railroad crossing, you do not \nkeep the gate down at the railroad crossing 100 percent of the time. \nThe track is not dangerous if the train is not coming.\n  The water comes through these dams only 20 percent of the time, and \nthe water is not dangerous if the water is not spilling through the \ndams. So if we kept the gate down at the railroad crossing 100 percent \nof the time, we would never be able to travel anywhere. That is the \nsame sort of reasoning we have here.\n  From Washington, the Department of the Army is saying they have a \npolicy, which they have had since 1996--which they have never applied \non the Cumberland River--that suddenly they have decided, after all \nthese years, they have to close the fishing area 100 percent of the \ntime, even though it might be dangerous only 20 percent of the time.\n  I am not the only one who thinks this is an unreasonable policy.\n  Last week, I went to Old Hickory Dam, near Nashville. About 150 \nfishermen were there with me on the banks of the Cumberland River. I \nmet with the Corps officials. They turned the water on so I could see \nit spilling through the dam. Then they turned it off. I met with Ed \nCarter, the director of the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency. I met \nwith Mike Butler, the chief executive of the Tennessee Wildlife \nFederation. I have talked with the Kentucky wildlife people and this is \nwhat they say. They think the Corps' plans to improve safety are so \nunreasonable that the wildlife agencies will not even help them enforce \nit. But they say, on the other hand, there are reasonable ways to \nimprove safety; that is, to treat the waters below the dam the way the \nTennessee Valley Authority does, for example, which is to erect large \nsigns--some of which already exist at Old Hickory Dam--blow the siren \nwhen the water is coming through. You can close the parking lot. You \ncould patrol the area. There are lots of ways to put the gate down, in \neffect, on these fishing areas 20 percent of the time. That makes a lot \nof sense, and the local agencies are willing to help do that.\n\n  Our legislation makes clear that for purposes of this act, installing \nand maintaining sirens, strobe lights, and signage for alerting the \npublic of hazardous waters shall not be considered a part of the \nprohibition. It makes no sense to take these public lands and say to \npeople: Well, the lawyers came in and said we need to be careful. Of \ncourse we need to be careful; however, being careful does not mean you \nkeep the gate down over the railroad crossing 100 percent of the time, \nand it doesn't mean you close the area to fishing 100 percent of the \ntime when it is dangerous only 20 percent of the time.\n  I am also concerned about the $2.6 million the Corps needs to \ntransfer from other parts of its budget to put up these physical \nbarriers. Where is the money coming from? I thought we were in the \nmiddle of a big sequester, a big budget crunch. I thought we were out \nof money. One of the areas which has some of the most difficult \nproblems to deal with is the Department of the Army. This is no time to \nbe wasting money building barriers that the wildlife people in \nTennessee and Kentucky, whose job it is to encourage boat safety, think \nare unreasonable.\n  I am doing what the Corps has said needs to be done, which is to \nprovide legislation. I look forward to continuing to work with the \nCorps of Engineers. My hope is that we can work out a reasonable \nsolution with the wildlife agencies.\n  The county judges on both sides of the border are very involved in \nthis. They see the economic benefit that comes from the large number of \npeople who visit those areas for recreational purposes. They leave \ntheir dollars behind. This creates good jobs in Tennessee and Kentucky.\n  Basically, these are public waters. Tennessee and Kentucky fishermen \nought to have access to them, and there shouldn't be an edict from \nWashington that puts the gate down the railroad crossing 100 percent of \nthe time. I am going to do my best to see that doesn't stand. I hope we \ncan work it out, but if we cannot, I am glad to introduce this \nlegislation with Senator McConnell, Senator Corker, and Senator Paul. \nThe same legislation is in the House of Representatives with \nCongressman Whitfield. I look forward to my meeting Monday with the \nAssistant Secretary of the Army.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n                                 S. 421\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize preferential treatment for certain \nimports from Nepal, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Nepal \nTrade Preferences Act.\n  This legislation is simple and straightforward. It grants duty-free \nstatus to imports of Nepalese garments for a seven year period.\n  As a friend of Nepal and the Nepalese people for over 25 years, I \nbelieve this bill will promote economic prosperity and lasting \npolitical stability in one of the world's poorest countries.\n  Nepal has a per capita income of $540.\n  Approximately 25 percent of the Nepal's 24 million people live in \npoverty.\n  The unemployment rate in Nepal stands at a staggering 47 percent; and \nmost Nepalese live on $3 a day.\n  Nepal's poverty was also compounded by a devastating, 10-year Maoist \ninsurgency which resulted in the deaths of 13,000 people.\n  Thankfully, on November 21, 2006 Nepal's government and Maoist rebels \nsigned a peace accord.\n  Two years later, Nepal became a republic and a Constituent Assembly \nwas elected to draft a new constitution.\n  Unfortunately, this momentum has stalled and Nepal remains without a \nnew constitution.\n  Challenges persist for Nepal's economy.\n  In 2005, in accordance with an international agreement, all quotas on \ngarment imports were removed.\n  This has had a devastating impact on Nepal's garment industry as U.S. \nimporters have shifted their orders to China, India and other suppliers \nwith cheaper labor markets.\n  The number of people employed by the Nepalese garment industry \ndropped from over 100,000 people--half of them women to between 5,000 \nand 10,000.\n  Garment exports fell from approximately $139 million in 2000 to $47 \nmillion in 2011.\n  The number of garment factories plummeted from 450 to 10.\n  The U.S. share of Nepalese garment exports dropped from 90 percent to \n21 percent.\n  Despite Nepal's poverty and the collapse of the garment industry, \nNepalese garments are still subject to an average U.S. tariff of 11.7 \npercent and can be as high as 32 percent.\n  In essence, we are penalizing an impoverished country which cannot \nafford it. This makes no sense.\n  I would point out that U.S. tariffs on Nepalese garments stand in \ncontrast to the European Union, Canada, and Australia which allow \nNepalese garments into their markets duty free.\n  It should come as no surprise, then, that while the U.S. share of \nNepalese garment exports has fallen, the European Union's share has \nrisen from 18.14 percent in 2006 to 46 percent in 2010.\n  The purpose of the Nepal Trade Preferences Act is to ensure that we \nprovide Nepal with the same trade preferences afforded to it by other \ndeveloped countries. No more, no less.\n  Humanitarian and development assistance programs should be critical \ncomponents of our efforts to help Nepal.\n  But we should also help the Nepalese people help themselves and open \nthe U.S. market to a once thriving export industry.\n  In the end, economic growth and prosperity can be best achieved when \nNepal is given the chance to compete and grow in a free and open global \nmarketplace.\n  Success in that marketplace will lead to a lesser dependence on \nforeign aid and encourage Nepal to develop other viable export \nindustries.\n  With this legislation, the United States can make a real difference \nnow to help revitalize the garment industry in Nepal and promote \neconomic growth and higher living standards.\n  The impact on the domestic industry will be minimal. At most, \nNepalese garments have accounted for 0.26 percent of all garment \nimports in the United States generating $14 million in revenue.\n  Nepal will continue to be a small player in the U.S. market.\n  But to allay any concerns that Nepalese garments will somehow flood \nthe market, this bill does place sensible restrictions on the amount of \ngarments that will receive duty free status. That amount will rise \nevery year up to a specific percentage of all U.S. garment imports.\n  By passing this legislation, we will help ensure that the garment \nindustry will be a big player in contributing to Nepal's economic \ngrowth and development. This will be more jobs and a rising standard of \nliving for the Nepalese people.\n  Let there be no doubt, it is my hope that this bill will also spur \nNepal's political parties to come together, resolve their differences, \nand finalize a new constitution. Lasting political stability is \nessential if Nepal is to fully realize the economic benefits of this \nlegislation.\n  Almost 7 years ago, the Nepalese people embraced peace and \nreconciliation. Let us show our solidarity with them and demonstrate \nour commitment to the success of the peace process by passing this \ncommonsense measure.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Nepal Trade Preferences Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 432. A bill to extend certain trade preferences to certain least-\ndeveloped countries in Asia and the South Pacific, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Asia-\nSouth Pacific Trade Preferences Act of 2013, a bill to promote economic \ngrowth, democracy, and political stability in some of the world's \npoorest countries.\n  This legislation will provide duty-free and quota-free benefits for \ngarments and other products similar to those afforded to beneficiary \ncountries under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, AGOA.\n  The countries covered by this legislation are 13 Least Developed \nCountries, LDCs, as defined by the United Nations and the U.S. State \nDepartment, which are not covered by any current U.S. trade preference \nprogram: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Kiribati, Laos, \nMaldives, Nepal, Samoa, Solomon Islands, East Timor, Tuvalu, and \nVanuatu.\n  These countries are among the poorest in the world with the bulk of \ntheir citizens living on less than $1 a day.\n  Despite this widespread poverty, their exports are subject to some of \nthe highest U.S. tariffs, averaging around 16 percent.\n  In fact, these developing countries pay a disproportionate share of \nU.S. tariffs.\n  Bangladesh, for example, is the 9th largest contributor of U.S. \ntariffs even though it is the 46th largest source of U.S. imports.\n  Cambodia is the 12th largest contributor of U.S. tariffs but ranks as \nthe 60th largest source of U.S. imports.\n  So, in essence, these two developing countries pay more in U.S. \ntariffs than many European countries. How is that fair or consistent \nwith our values?\n  Unfortunately, the United States is the only developed nation that \nhas not provided an enhanced trade preference program to the \nbeneficiary countries in this bill.\n  Indeed, we maintain duty preference programs for Haiti, the countries \nof sub-Saharan African and other developing countries and rightly so. \nThese programs are critical components of our efforts to provide hope \nfor millions of people struggling with poverty.\n  But it makes no sense to exclude other countries at the same level of \neconomic development. We should not hesitate to correct this inequity.\n  This is not about pitting one developing country against the other. \nRather, it is a simple matter of fairness and\n\n[[Page S1030]]\n\nensuring that we help all of those in need.\n  In fact, this effort goes hand in hand with my long-standing support \nfor a strong and effective foreign aid budget for the United States as \nan essential tool in helping lift these countries out of poverty and \nput them on the path to economic prosperity and political stability.\n  Especially in these difficult fiscal times, however, humanitarian and \ndevelopment assistance should not be the sum total of our efforts.\n  Make no mistake: these programs help stabilize poor and war-torn \ncountries, save lives, and lay the foundation for future prosperity.\n  Yet, the key for sustained growth, jobs, and rising standards of \nliving will be the ability of each of these countries to create vital \nexport industries to compete in a free and open global marketplace.\n  It is clear that the textile and apparel industries in many of the \nAsia-South Pacific countries in this bill are those industries that \nhold out the best hope for export growth.\n  We should help these countries help themselves by opening the U.S. \nmarket to their exports as we have done for other developing countries \nin the past.\n  By doing so, we will demonstrate the best of American values: \nreaching out to neighbors in need and helping them to stand on their \nown two feet.\n  We will also help ourselves.\n  First, as these countries become more prosperous, we will see new \nopportunities for our own exports in their growing markets.\n  This, in turn, will create jobs and economic growth in our own \ncountry.\n  But if we maintain high tariffs on imports from the Asia-South \nPacific countries, those opportunities will likely go to the European \nUnion and other developed countries that already have trade preference \nprograms for these countries.\n  We should not put ourselves at such a disadvantage.\n  Second, as the Asia-South Pacific countries become more stable \npolitically, we will help protect U.S. national security interests by \npreventing failed states which could become breeding grounds for \nterror.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that the cost of lowering tariffs on the \nimports of textile and apparel products from the Asia-South Pacific \ncountries is far less than any military intervention.\n  We will also help ourselves by securing partners in the fight against \nglobal threats such as terrorism, climate change, the HIV/AIDS \npandemic, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  U.S. leadership is essential in those efforts. But they require a \nglobal, multilateral response. As these countries grow, they can assume \na larger role and contribute more effectively.\n  When it comes to our national security, every bit of assistance \nhelps.\n  Finally, at a time of economic uncertainty, by eliminating tariffs on \nimports from the Asia-South Pacific countries, this bill will help \nlower prices for the American consumers and provide them with more \noptions.\n  It will also help the 3 million American workers whose jobs depend on \napparel imports.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that the Asia-South Pacific Trade \nPreferences Act is a win-win for the U.S. and the Asia-South Pacific \ncountries.\n  Now, let me address some of the concerns that may be raised about \nthis bill.\n  First, many of the Asia-South Pacific countries have struggled in the \npast with corruption, a lack of democracy, human rights abuses, and the \nabsence of rule of law.\n  Some may ask: why reward these countries with a trade preference \nprogram?\n  Make no mistake. These countries will not automatically receive the \ntrade benefits provided by this legislation.\n  This legislation has been drafted to ensure that the benefits are \ngranted on a performance-driven basis.\n  That is, to be eligible, a beneficiary country must demonstrate that \nit is making continual progress toward establishing rule of law, \npolitical pluralism, the right to due process, and a market-based \neconomy that protects private property rights.\n  So, this legislation would help promote democracy, human rights, and \nthe rule of law while sustaining vital export industries and creating \nemployment opportunities.\n  The beneficiary countries have a clear incentive to stay on the right \npath or they will lose the benefits of this bill.\n  If we ignore any problems, we will sustain the status quo and our \nefforts will fail.\n  Finally, whenever we discuss the creation of a new trade preference \nprogram, understandable concerns are raised about the impact on \ndomestic manufacturers.\n  If this bill becomes law, however, the impact on U.S. jobs will be \nminimal.\n  Currently, the beneficiary countries under this legislation account \nfor only 4 percent of U.S. textile and apparel imports, compared to 24 \npercent for China, and 72 percent for the rest of the world.\n  These countries will continue to be small players in the U.S. market, \nbut the benefits of this legislation will have a major impact on their \nexport economies.\n  By passing this legislation we will have an opportunity to change \nlives, protect our national security interests, and help the American \nconsumer. We should seize this opportunity.\n  I respectfully ask for the support of all my colleagues for this \nimportant initiative.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/28/senate-section/article/S1030-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 63--ENCOURAGING THE NAVY TO COMMISSION THE USS \n            SOMERSET (LPD-25) IN PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY (for himself and Mr. Casey) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\n                               S.

(for himself, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nCornyn, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Casey, Mr. Hoeven, Mrs. Gillibrand, \nMr. Kirk, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Cardin, Ms. Collins, Mr. \nBegich, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Brown, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Portman, Mr. Manchin, and \nMr. Lautenberg) submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 65\n\n       Whereas, on May 14, 1948, the people of Israel proclaimed \n     the establishment of the sovereign and independent State of \n     Israel;\n       Whereas, on March 28, 1949, the United States Government \n     recognized the establishment of the new State of Israel and \n     established full diplomatic relations;\n       Whereas, since its establishment nearly 65 years ago, the \n     modern State of Israel has rebuilt a nation, forged a new and \n     dynamic democratic society, and created a thriving economic, \n     political, cultural, and intellectual life despite the heavy \n     costs of war, terrorism, and unjustified diplomatic and \n     economic boycotts against the people of Israel;\n       Whereas the people of Israel have established a vibrant, \n     pluralistic, democratic political system, including freedom \n     of speech, association, and religion; a vigorously free \n     press; free, fair, and open elections; the rule of law; a \n     fully independent judiciary; and other democratic principles \n     and practices;\n       Whereas, since the 1979 revolution in Iran, the leaders of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran have repeatedly made threats \n     against the existence of the State of Israel and sponsored \n     acts of terrorism and violence against its citizens;\n       Whereas, on October 27, 2005, President of Iran Mahmoud \n     Ahmadinejad called for a world without America and Zionism;\n       Whereas, in February 2012, Supreme Leader of Iran Ali \n     Khamenei said of Israel, ``The Zionist regime is a true \n     cancer tumor on this region that should be cut off. And it \n     definitely will be cut off.'';\n       Whereas, in August 2012, Supreme Leader Khamenei said of \n     Israel, ``This bogus and fake Zionist outgrowth will \n     disappear off the landscape of geography.'';\n       Whereas, in August 2012, President Ahmadinejad said that \n     ``in the new Middle East . . . there will be no trace of the \n     American presence and the Zionists'';\n       Whereas the Department of State has designated the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 \n     and has characterized the Islamic Republic of Iran as the \n     ``most active state sponsor of terrorism'' in the world;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has \n     provided weapons, training, funding, and direction to \n     terrorist groups, including Hamas, Hizballah, and Shiite \n     militias in Iraq that are responsible for the murder of \n     hundreds of United States service members and innocent \n     civilians;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has \n     provided weapons, training, and funding to the regime of \n     Bashar al Assad that has been used to suppress and murder its \n     own people;\n       Whereas, since at least the late 1980s, the Government of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran has engaged in a sustained and \n     well-documented pattern of illicit and deceptive activities \n     to acquire a nuclear weapons capability;\n       Whereas, since September 2005, the Board of Governors of \n     the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has found the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran to be in non-compliance with its \n     safeguards agreement with the IAEA, which Iran is obligated \n     to undertake as a non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the \n     Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at \n     Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into \n     force March 5, 1970 (NPT);\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council has adopted \n     multiple resolutions since 2006 demanding of the Government \n     of the Islamic Republic of Iran its full and sustained \n     suspension of all uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing \n     activities and its full cooperation with the IAEA on all \n     outstanding issues related to its nuclear activities, \n     particularly those concerning the possible military \n     dimensions of its nuclear program;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has \n     refused to comply with United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions or to fully cooperate with the IAEA;\n       Whereas, in November 2011, the IAEA Director General issued \n     a report that documented ``serious concerns regarding \n     possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme,'' \n     and affirmed that information available to the IAEA indicates \n     that ``Iran has carried out activities relevant to the \n     development of a nuclear explosive device'' and that some \n     activities may be ongoing;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran stands in violation of the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights for denying its \n     citizens basic freedoms, including the freedoms of \n     expression, religion, peaceful assembly and movement, and for \n     flagrantly abusing the rights of minorities and women;\n       Whereas in his State of the Union Address on January 24, \n     2012, President Barack Obama stated, ``Let there be no doubt: \n     America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear \n     weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve \n     that goal.'';\n       Whereas Congress has passed and the President has signed \n     into law legislation imposing significant economic and \n     diplomatic sanctions on Iran to encourage the Government of \n     Iran to abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons and end its \n     support for terrorism;\n       Whereas these sanctions, while having significant effect, \n     have yet to persuade Iran to abandon its illicit pursuits and \n     comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions;\n       Whereas more stringent enforcement of sanctions \n     legislation, including elements targeting oil exports and \n     access to foreign exchange, could still lead the Government \n     of Iran to change course;\n       Whereas, in his State of the Union Address on February 12, \n     2013, President Obama reiterated, ``The leaders of Iran must \n     recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution, \n     because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet \n     their obligations. And we will do what is necessary to \n     prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon.'';\n       Whereas, on March 4, 2012, President Obama stated, ``Iran's \n     leaders should understand that I do not have a policy of \n     containment; I have a policy to prevent Iran from obtaining a \n     nuclear weapon.'';\n       Whereas, on October 22, 2012, President Obama said of Iran, \n     ``The clock is ticking. . . And we're going to make sure that \n     if they do not meet the demands of the international \n     community, then we are going to take all options necessary to \n     make sure they don't have a nuclear weapon.'';\n       Whereas, on May 19, 2011, President Obama stated, ``Every \n     state has the right to self-defense, and Israel must be able \n     to defend itself, by itself, against any threat.'';\n       Whereas, on September 21, 2011, President Obama stated, \n     ``America's commitment to Israel's security is unshakeable. \n     Our friendship with Israel is deep and enduring.'';\n       Whereas, on March 4, 2012, President Obama stated, ``And \n     whenever an effort is made to delegitimize the state of \n     Israel, my administration has opposed them. So there should \n     not be a shred of doubt by now: when the chips are down, I \n     have Israel's back.'';\n       Whereas, on October 22, 2012, President Obama stated, \n     ``Israel is a true friend. And if Israel is attacked, America \n     will stand with Israel. I've made that clear throughout my \n     presidency . . . I will stand with Israel if they are \n     attacked.'';\n       Whereas, in December 2012, 74 United States Senators wrote \n     to President Obama ``As you begin your second term as \n     President, we ask you to reiterate your readiness to take \n     military action against Iran if it continues its efforts to \n     acquire a nuclear weapon. In addition, we urge you to work \n     with our European and Middle Eastern allies to demonstrate to \n     the Iranians that a credible and capable multilateral \n     coalition exists that would support a military strike if, in \n     the end, this is unfortunately necessary.''; and\n       Whereas the United States-Israel Enhanced Security \n     Cooperation Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-150) stated that it \n     is United States policy to support Israel's inherent right to \n     self-defense: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 66\n\n       Whereas dangerous asbestos fibers are invisible and cannot \n     be smelled or tasted;\n       Whereas the inhalation of airborne asbestos fibers can \n     cause significant damage;\n       Whereas asbestos fibers can cause cancer such as \n     mesothelioma and asbestosis and other health problems;\n       Whereas asbestos-related diseases can take 10 to 50 years \n     to present themselves;\n       Whereas the expected survival time for those diagnosed with \n     mesothelioma is between 6 and 24 months;\n       Whereas, generally, little is known about late-stage \n     treatment of asbestos-related diseases, and there is no cure \n     for such diseases;\n       Whereas early detection of asbestos-related diseases may \n     give some patients increased treatment options and might \n     improve their prognoses;\n       Whereas the United States has substantially reduced its \n     consumption of asbestos, yet continues to consume almost \n     1,100 metric tons of the fibrous mineral for use in certain \n     products throughout the United States;\n       Whereas asbestos-related diseases have killed thousands of \n     people in the United States;\n       Whereas exposure to asbestos continues, but safety and \n     prevention of asbestos exposure already have significantly \n     reduced the incidence of asbestos-related diseases and can \n     further reduce the incidence of such diseases;\n       Whereas asbestos has been a cause of occupational cancer;\n       Whereas thousands of workers in the United States face \n     significant asbestos exposure;\n       Whereas thousands of people in the United States die from \n     asbestos-related diseases every year;\n       Whereas a significant percentage of all asbestos-related \n     disease victims were exposed to asbestos on naval ships and \n     in shipyards;\n       Whereas asbestos was used in the construction of a \n     significant number of office buildings and public facilities \n     built before 1975;\n       Whereas people in the small community of Libby, Montana, \n     suffer from asbestos-related diseases, including \n     mesothelioma, at a significantly higher rate than people in \n     the United States as a whole; and\n       Whereas the establishment of a ``National Asbestos \n     Awareness Week'' will raise public awareness about the \n     prevalence of asbestos-related diseases and the dangers of \n     asbestos exposure: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the first week of April 2013 as ``National \n     Asbestos Awareness Week'';\n       (2) urges the Surgeon General to warn and educate people \n     about the public health issue of asbestos exposure, which may \n     be hazardous to their health; and\n       (3) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Office of the \n     Surgeon General.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/28/senate-section/article/S1036-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 23.

Madam President, we are now on the eve of the so-called \nsequester. Tomorrow, March 1, Federal agencies will begin making $85 \nbillion in arbitrary, destructive budget cuts--cuts that economists \ntell us will damage our fragile economy and cost nearly 1 million jobs. \nThis is a shame and it is shameful. This is yet another self-inflicted \nwound to our economy, and it is completely unnecessary.\n  For months, President Obama and Democrats in Congress have urged \nRepublicans to join with us in negotiating a balanced package of \nspending cuts and revenue increases to head off this sequester. \nRegrettably, we have run up against the same old response from our \nRepublican colleagues: obstruction, obstruction, obstruction--an \nadamant refusal to compromise. They reject the very idea of a balanced \napproach, insisting that all deficit reduction must come exclusively \nfrom cuts to spending and investment. Since they have not gotten their \nway, they are now willing to allow all the destructive impacts of the \nsequester to happen.\n  Think about it, because it really is breathtaking. Republicans would \nrather allow our economy to lose up to a million jobs than to close a \ntax loophole that pays companies to move American jobs to foreign \ncountries. They would rather risk jolting the economy back into \nrecession than to close a tax loophole that allows hedge fund managers \nmaking hundreds of millions of dollars a year to pay a lower tax rate \nthan middle-class families. It really is breathtaking.\n  I am deeply concerned about the arbitrary cuts to programs that \nundergird the middle class in this country--everything from medical \nresearch to\n\n[[Page S1072]]\n\neducation to food and drug safety. Earlier this week, the Director of \nthe National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis Collins, warned that the \nsequester would slash $1.6 billion from NIH's budget, directly damaging \nongoing research into cancer, Alzheimer's, and other diseases.\n  Funding for special education would also suffer deep cuts, \neliminating Federal support for more than 7,200 teachers, aides, and \nother staff who support our students with disabilities.\n  Funding for food safety would be severely impacted, resulting in \nthousands of fewer inspections, a slowdown in meat processing, costing \njobs and endangering the safety of the public. The Food Safety and \nInspection Service may have to furlough all employees for approximately \n2 weeks, which could close down or severely restrict meatpacking plants \naround the country.\n  The list of destructive budget cuts goes on and on, and what many \npeople may not understand is that these are just the latest cuts to \nspending and investment.\n  Over the past 2 years, the President and Congress have already agreed \nto $1.4 trillion in spending cuts, all from the discretionary side of \nthe budget. These have been very dramatic spending reductions.\n  As I said earlier today, when we hear the Speaker of the House say: \nWell, since the first of the year, we have given on revenues but we \nhave not had any spending cuts--he says: No more revenues, just \nspending cuts because we have already done the revenues--well, you see \nwhat he is doing is he is drawing an arbitrary starting line. His \nstarting line is the first of this year. But you have to go back a year \nand a half to the Budget Control Act when, beginning with that, this \nCongress made $1.4 trillion in spending cuts--$1.4 trillion--and in \nJanuary we did $700 billion in revenues. So we are still $2 in cuts for \nevery $1 in revenue. Yet the Speaker says we should have no more \nrevenues, all spending cuts, to get up to our $4 trillion that is \nneeded to stabilize our debt in this country. So that means he wants to \nhave another $2.6--well, let me think about that; I have to add it up--\nit would be $1.9 trillion more in spending cuts.\n  Think about that, and think about it in terms of just one area that I \nknow about firsthand in my capacity as chair of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and \nRelated Agencies. That subcommittee has jurisdiction over spending, for \nexample, at the National Institutes of Health. Over the last 2 years, \nCongress has completely eliminated 65 programs under that jurisdiction, \ntotaling $1.3 billion. What that means is no more funding for education \ntechnology, $100 million; no more funding for civic education, $35 \nmillion; no more funding for creating smaller learning communities in \nhigh schools, another $88 million.\n  LIHEAP, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, has been cut \nby $1.6 billion. That is a 30-percent cut--a 30-percent cut. That cut \neliminates home heating and cooling assistance for 1.5 million low-\nincome and elderly households in this country. That has already been \ndone. Now the Speaker wants to do more. Maybe he wants to eliminate the \nentire LIHEAP program.\n  The administration's signature education initiative, Race to the Top, \nhas been cut by $150 million. That is a 20-percent cut--already, a 20-\npercent cut. That is what we have done already. If we cut any more, you \nare really going to be destroying education initiatives in this \ncountry.\n  How about lead poisoning, childhood lead poisoning. It has been cut \nby 93 percent, from $29 million a year down to $2 million, meaning that \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention no more has any funding \nto test children for lead poisoning. And we know that if you get kids \nearly, you can stop the deteriorating effects of lead poisoning. But \nnow we are not even going to be testing these kids anymore.\n  National programs to keep our schools safe and drug free have been \ncut by two-thirds, from $191 million to $65 million.\n  As I said, national programs that keep schools safe and drug free are \ncut by two-thirds. I wonder how many people know that. I wonder how \nmany people know we cut that already by two-thirds.\n  Again, this list goes on and on with deep cuts to vital programs. I \nwish to emphasize, these are the cuts we have already made in the last \n2 years. The sequester will cut them even further.\n  Fighting childhood lead poisoning, which we know continues on in this \ncountry, we know how it destroys kids and their future growth, and we \nknow early intervention can alleviate that. Yet it has been cut by 93 \npercent. What are we going to do, cut it by another 7 percent? We just \nwill not have any efforts at all to test kids for lead poisoning early \non. The sequester will have very real consequences for the economy and \nfor our society.\n  Finally, let me step back and put our discussion of this sequester in \na broader perspective. By all means, we need to reduce deficits \nfurther, especially in the longer term. But I have questioned \nrepeatedly the sort of obsessive, exclusive, almost borderline \nhysterical focus on budget deficits. Meanwhile, we are neglecting other \nurgent national priorities. How about the jobs deficit, the deficit in \nour investment in our infrastructure, the deficit in our investment in \na strong, growing, middle class?\n  What we need is an approach to the budget that addresses all of \nthese--reducing budget deficits, yes, but doing it in a way that allows \nus to strengthen the middle class and lay the foundation for future \neconomic growth.\n  We also need to look at the demographic projectory of our country as \nwell as the challenges posed by globalization. Our Nation is growing \nolder with the retiring baby boomers. This will dramatically increase \ngovernment costs for health care and other services. We are also now in \na global economy competing not only in manufacturing but also in a \ngrowing range of services, from telemarketing to the reading of medical \nMRIs. In order to compete successfully and keep quality jobs in the \nUnited States, we need to invest robustly both in a 21st century \ninfrastructure, as well as in a system of education and training that \nequips our young people and workers for the jobs of the future.\n  In this broader context, what is the best way to address the \nresulting deficits? Do we just slash spending for education, slash \nspending for infrastructure, slash spending for research and discovery, \nsacrificing the investments we will need to grow our economy in the \ndecades ahead? Do we just allow this destructive sequester to kick in, \ncosting us jobs, cutting vital supports for middle-class Americans?\n  These are the destructive budget options which will take effect \nstarting tomorrow if we fail to act. This is why I come to the floor, \nat the eleventh hour, to plead one final time for a compromise and \ncommon sense from Republicans. Yes, I am here to plead for some common \nsense, some compromise from Republican leadership.\n  There are plenty of areas where we can cut spending without seriously \nharming the economy. There are plenty of commonsense options for \nraising revenue without lifting tax rates or hurting the middle class.\n  It is still possible for Senators to come together, but that may only \nhappen if we have some willingness to compromise on the Republican \nside.\n  When the Speaker says absolutely no more revenue, how do you \ncompromise with that? We know from the polling data that the vast \nmajority of the American people, 60, 70 percent, believe we should have \na balanced approach, both in revenues and in cutting spending.\n  We have reached out our hand in an effort to shake hands with the \nRepublicans. They have not reciprocated by reaching out their hand to \nclose the deal.\n  It is still possible, but it is only possible if the other side is \nwilling to make some compromises. Time is short. I urge colleagues to \nput ideology and this partisanship aside, stop this sequester, tackle \nthese budget deficits in a way that allows us to invest in a growing \neconomy and a stronger middle class.\n  A lot of people say if the sequester kicks in, people aren't going to \nfeel it right away. Well, maybe not tomorrow night, maybe not even \nSaturday or Sunday. We will beginning next week, when the Food Safety \nand Inspection Service starts furloughing people and we begin fewer \ninspections and maybe the week after that when our air traffic\n\n[[Page S1073]]\n\ncontrollers begin to be furloughed because they don't have enough money \nand air traffic begins to slow down in New York and Chicago and \nWashington, DC, and Atlanta.\n  It is always true that in times such as these, when we have these \nkinds of crises facing us, who gets hurt first and the most are the \npeople at the bottom rung of the ladder, kids with disabilities, \nfamilies who need some heating assistance in the middle of the winter, \nelderly people who may need some Meals On Wheels delivered to their \nhomes.\n  These are always the people who get hit first and the hardest. We \ncan't forget our societal obligations as a Congress to make sure their \nneeds are met also. We can't turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to the \nneeds of people in our society who don't have anything anyway. We can't \nthrow them out in the cold. We can't let our children be denied Head \nStart programs or adequate child care programs. This is not befitting a \ngreat and wonderful society such as America.\n  I am hopeful with a meeting in the White House tomorrow--as I know it \nis not just a photo opportunity--we will hear from the Speaker of the \nHouse that, yes, we need a balanced approach, and we are willing to \ntake that balanced approach. If they do that, we can get this settled \nwithin the next few days and then move ahead.\n\n  So that is my hope for tomorrow. And I hope, again, we will see some \nforthcoming on the part of Republicans that they are indeed willing to \ncompromise.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/28/senate-section/article/S1073-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MARCH 4, 2013, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
