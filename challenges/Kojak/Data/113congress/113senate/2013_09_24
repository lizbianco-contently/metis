Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, there will be a period of morning business until \n11:15 this morning. The Republicans will control the first half and the \nmajority the second half. At 11:15 a.m. the Senate will proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the nomination of Todd Hughes to be a \nU.S. circuit judge for the Federal Circuit. At 11:45 a.m. there will be \na rollcall vote on confirmation of that nomination. Following that \nvote, the Senate will recess until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly \ncaucus meetings. At 2:15 p.m. we will resume consideration of the \nmotion to proceed to the continuing resolution. Senator Mikulski will \nmake opening remarks at that time, and Senator Cruz will be recognized \nafter her.\n  Mr. President, on the morning news I hear there will be a filibuster \ntoday. I want to disabuse everyone. There will be no filibuster today. \nFilibusters are to stop people from voting, and we are going to vote \ntomorrow. Under the rules, no one can stop that. We can advance the \ntime and do it more quickly. We could do that at any time, and I would \nbe happy to make sure we accomplish that, if both sides agree that, in \nfact, is something we should do. But we are going to vote tomorrow \nregardless of what anyone says or does today, unless it is a consent \nagreement to collapse the time, and that vote will occur sometime \naround noon tomorrow. So I want to make sure everyone understands there \nwill be no filibuster today.\n\n\n                           Economic Recovery\n\n  Mr. President, for millions of American families, the road to \neconomic recovery has been long, long, and very, very hard. Now, just \nas the economy\n\n[[Page S6690]]\n\nbegins to gain steam, some Republicans in Congress seem determined to \nderail 4 years of progress. They are obsessed with defunding health \ncare. They are pushing us closer and closer to a government shutdown \nthat would tank the economy, and that is an understatement.\n  The business community is gravely concerned about the impacts of a \nshutdown on the economy, and middle-class Americans are really upset \nand concerned about this threat.\n  Yesterday Republican and Democratic leaders in both Houses of \nCongress received a letter from the Business Roundtable, an association \nof chief executive officers who employ more than 16 million people. It \nis respected by Democrats and Republicans. The CEOs cautioned us about \nthe economic dangers of a government shutdown. They warned of the \ncatastrophic effects of a first-ever default on the Nation's debt--the \nnext looming crisis Republicans hope to exploit to their own short-term \npolitical benefit. I should say some Republicans.\n  This is what the Business Roundtable wrote yesterday:\n\n       Failure to fund the basic business of government and adjust \n     the debt limit in a fiscally responsible manner would risk \n     both the immediate and long-term health of the U.S. economy. \n     . . . Even a brief government shutdown would have serious \n     economic consequences and default, however temporary, would \n     be calamitous.\n\n  Five years removed from the worst of the great recession, job \ncreation, economic growth, and other key economic indicators are not \nwhere they should be, but they are headed in the right direction. The \nprivate sector has created 7.5 million jobs in the last 42 months, \njobless claims are at a 5-year low, and consumers feel more optimistic \nabout the economy than they have at any point in the last 5 years. A \ngovernment shutdown would reverse these trends and stunt future \neconomic growth, it would panic consumers and financial institutions, \nand it would cost the economy more than $30 billion for every week the \ngovernment remained shuttered--each week, $30 billion. We know this \nfrom experience. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice, the shutdowns of the mid-1990s--which lasted 27 days, all \ntold--reduced GDP by half a percent. That is a huge amount of damage to \nour economy.\n\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has joined the Business Roundtable in \ncalling on Congress to keep the government open. Here is what they \nsaid:\n\n       It is not in the best interest of the U.S. business \n     community or the American people to risk even a brief \n     government shutdown that might trigger disruptive \n     consequences or raise new policy uncertainties washing over \n     the U.S. economy.\n\n  But the dire effects of a shutdown would not just impact the economy; \na shutdown would send half the Defense Department's civilian workforce \nhome without pay and delay paychecks for many military families who \nalready live paycheck to paycheck. Although checks would go out to \nseniors already on Social Security, no new applications for benefits \nwould be processed, putting seniors and disabled Americans at risk. \nLikewise, veterans applying for education, disability, and pension \nbenefits would be forced to wait. The Centers for Disease Control would \nstop monitoring disease outbreaks. Passport applications would \nlanguish, costing airlines and travel-related businesses millions of \ndollars.\n  By a 3-to-1 margin, Americans already oppose this senseless \nRepublican plan--some feel more strongly than others--to hold the \ngovernment hostage to defund ObamaCare.\n  As I said here yesterday morning, CNN, CNBC, in separate polling, \nshow 59 percent--the same number in both polls--59 percent of the \nAmerican people support ObamaCare, and even a larger number of people \nthink the government shutdown is the worst idea that ever came along--\nas one Republican Senator said, the dumbest idea he ever heard. So \nimagine, Mr. President, their reaction--the American public--once they \nsee the dark economic outcome of a shutdown. I have told you how they \nfeel. But they can see in their mind's eye that they are losing their \njobs, their families are losing jobs, and an unquestioned economic \ndownturn.\n  Confucius, the famous Chinese philosopher, offered a warning--now a \nlong, long time ago--when he said: ``When anger rises, think of the \nconsequences.''\n  I realize generally the Republicans are still upset and mad, angry \nthat they lost the election in 2008. I understand that. They are still \nangry that they failed to stop a landmark expansion of health care to \nmillions of Americans. I understand that. They are angry that they have \nfailed to regain control of the Senate. They are angry that President \nObama was overwhelmingly reelected last year. But it is time to set \nthat anger aside. It is time to stop obsessing over old battles and \nthink of the consequences of a government shutdown.\n  So, Mr. President, what we need to do--the Acting President pro \ntempore, a longtime Member of Congress, approaching four decades of \nbeing in Congress, recognizes how we have worked together over those \ndecades, accomplishing good things for this country--is go back to \nthose days, days of working together. We could start in many places. We \ncould start by funding the government without a big hassle. We could \nwork together to do postal reform, which affects 6 million working \nAmericans. We could work together to do agricultural reform, which \nunder the bill we passed out of this body will save $23 billion. We cut \nthe deficit by $23 billion. We could work together to pass immigration \nreform. My Republican colleagues are concerned about the debt. That \nreduces it by $1 trillion.\n  Mr. President, the American people at least deserve that we work \ntogether and get things done. I would hope that with this crisis facing \nus we can put all our obsessions about health care and President Obama \ngetting reelected and our still controlling the Senate behind us and \nmove on to do good things for our country again.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                      House Continuing Resolution\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, about 4 years ago I mounted a campaign \nright here on the Senate floor against a bill that would come to be \nknown as ObamaCare. Nearly every day we were in session, I spoke about \nthe dangers of this bill for individuals, for families, for businesses, \nand the very character of our country. I predicted that it would be a \ncomplete disaster and that anyone who voted for it would come to regret \nit because the promises that were being made about ObamaCare could not \npossibly be kept. And guess what happened. These predictions are all \ncoming true.\n  ObamaCare has not even been fully implemented yet, but we can already \nsee the train wreck headed our way. Premiums are skyrocketing. Major \ncompanies have been dropping the health care plans their employees have \nand like. And every week it seems there are new reports about glitches \nthat will hurt families, compromise personal information, or expose the \nAmerican people to fraud--all of which helps explain why even some of \nthe bill's fiercest early backers are looking for an escape hatch.\n  But there is only one escape hatch that will fully help those trapped \nby this law, and that is full repeal. That is why I am supporting the \nHouse-passed CR. Not only does it defund this terrible law, it does not \nincrease government spending by a penny, and it keeps the government \nfrom shutting down, which nobody wants. It does something else--and \nthis is really important--it puts the focus right where it belongs: on \nthe Democrats who voted for and continue to support ObamaCare. Once we \ninvoke cloture, the focus will then turn to our friends on the other \nside of the aisle, the Senate Democrats. The majority leader is \ncounting on his Democratic allies to amend the bill. He can only afford \nto lose four Democrats--just four--if he wants to restore funding for \nObamaCare. So if five Senate Democrats vote against the majority \nleader, ObamaCare will be defunded. That is a vote we should have and \nin all likelihood will have.\n  Democrats have been hearing the same complaints about ObamaCare that \nthe rest of us have. The spotlight--the spotlight--really should be on \nthem. This is a rare opportunity to defund the law with a simple \nmajority--a simple majority to defund ObamaCare. We should have that \nvote. I just do not happen to think filibustering a bill that defunds \nObamaCare is the best route to defunding\n\n[[Page S6691]]\n\nObamaCare. All it does is shut down the government and keep ObamaCare \nfunded. And none of us want that. That would be the results of \nfilibustering.\n  Four years ago every Democrat voted for this bill and had the excuse \nthat they did not know how it would turn out. Well, they do not have \nthat excuse now. I think we deserve to know where they stand now. Four \nyears ago every Senate Democrat worked to jam this bill through the \nSenate, over the loud objections of their constituents. As the \nimplementation of this law proceeds, their constituents remain just as \nangry about it, and it is important for their Senators to go on record \nonce again. We are giving them a do-over--a second chance, if you will. \nDo they stand with the people of their States, who do not want this law \nto be implemented, or did they double down on this failed experiment? \nThat is the question.\n  Everybody knows where Republicans stand on this issue. We may be \ndivided on some things. We may not always agree on tactics. But on the \nquestion of repealing ObamaCare, we are totally united.\n  This law should be defunded. That is what the House bill does. That \nis why I plan to support it. But if we are going to repeal ObamaCare, \nwe are going to need some Democratic votes to do that. That is the only \nplan I have seen in this debate that will actually get us to our common \ngoal of undoing the law.\n  For the sake of our constituents, we need to unite to achieve it. So \nthis morning I would like to make a plea to our friends on the other \nside: Join us in taking it off the books and replacing it with the kind \nof commonsense, step-by-step reforms that lower costs and that \nAmericans will actually embrace.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I listened closely to the statement made \nby Senator McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican Senate leader. I \napplaud him and other Senators who have spoken out against the so-\ncalled filibuster that has been initiated by the Senator from Texas and \nat least one other Senator.\n  It is not technically a filibuster, as Senator Reid said, but the \nobject is to slow down the business of the Senate and it is somewhat \nsimilar to a filibuster. We are going to have that occur today when \nSenator Cruz takes the floor this afternoon to state his position that \nwe should shut down the government if we fund ObamaCare.\n  That, to me, is an irresponsible position. It is irresponsible \nbecause the Senators who support the House position are playing high \nstakes poker with other people's money. To shut down the government is \ndisastrous, not only for hundreds of thousands of Federal employees who \ndo important work to keep America safe and to keep us a leading nation \non the economy but also because it is at the expense of American jobs.\n  When Senator Reid, the Democratic leader, came to the floor and read \na statement from the Business Roundtable, he was reading from the \nstrongest business group that usually, without fail, supports \nRepublicans. That group put out a statement yesterday--the Business \nRoundtable, the leading business executives in our country--that to \nshut down the government or to fail to extend the debt ceiling is \ndevastating to our economy. The words they used were ``calamitous'' and \n``catastrophic.'' That is how they described the Republican strategy, \nwhich Senator Cruz and others are bringing to the floor of the Senate \ntoday--catastrophic, calamitous.\n  Why in the world would we have the self-imposed crisis created by the \nthreats of the House Republicans on the floor of the Senate today? They \nare entitled to a debate. They are entitled to state their position. \nThat is their right as Senators representing their States. But they are \nnot entitled to damage our economy and hurt innocent people and shut \ndown the government. That is a petulant political position.\n  What we need to do is take a more positive approach to governing this \ncountry. Senator McConnell also talked about ObamaCare, known as the \nhealth care reform bill, one of the most important bills the Senate has \npassed in modern times and one I was proud to support.\n  What he is basically calling for is the repeal of ObamaCare. What the \nRepublicans are calling for is to repeal, for example, that provision \nin ObamaCare which says that health insurance companies cannot \ndiscriminate against people with preexisting conditions. If you happen \nto be in a family with a child who has diabetes, it may be impossible \nfor you to buy health insurance under the old law. Under ObamaCare, \nyour family cannot be discriminated against. The Republicans want to \neliminate that provision of ObamaCare when they call for abolishing \nthat program.\n  Secondly, when they defund and eliminate ObamaCare, they are going to \nchange that provision which guarantees there will be no limits on our \nhealth insurance policy coverage. Who knows what tomorrow's diagnosis \nwill bring, what bills it will bring our family. But some health \ninsurance policies have a limit on what they pay. When that limit is \nreached, people face bankruptcy and worse. ObamaCare stops that from \nhappening. The Republicans want to repeal that.\n  ObamaCare also says that if your young son or daughter, fresh out of \ncollege, is looking for a job and has not found one, they can stay on \nyour family health insurance plan until age 26. The Republicans want to \nrepeal that, leaving more and more young people--millions across \nAmerica--vulnerable without the protection of health insurance.\n  When it comes to Medicare prescription Part D, seniors, because of \nthe so-called doughnut hole, were paying sums out of their own savings, \ntheir meager savings, and out of their own pockets, for prescription \ndrugs. ObamaCare fills that doughnut hole and gives those seniors more \npeace of mind when it comes to prescription drugs. The Republicans want \nto repeal that help for our senior citizens.\n  Finally, they want to repeal the insurance exchanges. Today, every \nMember of Congress who uses the health insurance available to us as \nSenators and Congressman is part of the Federal Employees Health \nBenefit Program. Each year Senators, Republicans and Democrats, have an \nopportunity under an insurance exchange to pick the plan best for their \nfamily. That privilege is something we appreciate and want to make \navailable for everyone across America. That is what ObamaCare does. The \nRepublicans want to repeal it. Republican Senators want to keep using \nthe insurance exchange for their families and their benefit. They do \nnot want to extend to it our families across America. That is what \nrepeal of ObamaCare would do.\n  Those are the specifics. For Senator McConnell to come to the floor \nand challenge those of us who voted for ObamaCare as to whether we \nstill stand by it, I do. Is it perfect? Of course not. There are \nchanges that can be made to this law and should be made but in a \nconstructive and positive fashion. This is not just about the peace of \nmind of people, families and businesses and others when it comes to \nhealth insurance, it is about our deficit. If we took the Republican \napproach of doing nothing when it comes to the cost of health care, \nsadly, we are condemning ourselves to deficits as far as the eye can \nsee.\n  Sixty percent of our deficits and looming national debt relates to \nthe increased cost of health care. If we took\n\n[[Page S6692]]\n\nthe Republican approach of doing nothing, ultimately, it would mean \nthat deficit, those debts, would be even larger for future generations. \nSo ObamaCare is a step in the right direction.\n  Finally, let me say I understand what is going on now with several \nMembers of the Senate Republican caucus who want to take to the floor \nand argue that we should shut down the government if it means funding \nObamaCare. I think they are wrong on the merits. They are wrong \npolitically. Both the Wall Street Journal and Karl Rove admonished them \nnot to take this suicidal strategy. I think they are right. It is a \nstrategy which is not appealing to anybody across America except a \nhandful of extremists. Those who are Independents and others believe \nthat funding our government is a basic responsibility of the House and \nthe Senate. It is important we accept that responsibility.\n  Standing to make a speech on your beliefs on the floor is certainly \nevery Senator's right, but let's get on with the business of \ngovernment. We should vote today on this motion to proceed instead of \nwasting an entire day and into tomorrow. If we can get bipartisan \nconsent, we can come to that motion quickly. The sooner we satisfy \nAmerica that we are not going to shut down the government, the better \nit will be for our economy to continue to grow and create jobs.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/24/senate-section/article/S6692-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6692-S6695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the economy generally \nand the negative effect President Obama's policies are having on the \neconomy and its health and particularly on middle-class families. I do \nnot think we have to look very far to see that impact; in fact, this \neconomy, which is growing at a very sluggish rate, the slowest recovery \nin 50 years. In other words, the economy, in terms of coming out of a \nrecession that we had a few years ago, is recovering at a slower rate \nthan in any recession in the past 50 years.\n  The labor participation rate--in other words, the number of people in \nthe workforce--is at a lower level, percentagewise, than it has been in \n35 years. We have to go back to the administration of Jimmy Carter to \nfind a time when the labor participation rate was at a lower level than \nit is today.\n  In fact, in the last year, of the jobs that have been created, 60 \npercent of those jobs are part-time jobs. We are not creating full-time \njobs, we are creating part-time jobs, meaning that American workers are \nhaving to work more than one job to make ends meet and are having lower \ntake-home pay. In fact, the take-home pay, the average household \nincome, is down by about $4,000 since the President took office. So we \nhave lower take-home pay, fewer jobs, at least fewer full-time jobs, a \nslow, sluggish economy.\n  Why is that the case? Frankly, it is because the policies the \nPresident is putting in place are making it more expensive and more \ndifficult to create jobs. Obviously, one of those policies that is \nhaving a profound impact on the economy is the President's health care \nlaw, which we refer to as ObamaCare. Since that bill was debated, going \nway back many years ago in the committees in the House and the Senate, \na number of my colleagues and I have been raising concerns about the \nimpact it would have.\n  For 4 years we have warned about the negative effects, such as \nincreased premiums, which we are now saying is actually the case, \nreductions in jobs, fewer jobs. We have fewer jobs being created out \nthere. More and more businesses are saying the reason they are not \nhiring people, the reason they are reducing their workforce is because \nof the mandates, the requirements, the uncertainty associated with \nObamaCare.\n  People are losing access to health care that they like and were \npromised they would be able to keep, but for 4 years this President and \nhis administration have looked the other way. Today, it seems that even \nthe organizations that strongly supported the health care changes are \ncoming to terms with their impact.\n  In fact, in 2009, the Cleveland Clinic hosted President Obama during \nthe height of his sales pitch to the American people. That same \nCleveland Clinic last week announced plans to cut some of its 44,000 \nemployees because of ObamaCare. The Cleveland Clinic is the largest \nemployer in Cleveland and the second largest employer in Ohio. They are \nthe premier hospital and medical research center that is now paying for \nthe consequences of ObamaCare.\n  The Cleveland Clinic is not the only company cutting jobs or wages in \norder to deal with increased costs due to ObamaCare. According to \nInvestors Business Daily, more than 250 employers have cut jobs or \nslashed hours as a direct result of ObamaCare's high costs and job-\nkilling regulations.\n  That should not come as any surprise, when a 2,700-page law has \nalready yielded 20,000 pages of regulations. Democrats overpromised on \nObamaCare. Now their signature piece of legislation is underdelivering. \nIt turns out, if you like your health care plan, you do not necessarily \nget to keep it--just ask the employees at GE or at IBM or at UPS or at \nWalgreens or at Home Depot.\n  Not only has ObamaCare failed to make health care more affordable, \nbut family premiums have actually jumped by more than $2,500 since \nObamaCare became law. According to the Chamber of Commerce, nearly \nthree in four small businesses plan to fire workers or cut hours as a \nresult of ObamaCare.\n  All of these negative effects are shaping public opinion of this law. \nObamaCare continues to be a gut punch to middle-class families who are \nalready struggling and public opinion is at an alltime low.\n  In a recent NBC-Wall Street Journal poll, 12 percent of Americans \nbelieve the Democrat's signature law will have a positive effect on \ntheir families. According to a recent CNN-ORC International poll, \nnearly 60 percent of Americans now say they oppose ObamaCare, which is \nup 17 percent since January.\n  Americans are opposing this law for good reasons. There is a CMS \nActuary report that says: Health care costs are going to rise by $621 \nbillion. Just yesterday, Forbes published an article. The title of the \narticle was ``ObamaCare Will Increase Health Spending By $7,450 For A \nTypical Family of Four.''\n  By taking information from the nonpartisan Medicare Actuary report \nwhich was published last week, Forbes concluded that ObamaCare will \nboost health care spending by roughly $621 billion above amounts that \nwould been spent without the law.\n  By spreading across all American families, the increase in health \ncare spending between 2014 and 2022 will amount to $7,450 per family of \nfour.\n  Juxtapose that against President Obama's promise that premiums will \ngo down by $2,500 per family.\n  A critical component of the health care law is the exchanges, which \nare scheduled to open for enrollment a mere 7 days from today. Yet it \nappears the administration is unprepared, yet again.\n  In fact, recently the Congressional Research Service reviewed the \nadministration's missed deadlines during the first 3 years of the \nhealth care law's implementation. As of May 31, the administration has \nfailed to meet a total of 41 out of 82, 50 percent--41 out of 82, 50 \npercent--of the law's deadlines. So it should be no surprise these \nexchanges aren't ready, which I find particularly concerning given the \namount of personal information Americans will be required to provide to \nthe government in order to apply for ObamaCare coverage through the \nexchanges. Personal data such as Social Security numbers, household \nincome, and other tax return information will be entered into a Federal \ndata services hub.\n  CMS recently signed a $1.2 billion contract with a British company to \nsort and evaluate exchange applications containing personal financial \ndata. According to the New York Times, the company ``has little \nexperience with the Department of Health and Human Services or the \ninsurance marketplaces.'' Last year, congressional hearings uncovered \nthat the company exposed more than 120,000 Federal Thrift Savings Plan \nenrollees to identity theft when personal financial data, including \nSocial Security numbers, was stolen from a compromised computer. This \nis not exactly a track record that inspires confidence.\n\n[[Page S6693]]\n\n  Only last week the Wall Street Journal reported a pricing glitch is \naffecting rollout of the exchange. This pricing glitch is producing \nwrong pricing information. To me, this is further evidence ObamaCare is \nnot ready for prime time. Unfortunately for the American people, when \nit comes to ObamaCare, the worst is yet to come.\n  I would argue that it is time to give the economy--the American \neconomy, middle-class families, middle-class workers--a break by \npermanently delaying the law for all Americans, not just a select few \nsuch as some of the waivers the President gives to his favorite \nconstituencies but for all Americans so they are not subject to the \nharmful impact and harmful effects of this law.\n  ObamaCare is not the only one of President Obama's policies that is \nhurting the middle class. President Obama's war on affordable energy is \nalso driving up energy costs and destroying jobs. During his first \nPresidential campaign, the President promised that under his energy \npolicies, ``electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.'' Maybe \npeople remember that statement, but he said ``electricity rates would \nnecessarily skyrocket'' if he were elected President. Unlike his \ncampaign promises to lower health care premiums and allow families to \nkeep their health care plans, this is one promise the President has \nkept.\n  Last week the administration rolled out a new energy tax that will \nslash jobs, restrict access to abundant domestic energy, and make \nelectricity rates skyrocket. When combined with other EPA regulations, \nthe President's policies will destroy more than 500,000 jobs, cause a \nfamily to lose more than $1,000 in annual income, and increase \nelectricity prices by 20 percent.\n  These burdens hit lower and middle-income families the hardest. These \nfamilies pay a much higher percentage of their income on energy costs. \nForcing these families to pay an additional $1,000 in energy costs each \nyear reduces what they have available to buy a home, pay for their \nchildren's education, or simply make ends meet each month.\n  Even union laborers have expressed concern that the new energy tax is \ngoing to have a harmful impact on them and on their families. The head \nof the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers said the tax \nwill ``threaten economic growth and America's energy future.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the IBEW \narticle.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [From the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Sept. 23, \n                                 2013]\n\n         EPA Coal Rule Threatens Energy Independence, Says IBEW\n\n       International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers President \n     Edwin D. Hill issued the following statement today:\n       ``The draft regulations issued by the Environmental \n     Protection Agency regarding emissions from newly-constructed \n     power plants threaten economic growth and America's energy \n     future.\n       ``The new rules would in effect stop the construction of \n     new coal-fired power plants in the United States by enforcing \n     emission-reduction goals that just aren't realistic using \n     today's technology for carbon capture and sequestration.\n       ``The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers \n     remains strong supporters of clean coal technology and \n     federal and industry investment to make it a realistic option \n     for the energy industry. But in mandating new coal plants use \n     technology that is not even commercially available or \n     affordable, the EPA is unfairly singling out the coal \n     industry and setting back efforts to grow the economy and \n     promote energy independence.\n       ``This means higher electricity bills for consumers and \n     layoffs and economic slowdown for tens of thousands of \n     working families that rely on the coal industry for \n     employment.\n       ``The EPA itself has estimated that mandating carbon \n     capture and storage technology that still has not been deemed \n     commercially viable would raise the cost of electricity by 80 \n     percent.\n       ``President Obama has always said he supports an `all-of-\n     the-above' energy policy that values a diverse energy \n     portfolio, including coal. But by effectively banning the \n     construction of new coal-fired plants, the EPA is forcing \n     America into heavy reliance on the volatile natural gas \n     market, abandoning our nation's largest fossil fuel base and \n     large parts of coal-producing America along with it.\n       ``Strong job growth and energy independence cannot be \n     achieved without coal, a key part of our energy mix.''\n\n  Mr. THUNE. The middle class has been hit hard by the Obama economy. \nUnemployment remains above 7 percent. Middle-class incomes have fallen, \nas I said, by over $3,000 since the President took office. \nUnfortunately, the President's health care and energy policies not only \ndestroy jobs but hit the middle class with higher health care and \nhigher energy costs. It is time for Congress to act as a check to the \nPresident's agenda and to stop these policies before more hard-working \nfamilies are further harmed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, until ObamaCare was passed in 2010, \nvirtually every major piece of legislation involving domestic reforms \nin this country has passed with solid bipartisan support, from Social \nSecurity to welfare reform. From Medicare to tax reform, from civil \nrights to No Child Left Behind, Presidents as different across the \nideological spectrum as Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, George W. \nBush, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton all understood there is more to \nmaking sure that legislation succeeds than just jamming it through on a \npartisan-line vote. Indeed, after the bill passes and it needs to be \nimplemented, aren't you going to need that same kind of bipartisan \nsupport to see that the legislation is actually implemented and \nactually works for the benefit of the American people?\n  By contrast, during the health care debate in 2009 and 2010, \nPresident Obama did not seek any kind of genuine compromise with \nRepublicans. Instead, he chose to ram it through on a controversial \nparty-line vote which has generated nothing but division and bitterness \nsince this legislation was first passed.\n  Four and a half years later, ObamaCare is more unpopular than ever. \nOne recent poll showed that 68 percent of American voters, including a \nmajority of Democrats, are concerned about how the law will affect \ntheir health care coverage. Medicare recipients are worried about \nlosing access to their current doctors. Middle-class families are \nworried about losing their existing insurance coverage. Young people \nare worried about seeing their premiums skyrocket. People on Medicaid \nare worried that America's health care safety net is going to become \neven less effective at protecting the neediest and most vulnerable \nmembers of our society.\n  Day after day, not a day passes that we don't read stories about \ndoctors who are dropping patients because of ObamaCare or employers who \nare ending the existing health care coverage their employees have \nbecause of ObamaCare or businesses that are slashing full-time work \ninto part-time work because of ObamaCare. States are projecting a spike \nin the insurance premiums their people will pay, because of ObamaCare, \nin the individual market.\n  Even the New York Times is now acknowledging that because of \nObamaCare ``many insurers are significantly limiting the choice of \ndoctors and hospitals available to consumers.'' Rather than expanded \naccess to coverage, consumers are finding their choices are even more \nlimited under ObamaCare.\n  The President's own Department of Health and Human Services has \nestimated that America already has a massive shortage of primary care \ndoctors. Indeed, just to meet current needs, we will have to add more \nthan 15,000. As a senior official at the American Academy of Family \nPhysicians recently told Bloomberg News, ``The shortfall of primary-\ncare access is not an insignificant problem, and it is going to get \nworse.''\n  That is bad news for all Americans, and it is especially bad news for \nMedicaid beneficiaries who already have a hard time finding providers \nwho will accept their insurance. In my home State, 62 percent of \nprimary care physicians aren't in a position to take any new Medicaid \npatients. This is because Medicaid pays them at a fraction of what \nprivate health insurance or even Medicare pays. So many doctors simply \ncan't afford to see new Medicaid patients. Here you have the irony, the \nterrible irony, of a promise of coverage but no real access to a \ndoctor.\n  Most physicians in Texas believe Medicaid is broken and should not be\n\n[[Page S6694]]\n\nused as a mechanism to expand coverage but, rather, as a last-resort \nsafety net program. Unfortunately, by dumping millions of additional \nAmericans into Medicaid without fixing it, ObamaCare will make our \nhealth care safety net even more fragile and even weaker.\n  Meanwhile, the President's health care law continues to discourage \njob creation and hamper our economic recovery. If there is one thing we \nneed more than anything else in this country, it is a stronger economy, \nbecause greater economic growth means more jobs and more opportunity. \nThen the people who have simply given up looking for work because the \neconomy is growing too slowly will begin to find work again.\n  As of last week more than 300 different employers had, according to \nInvestor's Business Daily, ``cut work hours or jobs, or otherwise \nshifted away from full-time to part-time staff because of ObamaCare.''\n  The administration seems to realize this.\n  Particularly, the employer mandate is discouraging job creation and \nprompting many businesses to turn full-time jobs into part-time jobs. \nIt is just common sense. ObamaCare gives businesses a powerful \nfinancial incentive to not hire more than 49 workers. What else did we \nthink would happen? If you hire more than 49 workers, you have to pay a \npenalty, but if you are underneath that cap you don't.\n  In early July the administration unilaterally delayed enforcement of \nthe employer mandate, recognizing this phenomenon of full-time work \nshifting to part-time work.\n  On the very same day it also announced it would not be verifying \ntaxpayer eligibility for ObamaCare premium subsidies until 2015, even \nthough the subsidies will begin flowing in 2014. What this means is \npeople will qualify for taxpayer subsidies for their health care even \nthough the Federal Government will not be verifying that information \nfor a year. What do we expect to happen? I think one reasonable \nprediction is there will be massive fraud in the program.\n  Of course, we know the President again tried to go it alone and do \nthis unilaterally without congressional action and, of course, without \nconstitutional authority. If there is one question my constituents ask \nme back in Texas, it is how can the President keep ignoring the law? \nHow can he keep issuing waivers or delaying the implementation of laws \nCongress has passed? My only answer to them is Congress could pass the \nlaws, but the Constitution gives the President the authority--the sole \nauthority in the executive branch--the sole authority to enforce them.\n  When the Attorney General and the executive branch refuse to enforce \nthe laws, their only remedy is at the ballot box and possibly lawsuits \nfiled by outside groups that may take many years to be resolved. It is \nenormously frustrating to them, and they worry that our whole \nconstitutional framework is being undermined by the administration and \nthis White House selectively deciding which laws it is going to enforce \nand which it is not.\n  The President is basically saying ObamaCare means whatever I want it \nto be. He is showing contempt for the rule of law, contempt for the \nseparation of powers, and our constitutional framework.\n  Look at the IRS. America's tax collection agency is in shambles due \nto the scandals that we all know way too much about. Unfortunately, \nthis same organization is going to be the one that actually helps to \nimplement ObamaCare. It will issue tax subsidies through the Federal \nexchanges, even though the law makes clear that only State exchanges \nqualify for these subsidies.\n  Americans are concerned also about how ObamaCare will affect their \nprivacy rights. After all, the health care exchanges are scheduled to \nopen exactly 1 week from today, but there hasn't been adequate time to \neven test the data security system.\n  Meanwhile, according to the Wall Street Journal, the government's \nsoftware can't reliably determine how much people need to pay for \ncoverage--not quite ready for prime time.\n  Finally, there is the issue of fraud. I mentioned that a moment ago. \nThe ObamaCare subsidies start next year, but the government won't \nactually be verifying it until 2015. In other words, the President is \neffectively inviting people to game the system without fear of \nconsequences.\n  Mr. President, the only way to effectively stop ObamaCare is to \ndismantle it entirely. That is why I strongly support the House bill \nthat would defund ObamaCare and save the American people from this \npublic policy train wreck. My colleagues stand ready to work with the \nPresident on smart patient-centered health care reforms that will \nactually reduce costs and improve access, but we refuse to help him \nsalvage a law that has proven to be so unaffordable, unworkable, and so \ncompletely at odds with what the American people were told the law \nwould do when this bill was passed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, this morning, upon coming in, I found \nthis morning's copy of Politico with the front-page headline: \n``ObamaCare: One Blow After Another,'' with a picture of a pill bottle \nthat says: ``Promises vs. Reality.''\n  I am going to read a little bit of the way this article begins.\n\n       The ObamaCare that consumers will finally be able to sign \n     up for next week is a long way from the health plan President \n     Obama first pitched to the Nation. Millions of low-income \n     Americans won't receive coverage. Many workers at small \n     businesses won't get a choice of insurance plans right away. \n     Large employers won't need to provide insurance for another \n     year. Far more States than expected won't run their own \n     insurance marketplaces. And a growing number of workers won't \n     get to keep their employer-provided coverage.\n\n  What is the President going to do about it? He made all the pitches, \nhe made all the promises, and the American people have found out it is \nnot true. So today President Obama is going to turn one more time to \nhis so-called ``secretary of explaining stuff'' to sell his health care \nlaw. The President and former President Bill Clinton will be holding a \npep rally attempting to convince people to sign up for health insurance \nin the new exchanges that open 1 week from today.\n  This health care law was supposed to be the signature achievement of \nthe Obama Presidency. Why does the President need to call for backup to \nexplain it? It was supposed to be overwhelmingly popular by now. Why \ndoes the Obama administration need reinforcements to sell it? Maybe \nbecause there are new polls out every day showing the new law is more \nunpopular than ever. In an NBC poll, only 31 percent of people said the \nPresident's health care law was a good idea. CNN found 57 percent \nopposed most or all of the proposals in the law.\n  Washington Democrats have been spinning their hardest but the \nAmerican people know the health care law is unaffordable, it is \nunworkable, and it is very unpopular.\n  The last time Bill Clinton took to the stage to sell the health care \nlaw was about 3 weeks ago. This was the Washington Post headline on \nthat speech. It said: ``Clinton on Stump for Health Care Law: Obama has \ndispatched ex-president to drum up support as crucial stage nears.''\n  Bill Clinton spoke for 50 minutes. He repeated a lot of the same old \nbroken promises about what the law will do. He also gave the same old \ntired excuses for why it will fall short. He said there might be some \nglitches, there might be some unanticipated issues, but he said there \nwere simple fixes to all of these. In 50 minutes--nearly an hour of \ntalking--what Bill Clinton didn't do was honestly and seriously talk \nabout the real problems with the Obama health care law. He never spoke \ndirectly to the American people who will be hurt by the law.\n  So when Bill Clinton takes to the stage again today I hope he will \nfinally talk to some of those folks. For starters, he should speak to \nthe workers who have had their work hours cut because of the law. It is \na direct hit to their paychecks. It is happening all across the \ncountry. Many towns, counties, and school districts have had to cut \nback the hours of their workers. They need to keep more employees at a \npart-time status to reduce the burdens and the expenses of the health \ncare law. They are limiting the hours they can pay bus drivers, \nlibrarians, coaches, substitute teachers, and other middle-class \nworkers.\n\n[[Page S6695]]\n\n  More than 250 different employers across the country have had to take \nsteps to reduce the burden of the President's health care law. \nPresident Obama owes part-time workers an explanation and he owes them \nan apology. And if he won't do it, Bill Clinton should.\n  The last time he spoke, President Clinton failed to mention the \nserious economic consequences of the law. The Obama administration did \nthe same thing. They said there was only anecdotal evidence. Well, the \nheads of three major labor unions happen to disagree with the \nPresident. They sent out a letter recently to Democrats in Congress \nwarning about the damage the health care law is doing to their care and \nto their paychecks. They wrote this, saying the health care law--\n\n       . . . will shatter not only our hard-earned health \n     benefits, but destroy the foundation of the 40-hour workweek \n     that is the backbone of the American middle class.\n\n  Even the President's strongest supporters are being hurt by his \nhealth care law. They are getting hit in their paychecks and they are \ngetting hit hard. I believe President Obama owes union members an \nexplanation. And if he won't do it, Bill Clinton should.\n  Those union leaders are also upset that a lot of the generous health \ncare plans they have had will have to be cut because of the law. They \nsaid the unintended consequences of the health care law are severe, and \n``perverse incentives are already creating nightmare scenarios.'' That \nis from the unions.\n  But it is not just the unions. Walgreen's, Home Depot, IBM, Sears, \nDarden Restaurants--one company after another has had to make changes \nto their insurance plans under the Obama health care law. President \nObama owes those middle-class workers an explanation and he owes them \nan apology. And if he won't do it, today Bill Clinton should.\n  The next group President Clinton should talk to are the spouses who \nare losing their insurance coverage. The University of Virginia \nrecently announced plans to drop spousal coverage for some of its \nemployees. The school said it was the President's health care law, and \nthat it would add $7.3 million to the cost of its health plan in 2014.\n  In a recent memo to employees, the shipping company UPS said it also \nplans to exclude 15,000 spouses from its insurance plan. The company, \nof course, cited the health care law as the top reason for this switch. \nIt said the increased expenses and the government mandates have made it \ntoo difficult to keep offering the benefit. So just as the University \nof Virginia, if a worker's husband or wife can get insurance from their \nother employer, then UPS won't be covering them.\n\n  President Obama owes those spouses an explanation. And if he won't do \nit, Bill Clinton should.\n  Finally, I hope President Clinton will be honest and speak directly \nto the young people who are going to see their insurance premiums \nskyrocket. The health care law needs healthy young people to sign up \nfor these exchanges in record numbers or the whole thing will collapse. \nThat is what is at stake for the Obama administration. So they are \nspending millions of dollars in advertising to convince young healthy \npeople to buy expensive Washington-approved insurance.\n  The Los Angeles Times ran a headline over the weekend: ``Hollywood \nplays key role for health law: White House counts on the entertainment \nindustry to promote its plan, especially to young people.''\n  Hollywood celebrities and Bill Clinton are trying to convince young \npeople to sign up. Many of those young people will be paying more, they \nwill be buying coverage they may not need, and that might not be right \nfor them. But they have to do it. They have to do it to help subsidize \ninsurance for older individuals.\n  This is happening at the same time these young people can't find a \njob--can't get full-time work. Why? Well, a lot of that is due to the \nperverse incentives of the health care law. President Obama owes those \nyoung people an explanation and an apology. And if he won't do it, Bill \nClinton should.\n  The American people deserve more than sound bites and talking points \nand excuses. They deserve better than what they have gotten under this \nterrible health care law. A few months ago the White House saw its \nemployer mandate was a bad idea, so they delayed the mandate for 1 \nyear. Republicans think all Americans deserve a delay.\n  There are real problems with this health care law and there are a lot \nof unanswered questions, a lot of unintended consequences, and a lot of \nways the new health care law can do more harm than good for middle-\nclass Americans. We should delay the law permanently and work out a \nbetter replacement that actually reforms health care the right way. The \nAmerican people wanted health care reform. They wanted the care they \nneed from a doctor they choose at a lower cost. But as the polls are \nshowing, the American people know the Obama health care law didn't give \nthem what they asked for.\n  President Obama failed to keep his promises and he has failed at \nchanging the public's opinion. So now he is going to be Bill Clinton's \nwarmup act in a last-ditch sales job. Well, what former President \nClinton should do is talk to the American people, whom President Obama \nhas ignored.\n  You only have to look at yesterday's New York Times front page: \n``Lower Premiums To Come At Cost Of Fewer Choices. Impact Of Health \nCare Law. In New Plans, Insurers Often Leave Out Many Providers.''\n  The President said: If you like what you have, you can keep it. If \nyou like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\n  Even the California plan the President touts, when we look at what is \noffered there in the insurance exchanges, the new network for thousands \nand thousands of people, tens of thousands of doctors across the State, \nit does not include the five medical centers of the University of \nCalifornia or the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center near Beverly Hills.\n  There is a furor in New Hampshire regarding the exclusion of 10 of \nthe State's 26 hospitals from health plans that it will sell through \nthe insurance exchange.\n  I think it is time for the President to admit the health care law is \nterribly flawed. Promise after promise has been broken, and it is time \nfor Democrats and Republicans to work together to give the American \npublic the care they need and deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/24/senate-section/article/S6695-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6695-S6697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HURTING MIDDLE CLASS\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I want to make a few points this morning \nand say what I think is on the minds of many Americans.\n  There is a reason why the favorability rating of Congress is at 10 \npercent or less, and that is because the middle class of this country--\nthe vast majority of our people--is hurting. They are worried about \nwhat kind of future their kids are going to have, and they look at \nWashington and they ask: What is going on?\n  Our Republican friends in the House on 42 separate occasions \nattempted to defund ObamaCare. And on 42 separate occasions, they \nfailed. There was a Presidential election in which this issue of \nwhether we expand health care to another 20 million Americans--whether \nwe end the obscenity of preexisting conditions, where people who have \nhad serious health problems are denied health care; whether we make \nsure kids 26 years of age or younger are on their parents' health \ninsurance plan, whether we do more for disease prevention, et cetera--\nwas debated very heavily. Guess what. The Republican candidate who \nwanted to defund ObamaCare lost that election. Now, quite incredibly, \nwhat the Republicans are saying is: Yes, we failed 42 times, we lost \nthe Presidential election, but now we are prepared to shut down the \nentire government unless we end this legislation.\n  Well, that is not going to happen. They are not going to end \nObamaCare. Surely we need to improve it. I myself believe we need a \nMedicare-for-all single-payer program. And let us discuss how we can \nimprove the program, how we can join the rest of the industrialized \nworld in guaranteeing health care to all people as a right of \ncitizenship, and how we end the absurdity in this country of spending \ntwice as much per person on health care as do the people of any other \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S6696]]\n\n  My Republican friends have nothing to offer on this issue. We have 48 \nmillion Americans with no health insurance. What are the Republican \nideas? They do not exist.\n  The point here is that no matter what your view may be about \nObamaCare, it is incredibly irresponsible and reckless, and makes this \ncountry look incredibly foolish to the rest of the world, that they are \nprepared to shut down the government unless they get their way on this \nissue. But most importantly, all over America, while people are \nstruggling, they are seeing this absurd debate about Republican efforts \nto shut down the government unless they defund ObamaCare.\n  People are saying: What about us? While you have this silly political \nfight, what are you doing to improve our lives, what are you doing to \naddress the fundamental economic realities in this country, which is \nthat the middle class of this great country is disappearing, more \npeople are now living in poverty than at any time in history--46\\1/2\\ \nmillion--and the gap between the very wealthy and everybody else is \ngrowing wider.\n  We have this unbelievable economic situation where, while the vast \nmajority of Americans have seen a decline in their standard of living, \npeople on top are doing phenomenally well.\n  A report that came out last week from the Census Bureau quite \nincredibly tells us that in terms of median family income, that family \nright in the middle of American society now is earning less income than \nthey did 24 years ago. Despite all of the increases in productivity, \ndespite all of the new technology, that family in the middle is earning \nless income than 24 years ago. A typical middle-class family has seen \nits income go down by more than $5,000 since 1999 after adjusting for \ninflation. The average male worker earned $283 less last year than he \ndid 44 years ago. The average female worker earned $1,700 less last \nyear than she did in 2007. Meanwhile, people on the top do incredibly \nwell. Between 2009 and 2012, 95 percent of all new income went to the \ntop 1 percent, and we now have by far the most unequal distribution of \nwealth and income of any major country on Earth.\n  We have a middle class that is disappearing, poverty is very high, \nand people on top are doing phenomenally well, 48 million Americans \nwithout any health insurance. The Republican solution to this plan is \nto bring down the government unless they can defund ObamaCare.\n  I think it is important for the American people to understand--and it \nis not discussed enough on the floor of the Senate or in the media--\nwhat the long-term plan of the Republican Party is. Is it simply to \ndefund ObamaCare? No, it is not. Is it simply to shut down the \ngovernment? No, it is not. It is important to understand what this \nrightwing, extremist ideology is all about and to have a serious \ndiscussion as to whether the American people want to go forward in that \ndirection, which is a lot more than just defunding ObamaCare or \nshutting down the government.\n  The Texas Republican Party every year publishes a platform. What is \ninteresting about it is not just that Texas is a very large \nconservative State, but the ideas that emanate from Texas often become \nmainstream in the Republican Party a few years later. I think it is \nimportant to understand what, long-term, the Republican Party wants to \ndo. Let me tell you some of the positions that were in the Republican \nParty platform in 2012, so we understand that what is being discussed--\nsome cuts in Social Security, voucherization of Medicare, massive cuts \nin food stamps--is not the endgame. That is the beginning of the game. \nThis is from the 2012 Texas Republican Party platform.\n\n       We support an immediate and orderly transition to a system \n     of private pensions based on the concept of individual \n     retirement accounts and gradually phasing out the Social \n     Security tax.\n\n  I give them credit for being upfront and straightforward about the \nissue that is ending Social Security. That is it. Social Security has \nbeen the most effective and successful program in modern American \nhistory. It has taken tens of millions of seniors out of poverty. \nBasically, what the Texas Republican Party is saying is, We don't want \nto just cut Social Security, we want to end it. If you are old, what \nhappens to you when you are 75 years of age and have no income coming, \nthat is not their worry.\n  Furthermore, speaking now as the chairman of the Veterans' Committee, \nI want every veteran in America to understand long-term goals. This is \nfrom the 2012 Texas Republican Party platform: ``We support the \nprivatization of veteran's healthcare.''\n  In other words, we have some 6 million veterans who are receiving \ngood, quality health care at the VA. I myself think we should expand \nthe program. There are at least 1 million veterans out there who are \nuninsured right now who could utilize VA health care. I myself think \nthe eligibility requirements are too stringent. We should bring more \npeople into the system. But our Republican friends in Texas, becoming \nmainstream, want to end veterans health care.\n  Next point:\n\n       We support abolishing all federal agencies whose activities \n     are not specifically enumerated in the Constitution; \n     including the Departments of Education and Energy.\n\n  The vast majority of people in the scientific community who study \nglobal warming think that global warming is a crisis today that is only \ngoing to get worse, and the only way to deal with that issue is having \na concrete policy. They want to abolish the Department of Education. \nMillions of young people all over this country cannot afford the cost \nof college today. Low-income kids, middle-class kids are struggling \neducationally all over this country. They want to abolish the \nDepartment of Education.\n  Furthermore, ``We . . . oppose . . . mandatory kindergarten.'' One of \nthe great crises in this country is childcare and the crisis of early \nchildhood education. Working families in Vermont and all over this \ncountry are having a hard time getting affordable childcare.\n  ``We believe the Environmental Protection Agency should be \nabolished''--not cut but abolished, so we can go back to the days when \ncompanies could throw their garbage into our rivers and streams, \npollute the air, make kids sick, and get away with it with impunity \nbecause there is nobody there saying it is against the law. Nobody can \nenforce the law. They want to abolish the Environmental Protection \nAgency and endanger the health and well-being of kids and Americans all \nover this country.\n  Furthermore, ``We recommend repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment of the \nU.S. Constitution, with the goal of abolishing the I.R.S. and replacing \nit with a national sales tax collected by the States.''\n  What does that mean? It means the ending of any form of progressive \ntaxation. As I pointed out earlier, the wealthiest people in this \ncountry are doing phenomenally well. The middle class is disappearing. \nWhat that means is we end the ability to ask the wealthiest people in \nthis country to start paying their fair share of taxes. We put the tax \nburden on the middle class and working families--so lower taxes for the \nrich, raise it for the middle class and working families.\n\n  ``We favor abolishing the capital gains tax [and the estate tax].'' \nThe estate tax applies to the very richest people in this country. Why \nnot abolish it and put the burden of taxation on working families?\n  Here is one that I think many Americans don't appreciate where they \nare coming from. I hope very much that this Congress will begin to \naddress the huge crisis facing tens of millions of workers who are \nworking for starvation wages. The bottom line is that one of the \nreasons poverty in America is increasing is that people can't make it \non $7.25, $8, $9 an hour. We have to raise the minimum wage. It is now \n$7.25 nationally. We have to raise the minimum wage to a living wage.\n  There can be an honest debate about how much higher the minimum wage \nshould go. I understand it. I think California has recently raised it \nto $10 an hour. The State of Washington has it higher. My own State of \nVermont has it higher. We can have that debate. But this is what \neverybody in America should understand: In terms of debate with my \nRepublican colleagues, that debate will not be how high we raise the \nminimum wage above $7.25. This is what the Texas Republican Party \nplatform in 2012 says: ``We believe the minimum wage should be \nrepealed.'' It\n\n[[Page S6697]]\n\nturns out that more and more of my colleagues in the Senate have been \nupfront about that.\n  What does that mean in the real world? What it means in those areas \nof our country where unemployment is extremely high and there is going \nto be a lot of competition for jobs, what employers will say is: Do you \nwant to work? We are going to give you $3.50 an hour. If you don't want \nthat, I have that person over there who is prepared to take that job \nbecause I have a line of people out there who are unemployed who are \nprepared to work for any wage--and we no longer are going to have a \nfloor on wages in America. That is what the Texas Republican Party \nbelieves. That is what more and more of my colleagues believe.\n  The point I am making this morning is that the fight we are having \nright now over shutting down the government, the debate I am sure will \nensue shortly after about whether we raise the debt ceiling and \nwhether, for the first time in the history of the United States, we \ndon't pay our bills, causing not only a national financial crisis but \nan international financial crisis--all of these issues are related to \nsomething that is much larger; that is, the transformation of American \nsociety in a radically different way than it is today. Almost without \nexception, what my Republican colleagues want to do now is take us back \ninto the 1920s, where working people had virtually no protection at all \non the job, no minimum wage, no job safety protection, where Social \nSecurity didn't exist, where Medicare didn't exist, so that if you were \nold and you got sick, your future was not very bright. If you were poor \nand you got sick, you had nothing. They want to take us back to a time \nwhen a handful of corporations and wealthy people controlled the \neconomic and political life of this Nation.\n  I do not believe that is where the American people want to go. I \nbelieve the American people want us to start focusing on issues of \nrelevance to them; that is, the understanding that we need to create \nmillions of decent-paying jobs by, among other approaches, rebuilding \nour crumbling infrastructure, the need to create jobs by making this \ncountry more energy efficient, so we can lower fuel bills and cut back \non greenhouse gas emissions. What the American people want us to do is \nfocus on the crisis of low wages in this country, to raise the minimum \nwage. They want us to make college education more affordable. They want \nus to end these horrendous loopholes that enable major multinational \ncorporations to, in some cases, pay nothing in Federal taxes.\n  I think the time is long overdue for this Congress to start \nrepresenting the working families of this country, the middle class of \nthis country, and not simply wealthy campaign contributors.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Todd M. \nHughes, of the District of Columbia, to be United States Circuit Judge \nfor the Federal Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes for debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Continuing Resolution\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, as we debate legislation to keep the \ngovernment running, we should not be debating a budget number that is \nhigher than the Budget Control Act asks for. Frankly, this is a \nstatement that should not have to be said here on the Senate floor. Why \nwould we even begin to consider a budget number that is some $20 \nbillion higher than the Budget Control Act? Have we somehow become \nflush with cash? I don't think so. Did we decide the way to run the \ncountry is to increase spending for a few months, only to have the \nsequester kick in, in January? Who are we kidding?\n  We are not kidding most Americans. They justifiably wonder what we \nare doing. Once again we find ourselves on the brink of a showdown and \na shutdown. It is the same old story but amid the back-and-forth \nbetween the two sides of the aisle, Americans do not see Congress \ngetting serious about Federal spending. We failed to pass even 1 of the \n12 spending bills to responsibly fund the government for the fiscal \nyear that starts in a few days. Had we taken up these bills in regular \norder, Members would have had the opportunity to review and consider \nour spending priorities. That is what people expect us to do here. \nInstead, we have procrastinated and put off the hard decisions like a \nbunch of teenagers putting off the pain of a term paper, but this has \nmore serious consequences.\n  Over the past several months the Senate could have voted on these \nbills, setting spending priorities while abiding by the $967 billion \nbudget cap for the next year. Instead, we chose to go through the \nmotions of preparing spending bills as if no spending limit existed, \nwith the knowledge that these bills would never see the light of day. \nNow as we quickly approach the 1st of October, we are faced with either \npassing the continuing resolution with a pricetag of $986 billion, $19 \nbillion more than the law allows, or risking a government shutdown.\n  The Senate should at the very least take up a spending resolution \nthat respects the realities we face, one that respects the Budget \nControl Act, one that funds government at the $967 billion level for \nnext year.\n  If we pass a bill above the limit set by law, we will simply cause \nanother round of sequester cuts in January. I am all for responsible \nsequester replacement legislation that brings down our national debt, \nbut we cannot and should not weaken the law of the land, the Budget \nControl Act, that has locked in real and meaningful cuts in spending.\n  As such, I hope the majority leader allows us to have a vote on a \nfiscally responsible continuing resolution. The majority leader has \nmade clear his intention to amend the continuing resolution to address \nhis concerns. A fair process would include affording other Members the \nsame opportunity.\n  Any process that yields a take-it-or-leave-it approach to funding \ngovernment while ignoring spending caps that are the law of the land \nis, quite simply, irresponsible.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is currently considering the Hughes \nnomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the nomination of Todd Hughes to fill the \njudicial vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, \nwhich is an extremely important court. It is also an important \nmilestone for the court. If confirmed, Mr. Hughes will be the first \nopenly gay judge to serve on the Federal appellate court in our \nNation's history. I am proud that the Senate has finally taken a \nhistoric step to break down another barrier to increase diversity on \nour Federal bench.\n  Mr. Hughes has extensive experience on issues that come before the \nFederal Circuit. He joined the Department of\n\n[[Page S6698]]\n\nJustice in 1994 and, since 2007, has served as Deputy Director for the \nCommercial Litigation Branch of the Civil Division. Mr. Hughes earned \nhis B.A. cum laude from Harvard and his J.D. with honors from Duke Law \nSchool. Upon graduating law school, he served as a law clerk to the \nHonorable Robert Krupansky of the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Sixth Circuit.\n  Mr. Hughes' nomination was reported unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee more than 2 months ago and could--and in my view should--have \nbeen confirmed within days. At a time when judicial vacancies are once \nagain above 90, this kind of needless delay undermines the serious work \nwe have to do to ensure the ability of our Federal courts to provide \njustice to Americans around the country. In addition to Mr. Hughes, we \nhave 13 other Federal circuit and district nominees pending on the \nExecutive Calendar. Of those nominees, 11 were reported by voice vote \nand there is no good reason to not confirm them today.\n  The delays in confirming noncontroversial consensus nominees have a \nreal life impact on the American people and the economy. It does not \nbenefit anyone if litigants have their cases delayed for months and \nmonths because our Federal courts are understaffed. Americans are \nrightly proud of our legal system and the promise of access to justice \nand speedy trials that is embedded in our Constitution.\n  Also critical to the functioning of our courts is doing all we can do \nto alleviate the harmful impact of sequestration. As we debate the \ncontinuing resolution to fund the Federal Government we must look to \nstreamline wherever we can, but we should do so with care and not \nsimply cut indiscriminately across the board. We have the benefit of \nthe greatest justice system in the world for less than 1 percent of our \nentire Federal budget. Yet, we refuse to provide this coequal branch \nwith the adequate resources it needs. Let us work to reverse the \nsenseless cuts to our legal system from sequestration so we can help \nour coequal branch meet the Constitution's promise of justice for all \nAmericans.\n  I congratulate Mr. Hughes on what I expect will be an overwhelming \nvote in support of his confirmation. And I commend President Obama for \nhis continued commitment to nominating highly qualified and diverse \nindividuals.\n\n\n                         Continuing Resolution\n\n  Mr. President, I have another important matter to address.\n  I remember the Bill Murray movie ``Groundhog Day''--a wonderful \nmovie, farcical but nowhere near as farcical as the groundhog day we \nhave once again in Congress. We find ourselves in a funding crisis \nmanufactured by a small, partisan faction. They say they are doing this \nfor the good of the country as they watch people's pension funds and \ntheir savings for the kids' college--not to mention everything else--go \nsouth because of the concern the markets and investors have as they \nwait to see if Congress can get its act together and actually do what \nwe were elected to do.\n  This small group of ideologues continue to turn their backs to \nreality. They insist on their ``my way or the highway'' ultimatums to \nthe rest of the country, which is preventing a bipartisan solution on \nthe funding bill and is leading us to the brink of a government \nshutdown.\n  I love my grandchildren. They range in age from 5 to 15 years old. I \nhave watched them grow up. I saw them on the playground when they were \n1, 2, 3, and 4 years old. Sometimes they would have little squabbles, \nbut they would work it out. This is a playground that would be a \nterrible example to children in a schoolyard. This crisis is again \nartificial and manufactured for political posturing. Even its effects \non the American people as we all again must anticipate a shutdown--are \nas real as they are avoidable. The American public is rightly weary and \nwary of this brinkmanship and of one Made in Congress, manufactured \ncrisis after crisis. This artificially induced uncertainty is harmful \nas well to our American economy, which is still tentatively regaining \nits footing after the great recession.\n  Some could come and posture--in this body or the other body--about \nhow they will shut down the government if they don't have their way \nbecause they have this figured out better than everybody else.\n  They will get their 2 or 3 minutes on television, and they will be \nvery happy that they did. The American people who will see their \nbusinesses close, their stocks go down, their savings dry up, and their \njobs closed off just so someone can get on television, are not thrilled \nabout this, especially when it is all totally unnecessary.\n  The issue that is preventing even a temporary spending bill from \nmaking it to the President's desk is the Affordable Care Act. \nUnfortunately, ever since its enactment, many Republicans in Congress \nhave been determined to derail the law and prevent its implementation. \nThey don't come up with a better idea. They say it is all or nothing. \nThey don't come and say: What are we going to do to help pay for your \nkids' insurance while they are in college? What are we going to do to \nhelp your family if they have a preexisting condition. No, no, no. We \nare just going to say no to everything.\n  Instead of doing the people's business, such as enacting routine \nbudget measures before the end of the fiscal year, the House has voted \nmore than 40 times this year alone to defund this landmark law, the \nAffordable Care Act. They have no interest in fixing problems or making \nit better--only in blowing it up. Even though the President has \npromised to veto a bill that includes this provision and the Senate has \nvoted down similar measures in the past, the law's opponents perceive \nthis short-term spending bill as an opportunity to hold the rest of \nAmerica and all government activities hostage to their ideological \ndemands.\n  They have not come up with one single idea of how they might make it \nbetter. They have not come up with anything. They haven't proposed an \nidea and said: Here is our idea that could be better. No, just get rid \nof it all.\n  Actually, I would remind them that was the position of their \ncandidate for President 1 year ago. He said if he were elected \nPresident, he would do away with it. What did the American people say? \nI recall how that election came out.\n  Let's think about what defunding and repealing the Affordable Care \nAct would really mean: Our country would return to a time when \ninsurance companies could deny coverage because of a preexisting health \ncondition. Benefits would be stripped for those who get sick. And \nseniors would pay more for prescription drugs. Tens of millions \nAmericans are currently without health insurance, but the health \ninsurance marketplaces opening next month will provide access for these \nAmericans to obtain coverage. And while we often hear that this is a \n``job-killing'' bill that is adding trillions of dollars to our \ndeficit, that rhetoric could not be farther from the truth. Repealing \nthe Affordable Care Act would actually add to our deficit, because the \nreforms we put in place more than three years ago are designed to save \nhealth care costs in the long run.\n  Beyond that damage, the House continuing resolution also would \ndrastically affect current Medicare beneficiaries. The House bill would \neliminate free wellness visits, which this year alone have helped 16.5 \nmillion seniors gain access to quality preventative care. The House's \nshort-sighted CR would also stop Medicare prescription drug coverage \nand discounts known as the ``donut hole'' forcing seniors to pay more \nout-of-pocket for their prescription drugs. And sadly, seniors are not \nthe only ones who would be harmed by this cynical House legislation. \nCommunity Health Centers, which provide necessary care to our rural \ncommunities across the Nation and especially in Vermont, would be hit \nwith a 60 percent reduction in Federal funding. Lifesaving nurse \nvisitation programs to help low-income mothers carry healthy babies to \nterm would be eliminated, and more than 92,000 individuals who \ncurrently have coverage under the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan \nProgram would be dropped. The list goes on.\n  The ill-conceived, short-term spending bill passed by the House last \nweek is not the only bill approved by the other body that would deal \nfirm blows to the most vulnerable in the country. After refusing to \nbring a farm bill to the House floor that would garner enough \nbipartisan votes to pass--as the chair of our committee, Senator \nStabenow, did in the Senate, where we had\n\n[[Page S6699]]\n\na bipartisan bill--House leaders took the unprecedented step earlier \nthis year and split food assistance from the other essential programs \nsupported by the farm bill, even though we passed a farm bill that \nwould save $25 to $30 billion.\n\n  After months of delay, last week the House voted on a separate \nnutrition title, which only moves us further away from enacting a farm \nbill before the programs expire on September 30. This latest lurching \nmaneuver means even more uncertainty for farmers.\n  Instead of standing with the millions of Americans who are still \nstruggling to put food on the table--these House Members never have to \ngo hungry, except by choice, because of the huge salaries they make--it \nis regrettable and inexcusable that the House Republicans are turning \nto slashing essential nutrition help for struggling Americans. Ensuring \nthat these programs can continue to serve Vermonters and all Americans \nin need is a key part of enacting a strong farm bill for our country. \nIt is a reality recognized by the bipartisan Senate-passed farm bill.\n  The House cuts SNAP benefits by levels 10 times as high as the \nbipartisan Senate bill and twice as high as the House's original bill. \nThese cuts would mean that each year an average of 3 million people \nwould be kicked off food assistance, even those who are working and \nmaking as little as $2,500 per year. What is worse, the bill will mean \nhundreds of thousands of children will lose access to school meals. Ask \nany teacher, whether in Hawaii, Vermont or in any other State, does a \nhungry child learn? Of course not.\n  These school meals are an investment in our future and an investment \nin our children. Having young people who are able to learn is an \ninvestment in the future of the U.S. economy. So what do we say? Oh, \nno, we are not going to feed them. This is a country that spends \nbillions of dollars just to get rid of excess food and on needless diet \nprograms, but we cannot feed children in school. It is shameful. It is \nmean-spirited, shortsighted, and it hurts America.\n  If that were not enough, the House Republicans also assert with their \nbill that 3 months of benefits every 3 years is plenty of time for out-\nof-work Americans to find a job that pays well enough to feed a family. \nGet real. Have they seen what happened to the economy in this country? \nHave they seen what happened as we try to drag ourselves back from the \nhorrible recession they put us into a few years ago? Unfortunately, \nwhen there is only one job for every three unemployed workers. Simply \ntelling out-of-work Americans to get a job is easier said than done. \nSomebody ought to ask them why don't they do their jobs.\n  Times of high unemployment are the very reason we have food \nassistance. These food programs were always carried by Republicans and \nDemocrats who worked together to help Americans get back on their feet. \nDespite the heated rhetoric, our Food Stamp Program is working as \nintended.\n  I was fortunate to come here when we had two men with entirely \ndifferent philosophies. Both men became nominees of their party to run \nfor President, George McGovern and Bob Dole. They worked together to \nfeed the hungry people in this country, especially in the School Lunch \nProgram.\n  The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that the SNAP costs will \nfall over the next several years. As the economy improves and people \nget back to work, those costs will come down. Children who are educated \nwill create jobs.\n  Instead, we have bumper sticker politics--appealing to our worst \ninstincts. It is churlish, childish, and irresponsible. I might also \nsay it is immoral.\n  The House-passed CR and the House so-called farm bill will only \nworsen the gridlock that crippled the Senate since our return from the \nAugust recess. We are elected not to grandstand but to legislate. Let's \nlegislate around here. Members need to stop running to the cameras, \ngetting little sound bites and saying things such as: I am standing up \nfor America, as they do everything to kill the American economy.\n  We were not elected to make the government less efficient. We are \neven unable to make the most basic decisions that the American people \nelected us to make. The American people want us to solve the problems \nnow through fair solutions and through the give-and-take of our elected \ngovernment.\n  I appreciate the fact that the people of my State--Republicans and \nDemocrats together--give me the honor of serving here. I have become \nthe longest serving Senator from our State and also the longest serving \nSenator in this body. I have seen Republicans and Democrats work \ntogether on these problems. I have seen people in the past do that. I \nknow it can be done but not when a tiny minority says: We are the only \nones who know what to do, and we will make the decision. No. We have \ngood men and women from both parties in the House and Senate. Let's \nstop the bumper sticker politics. Let's get back to work and do things \nthe way they should be done. There is still time to show the American \npeople that we know why we were sent here and that Congress can still \ndo the work of the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on the Hughes nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Todd M.

The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, as the chair of the Appropriations \nCommittee, I rise to oppose the continuing resolution the House passed \nlast week\n\n[[Page S6700]]\n\non a party-line vote of 230 to 189. On behalf of all of the people of \nMaryland and all of the people of the United States, I am so \nfrustrated; they should have a government that they can count on to \noperate, that they could count on to work as hard as they do; they \nshould be able to count on having the government they pay for. However, \nwhat we have here is a manufactured crisis, with histrionics and \ntheatrical politics attempting to bring us to the brink of a shutdown. \nIt is shutdown, slam-down politics.\n  The CR that was sent over to us is loaded with political ideology. \nWhat does it do? First it wants to defund the President's Affordable \nCare Act and take health care away from those who need it. It also is \ndesigned to create a crisis over the debt ceiling and undermine the \nfull faith and credit of the United States. Our President has been \nclear that he will veto any bill with these toxic political riders. He \nis right, and we will support him.\n  Much will be said in the media over the next several days about \nsomething called the continuing resolution. Well, here we go again \nusing Washington-speak that nobody in America understands. Here we go \nwith budget-speak. And the American people are saying: What are they \ntrying to accomplish? Well, let me explain it in a straight-talk way.\n  A continuing resolution is a straightforward, simple act where we \nextend the government's funding beyond October 1 to a date certain. It \nis meant to continue the funding. It is always, historically, meant to \nbe, No. 1, short-term and, No. 2, a stopgap measure as we work on \ngetting final resolution of budgetary and fiscal matters. It is also \ndesigned to keep the U.S. Government open and functioning while we work \nout our difficulties.\n  So that is what a continuing resolution is meant to be. It was never \nmeant to be a vehicle for controversial, provocative, poke-it-in-your-\neye and stick-it-to-you controversial legislation. It was never meant \nto be a negotiating chip for a grander bargain to resolve issues, nor \nwas it ever designed to be a weapon in the fight over the size and role \nof government. That is for the authorizing committee. That is what we \ndo in our appropriations committees at the subcommittee level. That is \nwhat Senator Murray in her Budget Committee worked on when we passed \nthe budget. That is where those fights come in, not at the end of the \nfiscal year.\n  Here we have the same old tricks and techniques we have seen year \nafter year since President Obama was elected. They not only want to \nthrow sand in the gears of the Obama administration, they want to throw \ncement into the gears of the functioning of government. Well, I think \nthat is outrageous.\n  The House continuing resolution is a manufactured crisis driving us \ntoward a shutdown. We have plenty of real crises in our country. How \nabout the crisis of sustained chronic unemployment at 7 percent or \nhigher in many of my communities or in certain sectors, such as \nconstruction, or in the rural parts of my State? There is also a real \ncrisis for those who need health care. There is a real crisis for those \nwho are seeking higher education and can't afford it. And look at our \ncrisis in the foreign policy arena.\n  On the very day the President is speaking at the U.N. to project \nAmerican power, the other side is trying on the Senate floor to make us \npowerless to function. If they want to project American power, they \nshould be willing to show that the greatest parliamentary, deliberative \nbody in the world can be parliamentary and deliberative in solving our \nproblems. If they want to project power, it starts here, showing we can \ngovern ourselves. We start by acting right and focusing on solving real \nproblems with real solutions and getting off of this brinkmanship.\n  The President has said he will veto it, so the riders are veto bait. \nThis is all designed to use a lot of time and a lot of resources. I was \nelected to the Senate to be a legislator, not a prop for a political \nfarce. This is not Gilbert and Sullivan, this is the real deal.\n  The American people are fed up with these manufactured crises, and so \nam I. So let me give my view about where we want to go. And who is the \n``we?'' I believe it is not only the Democrats in the Senate, but I \nbelieve there are pragmatists on both sides of the aisle who want to \nfind a sensible center where we can achieve fiscal stability, begin to \ndraw down our public debt but also have an opportunity to be progrowth \nin our country, where we focus on important issues of national \nsecurity, rebuilding America with infrastructure, rebuilding our human \ninfrastructure in terms of our educational system and also our research \nand development, coming up with the new ideas that will lead to the new \njobs in the new century. The way we want to do this and the way I am \nsuggesting is the way the American people would like us to vote.\n  The other party would like us to have a continuing resolution until \nDecember 15. That is one more gimmick to bring us to Christmas Eve, \nwhere we will have a lot of theatrics and jingle bells-jingle bells \nwhile we try to solve our situation.\n  I want a short-term CR. I would like one between now and November \n15--not long term, not something just to dilly and dither. I am tired \nof dilly and dither. So I suggest a short-term CR for sometime around \nmid-November. The purpose of that would be that we would use that \nopportunity to get to a vote in December that would be on the funding \nof all of our bills, arrived at by a vote here, a conference committee \nwith the House, where our spending would be sensible, it would be \naffordable, it would meet compelling human need, the national security \nissues of the United States, and would rebuild our infrastructure.\n  This isn't hard, but in order to get that, we need to clear out the \ntoxic political items in the CR. So I want a clean CR. A clean CR means \ngetting rid of the political riders of defunding ObamaCare and striking \nthe debt limit rider.\n  Second, we need to have a shorter date. My recommendation would be \naround November 15 because the longer term CR means more autopilot \nfunctioning of government--in other words, more government dysfunction. \nNovember 15 keeps the pressure on both sides of the aisle to get the \njob done.\n  What is getting the job done? First of all, we would like to cancel \nsequester, and we would like to cancel sequester in a balanced way. \nWhat is sequester? We have to come up with about $110 billion in debt \nreduction. We can do that through additional strategic cuts. As an \nappropriator, I am willing to look at them. Secondly, revenue. What \nabout those loopholes Mitt Romney talked about? Let's bring some of \nthose back and examine them. Let's look at some of the items in \nmandatory spending. This is the way we can enact our bills, invest in \nand protect our country.\n\n  Our Nation faces long-term fiscal challenges. It does demand action \nfrom the Congress. But the place for those negotiations is not in a \ncontinuing resolution. It belongs in the Budget Committee. And the six \nRepublican Senators who are planning to filibuster this week are the \nsame ones who threatened and blocked the budget the Senate passed going \nto conference in the House. So they blocked the budget. Then they blame \nus because we don't have a budget. Go figure.\n  The House and Senate Appropriations Committees, the appropriators, \nhave marked up annual funding bills. We are ready to make sure we can \ndo our work, but we need the Budget Committee to give us a top line. We \ncan't get to conference because Republicans have objected. Now they \nwant to have a simple stopgap that leads to a showdown and a shutdown.\n  If we don't come together, we will have very serious consequences. If \nwe do not enact a clean continuing resolution by October 1 that enables \nus to get to a sensible outcome in early December, the government will \nshut down. Doesn't that look great for the United States of America. We \nsay to emerging democracies all over the world, Look at us.\n  We need to show we can govern.\n  It has not only consequences in the way we are viewed in the world; \nit provides uncertainty for business, it will be terrible for our \neconomy, and it will have a direct impact on jobs. Business will not \nknow what the government is going to do and so they don't know what \nthey can do, so they will not be spending to create jobs. All we are \ndoing is creating more chaos.\n  We want to be sure the Small Business Administration approves loans--\nthey need to be open to do that--that rural housing development and \nfarm\n\n[[Page S6701]]\n\nloans are able to go out so we can help where that is needed.\n  We need to make sure crucial lifesaving discoveries at NIH happen. \nRight now if we have a shutdown, people will not be able to be admitted \nto the National Institutes of Health clinical trials and programs \nbecause they don't know if they will be continued.\n  Weather forecasters will be told they are not an essential service.\n  We are now looking at the impact on Federal law enforcement.\n  I could go item by item. I will talk more about these items as time \ngoes on.\n  I will conclude by saying during this last year on both sides of the \naisle the Appropriations Committee has functioned well. I thank not \nonly my subcommittee chairmen--I see Senator Durbin, who chairs the \ndefense subcommittee--but I also wish to thank the Republicans. My vice \nchairman of the committee, Senator Shelby of Alabama, supported me at \nevery step of the process. We functioned with civility, intellectual \nrigor, and open amendments during the committee process. It was \ntransparent. We had ``yes'' votes, we had ``no'' votes. But everybody \nhad their day and everybody had their say. We were able to move our \nprocess forward, although we disagreed sometimes on the funding level \nfor this or the funding level for that. But we came to a conclusion. I \nwish to thank them for their cooperation in the process.\n  Now we are here, where we could take the next step. Yes, we have to \ndebate some of those line items. We do need to debate some of those \nprograms. But we can't move forward unless we resolve the shutdown \nshowdown.\n  Let's pass a continuing resolution that takes us to mid-November. \nLet's make that continuing resolution a clean CR, which means let's get \nrid of the political riders. Our goal in December is that we pass an \nomnibus bill that is affordable, sensible, meets compelling human \nneeds, national security needs, our human infrastructure, and also lays \nthe groundwork for new jobs by funding research and development, at the \nsame time to cancel sequester, because we have arrived at it in a \nbalanced way where, yes, we can make additional strategic cuts, where \nwe also need to look at some of the items of mandatory spending, and \nlet's look at some revenue. I think we can do it.\n  If we want to project American power, the way to do that is right now \nshow that we can govern. Let's not get ourselves into a box where we \nare heading to a showdown. Let's not get ourselves in a situation where \nwe end up with a shutdown. This will not be a way that builds \nconfidence, builds our economy, and makes America continue to be as \nstrong as it can be.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is my understanding that under \nunanimous consent the Senator from Texas is to be recognized, but I ask \nif he would allow me 5 minutes to follow the Senator from Maryland and \nthen yield the floor to him.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Madam President, I stand in support of the statement made by the \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. We have served \ntogether in the House, now in the Senate. I am happy to serve with her \nin the capacity as chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, \nthe largest in dollar amount that has this responsibility.\n  I think what she has spelled out on the floor is very straightforward \nand very honest.\n  We were challenged in the Senate to come up with a budget resolution \nthis year. Many of our critics said, You have come up with excuses; now \ncome up with a budget resolution. And we did. Six months ago we passed \na budget resolution, and then we asked for consent to go to a \nconference committee with the House to work out our differences. Time \nand time again Senators on the other side of the aisle objected to our \nmeeting with the House to work out our differences. They had a \ndifferent reason every day. The net result was we couldn't have the \nconference committee to reach an agreement with the House on how much \nwe would spend.\n  Then Senator Mikulski told each of us in our appropriations \nsubcommittees: Do your work. Sit down with your Republican member and \ncome up with a spending bill for next year that gets rid of \nsequestration and that is sensible. And we did. Time and again we \nworked these out on a bipartisan basis, brought them through committee, \nready for floor action. The first bill came to the floor, \ntransportation. Senator Patty Murray brought it to the floor. We wanted \nto bring this first spending bill to the floor. Let's debate it, let's \nget it done. The Republicans objected to considering this \nappropriations bill on the floor. They objected to a conference \ncommittee on a budget, they objected to the spending bills, and here we \nare at the eleventh hour, approaching October 1, without the money to \ncontinue the functions of government. We are facing a slowdown this \nweek, and we are going to begin what may not technically be a \nfilibuster but at least is a delay in meeting our responsibility to \nfund our government.\n  Some have said--the House Republicans and others--if you do not stop \nPresident Obama's health care reform act, we will shut down the \ngovernment. That isn't fair. As Senator Mikulski has said, there are \npeople across America counting on the functions of our government. This \nnotion that we are somehow going to shut down the government with this \npolitical threat is unacceptable--unacceptable to the American people \nand unacceptable to this great institution.\n  Senator Mikulski is correct: We ought to have a short-term CR so we \ncan sit down, roll up our sleeves, and finally finish this business. \nWhether you are a Democrat, Republican, or Independent, people are fed \nup with this do-nothing Congress that doesn't address the real issues \nAmerican families are facing across our Nation. We need to roll up our \nsleeves and get it done. To have long speeches that go on for hours, \ndelaying the funding of our government, jeopardizes the most basic \nfunctions of what we need to achieve right here. We need to come \ntogether on a bipartisan basis. A filibuster, delay, long speeches may \nget the attention of the media for a few minutes but won't solve \nAmerica's problems.\n  The last point I want to make was her strongest point. The President \nis at the United Nations this week meeting with leaders around the \nworld to try to bring about a more peaceful world in a very dangerous \nclimate in many places. He wants to let people know that America will \nuse its leadership and its power to come together to make this a better \nworld. And what message is coming out of the United States Senate? That \nwe are divided, we are fighting with one another, we are facing \nfilibusters, and on and on. This isn't what America should be \nprojecting.\n  Let's project the kind of unity and the kind of determination that \nhas made this a great nation. Let's fund our government; let's solve \nour problems; let's stop the obstruction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to ObamaCare. I \nrise today in an effort to speak for 26 million Texans and for 300 \nmillion Americans.\n  All across this country Americans are suffering because of ObamaCare. \nObamaCare isn't working. Yet fundamentally there are politicians in \nthis body who are not listening to the people. They are not listening \nto the concerns of their constituents, they are not listening to the \njobs lost or the people forced into part-time work, to the people \nlosing their health insurance, to the people who are struggling.\n  A great many Texans, a great many Americans feel they don't have a \nvoice. I hope to play some very small part in helping provide that \nvoice for them. I intend to speak in opposition to ObamaCare, I intend \nto speak in support of defunding ObamaCare, until I am no longer able \nto stand, to do everything I can to help Americans stand together and \nrecognize this grand experiment 3\\1/2\\ years ago is, quite simply, not \nworking.\n  I also say at the outset that I am particularly honored to be \nstanding side by side with my friend and colleague Senator Mike Lee \nfrom Utah. Senator Lee has shown visionary leadership in standing and \ntaking the mantle of leading the effort to defund ObamaCare and to \nchallenge this train wreck of a law, and Senator Lee has been repaid at \ntimes with vilification from official Washington.\n\n[[Page S6702]]\n\n  In my judgment there is no Senator in this body, Republican or \nDemocrat, who is more principled, who is more dedicated, who is more \nfearless and willing to fight for the principles that make this Nation \ngreat than is Senator Mike Lee. It is a singular privilege to serve \nwith him and to stand side by side with him and so many others in this \nbody, and, even more importantly, so many millions of Americans all \nacross this country.\n  There is a problem in Washington, and the problem is bigger than a \ncontinuing resolution. It is bigger than ObamaCare. It is even bigger \nthan the budget. The most fundamental problem and the frustration is \nthat the men and women in Washington aren't listening. If you talk to \nthe man and woman on the street, that is the message you hear over and \nover again: Why don't they listen to me? Why don't they hear what we \nhave to say? They aren't listening to the millions of people, \nDemocrats, Republicans, Independents, Libertarians, across the spectrum \nwho say our elected officials get to Washington and they stop listening \nto the people.\n  We just had a 6-week recess during August where a substantial \npercentage of Members of Congress chose not to hold townhalls during \nthe 6 weeks we had to be back in our home States, not even to give \ntheir constituents a chance to say their views, because it is very easy \nwhen those of us who are in elected office have been here for a long \ntime to believe Washington knows better; to believe that all the \nsolutions are found in Washington, DC, and the rest of the country is \nbetter--as they say of small children--seen but not heard.\n  We need millions of people to get an answer. Millions of people are \nasking for accountability, for responsibility, for truth from their \nelected officials, truth about how ObamaCare is failing the men and \nwomen of America. It is time, quite simply, to make DC listen. That is \na point I intend to make over and over, because it is fundamentally \nwhat we are trying to do. We are trying to gather the American people \nto make DC listen.\n  The whole debate we are having is not over strategy. It is not about \nprocess. It is not about procedure. If you read the papers it looks \nlike it is. If you read the papers it is all sorts of confusing cloture \non the motions to the what-the, to the which-the. To anyone outside of \nDC, their eyes glaze over. Even to anyone in Washington, DC, their eyes \nglaze over.\n  This is also not about pollsters. It is not about pundits or \nconsultants or those who are making money back and forth on the \npolitical process. They have always been with us, and I am confident \nthey will remain with us for all time. The problem is DC is not \nlistening. The problem is our elected leaders are not listening to \ntheir constituents.\n  Everyone in America understands ObamaCare is destroying jobs. It is \ndriving up health care costs. It is killing health benefits. It is \nshattering the economy. All across the country in all 50 States--it \ndoesn't matter what State you go to, you can go to any State in the \nUnion, it doesn't matter if you are talking to Republicans or Democrats \nor Independents or Libertarians--Americans understand this thing is not \nworking.\n  Yet Washington is pretending not to know. Washington is pretending to \nhave no awareness. Instead we have politicians giving speeches about \nhow wonderful ObamaCare is. At the same time they go to the President \nand ask for an exemption from ObamaCare for Members of Congress.\n  If ObamaCare is so wonderful, why is it that its loudest advocates \ndon't want to be subject to it? I will confess that is a very difficult \none to figure out.\n  DC is using a rigged process to keep ObamaCare funded, to keep this \njob-killing bill funded. What they want to do fundamentally is ignore \nthe men and women of America and keep up with business as usual. People \nwonder why Congress has such low approval ratings. I remember when all \n100 of us were in the historic Senate Chamber for a bipartisan meeting. \nMultiple Senators stood and expressed frustration with the low approval \nratings that Congress has. It varies--sometimes, 10, 12, 14 percent--\nbut it is always abysmal.\n  Some suggested the reason was that we are not legislating enough. We \njust need to pass some more laws and the American people will be happy. \nI have to admit, that does not comport with just about anything I have \never heard in the State of Texas. That doesn't comport with anything I \nhave ever heard from constituents. I am going to suggest the most \nfundamental reason Congress remains in the low teens in approval \nratings is because Congress is not listening to the American people.\n  Every poll that has been done for years, when we ask the American \npeople what is their top priority, the answer is consistently jobs and \nthe economy--over and over, jobs and the economy. That is national. \nThat is in your State, my State. That is in all 50 States. Jobs and the \neconomy is the answer you get. It is also not partisan. You can ask \nRepublicans, ask Democrats, you can ask Independents. They say we need \njobs, we need economic growth back.\n  Yet I will tell you, Madam President--you and I have both served in \nthis institution some 9 months, not very long, but in the time we have \nbeen here we have spent virtually zero time even talking about jobs and \nthe economy. It doesn't make the agenda. It apparently is not important \nenough for this body's time. We spent 6 weeks talking about guns, \ntalking about taking away law-abiding citizens' Second Amendment \nrights, and we spend virtually no time talking about fundamental tax \nreform, about regulatory reform, about getting the economy going. And \npoliticians wonder why it is that Congress is held in such low esteem. \nThis is unfortunately a bipartisan issue, on both sides.\n  We need to do a better job of listening to the people. If the top \npriority of the American people is jobs and the economy, I am going to \nsuggest the top priority of Congress should be jobs and the economy.\n  Madam President, you and I should both be scratching our heads, \ntrying to think about a time when we weren't talking about jobs and the \neconomy because, I tell you, we certainly have not gotten it taken care \nof yet. The American people are frustrated because their elected \nofficials do not listen.\n  When we are home on the campaign trail, we say we listen. Yet \nsomething about this Senate floor, something about Washington, DC--I \ndon't know if it is the water, something in the air, the cherry \nblossoms, but people get here and they stop listening to the American \npeople.\n  As I traveled throughout the State of Texas--I spent the month of \nAugust and the beginning of September traveling virtually every day on \nthe road throughout Texas and across the country listening, hearing the \nstories. The American people are hurting. This is a difficult time. The \nvery rich, they are doing fine. In fact, they are doing better under \nPresident Obama than they were before. But hard-working American \nfamilies are struggling and their life has become harder and harder and \nharder.\n  ObamaCare is the biggest job killer in this country. The American \npeople want to stop this madness, and so do I. In Washington, we pass \nmillion-dollar bills, billion-dollar bills no one has ever read, often \nwithout even voting on them. We call it unanimous consent. It is only \nunanimous because they don't let anyone know.\n  In Washington, we spend $2 trillion more than last year and then tell \nvoters we saved money. The system is deliberately designed to hide what \nwe are actually doing.\n  In this debate right now over ObamaCare and the continuing \nresolution, voting to pass bills is called procedure, as if it doesn't \nmatter. We pretend it doesn't matter. It does matter. Our leaders right \nnow demand approval for bills before they are amended: Everyone come to \nthe floor, vote for the bill. Then we will amend it to make it say the \nopposite of what it says right now, but you have already voted so don't \nworry about it. We are told to agree to the bills without even knowing \nwhat the final product will be and that is what is happening right now. \nOur leaders in both parties are asking us to support a bill, to cut off \ndebate on a bill without even knowing what is in it.\n  It is as the former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi once observed: \nPass it to find out what is in it. That is how Washington does \nbusiness.\n  Let me tell you how this is likely to unfold. Senate majority leader \nHarry\n\n[[Page S6703]]\n\nReid has said he intends to offer an amendment to determine the future \nof our health care system and based on the public press reports--and I \nwould note you have to rely on the public press reports because this \nbody doesn't know, but based on the public press reports, that \namendment is going to fully fund ObamaCare. It is going to strip the \nlanguage the House of Representatives passed to defund ObamaCare and \nlisten to the American people.\n\n  The central vote the Senate will take on this fight will not occur \ntoday and it will not occur tomorrow. The first vote we are going to \ntake on this is a vote on what is called cloture on the motion to \nproceed. Very few people not on this floor have any idea what that \nmeans and even, I suspect, a fair number of people on this floor are \nnot quite sure what that means. That will simply be a vote whether to \ntake up this bill and to begin debating this bill. I expect that vote \nto pass overwhelmingly, if not unanimously. Everyone agrees we ought to \ntake this up, we ought to start this conversation.\n  The next vote we take will occur on Friday or Saturday and it will be \non what is called cloture on the bill. That is the vote that matters. \nCloture on the bill, the vote Friday or Saturday, is the vote that \nmatters.\n  Why is that? Because that vote is subject to a 60-vote threshold. If \nRepublicans vote with Democrats, then this body will cut off debate on \nthe bill. Cloture is simply cutting off debate. It is saying we are not \ngoing to talk about it anymore, we are silencing the voice of the \nSenate, we are silencing the voice of the people, and we are cutting \noff debate.\n  Why does that matter? Because once cloture is invoked, the rules of \nthe Senate allow the majority leader to introduce the amendment to fund \nObamaCare and then to have it pass with just 51 votes, not 60--51. As \nthe Presiding Officer is well aware, there are more than 51 Democrats \nin this body. Postcloture, after this body has voted to cut off debate, \nthe Democrats can vote on a straight party-line vote to fund ObamaCare. \nMadam President, I am going to let you in on a dirty little secret. \nWhen that happens, every Republican, if we get to that point, will vote \nagainst it and every Republican will then go home to his or her State \nand say: Look, I voted against ObamaCare.\n  That is actually the preferred outcome, to have a vote but yet to \nhave the result be business as usual continue in Washington. It is a \nlittle bit akin to the World Wrestling Federation, wrestling matches \nwhere it is all rigged. The outcome is predetermined. They know in \nadvance who is going to win and lose and it is all for show. There are \nsome Members of this body, if we could have 100 show votes, saying here \nis what we are for, but mind you, none of them are actually going to \nchange the law, none of them are actually going to occur, none of them \nare going to make one iota of difference to the American people because \nthey will never become law, but we will get to vote over and over again \nin proving how committed we are to principle A, B, C, D or E, that \ncuriously would make a significant number of Senators happy.\n  Our constituents deserve more--no more fake fights, no more hiding \nour votes, no more games, no more trying to fool the American people. \nWe need to make DC listen--make DC listen. I want to stand and fight \nfor the more than 1.6 million Americans who signed a national petition \nagainst ObamaCare and to the millions more who did not because they \nwere told by a politician it is not possible--don't even try to fight \nbecause it is not possible.\n  I am reminded of a children's story. My wife Heidi and I are blessed \nto have two little girls, Caroline and Catherine, ages 5 and 2, and one \nof their favorite children's stories, actually from when I was a kid, \nis ``The Little Engine That Could''--the train going up that said over \nand over again, ``I think I can. I think I can.''\n  I have to say, if we listen to a lot of Members of this body, the \nmessage would be simple. That little engine can't. What they say to \nthat train when it starts at the bottom of the hill is, no, you can't.\n  I think I can. I think I can.\n  No, you can't. No, you can't. We can't win. You can't stop ObamaCare. \nIt cannot be done. It is impossible. There is nothing we can do.\n  Are millions of Americans out of work? Yes. Are millions of Americans \nstruggling? Yes. Are millions of Americans seeing their health \ninsurance premiums skyrocket? Yes. Are millions of Americans at risk of \nlosing their health insurance because of ObamaCare? Yes.\n  But Washington tells our constituents: No, no, never mind. It can't \nbe done. It cannot be done. It is impossible. The rules of Washington \nsay this cannot be done.\n  And we wonder why this body has such low approval among the people. \nWhen we go out and tell the American people it cannot be done, there is \nnothing that can be done to stop ObamaCare, what we are saying is we \nare not willing to do it. We are not willing to stand and fight.\n  We are willing to give speeches. Oh, yes, if we want to have a speech \ncontest, we can line up and fall over backward who can give the best \nspeech against ObamaCare. But when it comes to actually standing and \nfighting, when it comes to actually having the opportunity to listen to \nthe American people, an awful lot of Members of this body, at least so \nfar, have not shown up to battle.\n  There are a lot of folks in the Washington establishment who do not \nwant to hear from us. The chattering class is quick to discipline \nanyone who refuses to blindly fall in line. That is the way Washington \nplays. There are rules. We are not supposed to speak for the people. \nThere is a way things are done in Washington and make no mistake, DC \ndepends upon Americans not paying attention.\n  They know most Americans are quite reasonably working too hard to \nprovide for their family. They are too busy spending time with their \nfriends and family. They are too busy working to try to make sure their \nfamily is provided for. They are going to church. They are dealing with \nthe day-to-day burdens of life. You know what they have learned? The \nAmerican people have learned when we get involved, even then it seems \nas though Washington politicians rarely listen.\n  I believe that can change. I am standing here today to salute, to \ncelebrate the American democratic system. I am standing here today to \nsuggest that if Senators listen to their constituents, if we listen to \nthe American people, the vote would be 100 to 0 to defund \nObamaCare. Even those Senators who voted for it who might have believed \nit would work. Many of us would have disagreed. Had I been here, not \nsurprisingly, I would have voted against ObamaCare 3\\1/2\\ years ago. A \nnumber of Members in this body voted in favor of it. Regardless of how \nMembers voted 3\\1/2\\ years ago, one of the great virtues of life is \nlearning, looking at the evidence, looking at the facts, and seeing \nwhen something is not working.\n\n  Look at the labor unions. Three-and-a-half years ago the labor unions \nwere enthusiastically supporting ObamaCare. Why? Because they heard the \npromises. They heard it was going to work, and that it would be a \nbonanza for all. They believed the promises, and that is \nunderstandable. Yet one of the things we have seen this year is one \nlabor union after another after another saying: Whoa. This thing isn't \nworking. This thing is hurting us. This thing is hurting our Members.\n  (Mr. MANCHIN assumed the Chair.)\n  By the way, the people whom it is hurting are hard-working men and \nwomen and hard-working American families. They are the ones getting \nhammered.\n  James Huff, the president of the Teamsters, has said ObamaCare is \ndestroying the 40-hour workweek. It is destroying the backbone of the \nAmerican middle class. That is not me saying that, that is not any \npolitician from Washington saying that, that is the Teamsters.\n  We should submit the question to the American people: Do the American \npeople want to destroy the 40-hour workweek that is the backbone of the \nAmerican middle class? That is not a close question. People talk about \nhow we are a 50-50 Nation and how there is a tight partisan divide. I \ndon't believe it. I think on questions such as that there is an \noverwhelming majority of Americans who say of course we should not \ndestroy the 40-hour workweek. Of course we shouldn't break the backbone \nof the American middle class.\n\n[[Page S6704]]\n\n  If more politicians listened to the people, we would respond and \navert this train wreck. Yet the politicians of Washington tell us: \nDon't worry about it. ObamaCare is going to be peachy keen. The Senate \nis too busy to do anything to avert this train wreck.\n  Mind you, the Senate is not too busy to exempt ourselves from it. We \nknow enough to say: We don't want to be a part of this thing. The \nAmerican people know it can't be done. Nothing can be done. We need to \naccept it.\n  Americans have never been people who accept failure. Americans have \nnever been people who accept impossibility. If we look to a ragtag \nbunch of colonists in the 18th century, the idea that we would stand up \nto Great Britain, the British Army--the most mighty military force on \nthe face of the planet--was impossible. It can't be done. I guarantee \nthat all of the pundits we see going on TV and intoning in deep \nbaritone voices: This cannot be done--if we were back in the 18th \ncentury, they would be writing messages in dark ink and sending it by \ncarrier pigeon, saying: This cannot be done. You can't stand up to the \nBritish Army. It can't be done. It is impossible. Accept your \nsubjugation. Accept your taxation without representation. Accept that \nthis is impossible.\n  If we fast forward to the Civil War--a time of enormous pain, \nanguish, and bloodshed in the United States--there were a lot of voices \nthen who said the Union cannot be saved. It cannot be done. Accept \ndefeat. I suspect those same pundits, had they been around in the mid-\n19th century, would have written the same columns: This cannot be done.\n  If we go to the 1940s, Nazi Germany--look, we saw it in Britain. \nNeville Chamberlain told the British people: Accept the Nazis. Yes, \nthey will dominate the continent of Europe, but that is not our \nproblem. Let's appease them. Why? Because it can't be done. We cannot \npossibly stand against them.\n  In America there were voices who listened to that; I suspect the same \npundits who said it couldn't be done. If this had happened in the \n1940s, we would have been listening to them. Even then they would have \nmade television. They would have gotten beyond the carrier pigeons and \nletters and they would have been on TV saying: You cannot defeat the \nGermans.\n  If we go to the late 1960s when a President, John F. Kennedy, told \nthis country: We are going to send a man to the Moon--when John F. \nKennedy told this country we are going to send a man to the Moon, there \nwere a lot of people who said: It cannot be done. It is impossible. It \ncannot be done. Yet John F. Kennedy had the vision to say Americans can \ndo things--whatever we set our minds to.\n  If we go to the late 1970s and 1980s, we were in the midst of the \nCold War. I remember growing up in the Cold War. I remember being told \nthe Soviet Union cannot be defeated. It cannot be done. We have to \naccept malaise. We have to accept second-class citizenship. They have a \nlot of weapons. We cannot possibly stand up to the Soviet Union.\n  There was a President--a President whom I admired deeply, President \nRonald Reagan--who had the temerity to say: What is your strategy on \nthe Cold War? Answer: We win, they lose.\n  At the time those same Washington founts of wisdom said: It can't be \ndone. No, no, no, we can't win. Winning is a two-dimensional strategy. \nWe need to be much more nuanced than that. We need to push for detente, \nwhatever that means. We need to push for something short of actually \nwinning.\n  So we get to ObamaCare, and what do all of those voices say? It \ncannot be stopped. It can't be done. We cannot defund it. By any \nmeasure ObamaCare is a far less intimidating foe than those I have \ndiscussed, with the possible exception of the Moon. The Moon might be \nas intimidating as ObamaCare. Yet those same voices of Washington give \nthe same message that they have said over and over and over again, \nwhich is the opposite of the message of the little engine that could: \nNo, you can't. It can't be done. No, we can't.\n  What should we have instead of you know what? We hear echoes from the \npast battles. We ought to have a vote where we can go to our \nconstituents and say: By golly, we really, really, really dislike \nObamaCare. Can we add a couple of more reallys? I want to make it clear \nthat it is really, really, really.\n\n  We wonder why our constituents look at us and say: What on Earth are \nyou doing? Do you actually care that we are losing our jobs? Do you \nactually care that we can't find a job? Do you care that our small \nbusinesses are not growing? Do you care that health insurance premiums \nfor people who are struggling are skyrocketing? Do you care that more \nand more Americans are losing their health insurance?\n  We don't need fake fights. We don't need fake votes. We need real \nchange. We need a better economy. We need more jobs. We need more \nfreedom. And what is critical in doing that is stopping ObamaCare \nbecause Americans should not have to worry about what Washington is \ndoing to them, what Washington is doing to make their life harder, what \nWashington is doing to take away their job, what Washington is doing to \ndrive up their health insurance premiums, what Washington is doing to \njeopardize the health insurance they have now.\n  I cannot tell the Presiding Officer how many times across the State \nof Texas I have had men and women come up to me--some with disabilities \nand some in wheelchairs--and say: Please, stop this bill. Stop \nObamaCare because I don't want to lose my health insurance. It is \njeopardizing the health insurance coverage I have now.\n  We all remember when President Obama told the American people: If you \nlike your health insurance, you can keep it. Now at the time that \nsounded good. Any of us who liked our health insurance wanted to keep \nit. We liked that promise. That is the kind of promise we like from our \ncandidates and our officeholders.\n  Yet as I mentioned earlier, one of the great faculties of higher \nreason is the ability to learn--the ability to learn from evidence and \nfacts. We have learned that promise did not, in fact, meet reality \nbecause the reality is millions of Americans are at risk of losing \ntheir health insurance.\n  A few weeks ago UPS sent a letter to 15,000 employees and it said: We \nare terminating spousal health insurance because of ObamaCare. Their \nhusbands and wives were told: Sorry, your health insurance is gone. \nRemember, the promise was: If you like your health insurance, you can \nkeep it. For those 15,000 UPS employees--for their husbands and wives--\nthat promise has been disproved by reality. This body would step up and \nstop ObamaCare if we did just one thing: if we listened to our \nconstituents. So together that is what we have to do: Make DC listen.\n  A lot of folks in Washington are angry we are even having this fight. \nA lot of folks in Washington are angry--it is fascinating how many \npoliticians in Washington think this isn't even worth our time. I will \npoint out, as is usually the case--almost always the case--the Senate \nfloor is largely empty. Everyone's schedules are apparently busy enough \nthat standing and coming together to stop ObamaCare doesn't make it \nonto the priority list. We ought to have all 100 Senators on this floor \naround the clock until we come together and stop ObamaCare. If they \ntalked to their constituents, that is what they would like. If they \nwould talk to their constituents, their constituents would say: What \npossibly do you have to do that is more important than getting the \neconomy moving again and bringing back jobs? What possibly do you have \nto do that is more important than stopping me from losing my health \ninsurance or stopping me from losing my health care? That is what I \nhear from my constituents over and over again. I am confident the \nPresiding Officer hears it from his constituents. Every one of us hears \nit from our constituents because that is what Americans are saying in \nall 50 States. We should not have to worry about what the next rule, \nthe next regulation, or the next tax is that is going to be handed down \nfrom the DC ruling class.\n  ObamaCare alone has produced over 20,000 pages of regulation. I am \nconfident the Presiding Officer has not read 20,000 pages of ObamaCare \nregulations. I can tell the Presiding Officer I have not read 20,000 \npages of ObamaCare regulations. I would wager all the money in my bank \naccount there is no Member in this body who has read 20,000 pages of \nObamaCare regulation.\n  Yet what is Washington telling small businesses all across the \ncountry? You\n\n[[Page S6705]]\n\nare bound by 20,000 pages of ObamaCare regulation, and more and more is \ncoming. There is another 3,000 pages added every 6 months. So it is \ngoing to keep coming and coming and coming.\n  I remember doing a tele-townhall several months ago, and a woman who \nowns a small business asked: How do I comply with all of these \nregulations? How do I comply with the burdens of ObamaCare? It was \nquite striking. She said: I don't even know where to start. I will \nconfess that I felt embarrassed because I said: Ma'am, I don't know how \nto tell you that.\n  The complexity is so much that it is causing more and more small \nbusinesses to stay small--avoid ObamaCare altogether. They can't \ndecipher the rules and regulations so they don't. If they have under 50 \nemployees, they can get out from under it.\n  I cannot tell you how many small businesses are not hiring right now. \nIf they have 30 or 40 employees, they are not subject to ObamaCare, but \nif they get the fiftieth employee, that fiftieth employee better be one \nheck of an employee, because the instant he or she shows up on the \npayroll, boom, the entire business is subject to 20,000 pages of \nregulations and crushing costs.\n\n  To the men and women at home today who are out of a job, I point out \nto you that if it were not for ObamaCare, every small business that has \nan opportunity to expand right now and is not expanding because of \nObamaCare--that is a job you are not able to get.\n  Do you want to know why the job economy is so bad, why there are so \nfew jobs, why we have the lowest workforce participation in decades in \nthe United States? Small businesses generate two-thirds of all new jobs \nin the economy, and small businesses have been hammered under ObamaCare \nunlike ever before.\n  If we listened to our constituents, we would step forward and act to \navert this train wreck. The only way that will happen is if the \nAmerican people demand it, if together we make DC listen. That is what \nthis fight is about. It is about ensuring that the American people have \na voice, ensuring that those who are struggling, those who are without \na job, those who are afraid of losing their health insurance--that \nWashington listens to them, that Washington acts on their needs.\n  Anyone who wants to know why this body is held in low esteem only has \nto look out to the empty chairs. If you are out of a job, wondering \nwhat the Senate is doing to get our economy moving, to help small \nbusinesses create new jobs so you can go to work and provide for your \nfamily, the answer is displayed right in front of you.\n  If you are concerned about the health care for yourself, for your \nfamily, if you are seeing more and more people losing their health \ninsurance and you are saying: ``What about my family? What if I lose my \nhealth insurance because of ObamaCare?'' and you ask what the Senate is \ndoing to listen to you, the answer, right now, is an empty Chamber.\n  Our system was based on a profound notion: that sovereignty resides \nwith the American people, that every one of us--sometimes people in the \nSenate behave as if they have no bosses, as if they are autonomous \nrulers. And Washington is a little bit of a town that treats the people \nin Washington--they behave like kings and queens of their own fiefdoms. \nYet every one of us has a whole lot of bosses. In my instance, I have \n26 million bosses back home in Texas. Who are the 26 million Texans \nwhom I work to represent? Those who supported me and those who did not. \nIt is my job to represent every one of them, to fight for every one of \nthem. The most fundamental problem, bigger than ObamaCare, is the \nproblem that Washington has stopped listening to the American people.\n  It is quite striking that in discussions about ObamaCare among \nelected officials, we hear more complaints about ``I don't like all the \nphone calls I am getting from my constituents'' than we do about \nObamaCare. It is apparently an imposition on some Members of this body \nfor their constituents to pick up the phone and express their views. It \nis viewed as somehow illegitimate. How dare they? Apparently, standing \non those steps and taking the oath of office invests 100 people with \nsomehow greater wisdom, greater insight, more brain cells. Our \nconstituents--there is a tendency in this town, particularly as time \ngoes on, to view our constituents as an annoyance.\n  Today--just today--I have heard multiple Senators complaining: too \nmany phone calls from my constituents. What a remarkable complaint. \nWhat a remarkable complaint.\n  Mr. President, you and I have both worked in the private sector. In \nthe private sector, if your boss picked up the phone and called, I \nsuspect neither you nor I sat at our computer playing Solitaire when \nour boss picked up the phone and called. Neither one of us said: Boss, \nI am too busy. Boss, I don't want to listen. You may have some \npriorities for the business but not me. I know better than you.\n  None of us did that. Because in the private sector, there is a quick \nand immediate response. If you tell your boss in the private sector: \nHey, boss, my time is too important for you; I don't care about your \npriorities; I am not going to listen to you, I suspect that will be \nyour last day at that place of employment.\n  Why is Washington broken? Because you have 100 people, a significant \nnumber of whom, on a daily basis, tell their boss, tell their \nconstituents: I am too busy for you.\n  Don't even bother to call my office because it just ties up my staff. \nIt is annoying. I know better than you do. I know the priorities better \nthan you do.\n  What a broken system. What a broken system. We work for the people. \nWhy are the people unhappy with Washington? Why are they disgusted with \nWashington? Because Washington is not listening to them. There is a \ngame instead that is focused on maintaining the status quo. Staying in \noffice--that is what is important because it is apparently very \nimportant to be invited to all the right cocktail parties in town. I \nwill confess, I do not go to a whole lot of cocktail parties in town. I \nam pretty sure you do not either. But there are Members of this body \nfor whom that is very important.\n  At the end of the day, we do not work for those holding cocktail \nparties in Washington, DC. We do not work for the intelligentsia in the \nbig cities who write newspaper editorials. We work for the American \npeople. We work for single moms. We work for young people. We work for \nseniors who are struggling. We work for Hispanics, for African \nAmericans. We work for every American who believes in the American \ndream.\n  This body is not listening to the people. Indeed, the very fact that \nover 1.6 million Americans have signed a petition, have picked up the \nphone, have been calling offices in this great Chamber is viewed as an \ninappropriate imposition. What an indictment of this body that we think \nit is somehow illegitimate that the American people would ask us not to \nfocus on irrelevant priorities. It is not like the American people are \ncalling, saying focus on some parochial issue. By the way, phone calls \nare not coming from our districts saying: Senator, please take more of \nthe American people's tax money and send it back to our district. We \nwould like some more pork.\n  Those are not the calls. Those are not the calls we are getting. The \ncalls are from people who are saying: Listen, jobs and the economy is \nmy No. 1 priority. Why isn't it Congress's? Jobs and the economy \nmatter. Why? Because if you are working, if you are working in a good \njob, you are providing for your family. It makes it easier for families \nto stay together. Moms and dads--it makes it easier for them to raise \ntheir kids, raise them with good values. It makes it easier for them to \nprovide a good education for their kids.\n  When you have one job, it lets you begin to climb the economic ladder \nto a better job and a better job and a better job. That is the American \nspirit. Yet we have tens of millions of people in this country out of \nwork. Every month we get the reports from the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics that say even more people have given up looking for work.\n  The odd way our unemployment statistics work, that makes the number \nthe newspapers report go down. Because when a few hundred thousand \npeople say: All right, I give up, it is so hopeless, I will never find \na job, that, curiously, results in the unemployment number going down \nbecause the number that gets reported in the papers is a measure of a \npercentage of how many\n\n[[Page S6706]]\n\nof the people looking for work are unable to find it.\n  I am going to suggest that people giving up is even worse. What a sad \ntestament, given the American spirit, the American spirit that we can \ndo anything we set our minds to, that anyone--the great blessings of \nthis Nation have been fundamentally that it does not matter who you \nare, it does not matter who your daddy was, it does not matter whether \nyou were born into great wealth and privilege and advantage or whether \nyou were born into humble means, anyone in this country can achieve \nanything based on hard work, perseverance, and based on the content of \nyour character. What a tremendous, unique blessing that is in the \nUnited States of America. The reason this ObamaCare fight matters so \nmuch is that is imperiled right now. In order for anyone with nothing \nto achieve anything, they have to be able to get a job to start. They \nhave to get on to the first rung of the economic ladder to have a \nchance of getting to the second or the third or the fourth or the \nfifth.\n  Just a week ago the Wall Street Journal had a long article about the \n``lost generation,'' about young people coming out of school in the \nlast few years who have not gotten their first job or who have gotten a \npart-time job. Because of ObamaCare, their employer does not want to \nhire them for 40 hours a week, so they get hired for 29 hours a week.\n  Think about young people. If they do not get that first job, they are \nnot going to get the second, they are not going to get the third. The \nimpact for young people right now that ObamaCare is having is \nabsolutely devastating. What this Wall Street Journal article was \nsaying is that the economic data shows that impact will be with them \ntheir entire lives; that when they start off their career not gaining \nskills, not working, not climbing the economic ladder, that delay will \nstick with them forever.\n  What a travesty. Where is the outrage? Where is the outrage? Where \nare the Senators standing here saying: What a travesty that young \npeople are being denied a fair shot at the American dream because of \nwhat we have wrought because of ObamaCare. That should unite all of us. \nIf we were listening to the American people, that would be where our \nattention would lie.\n  Fundamentally, what this week is about is that we need to make DC \nlisten, make them listen to the single mom working at a diner, \nstruggling to feed her kids, who has just been told she is being \nreduced to 29 hours a week. Who is speaking for that single mom right \nnow? Who is talking about how ObamaCare is forcing more and more people \ninto part-time employment? And, by the way, she does not get health \ninsurance. Instead, forced into 29 hours a week, what does that single \nmom do? She gets a second job. So now she is working two jobs, with 29 \nhours a week for both of them. Now she is away from her kids even more. \nShe does not have health insurance at either job now. But she has to \ntravel from one to the other. She has to deal with two conflicting \nschedules because one job wants her to work Tuesday, and the other job \nwants her to work at that same time on Tuesday. She has to go to both \nof her bosses. Both of them say: You need to be there Tuesday \nafternoon. Who is speaking for that single mom right now?\n  On Friday or Saturday of this week we will vote on cloture. Anyone \nwho votes yes for cloture, anyone who votes to cut off debate on this \nbill, is voting to allow Senate majority leader Harry Reid to fully \nfund ObamaCare. That is a vote that I think is a profound mistake. It \nis a vote that I hope all 46 Republicans will stand united against. It \nis a vote that, in time, I hope more than a few Democrats will stand \nagainst.\n  To fix the problems in this country, this does not have to be a \npartisan issue. Many of the President's most vocal supporters have \nstarted coming out against ObamaCare. Why? Because the facts show it is \nnot working, because if you get beyond the team mentality in \nWashington, if you get beyond the partisan focus in Washington and you \nask, is this thing good for the American people, it is very hard on the \nmerits to make the case that it is.\n  It is very hard. It is quite interesting that in the course of this \ndebate there have been more than a few newspaper articles, more than a \nfew attacks from our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle and \nalso from our friends on the Republican side of the aisle.\n  I told my wife that I now pick up the newspaper each day to learn \njust what a scoundrel I am and just what attacks have come, some on the \nrecord and some--actually the ones that are often even better are the \nanonymous ones. I have to say there is no courage like the courage in \nWashington of the anonymous congressional staffers. I have chuckled at \nmore than a few of them. You know, it says something when Members of \nthis body, the congressional staffers, and members of the media want to \nmake this about personalities. They want to make this about a battle of \nthis Senator versus that Senator, this person versus that person, so it \nis all personal. It is like reading the Hollywood gossip pages. That is \nhow this issue is covered. It is not by accident because one of the \nways Washington has discovered for not listening to the people is \ndistraction. Distract the voters with smoke and mirrors.\n  This fight is not about any Member of this body. This fight is not \nabout personality. Look, most Americans could not give a flying flip \nabout a bunch of politicians in Washington. Who cares? You know, almost \nall of us are in cheap suits and have bad haircuts. Who cares? What the \nAmerican people care about is their own lives. What the American people \ncare about is giving their kids a better future. What the American \npeople care about is having a job with a future, not a job where they \nare working 29 hours a week, where they are punching a clock, where \nthey feel as though they are just going through the motions, but a job \nwhere they say: Hey, I have a career. I can see the next step. I can \nsee the future for my family. That is what the American people care \nabout.\n  So regardless of the rocks that will be thrown--and they will \ncontinue to be thrown--I have no intention of engaging in that game, no \nintention of speaking ill of any Senator, Republican or Democratic, \nbecause it is not about us. Anyone who is trying to make this a battle \nof personalities is trying to change the topic from the topic that \nshould matter: whether ObamaCare is helping the American people.\n  If we focus on the substance, the evidence is overwhelming. This law \nis a train wreck. Every day the headlines come in: more jobs lost, more \npeople losing their health insurance, more premiums going up, more \npeople pushed into part-time work. Yet every day the Senate goes about \nits business and says: We are too busy to listen to the American \npeople.\n  There are different games, to be sure, that go on on both sides of \nthe aisle. Many of our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle \nright now endeavor to convince the American people: Pay no attention to \nyour lying eyes; ObamaCare really is terrific. That is not going \nterribly well. But on the Republican side of the aisle, there is a lot \nof energy and attention focused on saying: Well, yes, ObamaCare is \nterrible, but under no circumstances could we ever do anything about \nit. That is beyond us. We are destined to lose. So what we are \ninterested in on the Republican side of the aisle is let's cast a show \nvote--2, 3, 10--as many votes as possible to say: ObamaCare is really \nbad. We cannot fix it.\n  You know, that problem--it crosses that middle line. Whether you are \ntelling your constituents it is really working out well despite the \nobjective facts to the contrary or whether you are telling your \nconstituents: I agree, it is a terrible thing, but I cannot do anything \nto fix it, in both cases you are not listening to the people. That is \nsomething we need to correct. All of us, all 100 of us--we need to \nlisten to the people. Together, we need to make DC listen. If we do \nnot, the frustration will grow. If we do not, the disillusion with \nWashington will grow. If we do not, the approval rating of Congress \nwill keep going down, keep going down, keep going down. The only way to \nfix this problem is to demonstrate that we understand--we understand \nthe fact that we are not driven by partisan ideology; that we are \ndriven by doing our jobs and listening to the American people.\n  It is my fervent hope that over the course of this week, over the \ncourse of this debate, that all 46 Senators on the Republican side will \nunite and that\n\n[[Page S6707]]\n\nmore and more Democrats will come together and say: Listen, we have an \nobligation to our constituents. That is an obligation we are going to \nhonor.\n  Mr. LEE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEE. I would ask my distinguished colleague, the Senator from \nTexas, a series of questions with regard to this concept to make DC \nlisten. It is interesting that we are having this discussion right now \nat a time in our history when never has it been easier for so many \npeople throughout the country with so few resources to be heard by so \nmany.\n  In the past, you had to own a newspaper or perhaps in more recent \nyears you had to own a radio station or a television company or \nsomething like that to be heard by a lot of people. But these days \npretty much anyone can gain access to a telephone or the Internet, they \ncan send an e-mail, they can submit a post. It is one of the things \nthat have made possible a groundswell of people--just a few minutes ago \nthe Senator mentioned 1.6 million Americans just in the last few weeks \nsigning a petition asking for Congress to make a decision to protect \nthe American people from the harmful effects of ObamaCare.\n  They want government funded, just as we want government funded. They \nwant government to be able to continue to do the things government \ndoes. They want people to be able to rely on government to protect \nthem, to protect our borders, to protect our sovereignty, protect our \nhomeland against those who would harm us. They want government to be \nable to carry out its basic functions and its responsibility. They want \ntheir government funded. But they do not want that held hostage by \nsomething else. They do not want that funding tied to the funding of \nObamaCare in the sense that they want to keep government funded but \nthey want us to defund ObamaCare.\n  The House of Representatives shows that at least that side of DC, \nthat side of the Capitol was listening. I applaud the Speaker of the \nHouse and the other leaders in the House of Representatives who did \nthat. That suggests to me that they were listening on that side of the \nCapitol. They had many millions of Americans calling out on the \ntelephone, through mail, e-mail, every conceivable medium for relief \nfrom this bill. They listened. They listened because they understand \nthat the American people are being hurt by this. They ask the same \nquestions the Senator from Texas and I and others have asked: How many \nmore Americans will have to lose their jobs because of ObamaCare before \nCongress acts? How many more Americans will have to see their wages or \ntheir hours cut as a result of this ill-conceived law before we do \nsomething about this? How many more people will have to lose access to \nhealth coverage before Congress does something?\n\n  Just last Friday we saw Home Depot--one of America's great companies, \none of America's great success stories, one of America's great \nemployers--announce that 20,000 employees will be losing their health \ncoverage. How many more stories like this will we have to hear before \nCongress does something to protect Americans from the harmful effects \nof this law--a law that was passed a few years ago without a single \nRepublican vote in the House of Representatives; a law that was passed \na few years ago without a single Republican vote in the Senate; a law \nthat was passed--all 2,700 pages as it was then constituted--without, \nas far as I know, many, if any, Members of this body or the other body \nin the Capitol having had the opportunity fully to read it. Since then, \nof course, it has expanded. We have had an additional 20,000 pages of \nregulations promulgated, increasing rather exponentially the impact of \nthis law. The popularity of the law has not improved with time, just as \nthe complexity of the law has not become less problematic in the \nintervening 3\\1/2\\-year period.\n  So as we look at this, we think about the fact that it is important \nfor Congress to listen to the American people. Again, today it has \nnever been so easy for so many Americans with so few resources at their \ndisposal to make sure that they are, in fact, heard. So we have to ask \nourselves the question--I have to ask the Senator the question: How \nlong will it be before Congress acts?\n  I am pleased that the Senator referred to the opportunity crisis, the \neconomic opportunity crisis in America. He referred to the economic \nladder in this country. You know, I think it is an interesting fact and \nwe need to consider that--according to one recent study published I \nbelieve just in the last few weeks--for the first time in American \nhistory, 40 percent of those born in America, into the bottom quintile \nof the American economy, the bottom 20 percent of income earners in \nthis country--40 percent of the bottom 20 percent will remain in the \nbottom 20 percent throughout the duration of their lifetime. To my \nknowledge, that has never happened in this country. To my knowledge, \nthis undercuts what has long been a very distinguishing, enviable \ncharacteristic of the United States. It is what has made this the \ngreatest civilization the world has ever known--the fact that this is a \ncountry where regardless of where you were born on the economic ladder, \nregardless of the circumstances in which you came into this world or \ncame into this country, you could make it. In fact, your chances of \ndoing so were relatively strong. Yet 40 percent of those people, we now \nunderstand, will stay there throughout the duration of their lives.\n  Another study came out, also a few weeks ago, indicating that in 34 \nStates and the District of Colombia, an individual or a family is \nactually likely to see a dip in their well-being, a dip in their \nstandard of living if, instead of receiving welfare benefits, they \ndecide instead to shed those benefits and go on to an entry level job. \nThat is sad. That is sad because that suggests that our government--as \nwell-intentioned as many of those programs might be, they will have set \nin place a series of conditions that trap people, especially parents, \ninto a vulnerable, poor condition.\n  If there is one thing that I think parents feel somewhat universally, \nit is a degree of risk aversion. People do not like to take risks that \ncould jeopardize their ability to provide for their children. If we set \nup a set of conditions in which people, in order to maintain their \nlevel of certainty that they might have while surviving under a system \nof welfare benefits provided by the Federal Government--if they become \nlocked into that, locked into poverty in perpetuity because of that, \nthat is disconcerting because the risk is always too high to make that \njump to an entry level job. Without the entry level job, there will \nnever be the secondary job, there will never be the first raise or the \nsecond raise or the first, second, or third promotion. Without those \nthings, there is no ladder. Without those things, there is an \nopportunity lost and people remain on the bottom rungs of that very \nladder.\n  We see at the top rung a system of crony capitalism that sometimes \nhas the impact of keeping some people and some big businesses \nartificially held in place at the top of the economic ladder at the \nexpense of others, at the expense of would-be competitors who are \ndriven out or held out from the beginning from the competitive \nmarketplace through the oppressive intervention of the government, \nthrough the government's favoritism, and through the government's \nability sometimes, regrettably, to choose winners and losers in the \nmarketplace.\n  You see where most Americans are, right in the middle of the ladder. \nOn the middle rungs you see people working, trying to get by from day \nto day. They are able to survive, able to provide for the basic needs \nof their families. But they would like to do better. They would like to \nbe able to provide a more comfortable living for their families.\n  They find very often that no sooner do they find an increase in their \nincome than that same increase has been gobbled up by a combination of \noppressive taxes, oppressive regulations, and a devastating impact of \ninflation. When those things happen, we find people are unable to make \ntheir way up that economic ladder.\n  We find ourselves at a precipice of sorts. We find ourselves about to \nembark on a very bold experiment in which we rather dramatically expand \nthe role of the Federal Government, injecting it more directly, more \ncompletely, more dangerously into one of\n\n[[Page S6708]]\n\nthe most personal aspects of most people's lives, into the health care \nindustry. This is an industry that comprises a very significant portion \nof our Nation's economy in an area in which people feel strongly about \ntheir own right, about their own innate, inherent need and desire to \nmaintain a degree of control that is not subject to the will and whim \nof government bureaucrats in Washington.\n  At the same time the government is doing that, the government will be \nconsuming an increasingly large share of the resources moving through \nour economy, making it even harder for people who are trying to get by \nto do so and to do so without undue interference from the government.\n  This is an issue that is important to so many people. This is an \nissue that reminds people of the fact that whenever government acts, it \ndoes so at the expense of our own individual liberty. It does so at the \nexpense of our ability to live our lives as we would live them. It does \nso very often at the expense of the American economy. It does so very \noften at the expense of economic opportunity for Americans, you see, \nbecause when we expand government, we expand its cost. We make \nourselves as a country less free. We leave ourselves with fewer \nalternatives.\n  Is there a role for government to play in health care? Absolutely. Of \ncourse there is. No one disputes that. Are there improvements that can \nbe made to our health care system? Certainly there are.\n  But a 2,700-page law that was passed after Members of Congress were \ntold they had to pass it in order to find out what is in it, that has \nexpanded since then to include within its penumbra 20,000 pages of \nregulatory text, a law that has become less and less popular as time \nhas gone on--this has become very difficult. We find this becomes less \nand less something that the American people support.\n  I would ask if Senator Cruz feels that the American people have every \nright to speak out on this. Specifically does the Senator feel the \nAmerican people have every right to expect that those of us serving in \nthe Senate will do everything we possibly can, even casting difficult \nvotes, even casting procedural votes that might be difficult to cast or \ndifficult to explain? Do they have every right to do that even if it \ncauses great inconvenience for them and for us in the process of \ncomplying with their wishes?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from Utah for that very good question. \nThe answer is absolutely yes. That is the foundation of our Nation. If \nyou look at the history of government in the world, it hasn't been \npretty. The history of government for most of the existence of mankind \nhas been a story of oppression, a story of rulers imposing their will \non their subjects. For millennia, we were told that rights come from \ngovernment. They come from kings and queens, and they are to be given \nto the people by grace, to be taken away by the whim of the ruler. That \nhas been the state of affairs for most of the history of humanity.\n  The founding of our Nation embodied many revolutions.\n  The first revolution was a revolution that was a bloody revolution \nfought with guns and bayonets. But even more important than that \nrevolution was the revolution of ideas that occurred. The revolution of \nideas that began this Nation was twofold.\n  First, America began from the presupposition that our rights come \nfrom God. It is for that reason the Declaration Of Independence begins: \n``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created \nequal,'' that we are endowed--not by a king, not by a queen, not even \nby a President--but ``endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable \nRights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of \nHappiness.''\n  That is and was a revolutionary idea, and it led to the second \nrevolutionary aspect of the founding of our Nation which was that we \ninverted the concept of sovereignty. For millennia sovereignty began at \nthe top. It was the ruler who was called the sovereign. The word \nsovereignty derives from that notion. Of course, the sovereign is where \nsovereignty resides.\n  The American Framers turned that notion on its head. We said: There \nis no sovereign. Sovereignty resides with we the people. That is why \nour Constitution begins ``We the People,'' because this Nation wasn't \nfounded by rulers, it wasn't founded by elected officials, it wasn't \neven founded by States. It was founded by we the people, the American \npeople. That is the only place sovereignty has ever resided in the \nUnited States of America.\n  The Constitution, in turn, was created to lend power to government, \nnot to give it, to lend it and to lend it, I would suggest, only in \ngood behavior. Thomas Jefferson referred to the Constitution as chains \nthat bind the mischief of government, that sovereignty is an idea we \nneed to get back to.\n  I am going to suggest that for some time now the Senate has not \nbehaved as if we the people are sovereign. For some time the Senate has \nnot behaved as if each of us collectively has 3 million bosses. For a \nlong time the Senate has behaved as if the rules that matter are the \nrules in Washington, DC. That is why the most important objective of \nthis week is to make DC listen. The most important objective of this \nweek is to reassert that sovereignty is with we the people, that calls \nfrom our constituents and townhalls are not a pesky annoyance. It is \nthe core of our job. It is the core of our job to listen to the \nsovereign, which is we the people.\n  Right now we the people are hurting. If you get outside Washington, \nDC, you ask them about ObamaCare over and over, and the answer you get \nis: This thing isn't working.\n  A few weeks ago I hosted a small business roundtable in Kerrville, \nTX. Kerrville is a delightful town in central Texas. It is in the \nbeautiful hill country. If anyone wants to come to Texas, I would \nencourage you. Kerrville is a great destination in Texas.\n\n  This was a small gathering in a restaurant, about 20 small business \nowners. I asked each of them and I said: Let's go around the room. If \neach of you could introduce yourself, share a little bit about \nyourself, and then share a concern that is weighing on your heart. \nShare something you are praying about, share something you are worried \nabout, share something you are focused on right now.\n  It was a totally open-ended question. They could have talked about \nany issue under the Sun. They could have talked about Syria, guns, they \ncould have talked about anything.\n  We went around the table one after the other after the other. Over \nhalf of the small business owners around that table said to me: Ted, \nthe single biggest obstacle I face in my business is ObamaCare. Hands \ndown, not even close, there is nothing that comes close.\n  It was striking. Of those 20, there were probably 4 or 5 of them who \nrelayed some version of this same story. One was the fellow who owned \nthe restaurant we were meeting in. He said: You know, we have a great \nopportunity to expand our business. I have an opportunity to make the \nrestaurant even bigger, expand it, and from a business perspective, \nthis opportunity looks good. But he said: You know, we have got between \n20 and 30 employees. If we expand the business we will go over 50. And \nif we go over 50, we are subject to ObamaCare. If that happens, I will \ngo out of business. So you know what. I am not pursuing the expansion. \nI am not going to do it. We are going to stay the size we are.\n  One person after another around the table said the same thing. They \nhad 30 employees, 35, 40 employees. They had great opportunities to go \nopen another location, expand into a new aspect. One after the other \nsaid: We will not do it, because if we get over 50 employees, ObamaCare \nwill bankrupt us.\n  I want you to think about each of those 4 or 5 businesses and the 10 \nor 20 jobs that each of them didn't create, isn't creating right now \nbecause of ObamaCare. Then I want you to multiply that by thousands or \ntens of thousands of small businesses all across this country that \ncould be creating jobs. I want you to think about all the people right \nnow who are home wanting to work.\n  There are, by the way, I will note, some politicians who suggest that \nsome people in this country are lazy and don't want to work. I don't \nbelieve that. I think Americans want to work. Americans want the self-\nrespect that comes from going to the office, from working, from \nproviding for your family, from working to achieve the American dream.\n  Do some people give up? Sure. Can you give in to hopelessness? Yes. \nWhen\n\n[[Page S6709]]\n\nyou keep banging your head against a wall over and over again, trying \nto get a job, and you don't get anywhere, it is only natural for people \nto feel despair. I want you to think of the millions of jobs we could \nhave but for small businesses that are not growing, not expanding, not \ncreating those jobs.\n  Another small business owner around that table owned several fast \nfood restaurants. She had a problem. She owned enough fast food \nrestaurants that she had over 50 employees. I will mention the \nrestaurant business and the fast food business side in particular is \nquite labor dependent. I doubt if there is a sector in this economy \nthat has been hurt more than the labor in the fast food business. But \nher problem was she had enough stores so she was over 50 employees, so \nthat strategy wouldn't work for her. She described how she has already \nforcibly reduced the hours of every one of her employees to 29 hours \nper week.\n  I will tell you this woman almost began to tear up. She was \nemotional. She was not happy about this, to put it mildly. She said: \nListen, we have been in business a long time. Many of these employees \nwe have known 10 or 20 years. These are single moms. These are people--\nlook, if you are working in a fast food restaurant you are not at the \npinnacle of your career. You are struggling to pay the bills. These are \nsingle moms who are working hard and they can't feed their kids on 29 \nhours a week. But, you know, they can't feed their kids if I go out of \nbusiness either. If we are subject to ObamaCare, we go out of business.\n  Why 29 hours a week? Well, just like the 50-employee threshold, \nObamaCare kicks in and counts an employee if he or she works 30 hours a \nweek. One of the things that is forcing small businesses all over the \ncountry to do is to force their employees out of good full-time jobs \ninto 29 hours a week because they don't get hammered with the costs and \nburdens of ObamaCare.\n  I will mention another small business owner who I think will \nparticularly hit home with the Presiding Officer because I know the \nissues that resonate with him. This is an individual who manufactures \nhunting blinds--actually very interesting. They are hunting blinds that \nare camouflaged to look like trees. They are really very clever \ncreations. He described how he has been forced to move his \nmanufacturing overseas, to move it to China. So right now he is \nmanufacturing in China.\n  He said: Listen, I want to manufacture here in the United States. \nThat matters to me. I care about that.\n  He said this would be 150 to 200 good manufacturing jobs here in the \nUnited States.\n  The Presiding Officer and I both come from States where there are a \nlot of people who are struggling and who would love to see 200 more \nmanufacturing jobs. Manufacturing used to be a tremendous strength of \nour economy, but the manufacturing sector has been hammered in recent \ndecades. Yet this small business owner said that because of ObamaCare, \nif he brought his manufacturing back to the United States, his workers \nwould all be subject to ObamaCare and he couldn't be competitive in the \nbusiness. It would drive him out of business.\n  I would ask my colleagues to consider each of those small business \nowners and multiply it by the millions of small business owners across \nthis country--the millions of small business owners who aren't growing, \nthe millions of small business owners who are forcibly reducing their \nemployees' hours to 29 hours a week, the millions of small business \nowners who are considering moving operations overseas or have already \nbecause of ObamaCare. Why is the economy gasping for breath? Why are \npeople not able to get jobs? Because ObamaCare is killing jobs, and the \nSenate should listen to the people. We need to make DC listen.\n  Mr. VITTER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Senator. Does he acknowledge that he \nunderstands, as I do, that as this monstrosity goes into effect October \n1 and as it has all of these really devastating impacts on individuals \nand small businesses, under a special illegal rule from the Obama \nadministration, Congress and Washington get an exemption; they get a \nspecial pass; they get a special deal no other American gets under the \nlaw?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator for his question, and he is absolutely \nright. There are many scandalous aspects of ObamaCare: how it was \npassed--on a brutal partisan vote rammed through with late-night deals \nthat have earned rather infamous nicknames, such as the ``Cornhusker \nkickback,'' which has sadly become part of modern political lore; and \nthe ``Louisiana purchase,'' with all due respect to my friend from the \ngreat State of Louisiana, who was not involved in that. And one of the \nmost sorry aspects of ObamaCare is the aspect Senator Vitter refers to, \nwhich is that President Obama has chosen, at the behest of majority \nleader Harry Reid, at the behest of Democratic Members of the Senate, \nto exempt Members of Congress and their staff from the plain language \nof the statute.\n  When ObamaCare was being passed, Senator Chuck Grassley--a towering \ngiant in this body; a strong, principled conservative--introduced a \ncommonsense provision to ObamaCare that said: If you are going to force \nObamaCare on the American people, if you are going to create these \nhealth insurance exchanges and you are going to force millions of \npeople into these exchanges, then Congress should not operate by better \nrules than the American people. So he introduced a simple amendment \ndesigned to treat Members of Congress just like the American people so \nthat we didn't have this two-class system.\n  It has been reported--I was not serving in this body at the time--\nthat amendment was voted on and accepted because Democratic Senators \nbelieved the bill would go to conference and in the conference \ncommittee they could strip it out and it would magically disappear. But \nthen, because of the procedural games it took to pass it, they didn't \nhave the opportunity to do that, and suddenly, horror of all horrors, \nthis bill saying Congress should be bound by the same rules as the \nAmerican people became the law of the land.\n  So what happened? Majority leader Harry Reid and Democratic Senators \nhad a closed-door meeting with the President here in the Capitol where \nthey said, according to public news reports: Let us out of ObamaCare. \nWe don't want to be in these exchanges.\n  One would assume they are reading the same news reports the rest of \nus are reading--that ObamaCare is a train wreck, that it is not \nworking--and the last thing Members of Congress wanted to do was to \nhave their health care jeopardized. And the President directed his \nadministration to exempt Members of Congress and their staff, ignoring \nthe language of the statute, disregarding the language of the statute \nand saying: You guys are friends of the administration. We are taking \ncare of you.\n  I want to take a minute, in response to this question, to commend the \nSenator from Louisiana. Senator Vitter introduced an amendment to \nreverse this exemption, and it was a bold amendment. It was an \namendment that said we as Members of Congress should be subject to the \nsame rules as the American people. We shouldn't be treated by special \nor different rules for us. Indeed, the amendment of Senator Vitter said \nMembers of Congress should be subject to ObamaCare, our staff should be \nsubject to ObamaCare, and members of the administration--the political \nappointees of the Obama administration, who, by the way, are not in the \nexchanges--should be too. So if the President and Cabinet appointees \nand his political officials want to go into communities and tell \neveryone how wonderful ObamaCare is, then let them do so from personal \nexperience. Let them do so not being exempted but subject to the same \nexchanges and subject to the same rules the American people are.\n  The reason I wish to commend the Senator from Louisiana is his \nintroducing that amendment prompted a response that, I will suggest, \nbrought disgrace and disrepute on this body. It prompted a political \nresponse that targeted the Senator from Louisiana personally.\n  Now, we have all heard the saying ``politics ain't beanbag,'' but the \nnastiness with which the Democratic majority responded to Senator \nVitter for daring to say that the Washington ruling class should be \nsubject to the same rules as the rest of America was extraordinary even \nfor Washington, DC.\n\n[[Page S6710]]\n\nIn fact, I would note that the majority leader and the junior Senator \nfrom California, as I understand from public news reports, proposed a \nresponse to the Vitter amendment that said any Senator who votes for \nthe Vitter amendment--regardless of whether it passes but simply if you \ncast a vote in favor of it--he or she will lose their health insurance.\n  I have to admit that when I first heard of this proposed amendment, I \nshook my head in amazement. I had never heard of such a thing, and I \nsuggested to a friend who is a law professor that that would make a \nmarvelous law school final exam. Imagine this amendment being passed \ninto law and asking your law students to catalog all of the myriad ways \nin which such a proposal would be unconstitutional. In fact, I made \nthis point to the law professor I was talking to. I said: If you as a \nprivate citizen came to any Member of the Senate and said: Senator, if \nyou vote the way I want you to, I am going to pay you thousands of \ndollars that you can deposit into your personal bank account, you, Mr. \nLaw Professor, Mr. Private Citizen, would promptly and quite rightly be \nprosecuted for bribery. It is a criminal offense. It is a felony.\n\n  If, on the other hand, you or any other American citizen went to a \nU.S. Senator--went to Senator Vitter--and said: Senator Vitter, if you \ndon't vote the way I want, I am going to take thousands of dollars out \nof your personal bank account, I am going to extract them forcibly from \nyour personal bank account, well, as I told the law professor, then you \nwould be guilty of extortion and would be charged and no doubt \ncriminally convicted because under the black letter definition, that \nconduct--threatening to pay someone individually thousands of dollars \nor take thousands of dollars away from them as a direct quid pro quo \nfor how a Member of Congress votes--constitutes either bribery or \nextortion.\n  Now, let me be clear: No Member of this body is guilty of bribery or \nextortion. Why? The simplest reason is because the Constitution's \nspeech and debate clause protects all of us, such that given their \naction was proposing an amendment themselves, there is a constitutional \nimmunity. So I am not suggesting that anyone is guilty of bribery or \nextortion. But I am saying that if any private citizen who didn't \nhappen to be a Member of the Senate did the exact same thing as the \nsuggested content of their amendment, he or she would have committed a \nfelony under the plain text of those definitions.\n  So I want to commend Senator Vitter for shining a light on basic \nfairness, for enduring the vilification that was unfairly directed his \nway, and for making the point that outside of Washington is simple \ncommon sense.\n  I would suggest that if any of us were to get a gathering of our \nconstituents together, if we were to get a gathering of constituents \nfrom the opposing party and ask this question at any townhall gathering \nin our States: Do you believe that Members of Congress should be \nexempted from ObamaCare, that we should have a special rule, that we \nshould disregard the language of the statute and not be subject to \nObamaCare the way the American people are, the answer would be \noverwhelmingly no. And it doesn't matter where in the country you are \nor what your party is.\n  I thank Senator Vitter for having the courage and the principle to \nhighlight this particularly unfortunate aspect of ObamaCare.\n  Mr. VITTER. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I will be happy to yield for a question without yielding \nthe floor.\n  Mr. VITTER. Will the Senator also acknowledge that given that history \non this issue, given that illegal rule to exempt Congress, to have a \nspecial bailout, a special subsidy for Congress that the Obama \nadministration is putting into law without valid authority, and given \nthat we are debating and acting on a spending bill this week, we should \nbe voting on that? We should get a vote on my amendment and the Cruz \namendment together to block that illegal rule this week?\n  The majority leader said he had no problem with a vote on that, in \ntheory. He said that last week. He should allow a vote on this crucial \namendment, which will be filed to the bill, which will even be a \ngermane amendment on this spending bill this week, before this illegal \ncongressional exemption rule goes into effect. Would the Senator agree \nwith me?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I agree enthusiastically.\n  Senator Vitter highlights one of the many reasons why every \nRepublican in this body should vote against cloture on the bill on \nFriday or Saturday and why I believe a great many Democrats should vote \nagainst cloture as well.\n  As we understand it, we are told the amendment process on this bill \nis going to be rigged. The amendment process on this bill is going to \nbe that once debate is cut off, there will be a bill simply to fund \nObamaCare in its entirety, to delete the House language, and that other \namendments will not be allowed. The amendment of the Senator from \nLouisiana will not be allowed, the amendment repealing the medical \ndevice taxes will not be allowed, and the amendment getting the IRS out \nof the business of ObamaCare will not be allowed. Instead, it will be a \nrigged playing field.\n  The only way to prevent that rigged playing field is for Senators to \nstand together and vote no on cutting off debate on Friday or Saturday \nwhen we have that vote. If we stand together and vote no, that forces \nthis body to deal with the problem; otherwise, we know how the Kabuki \ndance ends. If cloture is invoked, if debate is cut off on the bill, \nvery shortly thereafter the majority leader has publicly announced he \nwill introduce an amendment to fully fund ObamaCare. That will require \njust 51 votes. So every Republican will get to vote no and tell his or \nher constituents they voted no. Yet magically and wonderfully it will \npass because it will be a straight party-line, partisan vote, and other \nSenators will be silenced.\n  I think Senator Vitter is absolutely correct, we should vote on the \nVitter amendment. Indeed, I would like to see the Vitter amendment \nbroadened. Another member of our conference indicated that if the \nVitter amendment were brought up, he would offer an amendment to expand \nit to all Federal employees. I think that is a terrific rule.\n  Right now, Federal employees earn substantially more than the private \nsector does. I don't think there is any entitlement to take our tax \ndollars and to live in a privileged condition being a Federal employee. \nIf Members of this body are going to go on television and tell the \nAmerican people: ObamaCare is great, it is good, it is terrific, it is \nso great, then they should be eager to live under it.\n  You can't have it both ways. Either ObamaCare is a train wreck, in \nwhich case we ought to listen to the American people and fix it, or \nObamaCare is wonderful and terrific and fantastic and all of the great \nadjectives the proponents of the bill have used, in which case Members \nof Congress, staff, and Federal employees should all eagerly embrace \nit.\n  I very much agree with Senator Vitter that it is critical we vote on \nthe Vitter amendment, and it is critical we make clear to the American \npeople there are not two sets of rules. There is not a ruling class in \nWashington that somehow gets treated differently.\n  Let me talk for a minute about congressional staffers. Behind closed \ndoors this issue generates a lot of passion. There are a great many \ncongressional staff members who are dedicated public servants, who have \noften taken substantial salary cuts to come to Washington to serve this \ncountry, who work brutal hours. Among congressional staff, just like \namong Members, the idea that they would be subject to ObamaCare deeply \nconcerns them. It concerns them on the money side and it concerns them \non the quality of care and health insurance that they will be able to \nget on the exchanges.\n  To make it real, I note there are multiple members of my staff who \nhave had very serious, even life-threatening health issues for whom the \nlimited health insurance, the subpar, the poor quality health insurance \nthat many fear will be available on the exchanges is not a passing \nconcern, not an academic concern, not a concern that let's put in \ntalking points, it is very real for a great many congressional staff, \nincluding staff in my office. If the Vitter amendment passes and \nCongress is subject to the same rules as the American people, there may \nwell be quite a few\n\n[[Page S6711]]\n\ncongressional staff who tender their letters of resignation and leave.\n  I have had one staff member already indicate she would retire after \nmany years of service, and the possibility of being put on ObamaCare \nwas a real factor in that decision.\n  If we lose some good talent from Congress, that will be a shame and a \nhardship for every office. But what does that say? If ObamaCare is such \na disaster that congressional staffers--and, mind you, a lot of these \ncongressional staffers who may tender their letters of resignation are \nstaffers working for Democratic Senators who drafted ObamaCare, who \nfight for ObamaCare every day. What does it say that staffers would be \nwilling to quit because the quality of health care under ObamaCare \nwould be so poor that they would rather go somewhere else than be \nsubject to those laws? I think that speaks volumes.\n  Neither Senator Vitter nor I in the long term has any interest in \nseeing congressional staff and Federal employees on ObamaCare, but it \ndoes have the value of highlighting how bad it is.\n  If this body is content to leave the American people stuck in \nObamaCare, then we ought to be subject to the same rules. If we are not \nwilling to live under those rules, if we say, Wow, ObamaCare scares the \nheck out of us and we don't want to be subject to it, then the proper \nanswer is not to vilify the Senator from Louisiana or any other Senator \nin this body. The proper answer is to step in and say to the American \npeople--in fact, let me suggest something that would have a powerful \nclarifying impact on this body.\n  If only Senators would behave as if their constituents were at least \nas important as their congressional staff; if only Senators were to \nbehave as if their constituents were at least as important as they \nare--to be honest, our constituents are more important. Our \nconstituents are our bosses. They are the reason we are fighting. The \nfact that this body is so torn apart by the notion that each of us \nwould be subject to ObamaCare and subject to the same rules the \nAmerican people are highlights how broken Washington is. That shouldn't \nbe controversial. That should be obvious.\n  Let me suggest to every Member of Congress, to every staffer who is \ndismayed--and, to be honest, saying they are dismayed is an \nunderstatement, to describe the degree of deep concern and even panic \nabout this. Let me suggest to every Member of Congress and every \nstaffer who is feeling that panic, direct that panic not to our own \nskins; direct that panic to the American people. Direct that panic to \nthe single mom working at the diner, working two 29-hour-a-week jobs \nwho is facing the consequences of ObamaCare.\n  Under ObamaCare, this President is getting ready to force millions of \npeople onto exchanges where they are very likely to lose their health \ninsurance.\n  In the privileged corridors of Washington, the risk of losing your \nhealth insurance, boy, that gets people worried. And it should. But it \nshould worry us even more for all the people across this country.\n  The majority leader and Members of Congress can get a sitdown with \nthe President of the United States. But 26 million Texans, most Texans \ncan't get a sitdown with the President of the United States.\n  If you are powerful, you can get a special exemption. We have seen \nthe President exempting every big corporation in America. Giant \ncorporations, he said, for a year it doesn't apply to you. The language \nof the law explicitly applies. There is no year delay of the language \nof the law.\n  For over 200 years we have operated as a nation of laws, not men. We \nhave operated as a nation that says if that is what the law says, then \nit kicks in January 1 and not a year from now.\n  What did the President say? No. Big companies have come to us. My \nfriends in big business, I am going to give you a year-long exemption.\n  If ObamaCare were so terrific, why would the President be wanting to \ndelay it until after the next election? The year-delay timing is not \nentirely coincidental. The employer mandate was supposed to kick in \nJanuary 1 of next year, and the President unilaterally and contrary to \nlaw delayed it one whole year until after the November 2014 elections.\n  If the representations that so many Members of this body make to the \nAmerican people were true that ObamaCare is terrific, is wonderful, \nthen I would think the President would be eager to have it kick in \nbefore the election. If it were a good thing, you would want the good \nstuff to happen before the election and not after the election. The \nfact that it was moved for big businesses is an indication of how badly \nthis law has failed.\n  But it is not just big businesses that have got an exemption. Members \nof Congress. Senators can get a closed-door meeting with the President \nof the United States. With much fanfare, the President came to the \nCapitol, met with the Democratic Caucus, and as was widely reported \nthey asked for a special exemption and they got it. How about the \nAmerican people? They can't go in.\n\n  One of the reasons people are so unhappy with Washington is they get \na sense that there are special rules that apply. Wall Street gets \nspecial exemptions, the big banks get special exemptions. Dodd-Frank \nsets up rules that hammer small banks, hammer community banks, hammer \nthe little guy. But what happens to the big guys? They keep getting \nbigger. Why? Because they get rules made in Washington that favor the \nbig guy over the little guy. And you wonder why there is such \ndissatisfaction in this country. But if you have political friends in \nthis administration, you too can get an exemption.\n  Labor unions have more and more been expressing their dismay about \nObamaCare as they have realized in practice the thing isn't working. \nRecently the labor unions came to the Obama administration and said, We \nwant an exemption too. Big businesses got an exemption, Members of \nCongress got an exemption. Shouldn't labor unions, shouldn't union \nbosses get an exemption? And with much fanfare the administration \nreportedly told them, No.\n  I am going to make a prediction right here and now. If the Congress \ndoes not act, if we don't show leadership in defunding ObamaCare, if we \ndon't stand together in imposing cloture on Friday, if we don't act to \navert this train wreck for the American people, before the end of this \nPresident's term we are going to see him grant an exemption for labor \nunions. That has been the pattern. Friends, political buddies--they get \na slap on the back. They get special treatment.\n  It wouldn't have been great politics to grant the labor unions an \nexemption right now, right in the middle of this debate. Right when you \nhave over 1.6 million people signing a national petition, right when \nCongress is debating it--gosh, it would have looked bad to grant an \nexemption then.\n  It is a little reminiscent of the President's remarks regarding Mr. \nPutin that were caught on tape before the last election--I forget the \nexact language, but, Tell Vladimir I will be able to work with him a \nlot more after the election.\n  I don't think it takes any stretch of the imagination at all to \nunderstand that, give it a little time, let the pesky people who are \nsort of worked up a little bit on ObamaCare dissipate. Then we will \nquietly do the exemption for labor unions.\n  Let me note the point ``quietly.'' One of the self-described fact \ncheckers--and we may talk long enough that I talk a little bit about \nfact checkers, because that is a particularly pernicious bit of yellow \njournalism that has cropped up that lets journalists be editorial \nwriters and pretend they are talking about objective facts, and \nbasically conclude as a factual matter--not as a matter of opinion--and \nanyone who disagrees with them is objectively lying.\n  One point that one of the so-called fact checkers in the Washington \nPost took issue with was an observation I made that President Obama is \nquietly granting exceptions.\n  I note that the exception for big business was announced in a blog \nposting by a midlevel political appointee in the Treasury Department, \nif I remember right, on a Friday. I may be wrong on the day but I think \nit was on a Friday. In Washington language, by any measure, when you \nannounce a major policy that impacts the whole country that exempts \ngiant businesses from your rule that you are jamming on the American \npeople and you don't do it from the White House, you don't do it from \nthe President, you don't do it as\n\n[[Page S6712]]\n\nan announcement, you don't take questions on it, you simply put a blog \nposting from a midlevel staffer, that counts as ``quietly.''\n  It hasn't been quiet since then because everyone happened to notice. \nSo my prediction right now is if we get past this, if the forces in \nthis body who defend the status quo--and, wow, are there a lot of \nforces that defend the status quo. There are a lot of people with a \nvested interest in maintaining the status quo. If they prevail, if \nObamaCare goes into effect before the end of this President's \nadministration, mark my words, you will see an exemption for labor \nunions just like the exemption for big business, just like the \nexemption for Members of Congress.\n  What are we left with then? We are left with a system where ObamaCare \nis a rule for, as Leona Helmsley so famously described them, the little \npeople. For everybody who doesn't have power and juice and connections \nin Washington, for everyone--look for the men and women at home, maybe \nyou have an army of lobbyists working for you. Maybe you have Senators' \ncell phones on your speed dial. Maybe you can walk the corridors of \npower. In that case you too get an exemption. But if you are just a \nhard-working American, if you are just trying to provide for your \nfamily, if you are just trying to do an honest day's work, make your \ncommunity better, raise your kids, set a good example, then the message \nthis President has sent--and sadly the message the Senate has sent--is \nyou don't count. We are going to treat everybody else better than you.\n  That is exactly backward. It is the hard-working American we work \nfor, not the lobbyists with tassels on their loafers who wander the \nhalls but the single mom in a diner. They are the people who are \nlosing.\n  I wish to talk about the harm to jobs and economic growth that is \ncoming from ObamaCare. Americans continue to suffer from high \nunemployment and severe underemployment. Instead of helping job growth, \nObamaCare's mandates and costs are causing businesses to stop hiring \nworkers, to cut employees' hours, and they are increasing the costs to \noperate businesses. Small businesses in particular are being hammered \nby ObamaCare.\n  Here are some recent statistics on unemployment and underemployment. \nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics report for August of 2013, \nthere are 11.3 million unemployed persons. The unemployment rate, the \nofficial unemployment rate is listed at 7.3 percent. Yet college \ngraduates over 25 face just a 3.5-percent unemployment.\n  Former Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee John Edwards used to talk \nabout two Americas. I didn't agree with a lot of things John Edwards \nsaid as a political candidate, but I actually agreed with that notion, \nand it is a tragic notion, that there are two Americas. There are two \nAmericas, A, between the ruling class in Washington and everyday \nAmericans, but there are also two Americas right now between those of \nwealth and privilege and power and everybody else. If you are lucky \nenough to be a college graduate, your unemployment rate is 3.5 percent. \nThat is pretty good. The people who are getting hammered, who are \nlosing under ObamaCare, are the most vulnerable among us. They are \nyoung people, Hispanics, African Americans, single moms. For Black \nteens the unemployment rate is over 10 times higher than it is for \ncollege graduates--38.2 percent.\n  Let me ask, when small businesses are not hiring, when small \nbusinesses are laying off people, when small businesses are forcing \nemployees to work 29 hours a week, whom do you think that is impacting? \nIt doesn't impact titans of industry. The rich and powerful are not \nlosing their jobs. They are not finding themselves forced into part-\ntime work.\n  We talked about the fast food business. The fast food business, that \nindustry is being hammered. You want to talk about what a tremendous \navenue for employment the fast food industry has been, particularly for \nthe first and second job someone has. When we look at the unemployment \nrate of African-American teens of 38.2 percent, the fast food industry \nhas been such a great avenue for advancement for minority teenagers.\n  I note I do not view that from the perspective of abstract numbers on \na piece of paper. I view that from a very personal perspective, because \n55 years ago, when my father came from Cuba, he was 18, he was \npenniless, and he couldn't speak English. But he was lucky. He was \nlucky to get to America. He was lucky to be able to apply for a student \nvisa, to be accepted to the University of Texas, to flee the Batista \nregime, where he had been imprisoned and tortured as a kid. By the time \nhe was a teenager, my father had endured more than the vast majority of \nMembers of Congress will ever experience.\n  I will note with that background it does make the back-and-forth of \nWashington pretty mild by comparison. If someone says something mean \nabout you in the newspaper, it may not be altogether pleasant, but it \nis pretty darned mild compared to being beaten and almost killed in a \nCuban jail as my dad was 55 years ago.\n  When he landed in Austin--if I could, Mr. President, I would ask you \nto put yourself in his shoes--not literally, because I think your feet \nare bigger than his, but figuratively. When my dad landed in Austin, he \ncouldn't speak English. He didn't know anybody. Imagine being in a \nstrange land where you cannot speak English, you have $100 sewn into \nyour underwear that my grandmother put there. The first thing he needed \nwas a job, so he went to look for a job.\n  The problem is if you are an 18-year-old kid from Cuba and you cannot \nspeak English, there are not a lot of jobs you can get. If you can't \nspeak English, it is pretty hard to get a job where you have to deal \nwith customers who are going to expect you to speak English. At that \npoint he didn't have a lot of skills. He was a teenager. So his first \njob was washing dishes. He made 50 cents an hour.\n  Why did he get that job? Because you didn't have to speak English. \nEven though he did not have a lot of skills as an 18-year-old kid, he \nwas perfectly capable of taking a dish, putting it under very hot \nwater, scrubbing it and setting it aside and he did it over and over.\n  When my father was here, he had no means of support other than \nwashing dishes. So what he did, one of the reasons he wanted to work in \na restaurant, is that restaurants would let you eat while you were \nworking. It was one of the perks of working in a restaurant; the \nemployees were able to eat. My father had no money for food. He barely \nhad money to pay for a tiny little apartment. In fact, he started in \nthe dorms, I believe, and tuition. That was it. He didn't have money to \nbuy food, so what my dad did is he ate at work. Since he liked to eat 7 \ndays a week, he worked 7 days a week. He would go in and he only ate \nduring those 8 hours. During the 8 hours he was working washing dishes, \nhe would eat like crazy, I mean he would just feed his face. Because \nwhen he left, the next 16 hours he wasn't eating anything, wasn't \nbuying food until the next 16 hours he showed up at work. That was the \nnext time he was going to eat.\n  Some people may look at a dishwashing job paying 50 cents an hour and \nturn up their nose at it and say: Who really cares about people in jobs \nlike that? Sometimes this Senate behaves like that. Who cares about \npeople in jobs like that?\n\n  But after some time my father learned English. I will tell you how he \nlearned English. He did a couple of things. No. 1, my father signed up \nfor Spanish 101. When he was a freshman at UT, he signed up for Spanish \n101. You might say: Why would a native speaker take Spanish 101? That \nseems a little dumb.\n  What my father would do is sit in the classroom and basically try to \nreverse engineer everything. So the professor would say milk is leche, \nand he would write it down and say leche is milk. He would try to sit \nand listen, and as the teacher was teaching Spanish he would try to do \neverything backward and try to figure out what the English was.\n  The other thing my dad would do, on Saturdays, he would go to movies. \nIn fact, when I was a kid, we would go to movies all the time together. \nIt was one of the things we loved to do together, still do. My dad used \nto go to movies on Saturday and he would sit there and watch the same \nmovie in English typically three times. He would just sit there and \nwatch it. When he first came there to Austin, he would\n\n[[Page S6713]]\n\nwatch a movie three times and have no idea of what was going on the \nfirst, second or third time. But then he would do it again and do it \nagain.\n  The human brain is a miraculous thing. As he would watch the movie \ntwo or three times, by the second time you start picking up context, \nstart picking up what was going on and start following the plot. By the \nthird time he would start following it even more. So relatively quickly \nmy father learned English.\n  I note he had a pretty exquisite incentive to learn English. His \nincentive to learn English was if he didn't, he was going to flunk out \nof school because he was taking his classes in English. He took mostly \nmath classes and math was the sort of thing you did not need as much \nlanguage as you do in other topics. But if he didn't learn English \npretty fast, he was going to flunk out of the University of Texas.\n  Once he learned English, he managed, at the restaurant he was working \nat, to get a promotion. He got a promotion to be a cook. Being a cook, \nthat was good. Look, being a cook was a lot better than being a \ndishwasher. It paid a little bit more. I don't know how much he got \npaid being a cook, but it paid better than 50 cents an hour. He had to \nspeak enough English, so when someone came in and ordered, let me get a \nsteak and potatoes, he had to know what that was and not give them \nscrambled eggs. So he learned enough to be a cook and respond to the \norders.\n  The place he cooked was a place called the Toddle House. It was a \nplace where the cooks were in front of the people. It doesn't exist \nanymore, but my father described it as a sort of Denny's. Imagine \nDenny's combined with Benihana. The menu was similar to Denny's, but \nthe cook was in front of you so you could see him. So my dad learned to \nflip pancakes. Let me tell you, as a kid on Saturday or Sunday morning \nand your dad is making pancakes, it is very cool when he can flip \nthem--you could make him flip them high in the air and catch them. But \nhe could do that.\n  I will credit my father; he invented--this wasn't for the restaurant, \nbut he did it anyway--he invented green eggs and ham. He did it two \nways. No. 1, the easy way, is he put green food coloring in the eggs, \nchopped up ham in it. ``Green Eggs and Ham'' was my favorite book when \nI was a boy. The food coloring is a little bit cheating, but if you \ntake some spinach and mix it into the eggs, the eggs turn green.\n  My dad worked as a cook to finish his way through the University of \nTexas. In 1961, my dad graduated, got a math degree. At his next job, \nhe was hired as a teaching assistant. He began taking graduate classes \nin mathematics at the University of Texas and he got hired as a \nteaching assistant teaching undergrads math. A teaching assistant was a \nbetter job than washing dishes or being a cook. It paid more and it had \nmore forward advancement. So he enjoyed being a teaching assistant.\n  He had all sorts of clever final exam questions that he would give. \nHe taught college algebra. I remember one of his final exam questions \nwas: You have a triangle with sides 11, 20, and 9. Compute the area.\n  You get students who would write pages and pages, trying to put all \nthese various equations together, trying to figure out the area. Almost \nall of them were wrong. It is a basic rule of geometry, for a triangle \nthe sum of any two sides has to be longer than the third side or else \nthey don't actually meet. A triangle with sides of 20, 11, and 9--11 \nand 9 add up to 20. That is a straight line. The area is zero. So he \nenjoyed kind of coming up with clever final exam questions. That was \none of them.\n  But from there, after being a teaching assistant, he applied for and \ngot a job with IBM as a computer programmer. This was, I think, 1962, \n1963. It was in the early 1960s. From there he got the skills as a \ncomputer programmer. He worked in the oil and gas industry. \nSubsequently, with my mother, he went on to start a small business, a \nseismic data processing company in the oil and gas business.\n  So when I was a kid, as I grew up, my parents were small business \nowners. When I talk about small businesses, similar to a great many \nAmericans, the majority of Americans, it is not a hypothetical. I have \ngrown up as the son of two small business owners, seeing the hard work, \nthe challenges of trying to run a small business. In fact, I saw my \nparents' business go bankrupt when I was in high school. I saw the up \nsides and the down sides of being in a small business. It ain't easy.\n  If my father had not been able to get that first job washing dishes \nand making 50 cents an hour, he never would have gotten his second job \nas a cook. If he hadn't gotten his second job, he wouldn't have gotten \nhis third job as a teaching assistant. If he hadn't have gotten that \njob, he wouldn't have been hired by IBM. If he hadn't been hired by \nIBM, he wouldn't have started his own business.\n  Earlier, the Senator from Utah talked about opportunity and the \nAmerican dream. When we look at a statistic, such as the fact that \nAfrican-American teenage unemployment is 38.2 percent, we are talking \nabout a generation of young people who are not getting that first job. \nThey are not getting the equivalent today of that job of washing dishes \nand making 50 cents an hour. They are not getting the job of flipping \nburgers in the fast food business because the impact of ObamaCare on \nthe fast food business is so devastating that it is not hiring workers. \nThe travesty is that they do not get to flip burgers. Flipping burgers \nis honorable work. It is not necessarily the fulfillment of someone's \nlife's ambition, but it is so frequently a stepping stone to the next \njob and the next job and the next job.\n  As a young kid, one of the things you have to learn is basic work \nskills, such as how to show up on time. A lot of teenagers are not very \ngood at showing up on time. They don't understand how to show up on \ntime. Even some U.S. Senators have not figured that out. Yet, if a \nyoung American doesn't get a job or learn to work with his coworkers, \ncustomers, their boss, how to show up on time, to be courteous, \nrespectful, diligent, and responsible, he or she can't learn the skills \nit takes to achieve in any job.\n  Some time ago I tweeted a speech Ashton Kutcher gave. It was actually \na terrific speech. It was a speech at one of those award shows where he \ntalked about the value of hard work. One of the things I remember he \nsaid was this: In my life, opportunity looks an awful lot like hard \nwork. That was a great message. It was a great message to young people. \nPart of the reason I tweeted it out and to salute him--I have watched \nhis TV shows and his movies, but I don't know him personally--was \nbecause he can speak to millions of young people who would never listen \nto me. I salute him for carrying a message about hard work, diligence, \nand working toward the American dream.\n  The greatest travesty of what is happening with ObamaCare is a \ngeneration of young people are being denied a fair chance at the \nAmerican dream. If we look at economic growth, according to the Bureau \nof Economic Affairs, GDP growth over the last four quarters has been an \nabysmal 1.6 percent. The historic average since World War II is 3.3 \npercent. Our economy is stagnant, and ObamaCare is a big part of the \nreason.\n  So I ask the Presiding Officer, where is the urgency in this body? \nWhen the Presiding Officer goes home and talks to the men and women in \nWest Virginia--or the men and women in Texas--he must hear that they \nare hurting. They understand that 1.6 percent economic growth is \nunacceptable and it is hurting the American people. Where is the \nurgency in this body? Where is the urgency to say: We have to stand and \ndo something to turn it around.\n  Jobs are being lost because of ObamaCare. A U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nsurvey of small businesses in 2013 found that 71 percent of small \nbusinesses say ObamaCare makes it harder to hire workers. The study \nalso found that two-thirds of small businesses are not ready to comply \nwith ObamaCare rules.\n  Why do we care about small businesses? Look, on one level, we care \nabout the entrepreneurs--the Horatio Algers and the people working \ntoward the American dream--but even more fundamentally, small \nbusinesses produce two-thirds of the new jobs in this country. If small \nbusinesses are suffering, jobs are suffering and America suffers.\n  ObamaCare is an absolute disaster for small businesses. Forty-one \npercent of small business owners have held off on plans to hire new \nemployees, and 38\n\n[[Page S6714]]\n\npercent say they are holding off on plans to grow their businesses in \ndirect response to the law.\n  By the way, the most egregious parts of ObamaCare still have not \nkicked in. Forty-eight percent of small business owners say ObamaCare \nis bad for business. Less than 10 percent say it is good for business.\n  Jamie Richardson of White Castle explained how ObamaCare is impacting \nher business: In the 5 years prior to the health care law, we were \nopening an average of eight new White Castle restaurants each year. In \n2013 we plan to just open two new locations. While other factors have \nslowed our growth, it is the mounting uncertainty surrounding the \nhealth care law that brought us to a standstill.\n  I want the Presiding Officer to think about that for a second. They \nwere opening eight White Castle restaurants a year--I like their little \nburgers--and that dropped to two. So six a year over the last 4 years \namounts to 24 White Castle restaurants. No. 1, just as a consumer--and \nI am a big fan of eating White Castle burgers--that is 24 places we \ncan't go to get a White Castle burger. But that is not the real \nhardship. The real hardship is all the jobs that are lost from those 24 \nrestaurants that didn't open. Every one of those stores would have \nmultiple shifts with managers, cashiers, or kids just mopping the \nfloor. All those jobs would have been on the economic ladder toward the \nAmerican dream.\n  Even within a fast food restaurant there has been tremendous \nopportunity for investment. Maybe you get hired mopping a floor because \nyou don't have any other skills or, like my dad, washing dishes because \nyou don't have any other skills. If you work a little while, maybe you \ncan move over to the fries and then to the griddle. You can move to the \ncashier desk and learn how to count change. A lot of kids don't know \nhow to count change. Sadly, because of the educational challenges we \nhave, a lot of kids don't have the skill to count change yet. They can \nlearn that. Then, if you demonstrate hard work, perseverance, and \ncustomer service, maybe you will get promoted to assistant manager, \nthen manager, and then who knows.\n  Just a few weeks ago I had dinner with a number of franchisees who \nown fast food restaurants for one particular very well-known hamburger \nchain. I listened to their stories. I start most meetings, if they are \nsmall enough that this is feasible--like the Kerrville small business \ngathering--by asking them to go around and share an issue that is of a \nconcern to them. I remember one gentleman, an African-American \ngentleman, who described exactly that path. He described how he got \nhired in an entry-level position at a fast food restaurant, developed \nskills, advanced, and then he was hired as an assistant manager and \nthen as a manager. After that, he saved up and bought his own \nrestaurant.\n\n  It was interesting. There were people--and some of the franchise \nowners had pretty extensive backgrounds. I think there was one fellow \nwho had 27 fast food restaurants. So there were some people who were \nvery successful businesspeople.\n  I remember this African-American gentleman who had relatively \nrecently saved up to buy his first restaurant that he owned and the \npride he justifiably felt--and the pride I felt. I mean, what an \nincredible country. What was interesting is that he described the exact \nsame challenges as the fellow who owned 27 restaurants and was far \nwealthier and had a far bigger business.\n  What all of them said as we were going around the table was that \nObamaCare is devastating. They didn't say it was sort of a little \nproblem. They didn't say it was making life more difficult. They said: \nIt is devastating. It is going to put us out of business. We don't know \nwhat to do. This is a disaster for our business.\n  A March 2013 Federal Reserve report on current Federal economic \nconditions explains that employers in several Federal Reserve districts \ncited the effects of the ObamaCare act as reasons for planned layoffs \nand reluctance to hire more staff.\n  In May 2013 Moody's economist Mark Zandi noted a slowdown in small \nbusiness hiring due to ObamaCare.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in the second quarter of 2013 small \nbusiness survey, found that Washington policies continue to hamper \nhiring and growth, with over a quarter of small businesses saying they \nhad lost employees in the last year. They cited health care as the very \ntop concern.\n  Concern about ObamaCare has increased by 10 points since June of 2011 \nand by 4 points just last quarter. Seventy-one percent of small \nbusinesses say the health care law makes it harder to hire. Only 30 \npercent say they are prepared for the requirements of the law--\nincluding participation in the marketplaces.\n  Among small businesses that will be impacted by the employer mandate, \none-half of small businesses say they will either cut hours to reduce \nfull-time employees or replace full-time employees with part-time \nworkers to avoid the mandate. Twenty-four percent say they will reduce \nhiring to stay under 50 employees.\n  I want to repeat those numbers because those numbers are deeply \ntroubling. Among small businesses that will be impacted by the employer \nmandate, one-half--50 percent--say they will either cut hours to reduce \nfull-time employees or replace full-time employees with part-time \nworkers to avoid the mandate. We are not talking about a few small \nbusinesses, we are talking about half of them. Twenty-four percent say \nthey will reduce hiring to stay under 50 employees. That is a disaster \nfor small business, it is a disaster for jobs, and it is a disaster for \nAmerican families who are struggling.\n  The outlook for hiring remains grim. The majority--61 percent--of \nsmall businesses do not have plans to hire next year.\n  A Grand Rapids, MI, company reported that they had to lay off over \n1,000 people due to the ObamaCare medical device tax. Let's think about \nthat. In Grand Rapids, MI, there are 1,000 people out of a job directly \nbecause of ObamaCare. Now let's think of their spouses and their kids. \nOne of the major breadwinners in their family lost his or her job \nbecause of ObamaCare.\n  On September 18, 2013, the world-renowned Cleveland Clinic announced \nthat it would cut jobs and slash 5 to 6 percent of its $6 billion \nannual budget to prepare for ObamaCare. This is not just impacting fast \nfood restaurants, this is impacting everyone. The Cleveland Clinic has \na $6 billion annual budget, and yet they are forced to fire employees. \nThe Cleveland Clinic is Cleveland's largest employer.\n  Every 4 years during the Presidential election, both parties purport \nto care passionately about what happens in the great State of Ohio. \nBoth parties focus and descend on Ohio--and a handful of other swing \nStates--as the center of the universe. Yet, as we sit here now in \n2013--not a Presidential election--somehow the concern about what is \nhappening to the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio has diminished. The Cleveland \nClinic is Cleveland's largest employer, and it is the second largest \nemployer in the State of Ohio after Walmart.\n  I would suggest that if all of the folks from this body and the \npolitical parties who descend on Ohio every 4 years are genuinely \nconcerned about what is occurring in Ohio in a non-Presidential year we \nshould see the floor of this Senate filled with Senators concerned \nabout the impact ObamaCare is having directly on Cleveland and the \nState of Ohio.\n\n  Cleveland Clinic is responsible for 80 percent of the economic output \nof northeast Ohio, according to a 2009 study. It is the largest \nprovider in Ohio of Medicaid health coverage for the poor, the program \nthat will expand to cover uninsured Americans under ObamaCare.\n  The Cleveland Clinic has close to 100 locations around the State. \nThey employ 3,000 doctors. Its main campus is recognized worldwide for \nits cancer and cardiovascular treatments.\n  (Ms. WARREN assumed the Chair.)\n  Madam President, some Members of this body might say: Well, these are \nhard times. Everyone is struggling, so maybe the Cleveland Clinic is \nresponding to economic challenges. Who is to say what the Cleveland \nClinic is doing has anything to do with ObamaCare? Well, the answer to \nthat is, who is to say? The Cleveland Clinic is to say. A spokeswoman \nfor the Cleveland Clinic said:\n\n       To prepare for health care reform, Cleveland Clinic is \n     transforming the way care is delivered to patients.\n\n  She added that $330 million would be cut from the clinic's annual \nbudget.\n\n[[Page S6715]]\n\n  You want to talk about direct job losses from ObamaCare, go to \nCleveland, OH, go to those working at the Cleveland Clinic, go to those \ndepending on the Cleveland Clinic for health care, and that is one very \nreal manifestation of the train wreck that is ObamaCare. According to \nthe Star-Ledger, in a story printed on September 12, 2013, Barnabas \nHealth, which employs over 19,000 people, is laying off employees. Why? \nWell, according to Barnabas Health, the reason is ObamaCare. According \nto a spokeswoman for Barnabas Health:\n\n       Healthcare reform, in combination with Medicare cuts, more \n     patients seeking outpatient care and decreasing patient \n     volumes--as a result, we have made the difficult decision to \n     reduce our workforce. Decisions like this are never easy and \n     we are working with these employees to help them look for \n     other opportunities within the Barnabas Health system.\n\n  This is not us putting words in their mouth. This is people on the \nground in the States dealing with the very real struggles and the \ndisaster that is ObamaCare.\n  The problem we face in Washington is that our elected officials are \nnot listening to us. We need to make DC listen. We need to make elected \nofficials in both parties listen to the very real hardship that is \ncoming from ObamaCare.\n  I would like to share a number of real constituent letters concerning \nObamaCare. So this is not me speaking. As I said at the outset, the \nreason Congress is held in such disrepute, so little approval, is \nbecause for many years now elected officials in both parties have \nrefused to listen to the people, and there is a sense of despair that \nno matter what the American people say, our elected officials will not \nlisten because they are more interested in themselves, they are more \ninterested in getting an exemption for Members of Congress from \nObamaCare than they are on fixing the problem for the American people. \nAnd that level of disillusion is not irrational. It is based on a very \nreal problem. Yet I am inspired that if and when the American people \nstand and make their voices heard, our politicians will have no choice \nbut to listen.\n  I remember early on--Madam President, you and I are relatively new in \nthis body. We have been here 9 months. I remember early on standing at \nthis very desk along with my friend Senator Rand Paul in his historic \n13-hour filibuster on drones. I remember when Senator Paul began that \nfilibuster, many Members of this body viewed what he was doing as \ncurious, if not quixotic, as a strange issue that most Members of this \nbody, frankly, were not concerned about. We saw something incredible \nhappen during that time, which is the American people got engaged, got \ninvolved, began speaking out, and it transformed the debate. As a \nresult of the American people's involvement, it transformed the debate.\n  If you want Washington to listen, the only way that will happen is if \nit comes from the American people. So let me read some letters from \nAmerican people who do not have the opportunity to come to the Senate \nfloor. I hope in a very small way to provide a voice for them.\n  A small business from Alice, TX, wrote, on August 9, 2013:\n\n       We, the undersigned employees . . . are growing \n     increasingly concerned with the apparent disregard for small \n     businesses and the middle class that is on display by the \n     United States government. We are trying to figure out how we \n     are going to cope with the 14% increase in health insurance \n     premiums we are facing, despite the fact that we have a lower \n     average employee age and loss ratio than we have had at any \n     point in our 21-year history. The increase is because of \n     insurance companies preparing for new taxes and unreasonable \n     requirements within ObamaCare.\n       On top of struggling to find the means to cover our own \n     group of employees, our government now makes it clear that \n     part of the massive amount of taxes we pay a year will be \n     used to cover 75% of health insurance costs for Members of \n     Congress AND their staffers. As waivers are granted daily, \n     shielding . . . big business, unions, government agencies, \n     and various other Affordable Care Act supporters, it is clear \n     the burden will rest firmly on middle class small businesses \n     like us. . . .\n       We strongly encourage our elected officials to place a \n     higher importance on public service than self-service.\n\n  Let me read that sentence again: ``We strongly encourage our elected \nofficials to place a higher importance on public service than self \nservice.''\n\n       We are hurting badly because of this, as are many \n     disillusioned businesses with whom we communicate in our \n     industry. Headlines nationwide report hiring freezes and \n     layoffs due to increased costs on businesses large and small. \n     The weight is too heavy at the worst time, and in result the \n     economy will soon break. We urge Congress to defund or repeal \n     the Affordable Care Act with no further delay. . . .\n\n  That is not me speaking. That is from a small business in Alice, TX. \nI would note, that is not even the CEO speaking. That is a letter \nsigned by the employees of that small business because they are \nhurting.\n  But let me note, it is not limited to the State of Texas. I guarantee \nyou, there are people hurting in every one of the 50 States, every one \nof the States we represent. A commercial real estate broker from \nChesapeake City, VA, wrote, on September 20, 2013:\n\n       I also wanted to share with you how ObamaCare is affecting \n     my business. I am a commercial real estate broker in Virginia \n     and am already feeling the effects of this disastrous bill. I \n     am currently in the process of analyzing an apartment \n     portfolio for sale for a client and recently the occupancy \n     has dropped dramatically in this class C low-income \n     community. The community is not subsidized as these tenants \n     are paying out of pocket for the rent. Most of the tenants \n     work in fast food, janitorial, and low paying service related \n     jobs. A great deal of them has had their hours cut to 29.5 \n     hours per week and cannot pay the rent. Our occupancy has \n     dropped as well as the income. Our management company has \n     reached into the City of Richmond for rent assistance for \n     these tenants but to no avail. Not only are these people \n     going to be forced into government housing but my client will \n     realize a smaller equity harvest. This is a disaster, and it \n     affects everyone.\n       As you can see by this scenario, many are affected by this \n     bill. Also, a class A franchisee with a national restaurant \n     chain whom I represent is experiencing the pain from this \n     bill. They are being forced to sell off to a larger \n     franchisee because they cannot afford to comply with the \n     requirements. I wish the American people understood how \n     severely the economy will be impacted. Thank you for fighting \n     the good fight. We are behind you.\n\n  Let me read again two sentences from that letter from a commercial \nreal estate broker in Chesapeake City, VA: ``Most of the tenants work \nin fast food, janitorial, and low paying service related jobs. A great \ndeal of them had their hours cut to 29.5 hours per week and cannot pay \nthe rent.''\n  So they are losing their housing. I want you to think for a second \nabout the spiral that comes from this. If you have someone who is \nworking as a janitor, if you have someone who is working flipping \nburgers, if you have someone washing dishes, as my dad did, and they \nhave their hours forcibly reduced to 29 hours a week, as so many people \nacross this country are having happen because of ObamaCare, they cannot \nprovide for their family on that, so they cannot pay the rent, as these \npeople cannot. But not being able to pay the rent means some of them \nmay move to government housing. And what is the answer? Look, they are \nlosing their hours because of ObamaCare. The answer is not: Well, let's \ngive them a rent subsidy. Let's tax people even more. First let's pass \nrules and laws and regulations that prevent people from getting decent \njobs. Then let's jack up the taxes even more so we can pay them to \nsubsidize their rent and subsidize their housing because they cannot \nafford to pay their rent, they cannot afford to pay their housing \nbecause of a law we passed that forcibly reduced their hours. That is \nthe path to destruction in this country.\n  Far better that we get back to our founding principles, far better \nthat we get back to what has made America great, which is our free \nenterprise system--a robust, free enterprise system that encourages \nsmall businesses to grow and to prosper, that encourages people working \na job as a janitor to work hard and get a promotion and climb that \nladder, to pay their own rent, to pay for their own food for their \nkids, to work and to advance.\n  These cries are coming from all across the country. Yet Washington is \nnot listening. We need to make DC listen.\n  A small business owner from Port Clinton, OH, wrote, on September 19, \n2013:\n\n       I strongly urge you to stand up for the middle class and \n     small business and vote to DEFUND ObamaCare. As a small \n     business owner, we have always offered health insurance. \n     After meeting with our health insurance representative, we \n     learned that the lowest coverage level of ObamaCare offered \n     is estimated to be about $400 a person, twice what we pay now \n     for excellent coverage. . . .\n\n[[Page S6716]]\n\n       With big business and government being exempted from this \n     policy, again the SMALL BUSINESS OWNER and individual are \n     left with all the costs for everyone else. This could well \n     end up closing our business and then there will be 15 more \n     individuals collecting from the government.\n\n  A constituent from Nacogdoches, TX, wrote, on May 29, 2013:\n\n       I need a little help here! Can you explain something to me? \n     My health insurance premiums for my wife, three children and \n     myself were $850 or so back in 2010. After ObamaCare was \n     passed my premiums are now $1400 or so. This January, when \n     ObamaCare is implemented it is estimated by Blue Cross \n     Blue Shield I could see a 25% increase in premiums. That \n     will be almost $1,800 a month for premiums plus on my HSA \n     plan my deductible is $10,000. If my calculator is \n     correct, that is $21,600 per year out of my pocket before \n     the insurance company pays a penny.\n       I also own a small business and have four others on our \n     group plan. If this cost increase is across the board with \n     the others as well, my business will stop the benefit of \n     insurance and each will be on their own to get coverage. I \n     understood this health care overhaul would be a benefit. From \n     where I am sitting it is only a burden. If you can, please \n     repeal this before it gets worse.\n\n  We are hearing these voices from Americans all over the country, both \nRepublicans and Democrats in this body. All we need to do is listen to \nthe people. A veterinarian from Montgomery, TX, wrote on February 20, \n2013:\n\n       I would like to bring to your attention a troubling \n     development. I am a veterinarian, and in the past had to use \n     a group health care policy offered by the American Veterinary \n     Medical Association. I am currently under my husband's \n     insurance. However, a number of my colleagues use one of the \n     various plans AVMA offers. The AVMA insurance is being \n     canceled at the end of the year. This decision is due \n     directly to ObamaCare. Here is the text of that notification. \n     Group Health and Life Insurance Trust Programs and New York \n     Life attributes the program's demise to regulatory \n     requirements put in place as a result of the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act signed by President Obama \n     in 2010.\n       Company officials told trustees that the challenges of \n     complying with provisions of the law that take effect in 2014 \n     are the primary reason New York Life opted to quit the \n     association health insurance market entirely. New York Life \n     has underwritten the American Veterinarian Medical \n     Association Trust medical coverage for the past 20 years.\n       A number of veterinarians are contract labor, called relief \n     veterinarians. These vets contract out on a daily or weekly \n     basis to fill in for doctors at various clinics when someone \n     takes a vacation or during seasonal business increases. Many \n     of those vets do not have access to health care in any other \n     way. This is a travesty. Perfectly good plans are being \n     discontinued due to a perfectly awful law. This health care \n     law is directly contributing to people losing their health \n     care.\n       My husband and I made long-term plans to potentially retire \n     early and use an AVMA plan until eligible for Medicare. We \n     also had the safety net of the AVMA insurance if something \n     happened with this job. For me, AVMA's decision is currently \n     an inconvenience. However, it removes an option for me in the \n     future. My colleagues on the other hand will likely be forced \n     into inferior health care or pay penalties through no fault \n     of their own.\n\n  We all remember President Obama told the American people: If you like \nyour health insurance plan, you can keep it. Even in these cynical days \nof politics, promises should mean something. For this woman and her \nhusband, that promise is a hollow failure. She is losing her health \ninsurance because of ObamaCare. That is not me saying that, not some \npolitician saying that. That is from her own words.\n  The rules of the Senate will not allow her or any other small \nbusiness owner to walk onto the Senate floor and speak out, to say: Why \nam I losing my health insurance? Why am I struggling? Why is my \nbusiness going under? So I am doing my very best to in some small way \nhelp provide a voice for those people who are struggling, those people \nwho are hurting.\n  But if this body were operating the way it should, there should be \n100 voices; 100 of us, Democrats and Republicans, should be standing \nside by side reading letter after letter like this. You know what. \nThese are our bosses. These are the people we work for. They are \nstruggling.\n  These letters I am reading are not ideological letters. They are not \ncoming from a partisan perspective. They are people who are seeing on \nthe ground this law is not working.\n  Yet DC does not listen to them. The Democrats in this body tell \nAmerica: ObamaCare is great. ObamaCare is terrific. I am sorry you lost \nyour health care, but ObamaCare is terrific. The Republicans in this \nbody, sadly more than a few of them, say: We will take lots and lots of \nsymbolic votes against ObamaCare, but there is nothing we can do. If \nevery Republican Senator stands together and votes no on cloture this \nFriday or Saturday, there is something we can do. We can stand and say: \nWe are listening to the American people. This law is not working and \npeople are suffering.\n  They are not interested in political games. They are not interested \nin show votes. They are not interested in the fact that if the majority \nleader succeeds in cutting off debate on this bill and there is a 51-\nvote threshold on an amendment to fund ObamaCare, at that point every \nRepublican will happily vote no. That may be solicited from the \npersonal political perspectives of the Republicans in this body, but it \ndoes not benefit the American people one iota. It does not benefit the \nAmerican people. It does not stop ObamaCare. It does not fix the \nproblem. That is what we should be doing.\n  A constituent from Euless, TX, wrote on July 3, 2013:\n\n       I have been disabled since 1997 and on a fixed income. My \n     wife lost her job of 16 years in 2008 and was not able to \n     find a good job so she was forced to take her Social Security \n     last year at age 62. She is 41-year type I diabetic and her \n     medical costs are expensive. Luckily, I was paying for \n     medical and long-term disability insurance when I was \n     working, which allowed me to continue the medical insurance \n     with a company even after I became disabled.\n       I got a letter in May of this year informing me that I was \n     going to lose that medical coverage come 2014. Since we are \n     both on a fixed income, it will be impossible for us to \n     maintain our mortgage and to start paying for all of our \n     health costs. Repeal ObamaCare.\n\n  These are voices from the people. This is a disabled man, a senior \ncouple who is suffering, who is losing their health insurance because \nof ObamaCare. Every one of us has an obligation to listen to people.\n  Look, I understand in Washington, in a football game we all cheer for \nour respective team. I cheer when the Houston Texans win a game. I am \nnot generally thrilled, having grown up in Houston in the 1970s, when \nthe Pittsburgh Steelers win a game, because I remember as a kid year \nafter year seeing the Steelers sadly trounce the Oilers and the great \nEarl Campbell when the Steelers had one of the greatest football teams \never to play the game. I understand that. It is a good thing to cheer \nfor your team.\n  In politics sometimes we cheer for our team too. So I understand the \ngreat many Democrats who take the view: Well, a Democratic President \nsigned the law, Democrats passed the law on a straight party vote so we \nhave got to cheer for our team. You know, I will note that more than a \nfew Democratic Members of this body privately, when they are behind \nclosed doors, are worried about what is happening to ObamaCare. They \nare seeing the problems. But yet publicly they are still cheering for \ntheir team.\n  This is not a team sport. This is life and death. There is a \nfundamental divide between the people and Washington. We need to make \nDC listen, listen to the people.\n  Mr. PAUL. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. PAUL. You know, Senators do not always ask for advice from other \nSenators. I thought I would come down and make sure the Senator had \ncomfortable shoes on, make sure he is getting enough to eat--try not to \neat on television. That is a little free advice that sometimes shows \nup.\n  But my question relates to ObamaCare. I think the Senator has done a \ngood job of bringing attention to something I think is going to be a \nreal tragedy for the country. As we get involved with this, there is so \nmuch talk about tactics and this or that, whether now is the right \ntime, when is the right time to do this, but I think the question is, \ndo we need to talk about something that is going to affect 16 percent \nof our economy, one-sixth of our economy? Do we need to bring up an \nissue? Do we need to draw attention and try to stop something that \ncould be damaging to the people precisely it is intended to help?\n  I think it is personally not a good idea to shut down government. I \nthink it is also, though, not a good idea to fund ObamaCare. Can they \nboth go together? Can you do one without the\n\n[[Page S6717]]\n\nother? Some, like the President, have said: Oh, Republicans, they just \nwant 100 percent of what they want or they are going to shut down \ngovernment.\n  Well, can you say something so patently false and get away with it, \nis my question. The President wants 100 percent of what he wants. He \nwants ObamaCare as he passed it with only Democrats. He wants it never \nto be changed. He wants no compromise. He wants what he wants or he is \nwilling to shut down the government. That is what this debate is about.\n  ObamaCare was passed with only Democrats, no Republican input, no \nRepublican votes. When people are saying there are problems, his own \npeople are saying there are problems. The Teamsters have said there is \na problem. Authors of the bill are saying it is a train wreck. The \nformer President came out this week and said: It is going to hurt the \npeople it was intended to help.\n  So we have got all of these people saying: For goodness sakes, slow \nthis train down. Stop this train. Stop this train wreck of ObamaCare. \nAll everybody cries about is: Oh, somebody wants to shut down the \ngovernment. The President does not want to compromise.\n  What we are talking about is, we do not want to spend money on \nsomething that is not going to work and hurt the people--precisely the \npeople it was intended to help. But the thing is, how do we fix it? \nWhat do we do? Can we scrap the whole thing? Well, the Democrats \ncontrol one body, we control the other body, they control the \nPresidency.\n  Historically what would happen, and what I think the American people \nwould like to see is, we stand up, as the Senator from Texas is, and \nsay what we are for. We are for a different solution. We are for \ncompetition. We are for the free markets. We are for bringing health \ncare to everyone with a lower price. We went through this whole debacle \nof giving people ObamaCare and it is going to be expensive. Everybody \nis going to pay more.\n  Many people still will not have insurance. The ones who do have \ninsurance are going to pay more. So what would we like? Why are we here \ntoday? Why is the Senator from Texas here today? To say to the \nPresident: We need to talk. What does the President say? He says: My \nway or the highway.\n  When the American people said they want dialog between Republicans \nand Democrats, how do we get there? We have to stand for what we \nbelieve in so they will come and talk. Does it mean we are going to get \n100 percent of what we want? No. But if we do not stand for what we \nbelieve, how will we have any dialog? How will we get to compromise? \nHow do we get them to talk to us? We are not asking for 100 percent of \nwhat we want, but we are asking for a dialog. How do we get the dialog \nunless someone is willing to stand and say: Enough is enough. When we \nlook at this, if we want to ever get to the point of getting to \ncompromise, the only way we get there is by standing and saying we \nbelieve in this.\n  It isn't about us demanding 100 percent of what we want. But right \nnow, if you look at this objectively, the President is getting 100 \npercent of what he wants--ObamaCare passed only by Democrats, not one \nRepublican vote. Really, how do we get to what the American people \nwant, which is dialog and compromise? We have to look at a deadline. We \nhave a deadline.\n  My question to the Senator from Texas is whether he wants to shut \ndown the government. Is that his intention or is it the President's \nintention to shut down the government or is it that perhaps when \ndeadlines come forward, that is a good time for dialog because no one \never seems to talk at any other time?\n  I would ask the Senator from Texas, what are his intentions? Does he \nwant to shut down the government or would he like to find something to \nmake ObamaCare less bad? I know we would both like to repeal it, but \nwould the Senator accept anything in between?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his very fine \nquestion. Let me say at the outset before I respond directly to the \nquestion that I remember not too many months ago standing on this same \nSenate floor in the midst of the Senator's historic filibuster. I will \nsay it was one of the proudest moments of my life. Indeed, during that \nfilibuster on drones, that was the first time I had ever spoken on the \nSenate floor.\n  I have observed multiple times that I will go to my grave in debt to \nRand Paul, to have the opportunity for the first time--and there will \nonly be one first time that anyone gets to speak on this floor--to have \nthat first time be in support of that tremendous filibuster that \nmobilized and unified the American people.\n  I will note that one of the things I remember the Senator shared with \nme afterward was the advice he just gave a minute ago. I remember \nasking: What do you think? The Senator was pretty weary at the end. His \ncomment at the time was, well, I wish I had worn more comfortable \nshoes. I will confess I thought about that. That struck me as pretty \ngood advice.\n  I am going to make an embarrassing admission right now. I will get to \nthe question in a second, but I wanted to make an embarrassing \nadmission first. For many years, when I was in private practice and \nwhen I was solicitor general, I wore a particular pair of boots, my \nargument boots. They were black ostrich boots. Litigators are kind of \nsuperstitious, so anytime I went into court to argue a case I wore my \nargument boots. I had them resoled four or five times.\n  When I had the great honor of serving in this body, of being sworn \ninto the Senate, when I was sworn in standing on the steps just in \nfront of us, I wore my argument boots. I have worn them every day \nsince. I don't believe there has been a day on this Senate floor that I \nhaven't worn my argument boots.\n  I had a choice with which I was confronted, which was do I follow \nthrough and wear my argument boots or do I listen to the very sage \ncounsel from my friend from Kentucky and go with more comfortable \nshoes. I will embarrassingly admit that I took the coward's way out. I \nwent and purchased some black tennis shoes. Actually, I think they are \nthe same model the senior Senator from Utah Orrin Hatch wears on a \nregular basis. I am not in my argument boots, and I will confess I do \nfeel pretty embarrassed by that. I am pretty sure, since we are on the \nSenate floor and C-SPAN is covering it, that this may not be covered by \nthe priest-penitent privilege, but I do feel it is a question of sorts.\n  The question Senator Rand Paul asked was an excellent question. His \nquestion was whether I or anyone here wishes to shut down the \ngovernment. The answer is absolutely not. We should not shut down the \ngovernment. We should fund every bit of the government, every aspect of \nthe government, 100 percent of the government except for ObamaCare. \nThat is what the House of Representatives did. The House of \nRepresentatives--232 Members of the House, including 2 Democrats--voted \nto fund every bit of the Federal Government, 100 percent of it, except \nfor ObamaCare.\n  I would note that last night on the floor of the Senate, I asked the \nmajority leader to consent to passing the continuing resolution the \nHouse passed, passing it into law. Had the majority leader not stood \nthere and said: I object, the continuing resolution would be passed \ninto law and the government would not be shutting down. The majority \nleader had every opportunity to not shut down the government.\n  Let me be absolutely clear. We should not shut down the government. I \nsincerely hope Senator Reid and President Obama do not choose to force \na government shutdown simply to force ObamaCare on the American people. \nThat would be a mistake. Instead, what we should do is listen to the \nAmerican people. Make DC listen.\n  Mr. PAUL. Would the Senator yield for one quick question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a quick question without yielding \nthe floor.\n  Mr. PAUL. Since we are making it clear, the Republican message and \nalternative here is not to shut down the government; our desire is to \nhave no ObamaCare. We desire not to have it. We think he went in the \nwrong direction. But we don't control the government. We don't control \nthe government. We don't control the Senate. It is controlled by the \nopposition party. We don't control the Presidency.\n  My question to the Senator is, If he can't get everything he wants, \nif he\n\n[[Page S6718]]\n\ncan't defund ObamaCare, which is exactly what he and I both agree on, \nand millions of people across America want us to get rid of ObamaCare, \nif the Senator can't, if he stands today and argues and cannot get rid \nof it, will he accept a compromise? Will he work with the President and \nwill he work with the majority leader if they are willing to come and \nsay: You know, you are right. We messed up on a bunch of this. There \nare a lot of people who are going to be hurt by ObamaCare. A lot of \npart-time workers are going to lose their jobs or are going to lose \nhours. There are going to be real workers who are full time who are \ngoing to lose their insurance or lose their jobs. Is the Senator \nwilling to work with us? Is he willing to work with the leader, Senator \nReid, and with the President to find a compromise?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for that question. I \nthink it is a very good question.\n  This afternoon the Senator and I and all the Republican Members of \nthe conference spent some 2 hours in a closed-door strategy session. I \nam not going to reveal what anyone else said there, but I certainly \nfeel comfortable revealing what I said there, which is that if we are \ngoing to make real progress in solving the problem that is ObamaCare, \nin listening to the American people and mitigating the job losses, with \npeople losing their health insurance, all of the harms that are coming \nfrom ObamaCare, we have to stand and fight right now.\n  The battle before this body is the cloture vote that will occur on \nFriday or Saturday of this week. If all 46 Republicans vote together in \nunity to support the House Republicans and to deny Majority Leader Reid \nthe ability to fund ObamaCare on a straight party-line vote, that puts \nus in a position to address the problem.\n  The Senator's question was would I vote for something less than \ndefunding ObamaCare. Personally, no. Why? Because I have committed \npublicly over and over to the American people that I will not vote for \na continuing resolution that funds one penny of ObamaCare.\n  I am reminded of when I first arrived in the Senate. I spent 2 years \ncampaigning for the Senator from Kentucky. Senator Paul campaigned with \nme in Texas over and over.\n  If you want to talk about a rock star, you should see, when Rand Paul \nshows up in Texas, the huge number of fans who come out for Senator \nPaul and for his dad.\n  I spent 2 years campaigning in Texas saying: The first bill I will \nintroduce in Congress will be a bill to repeal ObamaCare.\n  When I showed up, there were lots of reporters. I introduced the bill \nto repeal ObamaCare.\n  They immediately said: Well, why did you do that?\n  My response: Well, I spent 2 years campaigning telling the American \npeople that would be first bill I would introduce.\n  They were utterly befuddled why anyone would actually do what they \nsaid.\n  In answer to the Senator's question of whether I will vote for \nsomething that is a middle ground that funds ObamaCare partially, no. \nWhy? Because, as I have repeatedly told the American people, as I have \ntold Texas, I will not vote for a continuing resolution that funds \nObamaCare. But that being said, are there Members of our conference who \nwould like to see a compromise, who would like to see a middle ground \nthat is perhaps not what I very much want and will fight for with every \nounce of strength I have but that mitigates some of the damage of \nObamaCare, that responds to the people who are suffering from \nObamaCare, I think there are quite a few Senators who would like to see \nthat happen.\n  If Republicans roll over on the cloture vote on Friday or Saturday, \nif we allow the majority leader to fund ObamaCare with 51 votes, we \nwill get no compromise. There will be no middle ground because there \nwill be no reason to compromise. It is much like a poker game. I know \nthe Senator from Kentucky--many of his libertarian supporters enjoy a \ngood game of poker. As a Texan, I will admit to not being entirely \nadverse to it myself. In a game of poker, if somebody makes a bet and \nthen says to you ``if you raise me, I am going to fold,'' you will lose \n100 percent of your poker games. That is a path to losing.\n  For those Members of the Republican caucus who were perhaps not as \nadamant that we should insist on a complete and total defund now, I \ndon't intend to waiver from that position, but there may be others who \ndisagree.\n  If you want to get to any middle ground that is not a symbolic vote \nto tell our constituents but that actually changes the law to make \nthings better for the men and women at home, to mitigate the harms of \nObamaCare, the only way to do so is for Republicans to stand united and \nto deny the majority leader the ability to fund ObamaCare on a 51-vote \npartisan vote.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Would the courageous Senator from Texas yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I yield for a question without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Let me ask the Senator a question to cut to the chase. \nLet's get to the bottom line. Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, \nour respected leader of the Senate, Harry Reid, because of his \nposition, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, and \nPresident Barack Obama have all said publicly that the Affordable Care \nAct is the first step to a single-payer system. Listen to the folks on \nthe other side of the aisle, and many of them say the same thing.\n  We can call it a single-payer system, we can call it national health \ninsurance, but is this not the first step toward socialized health \ncare--socialized health care--and is stopping socialized health care \nworth pulling out all of the stops and fighting the fight?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from Kansas for that very fine question. \nHe is exactly right. Socialized medicine is--and has been everywhere it \nhas been implemented in the world--a disaster. ObamaCare--its intended \npurpose is to lead us unavoidably down that path.\n  I thank the Senator from Kansas for his good question on that front \nand for his leadership.\n  I would note that there are some Republicans, some commentators who \nhave said: Don't fight this fight. Don't fight to defund. Why? Because \nObamaCare is going to collapse on its own weight. If we just stay \nquiet, we don't take any risks. Give it time; it is getting worse and \nworse. Stay out of the way; it is going to collapse on its own weight. \nAnd there is both truth and falsity in that prediction. There is no \ndoubt that ObamaCare is going to collapse. But the problem is that the \nway it will collapse, if it is implemented, is likely to permanently \ndamage the private health insurance system, which will result in \nmillions of people losing their health insurance and having no ability \nto go back. That is what enables Majority Leader Reid to go on \ntelevision and say: Fear not, this will lead us to single-payer \ngovernment health care. Because when ObamaCare collapses in shambles--\nhe doesn't say this, but this is the necessary reasoning that leads him \nto this--it will take down the private health insurance business with \nit, so there will be nothing left.\n  Listen, I commend the majority leader for his candor. I mean, there \nis a degree of courage in embracing socialized medicine. There are a \nnumber of Members of the Democratic caucus who embrace socialized \nmedicine. I think every one of them shows courage and candor. I am very \nhappy to debate in great detail whether socialized medicine would be \ngood or bad for this Nation.\n  I don't think the American people are conflicted. If you look at the \nnations that have socialized medicine, everyplace it has been \nimplemented you see low quality, you see scarcity, you see waiting \nperiods, and you see government bureaucrats getting between you and \nyour doctor. If you go in for government treatment, you may be told \nthat you are going to have to wait 6 months, you are going to have to \nwait a year or, you know what. A bureaucrat in the ministry of \nwhatchamacallit has determined you don't get that treatment. That is \nwhat has happened in every socialized medicine country in the \nworld. And so to those on the Republican side, those commentators who \nsay this is a risky fight, I have never once suggested this is an easy \nfight. But in my 42 years on Earth, I have yet to see any fight that\n\n[[Page S6719]]\n\nis worthwhile that is easy. In his years as a marine, I would venture \nto guess that Senator Roberts never saw a fight that mattered that was \neasy. None of us were elected to this body to do easy things.\n\n  If the majority leader is right, that leaving ObamaCare alone will \nnecessarily lead us to socialized medicine because private health \ninsurance will collapse--ObamaCare will collapse--and there will be \nnothing left, what a call to urgency. Indeed, I would say the majority \nleader, in making that argument, should be one of the most effective \nspokespersons for saying we ought to have 46 Republicans uniting and \nvoting against cloture on this bill to say: No, we are not going to let \na partisan Democrat vote fund ObamaCare because we are not going to be \ncomplicit in any way, shape or form with destroying private health \ninsurance and forcing Americans into socialized medicine.\n  Let me note that in the meantime, even for those who somewhat \nserenely say: Fear not; this is going to collapse on its own. The \nprocess will inevitably be painful. Just a few minutes ago I read a \nletter from a constituent from Euless, TX, who is disabled and on a \nfixed income, whose wife has retired and who has lost his insurance \nbecause of ObamaCare. There are millions of Americans in Kansas, in \nKentucky, in Alabama, in Texas, and in States all over this country who \nare worried right now because their health insurance is in jeopardy. In \nmy view the decision of some Members of the Senate to say: Well, let \nObamaCare collapse--either on the Republican side because when it \ncollapses it will all just magically go away, or on the Democratic side \nbecause when it collapses it will lead us all to the perfect utopia of \nsocialized medicine--is easy. It is easy for Members of this body to \nsay such things from the cheap seats, particularly when the President \nhas granted an exemption to Members of Congress from ObamaCare, where \nthey feel that if the system collapses, if millions of Americans are \nsuffering, it is not going to be us. It is not going to be our staff. \nThe President has carved us out for special rules. It is just going to \nbe the American people.\n  The most fundamental divide that is happening here is this body has \nstopped listening to the American people. We ought to have the urgency \nfor this man and woman in Euless, TX, who is disabled and on a fixed \nincome and retired and who wants to keep his health insurance, that we \nhave for ourselves and our staffs. We ought to have that kind of \nurgency. And you know what. If it were our wife or our husband's health \ninsurance, we wouldn't say: Let the system collapse because, in time, \nthere will be a political victory. I guarantee if it were our spouse's, \nif it were our daughter's or son's health insurance, particularly if \nthey had significant health issues, not one of us would be serene in \nsaying: Let it collapse, because we want to immunize ourselves from the \ncriticism or because we want to ultimately move to socialized medicine.\n  I think the stakes have never been higher. In my view, the cloture \nvote we will take on either Friday or Saturday of this week is the most \nimportant vote that I will have taken--I think that any Member of the \nSenate will have taken--in the 9 months I have served in this body \nbecause it goes fundamentally to: Will we respond to the suffering \nObamaCare is causing? Will we respond to the millions of people who are \njobless? Will we respond to the people getting forced into part-time \nwork? Will we respond to the people who are losing their health care or \nwill we continue to say: For me but not for thee. Different rules apply \nto Washington that apply to the ruling class. The President can grant \nexemptions to the big corporations and to Members of Congress, but \nhardworking American families, you guys are left in the cold. I would \nsuggest that is a fundamental abdication of our responsibility. We are \nhere--or we should be here--fighting for the people.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. By chance, or maybe because of the significance of it, \nmy first question is very similar to what Senator Roberts had asked, \nbecause I have given a lot of thought to this. I haven't signed \nletters. I haven't said how I was going to vote on this issue. But it \nwas called to my attention that Senator Reid, the majority leader, \nflatly stated a month ago he believed in a single-payer system.\n  They asked him: Is it the Senator's goal to move toward a single-\npayer system? And his answer is: yes, yes, absolutely yes.\n  I just left the Budget Committee hearing. We have a great team there, \non the Republican and Democrat side, and my friend Sheldon Whitehouse \nand I had a little exchange about the new health care law, and I \nthought he was suggesting it wasn't much of a change. So I asked him \nthis, I said: The majority leader said he favors a single-payer system. \nHe said: I do too.\n  It wasn't long ago in the Budget Committee that Senator Bernie \nSanders also said he favored a single-payer system. And Senator Roberts \nmentioned others. And of course the President did. I checked the \nPresident's quote from 2003. He has denied it since, when he was trying \nto get the votes to pass the new law, but in 2003 he said he was a \nproponent of a ``single-payer universal health system.''\n  I think this is a huge national issue. This new health care law is \nclearly driven by an agenda: to have a single payer. So I ask Senator \nCruz: If there is a single payer, who will the payer be?\n  Mr. CRUZ. The payer is always the government, which ultimately means \nthe taxpayer, hardworking American families.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. In other words, the Federal Government?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I will continue to yield for a question without yielding \nthe floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Let me ask this. In other words, the government is \ngoing to be the one that pays for everything. In health care in America \nthere will be only one payer, the government, and it would then, since \nit is a predominant power, be able to dictate health policy, such as in \nthe socialized medical systems that have failed around the world; would \nit not?\n  Mr. CRUZ. The Senator is absolutely correct. Once the government is \npaying for health care, it controls health care. That has proven to be \nthe case in every country in the world.\n  I agree with the Senator from Alabama that it is commendable that \nthere are some Members of this body who openly embrace socialized \nmedicine. That is commendable for candor. I don't agree with it as a \npolicy matter, but I actually think there is virtue to speaking \nhonestly about what it is you support and not occupying the middle \nground, as those--to take a quote from Teddy Roosevelt slightly out of \ncontext--cold, timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.\n  One of the problems in this debate over ObamaCare is the relatively \nfew who are candid about what ObamaCare is designed to do. It is worth \nnoting, as Senator Sessions has, that Majority Leader Reid is not a \npassive observer from the sidelines. He is the man responsible, in his \nrole as majority leader, for passing ObamaCare through this body with \nonly Democratic votes--without a single Republican vote. So when he \nsays it is designed to lead to a single-payer system, when he says it \nis designed to lead to socialized medicine, we should trust that he \nknows what he is talking about.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, if the Senator will yield again for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. And is it not true--since Senator Reid has made his \nposition crystal clear ideologically, and based on the actions the \nSenator from Texas and I have observed--that he has steadfastly \nresisted any change whatsoever in the legislation as passed, certainly \nany change that would constrict its power and reach?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I think Senator Sessions is exactly correct.\n  If we look at the way this vote is set up, Republicans are being \nasked to vote with majority leader Harry Reid to shut off debate on \nthis bill. Any Republican who votes yes on Friday or Saturday to invoke \ncloture will be voting alongside majority leader Harry Reid to give \nLeader Reid the authority to fund ObamaCare using just 51 votes on a \nstraight party-line vote, which is exactly how ObamaCare passed in the \nfirst place.\n\n[[Page S6720]]\n\n  At the same time the majority leader has made clear he is not going \nto allow other amendments. He is not going to allow amendments that \nwould improve ObamaCare or fix ObamaCare. He is not going to allow the \namendment of Senator Vitter, as we talked about earlier, that would \ncorrect or get rid of the congressional exemption and treat Members of \nCongress the same as the American people, get rid of President Obama's \nlawless exemption, and stop treating Members of Congress like a \nprivileged ruling class who are different from the American people. \nLeader Reid has said he is not going to allow a vote on that, not going \nto allow a vote on repealing the medical devices tax that has been \ncrippling the medical devices industry, and that is killing innovation \nand killing jobs.\n  If Republicans are complicit in shutting off debate and allowing just \na single vote on funding ObamaCare, then we have only ourselves to \nblame. If we give the majority leader the power to do that, we should \nnot be surprised when he exercises it. It is within the power of the 46 \nRepublicans in this body to say no, to say: No, we will not shut off \ndebate that allows the majority leader to use 51 votes to fund \nObamaCare on a straight party-line partisan Democratic vote. We will \nnot be complicit in a process that treats Members of Congress like a \nprivileged ruling class and that ignores the cries for help from the \nAmerican people. All we have to do to accomplish that is for \nRepublicans to stand together and stand united.\n  It is my hope, my fervent hope, that the voices of dissension within \nthe Republican conference will stop firing at each other and start \nfiring at the target. And let me be clear who the target is. The target \nis not Democrats. I don't want us to start firing at Democrats or at \nthe President or at anyone else. It is not about us. The target is \nObamaCare. It is fixing this train wreck that is hurting the American \npeople.\n  If Members of the Republican conference in the Senate could devote \none-tenth of the ferocity they have devoted to fighting within the \ncaucus on this issue, to actually stopping ObamaCare--not a symbolic \nvote, not a press release, not a speech, but actually fixing the \nproblem--I could think of nothing better this Senate could do.\n  And you know what. If, instead of 100 Senators, this Chamber had 100 \ncitizens picked from our States at random, I guarantee not a one of \nthem would say in discussing this: You know what we need is a bunch of \nsymbolic votes. They wouldn't say that. Regular people who live on \nplanet Earth would know a symbolic vote is not a good thing or bad \nthing. They would say, if we grabbed any hundred--and I wouldn't even \nhave a partisan screen on it. I would grab 100 people at random, and I \nguarantee you they would say: We have to fix ObamaCare. This thing is \nhurting people.\n  The problem is too many Members of this body are not listening, and \nwe need to make DC listen.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, without yielding the floor, will the \nSenator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I notice a real low number of jobs being created this \nyear. And the reports were that 77 percent of those jobs created this \nyear were part-time, not full-time jobs.\n  Allan Meltzer, one of the great economists in the last 50 years, a \nknowledgeable observer of our economy, just testified in a Budget \nCommittee maybe 3 hours ago that ObamaCare was a factor in that \noccurring.\n  Would the Senator agree that we have had this extraordinary increase \nin part-time jobs rather than full-time jobs, and that is hammering \nworking Americans who need full-time work?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Senator Sessions is absolutely right. One of the most \ndevastating consequences of ObamaCare is that it is forcing so many \nAmericans into part-time work. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce 2013 second \nquarter small business survey found that among small businesses that \nwill be impacted by the employer mandate, 50 percent of small \nbusinesses say they will either cut out to reduce full-time employees \nor replace full-time employees with part-time employees to avoid the \nmandate, and 24 percent say they will reduce hiring to stay under 50 \nemployees.\n  As Senator Sessions knows, this is not one isolated anecdote here or \nthere. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, this is 50 percent of \nsmall businesses reducing employees' hours forcibly or just hiring \npart-time employees instead. This is an enormous problem. Who gets \nhurt? When someone gets their hours reduced to 29 hours a week, it is \nnever the CEO. It is usually not the lawyers. It is usually not the \nprofessionals. It is absolutely never Senators and Members of Congress.\n  The people whose hours get forcibly reduced are almost always, \nwithout exception, the vulnerable among us. They are the young, they \nare the Hispanics, the African Americans, the single mom working in a \ndiner, struggling to feed her kids, to be a good example to her kids, \nwho suddenly finds instead of having one job where she works her \nfingers to the bones to take care of her kids, she has to get two \nbecause 29 hours a week is not enough to provide for her kids. Suddenly \nshe has two jobs, both at 29 hours a week. She has to commute from one \nto the other. She has to deal with two bosses. Boss No. 1 says: I want \nyou at work Tuesday morning. Boss No. 2 says: I want you at work \nTuesday morning. What is a single mom supposed to do?\n  Earlier this afternoon I read from a constituent's letter talking \nabout low-income housing in Virginia, where a significant percentage of \nthe residents were janitorial or service industry workers and were \npaying their rent out of their own pocket. Because of ObamaCare, \nbecause of having their hours reduced, they weren't able to pay the \nrent. I will read two sentences from a constituent letter from a \ncommercial real estate broker in Chesapeake City, VA.\n\n       Most of the tenants work in fast food, janitorial, and low-\n     paying service-related jobs. A great deal of them had their \n     hours cut to 29.5 hours per week and cannot pay the rent.\n\n  So they are losing their apartments and being forced to live \nelsewhere. This is a tragedy playing out across this country, and it is \nincumbent on this body to listen to the people. We need to make DC \nlisten.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question \nwithout yielding the floor?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I will yield for a question without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I know the Senator is aware that the number of people \nemployed in the workforce today has fallen to the lowest level since \n1975 and wages have declined. We learned today in our Budget Committee \nhearing we have had a surge from around 300,000 people working part-\ntime to 1 million.\n  These are bad trends, but one place has avoided that; that is, the \nWashington, DC, area. It has had more job growth, higher income job \ngrowth than any place in America.\n  If this bill becomes entrenched into law, will it not create a huge \nadditional increase of government workers and bureaucrats in and around \nthis city, all riding on the backs of American workers?\n  Mr. CRUZ. The Senator from Alabama is absolutely correct. One of the \ndisturbing trends we have seen in recent years is the boom business in \nour economy is government. There are lots of consequences to that; one \nis that the best and the brightest learn, hey, you want to have \nsuccess, go into government. The private sector? That is apparently not \nwhat America is about.\n  Look right now at government employees who are paid substantially \nmore than their counterparts in the private sector. It is one of the \nreasons Senator Vitter's amendment would say that Members of Congress \nshall be subject to the same rules as the American people and not have \nthe special exemption President Obama has put in place is so important \nand why I support an even broader amendment that would include all \nFederal employees on the ObamaCare exchanges.\n  Our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle routinely say \nObamaCare is terrific, it is great. If that is the case, then Members \nof Congress should be excited about being on those exchanges, which are \napparently so great for our constituents, and so should Federal \nworkers. But they are not, indeed, as the Senator from Alabama knows \nwell.\n  This issue has caused more consternation among Members and \ncongressional staff than probably any\n\n[[Page S6721]]\n\nother issue because people are quite rightly afraid of losing their \nhealth insurance and losing their coverage.\n  That concern is not irrational. There are many good public servants, \ncongressional staffers who are Federal employees, even who are Members \nof the Senate. It is not irrational at all for them to be concerned \nabout losing their health insurance and forced onto poor-quality health \ninsurance. But that desire shouldn't push us to say let's exempt them. \nWe don't want to be subject to it. That desire should push us to fight \nfor hard-working American families. That desire should say: If we don't \nwant to be on the exchanges, let's not make anyone else be on them. \nThat divide between Washington--the ruling class--and the American \npeople is the most significant reason for the disillusion we see.\n\n  The view from Americans all over this country--and this is true of \nconservatives and liberals--is that Washington doesn't listen. \nPoliticians don't listen. We just had an August recess. A significant \nnumber of Members of this body held no townhalls, didn't go back and \nlisten to their constituents. You can't fault Americans for saying \npoliticians don't listen to us when, in fact, politicians don't listen \nto us. That is what this fight is about.\n  If it is just up to Washington, we are not going to have to do \nanything to stop ObamaCare. For one thing, Members of Congress and \ntheir staff are exempted so there is no urgency. But if we listen to \nthe American people, there is urgency. That is why it is so critical \nthat we make DC listen.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, if the Senator would yield for another \nquestion.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I would be happy to yield for a question without yielding \nthe floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I know the Senator is aware that Senator Baucus, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, a long-time Senator who I believe \nhas announced he is not going to run again but shepherded this \nlegislation through the Senate and worked in many ways to try to make \nit better--lost some battles in that time--has referred to this as a \n``train wreck'' because there are so many things going wrong right now. \nDid the Senator hear that from him?\n  It seems to me we are at a point where we have to push hard. That is \nthe conclusion I have come to, and I will ask the Senator's opinion. It \nseems to me we are at a position where we need to push hard to force \ndiscussion of this legislation because the majority leader wants to \nmake it even bigger government, to take it even further. He is blocking \nand going to resist any attempt to have real debate, real amendments \nbeing offered. He will not allow votes, and he is going to fill the \ntree and otherwise dominate the Senate so we can't even have the \nclassic debate and amendments and votes to improve this train wreck of \na law.\n  Is that the way the Senator sees the situation we are in today?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Senator Sessions is absolutely correct. I would note, first \nof all, the Senate Democrat who is the lead author of ObamaCare has \nreferred to ObamaCare's implementation as ``a major train wreck.'' That \nis not I speaking. That is not Senator Sessions speaking. That is the \nlead author of ObamaCare, a Democratic Senator.\n  I commend his candor. It is indeed a major train wreck. I have no \ndoubt that more than a few of his colleagues on that side of the aisle \nwere unhappy with him for speaking the truth on that.\n  There should be a lot more truth-speaking in this body, not engaging \nin partisan team politics but speaking the truth for the American \npeople. That was commendable for Senator Baucus to speak for the \nAmerican people and say this is a major train wreck. We need to all \nacknowledge it is a major train wreck and then step forward to avert \nthe train wreck.\n  Senator Sessions' second point is a very important one. I note \nSenator Sessions is an elder statesman in this body, has served \nadmirably a great many years, fighting for the citizens of Alabama, and \nis well experienced when a day a time existed when the Senate operated \nlike a deliberative body, where Senators would speak and offer \namendments and amendments could be considered. That doesn't occur now.\n  The practice Senator Sessions referred to, and I suspect some folks \nmay not be familiar with, is called filling the tree. Filling the tree \nhas become commonplace. Filling the tree is a procedural and \nparliamentary tree that only the majority leader can do. The majority \nleader has a privileged role under the Senate rules in that he has \npriority of recognition, the ability to insist he is the first Senator \non the floor to be recognized.\n  Filling the tree enables him to do what he has said he is going to do \non this bill, which is file an amendment to fund ObamaCare in its \nentirety and then fill the tree so no other Senator can offer any \namendments, so the other 99 Senators are muzzled, we can't offer \namendments to improve ObamaCare, we can't offer amendments to fix \nObamaCare, and we can't offer amendments to do anything. Indeed, the \nmore liberal Members of the Democratic caucus can't offer amendments to \nadopt a single-payer socialized medicine system, which some of them \nopenly embrace. That is a sign of a Senate that is not working.\n  There should be open debate and there should be open amendments. One \nof the great strengths of this body is that all 100 Senators for most \nof the history of the Republic could offer any amendment at virtually \nany time. That has all but disappeared. Why has it disappeared?\n  For folks who are at home watching this debate, it is easy to let the \nprocedure make your eyes glaze over. When you hear someone talk about \ninvoking cloture on the motion to proceed, it is utterly \nincomprehensible to virtually anyone in the country. Indeed, I suspect \nmore than a few people on the floor of the Senate right now don't quite \nunderstand what it means.\n  But what is all the procedure about? Why should you care about \nfilling the tree? You should care about it because it is a tool of \npower, of silencing the people, and using the positions of power to \nenforce Washington's ideological view on the rest of this country.\n  If we got out of Washington, DC, if we went to the American people \nand said what are your top priorities--we actually have. We don't have \nto hypothesize about that. The American people over and over again say \njobs and the economy are their top priorities. The American people want \nObamaCare stopped because it is not working, it is killing jobs, it is \npushing people into part-time work. Yet this Senate has not been \nlistening to the American people.\n  We need to make DC listen.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would also observe, and the Senator probably is \naware, it does appear there is a budget point of order against this \nwhole continuing resolution. I want to mention a couple of things.\n  I want to thank the Senator for having the courage to stand here and \nraise the concerns I am hearing all over my State. I had three separate \nmeetings in August, as I traveled the State, with small business \ngroups. It is difficult to overstate the concerns they have with this \nlaw. They tell me without a doubt it is impacting their willingness to \nhire and the uncertainty in the workplace is damaging business in \nAmerica, and they are passionate about it.\n  They are struggling to get by. They are laying off people and they \nare not happy about it. They say this law alone is the primary thing \nthat is hammering them in this country. I have given a lot of thought \nto it. I am beginning to see that we have to use the opportunities we \nhave to confront this issue and talk about it and try to force some \nchanges and improvements.\n  I appreciate the effort, and I am going to support the Senator. I am \ngoing to oppose any advancing of the final bill that does not provide \nsome change in ObamaCare.\n  I did not sign the letter, and have some great friends who see it \ndifferently than I do who likewise are totally opposed to the health \ncare law. I want to be sure people who are listening need to know good \npeople, I think, can disagree on this. But the Senator stood up and \nraised the question and forced us to confront it and talk about it and \nI think it is good. I intend to support him. I am not going to vote to \nmove a bill where we are sure we are going to be blocked from having \nany\n\n[[Page S6722]]\n\nmeaningful discussion on one of the most historic, damaging laws in \nmaybe the last hundred years that would basically move us to single-\npayer, government-run socialized medicine. I think that is where we are \nheading.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership. Hopefully we can begin to \nforce this Senate to act. The House has already acted. They have \nrepeatedly acted to fix this legislation, because it is so damaging. \nBut the Senate, the Democratic Senate, refuses to act. It refuses to \nlisten. That is the problem I have. One way I have to express that is \nto support the position the Senator has taken.\n  I thank him very much and wish him good luck.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Alabama for his question and \nfundamentally for his support. His support is very needed. Senator \nSessions is a man who is respected in this body. He commands the \nrespect of his peers.\n  If you read the newspapers, the votes have already been decided. If \nyou watch the TV commentators, I read one newspaper article--it was \nactually styled a news article--that talked about the ``effort to \ndefund ObamaCare, which is doomed to fail.''\n  That was the lead, the opening line of what purported to be an \nobjective news article. A lot of folks in official Washington and the \nWashington establishment have said there is no way this can happen.\n  Three weeks ago they said there is no way the House is going to vote \nto defund ObamaCare. Three weeks ago you read it was impossible, cannot \nhappen, will not happen. Yet on Friday the House voted overwhelmingly \nto defund ObamaCare.\n  This week it is all the same pundits. A funny thing: Everyone who \nsaid it is impossible in the House--apparently there are no \nconsequences for their being proved laughingly, totally, completely \nwrong. And they all come out with the same certainty, the same deep \nbaritone voices, to say it is impossible that the votes will be there \nin the Senate. Republicans will not stand together.\n  Let me point to just a minute ago. Senator Jeff Sessions who, as he \nknows, was not on the letter Senator Mike Lee circulated, was not \ninitially part of the group--according to all of the press, anyone who \nwas not on the letter was necessarily going to oppose us, and Senator \nSessions is here, courageously standing, and I appreciate his \nleadership, his principle, and his courage. I am going to suggest this \ndebate is having exactly the function it is supposed to.\n  Back when this body was in fact the world's greatest deliberative \nbody, as it was reputed to be, debates were about moving hearts and \nminds and making the case. How can we best serve the American people? \nNow, sadly, debates usually occur in an empty Chamber and the \nWashington establishment tells us this is the result of the vote before \nit happens.\n  Let me note for those of you keeping score at home, the momentum has \nconsistently been in favor of defunding ObamaCare. Two months ago \neveryone said it was impossible, the American people were not behind \nit, the House was not behind it, the Senate was not behind it, it could \nnot happen. We saw the American people unite. We saw over 1.6 million \nAmericans sign a national petition, we saw the House unite, and now the \nSenate must unite, and I am grateful to Senator Sessions for his \nleadership and his support.\n  Mr. RUBIO. I thank the Senator for his efforts here today and in the \nweeks that led us here. I ask the Senator from Texas--let me preface \nthis by saying so much of the focus--if you read the coverage, all the \nfocus is on what is going to happen, the process, the votes, who is \ngoing to vote what. I think that is important and I think we will have \na conversation about that in the moments to come.\n  What I am most enthusiastic about in the last few hours is there is \nan increasing focus on why. Why are people so passionate about \nObamaCare, particularly those who are opposed to it? Why is there a \ngrowing number of Americans coming out and saying ObamaCare is a bad \nidea? Why are Republicans united against ObamaCare?\n  Let's be clear. We do have a tactical debate going on in the \nRepublican Party about the right way to stop ObamaCare. What there is \nno debate about among Republicans is this is a bad idea for the \ncountry. Why are we so passionate about that? I only speak for myself \nin what I am about to say, and I think it speaks for others. I will ask \nthe Senator from Texas to comment in a moment about that. I think \nsometimes when you are born and raised, as I have been, your whole life \nin this country, speaking for myself, sometimes it is easy to take for \ngranted how special America is because this is all you have known, this \nis all we have ever been around so we take that for granted a little \nbit.\n  I had a blessing, similar to the same one the Senator from Texas had. \nI actually grew up around people who knew what life was like somewhere \nelse. They knew what America had is special because they lived \nsomewhere else and they knew what the world was like outside of \nAmerica. It is a reminder that what makes America different and special \nfrom the rest of the world is that it is one of the few places in human \nhistory where no matter where you start out in life, no matter how poor \nyou were, no matter how poor your parents were, no matter how \ndisconnected they may be from power, if you are willing to work hard \nand you are willing to sacrifice, you can have a better life.\n  For us Americans, that seems, of course, right. That is the way it \nhas always been. It is not. In fact, for almost all of human history \nthat has not been the case. In much of the world that is still not the \ncase. For almost all of human history almost everyone who has ever \nlived is basically trapped by whatever they were born into. If your \nparents were poor, you were poor. If your parents were farmers, you \nwere a farmer. I want you to think about what that means for a moment. \nImagine for a second--because all of us have dreams and hopes, when you \nare young, especially. Imagine for a second if you are someone with \ntalent and dreams and aspirations and ambitions but knowing that in the \nsociety you live in, none of that matters because you are not from the \nright people. You don't come from the right family. Imagine how \nfrustrating that must be.\n  That is the story of humanity up until about 200 years ago when the \nAmerican experiment began, based on something very powerful the Senator \nfrom Texas talked about a moment ago, the idea that every single one of \nus has a God-given right to go as far as our talent and our work will \ntake us.\n  The result is the most extraordinary story in all of human history. I \npoint that out today because I remember growing up knowing my parents \nwanted me to clearly understand that I would have a chance to do things \nthey never had a chance to do because I lived in an extraordinary place \nunlike any that had ever existed before.\n  Fast forward to today and the challenges we face as a country. The \none thing that most worries me as I analyze American politics and the \nstate of our country is there is a growing number of people who are \nstarting to doubt whether that dream is still true; a growing number of \npeople who are starting to wonder is it still true that if you work \nhard and you sacrifice, you can get ahead. Do you know why they are \ndoubting that? Because they are working hard, they are working harder \nthan they ever have, they are sacrificing, and not only are they not \ngetting ahead, they are struggling to keep from falling behind.\n  There are a lot of reasons why this is happening. Globalization has \nchanged the nature of our economy. So have advances in information \ntechnology. We have an emerging skills gap in this country where \nunfortunately many Americans have not acquired the skills needed for \nthese new jobs in the 21st century. We have to address these things. \nSocietal breakdown is real. It is having an impact. In fact, it is one \nof the leading causes of poverty in the United States, and that is \ntroubling too.\n  But for those of us who are in the Federal Government and in the \npolicymaking branch of government, I think it is time we realize that \none of the leading threats to the American dream is the policies that \nare being pursued at the Federal level, policies that are undermining \nthe free enterprise system. Here is why that is important--because the \nonly economy, the only economic system in human history that rewards \nhard work, sacrifice, and merit is the American free enterprise\n\n[[Page S6723]]\n\nsystem. The evidence is all over the world. Look all over the world at \npeople whose families have lived in poverty for generations, who now \nhave joined the middle class. They live in countries that are trying to \ncopy the American economic example. They don't live in countries that \nembrace socialism, they don't live in countries that embrace big \ngovernment. They live in places that are trying to move toward free \nenterprise. Free enterprise has eradicated more poverty than all the \ngovernment programs in the world combined. That is the story of free \nenterprise. That is why it is startling that over the last few decades, \nFederal policies have contributed steadily to undermining the free \nenterprise system.\n  We talk about all those policies, but ObamaCare is an example of \nthat. You ask yourself how does ObamaCare undermine the free enterprise \nsystem? There are a few examples. First, because of the disruptive \ncosts and rules created by ObamaCare, there are thousands of middle-\nclass jobs that will not be created. These are jobs that were going to \nbe created that someone wanted to create. I met a restaurant owner. I \nthink he was from Louisiana. He testified before the Small Business \nCommittee. He wants to open new restaurants. He has specific sites in \nmind. He knows he can make it work. He is not going to do it and he \ncites ObamaCare as the reason why. Those are jobs that were going to be \ncreated that do not now exist because of ObamaCare. That undermines the \nfree enterprise system.\n  ObamaCare has a mandate. It has already been discussed here on the \nfloor. It says if you have more than 50 full-time workers, you have to \nlive by a bunch of mandates that it creates. Do you know what the \nresult of that has been? Businesses close to that number are deciding I \ndon't want to have 50 employees, I want to have 48 or 49 so that \ndoesn't apply to me because I can't afford for it to apply to me. Do \nyou know what that means? That means those were jobs that were going to \nbe created or those are jobs that were there but now they are part \ntime. That means you lost money out of your paycheck.\n  It also has redefined, ObamaCare has redefined what part-time work \nis. An American economic reality is that part-time work is anything \nless than 40 hours, except for ObamaCare, anything less than 30 hours. \nSo what is happening? People working part time are losing their hours.\n  Real world example. Sea World in Florida just announced it is moving \nover 2,000 of its part-time employees from 32 hours a week to 28 hours \na week. That is not just a statistic. These are people who are losing 4 \nhours' worth of pay a week.\n  The very people that this bill is supposed to be helping, the working \nclass and middle class--the people who are trying to get ahead--are the \npeople it is directly hurting. That is just one example. There are \nmultiple examples. Senator Cruz and I could cite examples all night of \nreal people who will be hurt in this way.\n  I have one more point that has not been talked about enough. Medicare \nAdvantage is a program that gives seniors choices. It has competition. \nThere are different companies that provide Medicare Advantage benefits, \nand they compete for the business of seniors by offering additional \nbenefits.\n  My mom is a Medicare Advantage recipient. She is heavily marketed \nevery year because--like all seniors are in that area--they want her \nbusiness. How do they compete? They offer transportation, free \npharmaceuticals, or whatever it may be. Well, guess what. ObamaCare \ntakes money out of Medicare Advantage, not to save Medicare but to fund \nObamaCare. Later this year--in early January--these seniors are going \nto get a letter in the mail saying that their Medicare Advantage plan \nno longer offers X, Y, or whatever some of these benefits are. That is \njust another example of who is hurt by this.\n  Why are we passionate? Why are we here about this? Look, we have an \nideological objection to the government being involved in such a \nwidespread way in health care, but now it is beyond that. We are \npassionate about this opportunity that we have to stop ObamaCare \nbecause of the impact this is having on real people. At the end of the \nday, that is what we are fighting for. We are not fighting against \nObamaCare, and we are fighting for these people.\n  By the way, the people we are fighting for includes people who voted \nfor the President. This includes, by the way, people who didn't vote \nfor me or the Senator from Texas or the Senator from Utah. We are \nfighting for them because they are going to be hurt by this.\n  If your dream is to open your own business one day and to grow it, \nObamaCare will hurt you. It is going to make it harder for you to be \nable to do that. If your dream is to do what my parents did, which is \nto work a job so your kids could one day have a career, ObamaCare is \nhurting you too. It could cost you the insurance you have now that you \nare happy with. It could cost you hours out of your paycheck. It could \ncost you your very job.\n  What about if you are working part time while you go to school at \nnight? If you are paying your way through school as a part-time worker, \nObamaCare is going to hurt you. You are going to lose hours at work \npotentially because of ObamaCare. What if you graduated from college? \nYou finished college and have done everything that has been asked of \nyou.\n  What do we tell young people in America who go to school, get good \ngrades, a degree, and dream of having a career and better life? What do \nthey want to do? They want to graduate from college, get married, buy a \nhouse, and start a family. A lot of people are having to put that off \nfor a lot of reasons. ObamaCare will be one of the reasons. You know \nwhy? Because that job or career you wanted to start may not be created \nnow because of ObamaCare.\n  What if you worked your whole life--like the 3 million seniors who \nlive in Florida--and are living with dignity, security, and stability, \nand can finally sign up for the Medicare Advantage plan, but now \nObamaCare is hurting you? That is the irony in all of this. The very \npeople they said this plan--this bill, this idea--would help are the \nvery people it is hurting the most. That, by the way, is the experience \nof big government.\n  I know that big government sounds appealing sometimes when you are \nhurting and struggling to make ends meet and then a politician comes \nalong and says: I'm going to create a new program called jobs for \nAmericans and health care for everybody. When you are struggling, this \nstuff sounds enticing. The problem is it never works. Anytime and \nanywhere it has been tried, it has failed, and it will fail again. It \ndoesn't work.\n  In fact, big government hurts the people who are trying to make it. \nIf you are a multibillion-dollar corporation or a millionaire or \nbillionaire, you may not like big government, but you can afford to \ndeal with it. If you are a major corporation in America, you can hire \nthe best lawyers in America to navigate whatever complex rules the \ngovernment throws at you. If you really don't like it, you can hire the \nbest lobbyist in this city to write the laws in your favor or try to \nget them written in your favor.\n  However, if you are trying to start a business by using the free wi-\nfi at Starbucks or you are using the spare bedroom in your home to \nstart a business, you can't navigate all of that big government stuff. \nYou can't afford to hire a lobbyist to get a waiver from ObamaCare. \nThat is the irony of this. The very people that big government promises \nto help are the people it hurts the most, and we are seeing it again \nwith ObamaCare.\n  Who is getting waivers from ObamaCare? The people who can afford to \ninfluence it. That is the experience of big government. It is the \nexperience of ObamaCare, and that is unfair. That is just not fair. It \nis not fair that in America the people who are willing to work hard and \nsacrifice are not able to achieve a better life. That is wrong.\n  The only way to assure that those opportunities are there is to \nembrace the free enterprise system, not to undermine it or try to \nreplace it with an expansion of government that in the end will \ncollapse under its own weight. But that is the direction we are headed \nin right now.\n  You want to know what the biggest issue facing America politically \nis? It\n\n[[Page S6724]]\n\nis not whether Republicans or Democrats win the next election, it is \nwhether we will continue to be an exceptional country where anyone from \nanywhere can accomplish anything or whether we will become like the \nrest of the world, just another powerful, rich country with a big \neconomy, but no longer the place where hard work and sacrifice is \nenough. That is the choice we are being asked to make on issue after \nissue that comes before this body, and especially on this one.\n  I will yield back to the Senator from Texas by just saying this: My \nparents were never rich. I told this story before, but I tell it, not \nso much to talk about me, but to talk about us, because this is our \nstory, not just mine. My parents were never rich. When they came here, \nthey didn't know anybody. They had no money or connections. They barely \nspoke the language. When they first came here, they struggled. They \nwere discouraged. Sometimes they wondered if they made a mistake. \nSometimes they thought that maybe they should have stayed back in Cuba. \nUltimately, they persevered and hung in there.\n  Ten years after they had been here, my dad was working as a bartender \nand my mom worked as a maid and a cashier. They bought their first home \nin 1966. In fact, by 1971, they were so optimistic about the future, \nthat after both of them were over 40 years of age, they had me, and \nthen my sister a year and a half after that. Talk about optimistic \nabout the future. America fundamentally changed their lives because of \nfree enterprise.\n  My dad had a job at those hotels because someone had access to money \nand risked it. They took a risk and said: I am going to invest this \nmoney into opening up a hotel because I believe in my idea. Because \nsomeone took a risk, my dad and my mom had a job. They weren't rich. We \nnever owned multiple homes. We never had a yacht. We never traveled to \nEurope. There is nothing wrong with any of those things.\n  My parents lived the American dream. Why? Because they lived a life \nno one in their family history had ever lived in terms of stability and \nsecurity, and they were able to provide opportunities for their \nchildren they themselves never had. That is the American dream. It is \nabout being able to fulfill your God-given potential, whatever it may \nbe, and it is what is at play right now.\n  There are millions of people in this country who are trying to \nachieve their American dream. There are millions of people across \nAmerica who are trying to do what my parents were able to do for me and \nwhat Senator Cruz's parents were able to do for him. Our job is to make \nit easier for them to do it, not harder. Our job is to do everything we \ncan to ensure that this is the one country on Earth where that is still \npossible.\n  When we pass bills such as ObamaCare, which claims to help people \nlike this, we are not helping them. We are hurting them. If we hurt \nthem, we hurt the country because there cannot be an America without an \nAmerican dream. We can't be special and exceptional without the \nAmerican dream, and that is what is being undermined by big government \nand by ObamaCare.\n  At the end of the day that is why we are so passionate about this, \nand that is why this is an issue worth fighting for.\n  The Senator from Texas was reading stories and cases earlier today \nthat he heard from around the country, and that is what these people \nare telling us. That is what they are saying to us. They are saying: \nAll we want is a chance to turn our dreams into reality. All we want is \na chance to be able to work hard and sacrifice so we can achieve a \nbetter life. All we want is for you guys to give us a chance.\n  I ask the Senator from Texas: Isn't that what this issue is all \nabout?\n  Mr. CRUZ. The junior Senator from Florida is absolutely correct. I \nagree entirely. Senator Rubio is inspiring. Senator Marco Rubio is a \ncritical national leader. When Senator Mike Lee began this fight, Marco \nRubio was there from day one. He was there from the beginning, despite \nthe protests and despite official Washington saying that he should know \nbetter than to stand against the DC establishment and stand for the \npeople.\n  I don't know if there is anyone more effective, more articulate, or a \nmore persuasive voice for conservative principles than my friend Marco \nRubio. His race in Florida 2 years ago was supposed to be impossible. I \nknow that because I read it in the paper over and over.\n  Actually, many of the same people are saying this fight is \nimpossible. They all said it with that same certitude and that same \ndeep baritone voice: This young lad Rubio has no chance of winning this \nrace. If it were up to official Washington, they would have been right. \nBy every measure of official Washington, the winner of that race that \nwould have been picked was the governor of the State. All of Washington \nwas behind him. The only thing that was standing with Marco Rubio was \nthe people.\n  When he started, he was at 3 percent in the polls. That is a \ncondition I know well because 2 years later I found myself in a similar \nposition. Yet he ran a campaign where he crisscrossed the State of \nFlorida. He listened to the Florida people and got support from the \ngrassroots. His victory in 2010 was a transformational moment in \nAmerican politics, and it is also emblematic about what this fight is \nabout right here.\n  If you trust the talking heads on television, if you trust the \nreporters who tell us what is up and what is down, what is white and \nwhat is black, then ObamaCare is here to stay and America has to \ncontinue to suffer with it because we can never, ever do anything to \nchange it. As long as this body, the Senate, believes the opinions of \nthese 100 people in this room is more important than the American \npeople, that will remain a true and accurate description. But that is \nnot our job. Our job is to listen to the people.\n  Marco Rubio's parents were Cuban immigrants. His dad was a bartender. \nIt was a family experience that resonates powerfully with me because I \ncame from a similar background. But more important than that, Marco \nRubio's story is the American story. There is not a Member of this \nSenate, or a person in this country, who doesn't have a story just like \nthat somewhere in their background.\n  The most unique aspect of the United States of America, I believe, is \nthat we are all the children of those who risked everything for \nfreedom. I think it is the most fundamental aspect of our DNA and what \nit means to be an American. What unifies all of us is that as Americans \nwe value liberty and opportunity above all else.\n  One of the things I admire about Senator Rubio is how he views issues \nin this Senate. He doesn't look at it from how it impacts the titans of \nindustry, such as the CEOs, but from how it impacts people such as his \ndad and my dad, the people who struggled and climbed the economic \nladder, seeking the American dream.\n  If today you are a bartender at a Nevada hotel or if you are washing \ndishes at a restaurant, like his father and my father, respectively, \nObamaCare is hurting you. It is hurting you in a way that all the \nSenators who have a special exemption from Barack Obama don't have to \nworry about. It is hurting you because your job is in jeopardy. You may \nwell lose your job or you may not have a job to begin with.\n  Maybe you would like to be a bartender or wash dishes, but because of \nObamaCare, there is no job to hire you. Maybe it is hurting you because \nwhat used to be a 40-hour a week job has become a 29-hour a week job \nand your boss has told you: I don't have any choice. ObamaCare kicks in \nat 30 hours a week, and it will bankrupt me.\n  Suddenly you are struggling by either working 29 hours a week and are \nunable to feed your kids or have to get a second job and work 29 hours \na week and have to juggle your schedule, which results in making your \nlife more difficult than it was before--not to mention your concerns \nabout health insurance. Maybe you have a health insurance.\n  Maybe a person has a health insurance plan they have been struggling \nto pay, but it is important to them and they want to make sure their \nkids are covered, they want to make sure their spouse is covered. Yet \nevery year they see their premiums going up and up and up.\n  We remember when President Obama was defending the ObamaCare bill. He \npromised the American people that as a result of ObamaCare, the average\n\n[[Page S6725]]\n\nfamily's health insurance premium would drop $2,500. He said: That is \ngoing to happen by the end of my first term. I would point out that the \nPresident's first term ended 9 months ago, and by the end of the \nPresident's first term, that promise was proven not just a little off \nthe mark, not just kind of sort of a little bit not entirely accurate; \nit was proven 100 percent, categorically, objectively false.\n  Let me suggest to every American, if your health insurance premiums \nhave dropped $2,500, as the President promised the average family--so \nthere would be tens of millions for whom that is true--then I would \nencourage those Americans to enthusiastically stand and defend \nObamaCare. But there is a reason it is so profoundly unpopular, and it \nis because it hasn't happened. Premiums have gone up, and the American \npeople are hurting as a result. So DC should listen to the people. We \nshould make DC listen.\n  Mr. LEE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEE. I wish to ask the Senator from Texas whether he has received \ncomments similar to those I have received from my constituents and from \nother concerned citizens from around the country in recent months. I \nwish to highlight a few and ask whether these are similar to comments \nthe Senator from Texas has heard, concerns he has heard expressed.\n  Let me start by sharing one expressed by Shawn from Utah, who says:\n\n       I do not like the fact that the President is picking \n     winners and picking and choosing which parts of the law he \n     will enforce. We need the three branches of government to \n     keep freedom alive.\n\n  Well, Shawn from Utah, I share your concern. I would add to that, to \nShawn from Utah, the fact that this is really what started this effort. \nIn other words, during the first week of July 2013, when the President \nannounced there were several provisions in the law he simply would not \nbe implementing, he simply would not be enforcing, along the lines of \nwhat Congress enacted with the Affordable Care Act in 2010, it was at \nthat point that I and several others put our heads together and \nrealized that if the President is saying this law is not ready to \nimplement, if the law objectively is not ready to implement; if, as we \nnow understand it, the law is going to make health care less affordable \nrather than more affordable for so many Americans, perhaps Congress \nshouldn't be funding its implementation and enforcement. Perhaps that \nought to be telling us something.\n  So it is important to remember, as Shawn from Utah points out to us, \nthat we do have three branches of government. This is the legislative \nbranch. Our job is to make the laws. The President does not have law-\nmaking authority. The President can seek changes in the law just as \nother citizens can seek them from Congress, but Congress does have to \nact.\n  Although the President wields the veto pen, the veto pen is not the \nlegislation pen. He doesn't have the power to legislate on his own \nwithout the assistance of Congress. It is one of the reasons we are in \nthis debacle today. It is one of the reasons we have, along with so \nmany millions of Americans, expressed this position that we would like \nto fund government while defunding ObamaCare. This is something the \nAmerican people are calling out for. It is something they are \nrequesting. It is something the House of Representatives acted boldly \nand bravely in doing, in standing behind the American people. This \nreally is what we are doing. This is the whole reason we are concerned \nabout this, because we want to stand with the American people and with \nthe House leadership, Speaker Boehner and the other leaders in the \nother body in Congress, who bravely put forward this legislation to \nkeep government funded while defunding ObamaCare.\n  One of the things we have been concerned about today and one of the \nthings I think we need to focus on over the next few days is the fact \nthat with the House of Representatives acting last week, passing this \nlegislation, this continuing resolution to keep government funded while \ndefunding ObamaCare, in order for us to stand behind them, we have to \nmonitor the manner in which that legislation is reviewed over here.\n  Now that the House-passed continuing resolution has reached the \nSenate, we have a few options. There are a few acceptable ways of \ntreating this legislation now that it has been passed by the House. One \nvery acceptable approach would be for us to say: OK, let's bring up the \nHouse-passed continuing resolution--the resolution that funds \ngovernment but defunds ObamaCare--and let's have an up-or-down vote. \nLet's vote for it as is, the same way it was crafted in the House of \nRepresentatives. That would be an acceptable approach. I would be \ncomfortable with that.\n  Another acceptable approach would be to say: Instead of just taking \nit up and passing it or not passing it as is, let's have an amendment \nprocess. Let's allow Democrats and Republicans as they may deem fit to \noffer amendments. Let's debate those amendments, discuss their relative \nmerits, the pros and the cons. Let's put those before the American \npeople in the few days we have left before the existing continuing \nresolution expires, let's vote on all of those, and then at the end of \nit we will get to the bill itself as it may have been amended by that \npoint. That would be acceptable as well.\n  What is not acceptable is what many have suggested will occur. Many \nhave suggested that the majority leader will bring up this bill and \ninstead of saying ``let's vote on it as is'' or instead of saying \n``let's have an amendment process,'' he apparently wants to have his \ncake and eat it too. He wants to have it both ways. He wants to bring \nit up and subject it to one and only one amendment--an amendment that \nwould strip out a very critical part of the legislation, a part of the \nlegislation that probably is the ``without which not'' element for many \nof the House Members who voted for it: the provision defunding \nObamaCare. He wants that amendment and no other. That is not \nacceptable, and under that circumstance, in my opinion and in the \nopinions of several of my colleagues, some of whom we have heard from \ntoday, the appropriate way to register that concern is to vote against \ncloture on the bill if, in fact, that is what the majority leader \nchooses to do.\n  That is why we are fighting this particular battle today. That is \nmuch of what we are discussing today, is why it is that we should not \nbe facilitating the effort of Senate leadership to, in effect, gut the \nHouse-passed continuing resolution of an extraordinarily critical \nelement, an element without which it could never have passed in the \nHouse of Representatives and an element which, frankly, the American \npeople expect us to take up and discuss and debate. So either way--an \nopen amendment process, fine; an up-or-down vote on the bill as is, \nfine. What is not fine is an effort to try to have it both ways.\n\n  Let me share with the Senator from Texas another comment I received \nfrom a man named Michael who is also from Utah:\n\n       We are getting a bigger and bigger government. They're \n     telling us what we should have, what we are entitled to \n     instead of protecting a free people paving our own path. \n     Government gets bigger while the job market is getting \n     crushed. I work for a company in the middle of layoffs and \n     more are to follow. We can't continue like this.\n\n  This is an acknowledgment that so many people across our great \ncountry are making as they discover the impact of this bill--passed \ninto law some 3\\1/2\\ years ago--that has not increased in popularity \nover the last 3 years.\n  Time might not have increased its popularity--in fact, it has had \nquite the opposite effect--but time has had the effect of expanding its \nvolume. It has gone from 2,700 pages when it was passed to more than \n20,000 pages now when we add the implementing regulations. That is \nquite stunning. The length of it is quite stunning. It reminds me of \nsomething James Madison wrote--I believe it was in Federalist No. 62. \nHe said, if I may paraphrase him, it will be of little benefit to the \nAmerican people that their laws may be written by individuals of their \nown choosing if those laws are so voluminous and complex that they \ncan't reasonably be read and understood by the American people. Well, \n2,700 pages is a little too long. It is a lot too long. And I certainly \nknow that 20,000 pages is much, much, much too long.\n  That brings to mind a comment I received from Marcia, also from Utah, \nwho writes this:\n\n\n[[Page S6726]]\n\n\n       However well intentioned Obama care may be, I do not feel \n     this is the best solution. I think something ``less wordy'' \n     and more succinct would be a much better plan. If you can't \n     say it in 5 pages or less, it may be best unsaid! The changes \n     already enacted have made it more difficult for me to get \n     medical care. Not a big help!\n\n  Well said, Marcia, very well said.\n  When we vote on legislation people haven't read, the American people \ntend to suffer. When we perpetuate a mistake once made embodied in a \n2,700-page bill, things go from bad to worse to much, much worse.\n  What we have right now is an opportunity for us to debate and discuss \nthe merits of something that perhaps was not adequately debated and \ndiscussed 3\\1/2\\ years ago when this law was passed, when Members of \nCongress were told to pass this law to find out what is in it. Well, we \nknow a lot more about what is in it now. The American people have \nconcerns.\n  It is appropriate to have the discussion now in connection with \nspending legislation because, after all, Congress does have the power \nof the purse. Congress is given this power, this responsibility of \nmaking decisions regarding taxing and spending. It was for this reason \nthe founding generation wisely put it in the hands of the House of \nRepresentatives--the power of the purse--giving the House of \nRepresentatives the responsibility to initiate or originate bills \nrelating to this power. It is the House of Representatives that is, \nafter all, the branch of a government and of Congress that is most \ndirectly responsive to the needs of the people.\n  It is appropriate that we have this discussion regarding funding or \nnot funding a piece of legislation that is going to require a lot of \nmoney and is going to be proven costly to the American people in many, \nmany ways in the coming years--I say ``costly in many ways'' to reflect \nthe fact that it is not just the cost of government money; it costs the \nAmerican people a lot of things as well. It is costing them jobs. It is \ncosting them wages. It is costing them access to health care in many \ncircumstances.\n  Let me read something I received from Randy. Randy is from my \nneighboring State of Idaho. Randy writes:\n\n       My wife and I have a small business with about 20 \n     employees. We struggle to stay in business. We feel that if \n     and when Obamacare is implemented, we will not be able to \n     continue to be in business.\n\n  Randy, I can't tell you how many people I have heard make very \nsimilar comments from one end of my State of Utah to the other and from \npeople across America. You are not alone, Randy. A lot of people out \nthere are concerned as well.\n  That is one thing people lose in addition to wages or jobs or access \nto health care--some of them lose the opportunity they have to stay in \nbusiness. We are not talking about millionaires and billionaires; we \nare talking about hard-working Americans who put a lot on the line in \norder to make a decent living, in order to provide jobs for their few \nemployees. This is something we need to look out for. This is something \nwe may not, we must not lightly brush aside.\n  Here is something else some Americans will sometimes lose--something \nthey were promised they would not lose--access to a doctor they like, \naccess to a doctor they have come to trust over the years.\n  This one comes from Jack from the State of Texas. Jack says:\n\n       My family doctor of 25 years is talking about an early \n     retirement because of policies Obamacare is going to require \n     him to follow that will compromise the oath he took when he \n     became an M.D.\n\n  This is sad, Jack. This is something we were promised would not \nhappen, and it is something that should not happen. This is something \nthat we are told is happening from time to time.\n  Ryan, also from Texas, writes:\n\n       My mother is a middle-class mortician whose health care \n     coverage is going up by 68 percent for this poorly envisioned \n     law with no other changes. She simply cannot afford to \n     maintain health care coverage without significant changes to \n     her lifestyle, and for what?\n\n  Sometimes we have to ask that question: And for what?\n  Sometimes we have to ask the question, the same question that \nphysicians are required to ask themselves: Are we doing harm? It is my \nunderstanding that when a physician becomes licensed, he or she must \ntake an oath, an oath that involves an obligation to first do no harm. \nWe as lawmakers have to ask ourselves that question from time to time. \nWe as lawmakers have to view ourselves as subject to a similar \nobligation to first do no harm.\n  (Mr. DONNELLY assumed the chair.)\n  Some have said that when you are carrying around a hammer, everything \nstarts to look like a nail. I wonder whether that is sometimes true of \nCongress and the law-making power. Because of the law-making power we \nwield, sometimes, when we view problems, we assume we automatically, \nnecessarily, inevitably have the right solutions. Well, in some cases \nthat may be true. In other cases, it might be true in part. But that \npower might be used incorrectly. Sometimes when legislation is hastily \ndrafted, thrown together in a hurry, rather than for purposes of making \nsure it is part of a cohesive whole--something that will be a coherent \nmechanism that can be implemented in a commonsense fashion--sometimes \nif it is thrown together too hastily and these cautions are ignored, we \ncan end up doing a lot of harm, we can find ourselves first doing harm \nabove all else, and that is not OK.\n  When we look at this law, and we look at the fact that the American \npeople are funding its implementation, we discover it is much deeper \nthan something that deals with an individual mandate or an employer \nmandate or a set of regulations governing the insurance industry. It is \nmuch more than that. It is much more than what people will have to do \nwith regard to the reporting of some fairly personal details about \ntheir lives to the IRS, an agency that Americans have come to trust \nsubstantially less than they already did, as if that were possible.\n  It is about the fact that the American people--in addition to being \nmade less free by this law, and in addition to being made less \nprosperous by this law--are also required to fund its implementation \nand its enforcement against them. That is where the power of the purse \nmust come into play. That is what makes it so appropriate, so \nessential, so vital that we have this discussion right here and right \nnow as we consider spending legislation, spending legislation that may \nwell represent our last best hope of achieving a degree of delay or \ndefunding of this legislation before its primary operative provisions \ntake full effect. That is why it is important for us to have this \ndiscussion right now.\n  Let me emphasize again the importance of the cloture vote and the \nposition we are taking on that. It is grounded fundamentally in the \nunderstanding that the House of Representatives acted in a manner \nconsistent with what the American people have been asking. I cannot \nemphasize enough the fact that House Speaker John Boehner and his \nleadership team in the House--the House Republicans have supported him \nin this effort. They did great work. They stood valiantly with the \nAmerican people who were calling out overwhelmingly for them to take \nthis step, to keep government funded but defund ObamaCare. And that is \nwhat they did.\n  Now that they have acted, there are two approaches we could take to \nthis that are perfectly appropriate. We could vote on that legislation \nas is, up or down, or we could subject it to an amendment process, \nallow Democrats and Republicans alike to present amendments to make the \nHouse-passed resolution better, as they might deem fit. We can debate \nand discuss and vote on each of those. Sure, it can be time-consuming. \nSure, it can be grueling. But that is our job. We took an oath to do \nthat job. We do this all the time--maybe not as much as we should. But \na few months ago in connection with the budget resolution, we as \nSenators stood and sat--a little of both--here all night long. We voted \nall night long, until 5 o'clock in the morning. People got a little \ncranky at times, but that is what we are here to do--not to be cranky, \nbut we are here to vote, to cast votes on amendments. That is what we \nhad to do that day because there were a lot of amendments. That is what \nwe should be doing with this if, in fact, we decide we want amendments \nto the House-passed resolution.\n  So vote on it up or down as is; fine. Subject it to an open amendment \nprocess; fine. Trying to have it both ways, the majority leader telling \nus this will be subject to one amendment, one amendment only--an \namendment that\n\n[[Page S6727]]\n\nwould gut and render nugatory the operative provision that was so \nimportant to so many House Members--that is not OK. That is why those \nwho agree with us on this point, those who feel that way, those who \nfeel the American people need us to stand up for them, should vote no \non cloture when we get to the cloture vote on the bill later in this \nweek.\n  I would ask my colleague from Texas, as to these concerns I have \nexpressed, these statements that have been made from people around the \ncountry--some of them my constituents in Utah, some of them from other \nparts of the country, including a couple from Texas--what similarities \ndoes the Senator see between these statements I have read today and \ncomments the Senator has heard from his constituents as he has traveled \nthrough his great State, a State of great expanse and a State of close \nto 30 million people? What similarities does the Senator see between \nthese statements and those he has heard around his State?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from Utah for that very insightful \nquestion. Let me note there are many reasons why I love the Senator \nfrom Utah. But very near the top of the list is the fact that when he \n``paraphrases'' the Federalist Papers, it is darn near a word-for-word, \nverbatim quote. Mike Lee is extraordinary and it is an honor to stand \nby his side and serve with him. The stories he has read are exactly \nconsonant with the stories I have heard all across Texas and, frankly, \nall across the country. This thing is not working. It is not political. \nIt is not partisan. It has nothing to do with what team you are on. The \nfacts are clear. There is a reason why the unions are jumping ship. \nThere is a reason why Teamsters President James Hoffa says ObamaCare is \ndestroying the 40-hour workweek that is the backbone of the American \nmiddle class. There is a reason why the IRS employees union has asked \nto be exempted from ObamaCare. These are the guys who are in charge of \nenforcing it on the rest of us. They have asked to be exempt because it \nis not working. The facts are clear. It is a train wreck. As the lead \nauthor Democratic Senator put it: It is a train wreck.\n  In fact, let me share some of the tweets that have come in the \npreceding days. In the preceding days, the American people had a chance \nto speak out about ObamaCare and in particular there was a hashtag \n``DefundObamacareBecause.'' In the last several days, Americans all \nover this country have tweeted their reason why ObamaCare should be \ndefunded.\n  I will note to Senator Lee that some months ago, he and I stood on \nthis same Senate floor, side by side with our dear friend Senator Rand \nPaul, supporting him in his historic filibuster on drones. At that time \nI had the opportunity to read tweets that were supporting Rand's \nfilibuster. To the best of my knowledge, that was the first time tweets \nhad been read on the Senate floor, which I have joked to my wife makes \nme happy because 20 years from now if there is some obscure political \ngeek trivial pursuit game, I am pretty confident I am going to be an \nanswer as to the first person to have the chance to read tweets on the \nSenate floor.\n  I am going to do my best now to be the second person. Now I am \nreading tweets that concern the hashtag ``DefundObamacareBecause,'' but \nI will note there has been another hashtag tonight: ``MakeDCListen.'' \nAnd that hashtag has been trending higher and higher--\n``MakeDCListen''--and as the evening goes forward, I fully expect for \nthose of you who have something you want to say, but you are not \ncurrently able to come to the Senate floor--maybe in a few years you \nwill be, maybe you will be elected to the Senate and stand at your desk \nand make your arguments, but right now you are not--let me encourage \nyou to tweet with the hashtag ``MakeDCListen,'' and I expect later in \nthe evening to read a sample of those tweets so we can help provide \nvoice to those millions of Americans who are frustrated that DC is not \nlistening.\n  But these are some of the tweets in the past few days with the \nhashtag ``DefundObamacareBecause.''\n\n       It is just another way to gain control over people.\n       Defund ObamaCare because I don't want the government \n     dictating my health care.\n       Because I don't trust the government to run my health care.\n       Because it was sold to us on lies. You can keep your \n     insurance? No. My coverage reduced to nearly nothing, \n     premiums the same.\n       Because it's too intrusive on our privacy.\n       Because it's killing jobs and stifling the economy.\n       Because it's forcing small businesses to lay off full-time \n     workers and replace them with part-time workers to avoid \n     bankrupting mandates.\n       Because Congress should be representing us, we the people. \n     A majority of Americans don't want ObamaCare.\n       Because it adds layers of government, inefficiency, \n     centralizes control to ivory-tower bureaucrats. Massive drag \n     on the economy.\n       Because it will lead to SINGLE-PAYER health ``care''.\n\n  ``SINGLE-PAYER'' is all caps and ``care'' is in quotes.\n\n       Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.\n       Because it's not even implemented yet and it has already \n     raised my insurance rates and reduced the quality of my \n     medical care.\n       Because cancellation notices from my carrier due to ACA \n     kind of ruined the narrative: Like it, keep it. Bombs away on \n     ACA.\n       Because I don't want the government deciding my family's \n     health care.\n       Because the cost of health care will increase with quality \n     decreasing. Empower the free market.\n       Because it is a threat to jobs and our economy.\n       Because I got laid off. My chances of finding another job \n     are slim too. None now.\n       Because it's time people in DC do what's best for this \n     country instead of their political party.\n\n  Let me read that one again: ``Because it's time for people in DC to \ndo what's best for this country instead of their political party.''\n  If we listened to the people, if we make DC listen, this would not be \nabout party, this would not be about Democrats sticking to the bill \nthey passed, this would not be about Republicans afraid of political \nblame and repercussions. This would be about 100 Senators listening to \npeople and saying: This bill is not working.\n\n       Because it kills jobs and the backbone of the American \n     middle class.\n       Because it's killing free clinics and reducing access to \n     care.\n       Because Americans love freedom.\n       Because it's a job-killing machine, up to and including \n     doctors.\n       Because I don't want government to control my health care.\n       Because the free market works and government regulation \n     does not.\n       Because Americans can't live on part-time wages and pay the \n     outrageously high cost of ObamaCare.\n       Because it violates Americans' first amendment right to \n     religious liberty.\n       Because we the people don't want it and the government \n     works for us.\n\n  Let me repeat that one again: ``Because we the people don't want it \nand the government works for us.''\n  Let me note something, by the way. That hashtag was a simple hashtag: \n``DefundObamacareBecause.'' That is the message that is coming from the \npeople. Washington is not listening. It is why tonight ``MakeDCListen'' \nis trending higher and higher as a hashtag because that is what this \nfight is about. Washington is not listening to the people.\n\n       Because it has already resulted in great doctors leaving \n     medicine.\n       Because government is not meant to force me into something \n     they have no business in.\n       Because I'm against force and coercion from government. If \n     it was a great idea, it would be voluntary.\n\n  Now that says something.\n\n       If it was a great idea, why is the Federal Government \n     forcing you to be a part of it? By the way, why, at the same \n     time, is the President granting exemptions to big \n     corporations and to Members of Congress? If it is a great \n     idea, they would not have to force you to participate. If it \n     was a great idea, Members of Congress would not have asked \n     the President for an exemption so that Members of Congress \n     get a special rule that does not apply to the American \n     people.\n       Because I do not want bureaucrats involved in my \n     physician's decisions on my health care.\n       Because I value my freedom.\n       Because it's ruining the 40-hour work week, according to \n     unions.\n       Because it is crony capitalism for the health care \n     industrial complex.\n       Because you don't want a bunch of bureaucrats deciding \n     which medical treatments you can and can't receive. What do \n     they know?\n       Because the government SHOULD NOT own our medical data.\n       Because the IRS will be enforcing it.\n\n  Now, that is a pair that gives you great comfort. The IRS in charge \nof it, the IRS employee unions publicly asked them to be exempted from \nObamaCare. Right now they are assembling the largest database in the \nhistory of our health care records. We have seen the IRS--their \nwillingness to abuse their power. Under ObamaCare\n\n[[Page S6728]]\n\nright now, they just have access to our health care records so it is \nnot like anyone should be concerned about it.\n\n       Because it is a job-killing, economy-destroying, health \n     care-ruining, debt-exploding, out of control government mess.\n\n  I like that one.\n\n       Because it is a job-killing, economy-destroying, health \n     care ruining, debt-exploding, out of control government mess.\n       Because ObamaCare is all about socialistic control of we \n     the people and nothing to do with fixing health care.\n       Because it was rammed through in the dark of the night, and \n     that should matter.\n       Because it has already come between me and my doctors and \n     it is not even fully implemented yet.\n\n  Next time you see your physician, do you want your friendly \nneighborhood Federal bureaucrat sitting down and being part of the \nphysician's meeting? I do not. I know Texans do not either, most \nAmericans do not either.\n\n       Because it is a Trojan horse. Once inside it will destroy \n     us.\n       Because even the unions agree it's not working.\n       Because we need the IRS to get out of our lives, not make \n     health care decisions for us.\n       Because it will cost Americans their jobs.\n       Because it's a red herring being used to move the credit to \n     a single-payer system.\n\n  As we noted earlier, that is not--some people dismiss that. Oh, \nsingle payer, this is designed to go there. You know that is just \ncrazy, tinfoil hat-wearing stuff. But there is an old saying: Just \nbecause you are paranoid doesn't mean they are not out to get you. Yes, \nthere are people worried about single payer. They have every good \nreason to be, particularly when the majority leader of the Senate goes \non television and says: The purpose of ObamaCare is to send people into \na single-payer system, government-provided socialized health care.\n  That is the express purpose from those who voted for ObamaCare, to \ndestroy the private health insurance system and to move to single-payer \ngovernment socialized medicine.\n\n       Because honestly the people do not want it.\n       Because problems cannot be solved by a larger government \n     than the one that created them.\n       Because after 3 years, they are still trying to sell it to \n     us.\n\n  That is a good point. If it were such a great idea--don't you \nremember at the time, they said: Gosh, when people get it, they are \ngoing to love it. It is going to work. You know what. If it had, we \nwould be having a very different discussion. If it had worked, the \nAmerican people would support it. We would see the results. We would \nsee the benefits, and we would not have this debate. If it were working \nwell, we would not be having this debate because the American people \nwould support it. The facts are clear. So even those who voted 3 years \nago, unless your view of serving in office is: Hey, once I vote, I \nstick to it no matter what the facts say, no matter how much people are \nhurting, no matter how big a disaster it is. I ain't changing no matter \nwhat.\n  I cannot believe there are many Senators in this body who want to \napproach voting like that. That is not a responsible way to approach a \njob. The facts are clear. This thing is not working. All 100 of us \nought to act to avert this train wreck.\n\n       Because it is and will continue to destroy jobs, slow \n     hiring, and move others to part-time status.\n       Because if you don't, your doctor might just retire early.\n\n  How many know a doctor who is retiring early? I know quite a few who \nare retiring. Do you think that is good for our health care system, \nseeing doctors retire early? I know older doctors who are advising \nyoung students, do not go to med school. Do you think that is good for \nhealth care? Do you think that is going to expand our health care if we \ndo not see bright young students going to medical school? That is what \nObamaCare is doing.\n\n       Because you do not want an IRS agent deciding if your mom \n     lives or dies.\n       Because it makes health insurance less affordable. My \n     premiums will be higher to subsidize people who cannot afford \n     insurance.\n       Because even the unions don't want it.\n       Because the IRS has shown they are willing to abuse power \n     for political gain.\n       Because it's not about care, it is about government \n     control.\n       Because I shouldn't have to pay for the murder of innocent, \n     unborn babies through abortion.\n       Because if it worked, Democratic Senators would not have \n     needed to be bribed to vote for it.\n       Because the death panel is an unchecked bureaucracy \n     accountable to no one.\n       Because I love my current health care and doctors.\n\n  Do you like your current health care? Do you like your doctor? Do you \nwant to keep seeing your doctor? I tell you, Americans all over this \ncountry are losing their health care because of ObamaCare. They are \nlosing their ability to see their doctors. That is what happens if the \nSenate does not act to defund ObamaCare.\n\n       Because the majority of the country is against it.\n       Because premiums up 100 percent after dropped off spouse's \n     plan. Elimination of meds coverage, reduction of choices and \n     treatments.\n\n  These are real people tweeting. They are sharing their stories of why \nthey do not like ObamaCare. Do you notice these stories are not: \nBecause I am a Republican. Because I am a Democrat. Because I believe \nin this ideology. It is because: This thing is hurting me and my \nfamily. If this body were listening to the people, we would have 100 \nSenators concerned about all of the Americans being hurt by ObamaCare \nand here at any hour of the night ready to act to stop it.\n\n       Because no one wants to live in their parent's basement \n     forever.\n       Because Reagan once said, you can't be for big government, \n     big bureaucracy and still be for the little guy.\n\n  Boy, ain't that the truth.\n\n       Because I don't want to pay more taxes to fund it.\n       Because it does nothing to reduce costs while hurting many \n     full-time employees who are dropped to part time.\n       Because it makes health insurance less affordable, my \n     premiums will be higher to subsidize people who cannot afford \n     insurance.\n       Because it actually does add a dime to the deficit, and a \n     lot of them.\n       Because--\n\n  Three words in all caps.\n\n     --INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE.\n       Because it is killing full-time jobs and stunting the \n     growth of businesses that want to hire.\n       Because government should not be in charge of something as \n     important as health care.\n       Because the devil himself wouldn't put the IRS between you \n     and your doctor.\n\n  I like that one too.\n\n       Because the more exemptions that are given out, the more \n     ObamaCare won't work.\n       Because I cannot afford to get two jobs, pay outrageous \n     prices for crappy insurance. I will lose my full time.\n       Because that time Congress passed the law and then excluded \n     themselves. #healthcarehypocrisy.\n       Because doctors and hospitals are already becoming limited.\n       Because it is designed to collapse private insurance and \n     force us all to single payer. Socialism.\n\n  Again, I would note that is not hypothetical. That is what majority \nleader Harry Reid has publicly said on television.\n\n       Because insurance isn't very helpful when you can't find a \n     doctor.\n       Because I don't need to spend a decade of my life filling \n     out government forms.\n       Because baby-boomer doctors will retire in droves, plus \n     more who won't practice in this environment.\n       Because if it is not good enough for Congress, it sure as \n     shooting is not good enough for the people.\n\n  Those are sentiments we are hearing from all across the country. \nThose are sentiments that reflect the views of the American people, not \njust in Texas, in all 50 States, and not just Republicans but \nDemocrats, Independents, Libertarians. The American people understand \nthat when you have a law that is killing jobs, when you have a law that \nis hammering small businesses, when you have a law that is forcing \npeople into part-time work and to work 29 hours a week, when you have a \nlaw that is causing skyrocketing insurance premiums, when you have a \nlaw that is causing more and more people to lose their health \ninsurance, you have a law that is not working.\n  You have a train wreck, as the Democratic Senator who is the lead \nauthor of this bill described it. Yet right now the Senate is not \nlistening to the American people. The Democrats in the Senate \nunderstandably have circled the wagons. They passed this bill, and even \nif it is a sinking ship, we have yet to see Democrats come out and say: \nWe tried it. It didn't work. Let's listen to the American people. I \nhope the time comes this week where we see some courageous Democrats \nstand--and let me say to any Democratic Senator who does so, he or she \nwill receive withering criticisms from the partisans in your party.\n\n[[Page S6729]]\n\n  Now I will know, as someone not entirely unfamiliar with receiving \nwithering criticisms from one's own party. There are worse things in \nlife. I promise you that it is, in the order of things to be worried \nabout, quite low. You know I am a lot more concerned about a single mom \nworking in a diner trying to feed her kids than I am about whether some \nSenator or some congressional staffer wants to run to a newspaper and \nsay something mean about me.\n  So any Democratic Senator who is thinking about responding to the \nconcerns that I know you are hearing from your citizens, because we are \nhearing it all over the country, let me suggest a little bit of grief \nfor breaking party discipline is a small price to pay for doing your \njob, for listening to the American people.\n  Let me say to the Republicans: There is a lot of concern about \npolitical blame. There is a lot of concern about: If we would just get \na symbolic vote so we can all say we are opposed to it, but let's not \nactually do anything to change ObamaCare. Let me suggest to my \nRepublican friends that we should worry a lot less about blame and \ncredit and politics and just worry about fixing the darn thing for the \nAmerican people.\n  If we get back to an economy where jobs are booming, where small \nbusinesses are thriving, where people who are struggling and want the \nAmerican dream can get that first job and get that second job and climb \nthat economic ladder and advance, provide for their families, that \nanswers a whole lot of problems.\n  I have heard some partisan observers say: ObamaCare is not the \nbiggest job killer in the country. No. 1, it is ironic that is the \nparticular debate, about whether it is the biggest job killer or the \nsecond biggest job killer. But let me tell you, I do not think there is \nany debate on that question.\n  So let me point to a list by Investors Business Daily of 300 cuts to \nwork hours or jobs.\n  Well, if you don't believe ObamaCare is the biggest job killer in the \ncountry, look to the facts. This year report after report has rolled in \nabout employers restricting work hours to less than 30 hours per week--\nthe point where the mandate kicks in. The data also points to record-\nlow workweeks in low-wage industries. It is low-wage industries in \nparticular because the people who get hammered by this are not the \nCEOs. It is not the rich. The rich have done just fine under President \nObama. It is hard-working American families, the people who are \nstruggling. It is young people, Hispanics, African Americans, and \nsingle moms. They are the ones who are losing their jobs and being \nforced to work 29 hours a week.\n  Investor's Business Daily compiled a list of job actions that provide \nstrong proof that ObamaCare's employer mandate is behind cuts to work \nor staffing cuts. As of September 18, 2013, their ObamaCare scorecard \nincluded 301 employers.\n  In the State of Alabama, Houston County cut the hours of part-time \nemployees to less than 30 hours per week.\n  In California, Biola University cut student work hours to a maximum \nof 25 per week and suspended the limit due to the employer mandate \ndelay. That is interesting. They cut it, and then when the employer \nmandate delay kicked in, they suspended that. If you want to understand \ncause and effect, look to the behavior, look to the suffering, look to \nthe job losses that are coming as a direct result of ObamaCare.\n  In Florida, Bealls department stores restricted part-time hours to \nless than 30 hours a week.\n  In Florida, SeaWorld Entertainment--have any of you ever taken your \nkids to SeaWorld? They cut hours for part-time workers from a maximum \nof 32 hours to 28 hours a week. That is SeaWorld, which is a big \nemployer.\n  In Illinois, Palmer Place Restaurant cut hours for some workers below \n30 hours a week.\n  In Kansas, the Salina Family YMCA cut part-time employee schedules to \na maximum of 25 hours per week.\n  In New Jersey, Middletown Township Public Schools cut hours for \nparaprofessionals to below 30 hours per week.\n  The great State of Texas--it actually doesn't say ``great State'' on \nthe list, but I view that as implied--Sam Houston State University \nlimited student work hours to 29 per week, impacting multiple job \nholders.\n  In Michigan, Auburn Hills reduced hours for part-time seasonal \nworkers to less than 30 per week.\n  In Pennsylvania, Friendship Community cut part-time hours to below 30 \nper week. That, by the way, is a group home for adults with \ndisabilities. Not only are the folks at Friendship Community working to \nhelp adults with disabilities, they are also getting their hours cut. \nThat is their penalty for making a difference in their community.\n  In Michigan, Meridian Public Schools cut schedules of hourly workers \nto less than 30 hours per week.\n  In Arizona, Arizona State University limited course loads for \nnontenured associate faculty members.\n  In Maine, Mainesubway, the Subway franchisee, reduced worker hours to \nno more than 29 per week.\n  In New York, Finger Lakes Community College capped course loads for \nadjunct faculty.\n  In South Carolina, Tsunami Surf Shops--I like that name; that is a \nsurf shop with an attitude--will limit workers to less than 30 hours \nper week.\n  In Illinois, Southern Illinois University limited graduate teaching \nassistants to 20 hours per week.\n  In Indiana, Vincennes cut the hours of part-timers to 29 per week.\n  In California, the Mexican American Opportunity Foundation cut the \nhours of employees working up to 39 hours a week to less than 30. I am \ntalking about a real impact from this law.\n  In Georgia, Georgia Military College cut the hours of adjunct faculty \nto below 30 hours per week.\n  In Illinois, Vcm Inc., the Subway franchisee, reduced hours for \nhourly wage earners to below 30 per week.\n  In Indiana, Ball State University limited work hours for graduate \nassistants.\n  In New Jersey, Toms River will cut part-time hours to 25 hours per \nweek, effective July 2014.\n  In North Carolina, Forsyth Community Technical College reduced hours \nfor adjunct faculty to below 30 hours per week. Also in North Carolina, \nWilkes Community College reduced teaching loads for adjunct faculty to \nbelow 30 hours a week.\n  Let me go through a few of these that are much the same:\n  Texas, Consolidated Restaurant Operations and Dave & Buster's; \nPennsylvania, Philadelphia University; Virginia, K-VA-T Food Stores; \nMissouri, Three Rivers College. In Alabama, the University of Alabama \ncapped student work hours at 20 per week. That may, in fact, be \njustifiable punishment for their having beaten Texas A, but it is \nstill not good for the students who would like to work more than 20 \nhours per week. Florida, Brevard County; Florida, Buca di Beppo \nrestaurant chain; Florida, Hillsborough Community College; Florida, St. \nPetersburg College; Georgia, Cherokee County School Board; Indiana, \nHancock County; Indiana, Morgan County; Michigan, Central Michigan \nUniversity; New Jersey, NEMF trucking company; North Carolina, \nHenderson; Ohio, White Castle. We read a letter from White Castle \nearlier today. They used to open eight new restaurants a year. They \nhave reduced it to two. Think of all the people who won't get jobs \nbecause there is no White Castle over there, not to mention all of the \nhungry college kids who at 3 in the morning are just craving a White \nCastle and they can't find one. Oregon, Shari's restaurants; \nPennsylvania, Carnegie Museum; Tennessee, Oneida Special School \nDistrict; Tennessee, Scott County School System; Tennessee, Stewart \nCounty School System; Texas, Jim's Restaurant; Virginia, Christopher \nSavvides Restaurant & catering; Wisconsin, Minocqua-Hazelhurst-Lake \nTomahawk School District; Wisconsin, Trig's Supermarkets; Alabama, \nUniversity of North Alabama; California, Fatburger. Now there is truth \nin advertising. Iowa, Lee County; Michigan, Delta County; Texas, Bee \nCounty; Idaho, Boundary County; North Carolina, Rutherford County; \nPennsylvania, Lawrence County; Michigan, Kenowa Hills Public Schools; \nNew Jersey, City of Burlington Public Schools; Texas, the Lion & Rose \nBritish Restaurant and Pub; Texas, MTC Inc. Restaurant Management; \nUtah, Millard School District; Arkansas, Area Agency on Aging of\n\n[[Page S6730]]\n\nWestern Arkansas; Arkansas, Walmart Stores, Inc. Has anyone heard of \nthem? They increased temp share of workforce to ``fewer than 10 \npercent'' from 1 to 2 percent before this year. California, CKE \nRestaurants, Inc.\n  The list goes on and on.\n  Every one of those--and I read the first 50 or 75 out of 301--it is \nall over the country. It is every State. A lot of folks in this body \nmay say: Well, that doesn't impact us. What is the problem? If you \nserve in the Senate, your salary is guaranteed no matter what. Besides, \nwe are exempted from ObamaCare. So what is the concern?\n\n  That is official Washington for you. What is the problem? Government \nis a boom business. If you look at the counties surrounding Washington, \nDC, they are booming. Why? Because government is growing, growing, \ngrowing, and growing.\n  At every place I just read, there are men and women working and \nalmost none of them are wealthy. Almost none of them are fat cats. \nAlmost none of them are, as the President likes to invoke so often, \nmillionaires and billionaires. They are 22-year-old kids, some who are \nrecent college graduates and some who dropped out of high school, but \nthey are trying to work. They would like to make a better life. They \nare not able to do so. They are not able to do so because of ObamaCare.\n  Every one of those names--and listening to those names, it would be \neasy to zone out: Oh, another name, another name; those are just empty \nnames. Every one of those names--there are men, women, and their kids \nwho are suffering because of that. If you have a job, working hard, \ntrying to provide for your family, and you are told: Congratulations; \nyou will be working 29 hours a week courtesy of the Senate and \nObamaCare--talk about a failed law.\n  In the last election, young people voted overwhelmingly for the \nreelection of the President. Indeed, some of my friends on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle believe that a new dawn has arrived, that \nyoung people will remain permanently Democrats and thus keep a \nDemocratic majority in the Senate for time immemorial. I am not \nconvinced of that.\n  I will say it is interesting--you could not design a law to do more \ndamage to young people than ObamaCare if you sat down and tried. If you \nsat down and said: Let's really pound the living daylights out of young \npeople, you couldn't do it.\n  We will talk later tonight about premiums that are going up, \nespecially for young people, because one way to understand ObamaCare is \nit is a massive wealth transfer from young healthy people to everyone \nelse. If you are young and healthy, Congress looked at you, licked \ntheir chops, and said: You are for dinner. Not only that, the people \nwho are getting their hours forcibly reduced are overwhelmingly young \npeople. They are people who are starting their climb on the economic \nladder. If you don't get that first job, you don't get the second, and \nyou don't get the third. It impacts you for a long, long time.\n  Just recently, I read an article in the Wall Street Journal that I \nthink is relevant for every young person to read because it explains \nhow ObamaCare is impacting you not just today but for decades to come. \nI think young people have a particularly acute desire to see this \nSenate act this week to defund ObamaCare because it is young people \npaying the price. Don't take my word for it, take the Wall Street \nJournal. On September 1, 2013, the Wall Street had a major article that \nwas entitled ``Wanted: Jobs for the New 'Lost' Generation.'' If you are \na young person, you should feel excited: there is now a title for your \ngeneration--the ``lost generation.'' I mentioned that if you were \ntrying to design a law to hurt young people, ObamaCare--you couldn't do \nbetter than that. Well, it has produced a lost generation.\n  Here is what the Wall Street Journal said:\n\n       Like so many young Americans, Derek Wetherell is stuck. At \n     23 years old, he has a job, but not a career, and little \n     prospect for advancement. He has tens of thousands of dollars \n     in student debt--\n\n  I know what student debt is like. It was only 2 years ago that I paid \noff my student debt. I had to take out student debt to pay my way \nthrough college and law school. There are a lot of young people right \nnow struggling to pay off student debt. I will tell you, if you combine \nstudent debt with a dead-end job or not being able to find a job at \nall, that is a recipe for a lost generation.\n  Continuing with Derek Wetherell:\n\n       He has tens of thousands of dollars in student debt, but no \n     college degree.\n\n  That is becoming more and more common. People take out loans to get a \ncollege degree, but they are not finishing. They are not able to \nfinish.\n\n       He says he is more likely to move back in with his parents \n     than to buy a home--\n\n  The American dream used to be that everyone wanted to buy their own \nhome, have a white picket fence, have a swing out front on which your \nkids could play. That was our parents' dreams. That was their parents' \ndreams. That has been the American dream for generations. I ask young \npeople, how many of you feel that dream is a realistic prospect for \nyou? It was for your parents when they were your age. Let me tell you, \nthe policies this Congress has put in place because we are not \nlistening to the American people are a direct cause of that. ObamaCare \nis a direct cause of that.\n\n  Mr. Wetherell continues:\n\n       He says he is more likely to move back in with his parents \n     than to buy a home, and he doesn't know what he will do if \n     his car--a 2001 Chrysler Sebring with well over 100,000 \n     miles--breaks down.\n  Is there anyone else in America who has a car that is 12 years old \nwith 100,000 miles and is wondering what happens if they wake up one \nmorning and turn the key and nothing happens? If you have a good job, \nif you are climbing the economic ladder, if you have career prospects, \nyou can deal with that. If you are stuck in a dead-end job and living \npaycheck to paycheck, that is a huge problem.\n\n       ``I'm kind of spinning my wheels,'' Mr. Wetherell says. \n     ``We can wishfully think that eventually it's going to get \n     better, but we don't really know, and that doesn't really \n     help us now.''\n\n  There are millions of Americans who feel exactly like that.\n\n       Mr. Wetherell is a member of the lost generation, a group \n     that is now only beginning to gain attention from many \n     economists and employment experts.\n\n  Young people should feel particularly privileged that they have \ncoined a new term for their generation--the lost generation--because of \nObamaCare and the policies of this administration.\n\n       From Oakland to Orlando--and across the ocean in Birmingham \n     and Barcelona--young people have come of age amid the most \n     prolonged period of economic distress since the Great \n     Depression.\n       Most, like Mr. Wetherell, have little memory of the \n     financial crisis itself, which struck while they were still \n     in high school. But they are all too familiar with its \n     aftermath: the crippling recession, which made it all but \n     impossible for many young people to get a first foothold in \n     the job market, and the achingly slow recovery that has left \n     the prosperity of their parents' generation out of reach--\n     perhaps permanently.\n       \"This has been for quite a while now a hostile environment \n     for young people,'' said Paul Taylor, executive vice \n     president of the Pew Research Center, which has studied the \n     impact of the recession on young people. ``This is all \n     they've really known.''\n       The financial crisis that struck five years ago this month \n     opened up a sinkhole in the U.S. economy that swallowed \n     Americans of all ages and backgrounds. Retirees lost life \n     savings. Families lost homes. Millions of Americans lost \n     their jobs. Five years later, that hole is being filled in, \n     however slowly. The unemployment rate is down to 7.3 percent \n     amid slow, steady job growth.\n\n  Although, as we noted earlier, that 7.3 percent vastly understates \nit, because so many have given up looking for work altogether.\n\n       The stock market has rallied to new highs. Home prices are \n     rebounding. Total output has surpassed its prerecession peak.\n       But the recovery has left many young people behind. The \n     official unemployment rate for Americans under age 25 was \n     15.6 percent in August, down from a peak of nearly 20 percent \n     in 2010 but still more than 2\\1/2\\ times the rate of those 25 \n     and older--a gap that has widened during the recovery.\n\n  In other words, it has gotten worse for young people during the past \nfew years.\n\n       Moreover, the unemployment rate ignores the hundreds of \n     thousands of young people who have taken shelter from the \n     weak job market by going to college, enrolling in training \n     programs or otherwise sitting on the sidelines.\n\n  Do any of you know anyone--do any of you, right now, know anyone \ndoing that--going to school because, gosh, jobs are so lousy, maybe, \nyou think,\n\n[[Page S6731]]\n\nyou will try to do something at school and maybe things will get \nbetter? If ObamaCare keeps hammering small businesses so they do not \nhire new workers and they keep reducing hours, the prospects for things \ngetting better are not very bright.\n\n       Even those lucky enough to be employed are often \n     struggling. Little more than half are working full time--\n     compared with about 80 percent of the population at large--\n     and 12 percent earn minimum wage or less.\n\n  Let me repeat that. For young people who are working, little more \nthan half are working full time. If you are a young person, if you are \nhoping to start a career, being forced into a part-time job because of \nObamaCare is a big problem.\n\n       The median weekly wage for young workers has fallen more \n     than 5 percent since 2007, after adjusting for inflation; for \n     those 25 and older, wages have stayed roughly flat.\n\n  It is getting worse for young people. It is young people who are \nreally getting hit by this. Let me ask young people: What urgency do \nyou see in the Senate? Is the floor of the Senate filled with Senators \nsaying there is a crisis with young people; let's step forward and help \nthem get jobs? Nope. Senators have very busy calendars. There are \ncocktail parties to go to. Responding to the crisis that young people \nare facing is not high on the priority of enough Members of this Senate \nbecause Washington isn't listening to the people. That is why the \nhashtag is trending: ``MakeDCListen.'' Because we need to make DC \nlisten.\n\n       This generation's struggles have few historical precedents, \n     at least in the U.S.\n\n  You all should feel excited. You have made history, although, \nunfortunately, not for a good reason, because the government has put \npolicies in place that have so hammered small businesses that they have \ncreated a job market that makes life incredibly difficult for young \npeople.\n\n       The recession of the early 1980s was comparable but was \n     followed by a rapid recovery.\n\n  Well, gosh, what happened in the early 1980s? President Ronald Reagan \nwas elected. He implemented policies the exact opposite of this \nadministration's policies. Instead of jacking up taxes by $1.7 \ntrillion, as this Congress and this President has done, President \nReagan slashed taxes and simplified the Tax Code. Instead of exploding \ngovernment spending and the debt, President Reagan restrained the \ngrowth of government spending. And instead of unleashing regulators \nlike locusts that destroy small businesses, President Reagan restrained \nregulation and the result was incredible growth.\n  For young people who have never known anything other than these \nabysmal economic conditions, there is another way. Every time we have \nimplemented pro free-enterprise policies of restraining taxes, \nrestraining regulation, reining in out-of-control government spending \nand debt, the result has been small businesses have prospered and \nthrived. They have created jobs, and the result has been young people \ncould get jobs, full-time jobs that advance towards a career and \ntowards the American Dream.\n\n       The economic legacy of the Great Depression was erased to a \n     large degree by World War II and the boom that followed. No \n     similar rebound looks likely this time around.\n\n  What a crying shame. Wouldn't it be nice if this week we forced them \nto change that sentence. Suppose this week Washington, DC, changed. \nSuppose this week Senators in this body--Republicans and Democrats--\ndecided we are going to do something we haven't done in a long time. We \nare going to listen to the people. The American people say their top \npriority is jobs and the economy. Suppose Members of the Senate said: \nHot diggity, our top priority is jobs and the economy. Suppose Members \nof the Senate came together, and Republicans said we are going to stand \ntogether on cloture. On the vote on Friday or Saturday, all 46 of us \nare going to vote against cloture because ObamaCare is killing jobs. It \nis the biggest job killer and it is hurting the American people. And \nsuppose Democrats said: You know, even though we supported ObamaCare, \nwe have seen how it is implemented, it is not working, it is a train \nwreck, the American people are hurting, and we are going to respond. We \nare going to respond to young people--the young people, by the way, on \nTwitter and in social media we are reaching out to all the time.\n\n  You know, lots of politics is very interesting, but nothing is better \nfor a young person than a growing economy and an opportunity to have a \njob to work to achieve the American Dream. Yet the Wall Street Journal \nsays no similar rebound looks likely this time around. I tell you what. \nIf we act in an historic show of courage to defund ObamaCare, that will \nchange.\n\n       What evidence does exist suggests today's young people will \n     suffer long-term consequences.\n\n  Now, this is important. You say may: Well, the job I have now is not \ngreat, but it will be fine in a few years. Here is part of the problem. \nWhen young people are stuck in dead-end jobs, if they don't get \nopportunity now, it echoes throughout that generation for decades.\n\n       One recent study by Yale University economist Lisa Kahn \n     found that after the 1980s recession, new college graduates \n     lost 6 to 7 percent in initial wages for every one percentage \n     point increase in the unemployment rate. The effects shrank \n     over time, but even 15 years after graduation, those who \n     finished college in bad economic times earned less than \n     similar people who graduated in better times. Some never \n     caught up at all.\n\n  So this stagnant economic growth, if you are a young person, I am \nsorry to tell you, it is not just a problem now. If you don't see the \nSenate finally listening to the American people, finally working to \nbring back economic growth, the stagnant economic opportunities we have \nright now are likely to haunt the lost generation of young people for \ndecades to come. This is an urgency that should have this Senate floor \npacked.\n  You know what. A lot of men and women in this body have kids who are \nin that generation. And we should be horrified, we should be outraged \nthat the future of our young people is jeopardized.\n\n       Mr. Wetherell, the son of an electrician, grew up in \n     Imperial, MO, a very small town south of St. Louis, where job \n     opportunities were limited even when the economy was strong, \n     and it wasn't when he graduated from high school in 2008. He \n     enrolled at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, juggled a \n     full course load, had a full-time job at a local grocery \n     store, and tracked his near-constant commitments on a dry-\n     erase board in his room.\n       Eventually, the schedule wore him down. He withdrew from \n     school in 2011, though he says he still plans to complete his \n     degree. He owes $27,000 in student debt--roughly his annual \n     pretax earnings--with three semesters still to go.\n       Mr. Wetherell is better off than many of his peers. He \n     works at Schnucks, a locally owned supermarket chain where he \n     is a union member--\n  And, by the way, that is one of the reasons why so many unions that \nhave supported ObamaCare are turning on it now--\n\n      receives health benefits and is paid $12.65 an hour. That is \n     enough to cover $400 monthly rent and $200 in student loan \n     payments. But it leaves little left over for an emergency \n     fund, let alone retirement savings.\n\n  How many young people right now are able to save for retirement? That \nis something else that will echo for decades. Savings when you are \nyoung are most important for retirement because through compounding \ninterest they can grow over the years.\n\n       ``It's kind of unsettling not being able to put anything \n     away,'' says Mr. Wetherell, a political science major.\n       Even more unsettling: Wetherell has noticed that more and \n     more of his coworkers have college degrees, some from well-\n     regarded colleges like Washington University. What he had \n     intended as a job to help pay his way through college has now \n     turned into a destination for college graduates. ``I think a \n     lot about whether I'm ahead or behind,'' he says. ``I really \n     hope I'm not ahead.''\n\n  What does that say when what used to be a part-time job that would \nhelp people pay their way through school becomes a destination for \ncollege graduates?\n  You know, my dad worked his way through the University of Texas as a \ndishwasher and then as a cook. That job is what let him get the \neducation. How much different would it have been if, after he had \ngotten his degree, he had shown up and they had said: Let's start \nwashing dishes.\n\n       Americans aren't the only ones asking such questions.\n\n  I'm going to pause in this article because it is 8 o'clock right now, \nand I mentioned before that Heidi and I are blessed to have two little \ngirls, Caroline and Catherine. Caroline is 5 and Catherine is 2. I love \nmy daughters with all my heart. They are the joys of my life. I will \ntell you the hardest aspect of public service is not someone\n\n[[Page S6732]]\n\nsaying something mean about you--the press. The hardest aspect of \npublic service is being away from those little precious angels and \ncoming up here to DC. I tell you, it breaks your heart on Monday \nmorning when I walk out of the house and one girl grabs one leg and one \ngirl grabs the other and they say: Don't leave, Dad.\n  Well, right now, Caroline and Catherine are both at home getting \nready to go to bed, and they have both turned on the television. They \nare both watching C-SPAN. Now I'm going to confess that Caroline and \nCatherine don't usually watch C-SPAN since there are far too few \nanimated features on C-SPAN. But because the girls are watching, and my \nwife Heidi is watching with them, I wanted to take an opportunity--an \nopportunity I don't usually have when I am in DC--to read them a couple \nof bedtime stories. They are watching right now, and if you will \nforgive me, I want to take the opportunity to read two bedtime stories \nto my girls.\n  But there is a point to this also. The point is very simple: The \nurgency we have and should feel is because of our kids. It is because \nof the future they are facing. It is because of the limited \nopportunities they have.\n  I wish to read first to Caroline and Catherine Bible stories from the \nOld and New Testaments. We often read similar stories at home. This one \nis entitled ``King Solomon's Wise Words.'' It is from Proverbs 10, 11, \n12, 14, 16, 17, 20, and 21.\n  So, Caroline and Catherine:\n\n       King Solomon had good advice for how people could live a \n     good life and be happy. Here are some of his wise sayings:\n       Children with good sense make their parents happy, but \n     foolish children make them sad.\n\n  Sweetheart, you make your mommy and me very happy.\n\n       You will say the wrong thing if you talk too much, so be \n     sensible and watch what you say.\n\n  I will have to confess to my colleagues, that is not an encouraging \nProverb for someone in the midst of a filibuster.\n\n       Kindness is rewarded--but if you are cruel, you hurt \n     yourself.\n       Try hard to do right, and you will win friends; go looking \n     for trouble, and you will find it.\n       Good people are kind to their animals, but a mean person is \n     cruel.\n       We trap ourselves by telling lies, but we stay out of \n     trouble by living right.\n       It's wrong to hate others, but God blesses everyone who is \n     kind to the poor.\n       Kind words are like honey--they cheer you up and make you \n     feel strong.\n       Don't trust violent people. They will mislead you to do the \n     wrong thing.\n       Even fools seem smart when they are quiet.\n\n  I suppose that may counteract the other one.\n\n       Good people live right, and God blesses the children who \n     follow their example.\n       Hearing and seeing are gifts from the Lord.\n       The food you get by cheating may taste delicious, but it \n     turns to gravel.\n\n  And,\n\n       If you try to be kind and good, you will be blessed with \n     life and goodness and honor.\n\n  So that is the first story for Caroline and Catherine.\n  The second one is what they know is my favorite story. It was my \nfavorite story when I was a kid and it is a story I love reading to \nthem. I actually don't get to read it to them often because we have a \nrule at home that they get to pick the books. For whatever reason, they \ndon't pick Dr. Seuss's ``Green Eggs and Ham'' all that often. I don't \nget to read it that often because I tell them, Go pick the books you \nwant to read, and I read to them. But since tonight, girls, you aren't \nhere, you don't get to pick the book, so I got to pick ``Green Eggs and \nHam.'' I love this story, so I am going to read it to you.\n\n     Sam I Am.\n     That Sam-I-am!\n     That Sam-I-am!\n     I do not like that Sam-I-am!\n     Do you like green eggs and ham?\n     I do not like them, Sam-I-am.\n     I do not like green eggs and ham.\n     Would you like them here or there?\n     I would not like them here or there.\n     I would not like them anywhere.\n     I do not like green eggs and ham.\n     I do not like them, Sam-I-am.\n     Would you like them in a house?\n     Would you like them with a mouse?\n     I do not like them in a house.\n     I do not like them with a mouse.\n     I do not like them here or there.\n     I do not like them anywhere.\n     I do not like green eggs and ham.\n     I do not like them, Sam-I-am.\n     Would you eat them in a box?\n     Would you eat them with a fox?\n     Not in a box.\n     Not with a fox.\n     Not in a house.\n     Not with a mouse.\n     I would not eat them here or there.\n     I would not eat them anywhere.\n     I would not eat green eggs and ham.\n     I do not like them, Sam-I-am.\n     Would you?

It is bedtime. Give Mommy a hug and a kiss, brush your \nteeth, say your prayers, and Daddy is going to be home soon to read to \nyou in person.\n  Let me say more broadly to everyone, ``Green Eggs and Ham'' has some \napplicability, as curious as it might sound, to ObamaCare, because 3\\1/\n2\\ years ago President Obama and Senate Democrats told the American \npeople, Just try ObamaCare. Just try it. There were an awful lot of \nRepublicans who were very skeptical of it, I think for good reasons, \nbut very skeptical. And we were told try it, try it, try it, try it. \nUnfortunately, through an exercise of brute political force, ObamaCare \nbecame the law of the land.\n  But the difference with ``Green Eggs and Ham'' is when Americans \ntried it, they discovered they did not like green\n\n[[Page S6733]]\n\neggs and ham and they did not like ObamaCare either. They did not like \nObamaCare in a box, with a fox, in a house, or with a mouse. It is not \nworking.\n  One of the oldest definitions of insanity is continuing to do the \nsame thing over and over expecting different results. I understand why \nmany supported ObamaCare in the beginning. But if you look at the \nfacts, if you look at the evidence, if you look at what is happening \nwhen the American people have tried it, it is not working. And if we \nlisten to the people--if we listen to the American people, every one of \nus will stand together and say, We are going to stop this train wreck. \nTogether, we need to make DC listen.\n  Mr. ENZI. Through the Chair, would the Senator yield for a question, \nretaining the floor?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. ENZI. I want to thank the Senator for the recitation of ``Green \nEggs and Ham.'' That is as good as I have heard. I loved the different \nvoices in it. One of my favorites was ``Hand, Hand, Finger, Thumb'' by \nDr. Seuss. And another one was ``Hop on Pop.'' I think all of those \ncould have related to the messages here. They might even be simple \nenough that we could get the message across.\n  I appreciate all the passion and preparation the Senator has put into \nexplaining this and his careful way with words.\n  We are on a continuing resolution, and I don't know that people out \nthere understand what continuing resolution is. It means that we failed \nto do our job on time--that we should have had 12 appropriations bills, \none at a time, and been able to go through them with some care.\n  I think maybe the Senator would agree that perhaps if we had done \nthat, when we got to Health and Human Services we might have had the \nissue on the individual items of defunding ObamaCare. Had we had those \nindividual ones, I think some of those would have passed and it \nwouldn't have had to have been an all-or-nothing as we have now.\n  Would the Senator agree that doing it this way, particularly if we \nhave no debate and no amendments, would be the wrong way, and that all \nwe are doing is delaying some more decisions a little further down the \nroad that again should have been covered by appropriations in a very \ntimely manner? Isn't that the same problem we had with sequester, where \nwe went through two-thirds of the year when there was supposed to be a \n2.3-percent sequester, so we only had 4 months left and those agencies \nhad to pack it into the 4 months, and that made it 5.3 percent and that \nhurt worse? Of course, the President's note to everybody to ``make it \nhurt'' was not particularly helpful either.\n  But aren't we faced again with that when we are doing a 2-month delay \non a CR, so that we have to go through this exercise again probably \nwhen we would like to be home at Christmas personally reading those \nstories to kids? I would like to be reading to my grandkids.\n  We have been kind of put in a box here that the American public \ndoesn't like, I don't like, but it wasn't our doing.\n  If those bills would have been brought up one at a time, we could \nhave debated each of them and gotten into some details on them. It has \nbeen a long time since we got into details on trillions of dollars of \nspending. Health care is a part of that, and health care deserves some \nindividual attention. That is what the Senator and I and a number of \npeople are trying to give it, some individual attention. But we are \nbeing denied that right. We are not being allowed to go into it in \ndetail so we can show exactly which parts we would defund, which parts \nwe would dismantle and replace with something better.\n  I spent a lot of time on this bill because I was here when it was \ngoing through the committee process. In fact, I had a 10-step plan on \nmy Web site that would have done more than this bill and it would have \nbeen paid for. But that isn't a part of the bill. When they say the \nRepublicans don't have solutions, they are not willing to look at any \nof the solutions even if they would wind up in a better situation.\n  This was passed with a partisan government. It is a health care that \nis failing and we are not getting a chance to change it. Of course, I \nam one of those who would have liked to have repealed it and started \nover again and gotten it right.\n  I know of another substitute bill that Senator Coburn and Senator \nBurr did, and that would have been a better replacement too. It would \nhave covered more of the things the President, in a joint session of \nCongress when he covered it--I was on a committee that was working on \nit particularly, and I sat there and took extensive notes. The next day \nin our meeting I said, There are 14 things that he said in that speech \nwe did not cover and I think we should have covered them.\n  Instead, we wound up with the bill we have because there were 60 \nDemocrats and that is all it took to pass the bill. They had to make a \nfew deals in order to get the 60 to stick together, and it is \nsurprising they did stick together.\n  I will end on that question. I have one other I would like to ask \ntoo. But I think our failure to do appropriations leads us to this \npoint, and also gets us to a point where we can't go into the details \nof the bill. We have to take an all-or-nothing approach. That is not \nlegislating. That is deal-making. I think we have an alternate approach \nand I would like the Senator to comment on it.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from Wyoming for that very good question. \nI thank him also for his early support of this fight to defund \nObamaCare. When Senator Mike Lee and I began this endeavor, Senator \nEnzi was with us from the start. I am grateful for his support and for \nhis leadership.\n  I note his question is exactly right. We would not be in this mess \nwere it not for the failure of the Senate, the failure of the Senate to \ndo its job, the failure of the Senate to have open debate, to have open \namendments, the failure of the Senate to actually pass appropriations \nbills.\n  Continuing resolutions exist because Congress has fallen down on the \njob. Congress has not actually passed appropriations bills into law. \nOne of the things the continuing resolution bill does--a continuing \nresolution basically says let's keep everything going because we have \nnot actually passed the appropriations bills that would properly make \nthe funding decisions on the various agencies of government. But a \ncontinuing resolution enables those who want to keep funding ObamaCare \nto try to hold everything hostage to it.\n  For example, you hear some in the Democratic majority suggesting--\nthey often run through a parade of horribles. If there is a government \nshutdown, if the continuing resolution doesn't pass, here are all of \nthe horrible things that will happen.\n  Some of the parade of horribles that are suggested are contrary to \nlaw. For example, they will sometimes suggest people will not get their \nSocial Security payment or they will not get their Medicare or they \nwon't get their Medicaid or we won't pay interest on the debt. That is \nnot the way the Government works. All of those are paid through \nmandatory spending. The continuing resolution does not impact those \ncontinuing to happen. I note in 1995 when there were two partial \ntemporary shutdowns, Social Security checks continued to go out, the \ninterest on the debt continued to be paid. All that continued.\n  Another thing those who are trying to force ObamaCare on the American \npeople frequently want to hold hostage is the men and women in the \nmilitary. My friend from Wyoming noted if we passed appropriations \nbills that would not be a problem. The House has passed an \nappropriations bill for the military. Yet the majority leader, Harry \nReid, the Democratic majority, had not taken that bill up. If we had \npassed it into law you could quantify the chances of the men and women \nin the military having their pay suspended to mathematical certainty to \n0.000 percent. If we passed the appropriations bill, the issue would be \noff the table. But the Senate did not do its job; we did not pass the \nappropriations bill for the military.\n  That leaves a tiny window for the President to threaten. If Congress \nlistens to the American people and defunds ObamaCare, we may just stop \npaying the men and women of the military. Let me be absolutely clear. \nUnder\n\n[[Page S6734]]\n\nno circumstances ever should the United States not pay the men and \nwomen of our military who risk their lives on the front lines. Current \nlaw gives the President ample authority to continue to pay the military \nregardless of whether there is a temporary partial shutdown.\n  What has happened in the past, if and when there has been a temporary \npartial shutdown, is nonessential government services are temporarily \nsuspended. By any measure, the military of the United States is not \nnonessential. So if we had done our job, as the Senator from Wyoming \nputs that forward, if we had passed appropriations bills, we would have \ntaken off the table one after the other after the other of these \nhostages that are being held as the price to force ObamaCare on the \nAmerican people.\n  Part of the reason why the Democratic majority of the Senate does \nthat is because the debate on the merits of ObamaCare is very hard to \nwin. You notice we are, by and large, not engaging in a debate on the \nmerits of ObamaCare, in terms of defunding ObamaCare. You don't see \nDemocratic Senators talking about all the people who are losing their \njobs, you don't see Democratic Senators talking about all those people \nhaving their hours reduced or all the people seeing skyrocketing health \ninsurance premiums, or who are losing their health insurance. Instead, \nwe see Democratic Senators going on television and saying: Well, if \nthey stick to their guns on this, it is going to shut down the \ngovernment.\n  The Senator from Wyoming points out there is no reason for that. We \ncould have passed the appropriations bill or we could do what the House \nof Representatives did. The House of Representatives, in an \noverwhelming vote, 232 Members, including 2 Democrats, voted to fund \nevery aspect of the Federal Government--including, I note, some parts \nof the Federal Government that I am certain House Republicans are not \nfans of--yet they voted to fund all of it except for ObamaCare.\n  I know my friend Congressman Louie Gohmert has come over to the \nSenate floor in a show of solidarity. I appreciate Congressman Gohmert \njoining us.\n  I note if the Senate wants to avoid a shutdown, it can do so. Indeed, \nlast night I took the opportunity to ask the majority leader, Why don't \nwe avert this whole train wreck right now? Why don't we agree by \nunanimous consent to pass the continuing resolution the House has \npassed, take the prospect of a shutdown off the table entirely, and \ndefund ObamaCare because it is hurting the American people? Majority \nLeader Reid objected and said no. No, he wants to keep ObamaCare, he \nwants to force it on the American people. Critically, he wants to use \nthe threat of a government shutdown to try to do so. That, I suggest, \nis inconsistent with the obligation that every Senator has.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask permission to ask another question \nthrough the Chair, with the Senator being allowed to keep the floor.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, would the Senator agree that there are a \nnumber of things in this bill that have been changed because we have \nrecognized that those things would not work? We have changed--not we, \nthe President has changed a number of these things. I am having trouble \nfinding in the law where those changes come from. There is not a lot of \nwaiver authority in the bill, but every time a difficulty is found with \nthe bill, then there appears to be a waiver so that particular part of \nthe bill no longer exists.\n  I have never seen that done before on legislation. How do they take a \npiece of the law that is in the bill, that does not have a waiver \nright, and go ahead and exempt us under that particular part of the \nlaw? One particular part of that I am particularly sensitive on because \nI worked on it very diligently. As the bill came through committee, \nthat piece was the one where Congress should be under the law that we \npassed, Congress and the staff.\n  That got remodeled, as you will recall, a little bit so that the \ncommittee staffs did not have to come under it because the committee \nstaffs were actually going to finish up the bill. But we had intended \nfor all of our staffs to be under that bill.\n  Would the Senator agree that one of the amendments that we have not \nbeen able to vote on--it would have only taken 30 minutes to do a 15-\nminute vote. That is kind of standard around here; it takes us a little \nlonger to do a 15-minute vote. Heck, it takes us 20 minutes to do a 10-\nminute vote and that has to follow on the heels of a 30-minute 15-\nminute vote.\n  We could have had that vote, but we were not allowed to. What that \namendment is, as you will recall, what it would have done is put \nCongress back under the bill. It would have subjected Congress to \nsuffering the same exact thing the American public is going to start \nexperiencing on Tuesday as they go into the exchange or at the very \nlatest by the 1st of January when they are required to do that.\n  If their company is no longer providing them with insurance, the \ncompany will pay a little penalty but they get to come under the \nexchange. But they do not get to bring the company's tax-free donation \nto their health care along with them. But that is the way we had \nenvisioned it working for Congress too. They would not get a special \ndispensation. So we brought up this amendment which would require that \nnot only would Congress come under it, but since the President is the \none who exempted this and did not have the right to exempt this from \nit, we thought perhaps he and the Vice President and the political \nappointees maybe ought to come under that same bill. I mean, why \nwouldn't the President want to come under it? After all, it is called \nObamaCare. It is named after him.\n  Apparently there is a tremendous desire not to do that, to explain \nthat the Federal Government is different. That is exactly what the \nAmerican people are upset about, that we are different. We should not \nbe different. That is one of the things that could have been taken care \nof if we had taken this all through regular order.\n  I appreciate efforts of the Senator to be able to do something. I ask \nif the Senator believes we ought to be exempted under any parts of this \nlaw or if these exemptions would be legal for the President to do if it \nis not written in the law? As a lawyer, my colleague probably has \nbetter insight into that than I do--and a constitutionalist. That is \nwhy I ask the question. Does the President have the right to do that?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my colleague for that very good question. The \nsimple answer is no, the President does not have the authority to \nrewrite the law or alter the law. We operate under a principle that no \none is above the law. We are a nation of laws and not of men. There are \nmany disturbing aspects of ObamaCare, but one of the persistent ones is \nthis law has been such a train wreck that the approach of the President \nhas been, over and over, simply to disregard the language of the law, \nto pretend as if the law of the United States does not exist because as \npassed it was such a bad law. The way that is manifested, as my friend \nfrom Wyoming pointed out so accurately, is to grant exemptions to \npolitically favored classes.\n  It started out with big business. Giant corporations were all, with \nthe wave of a pen, told don't worry about ObamaCare. It is supposed to \nkick in for you January 1 of next year, but the President has decided \nhe is going to do a favor for big businesses that he will not do for \nsmall businesses, that he will not do for hard-working American \nfamilies.\n  The next significant waiver we saw was for Members of Congress. It \noccurred after a closed-door meeting here in the Capitol where majority \nleader Harry Reid and all the Senate Democrats, according to the public \nreports, came to the President and said: We want out of the ObamaCare \nexchanges.\n  As my friend from Wyoming pointed out, if the ObamaCare exchanges \nwere a good thing, if ObamaCare was working, why would there be panic \namong Senate Democrats saying please exempt Members of Congress? Why \nwould there be panic among congressional staffers, as I can assure you \nthere is, in a bipartisan way, about being subjected to these ObamaCare \nexchanges? Why would there be such opposition to subjecting the \npolitical appointees of the Obama administration to the ObamaCare \nexchanges or, as my friend from Wyoming pointed out so correctly, the \nPresident himself?\n\n[[Page S6735]]\n\n  It is, after all, called popularly ObamaCare. Even the President has \nembraced that name. You would think, I suspect, if there were a health \ncare plan called EnziCare, the Senator from Wyoming would be happy to \nbe covered by it and he would probably be very careful to draft a plan \nthat he would be willing and excited to be covered by.\n  What does it say that the people in charge of enforcing ObamaCare on \nthe American people want out? They want a special rule. The IRS \nemployee unions, the men and women who are given the statutory \nresponsibility of going to Americans, going to hard-working Americans \nand forcing Americans to comply with ObamaCare, have said in writing: \nPlease, let us out of ObamaCare. We don't want to be a part of this \nthing. This is our health care you are talking about.\n  The most profound issue we are dealing with here today is not jobs, \nit is not the economy, it is not health care, it is not ObamaCare. The \nmost profound issue we are dealing with here today is the fundamental \ndivide between Washington and American people. There is a ruling class \nin Washington, DC; that they are subjected to different rules than the \nAmerican people; that it is perfectly appropriate for political friends \nand allies of the President to get exemptions while single moms and \nyoung people and Hispanics and African Americans, people struggling, \nunion workers struggling to pay the bills, provide for their kids--they \ndon't get an exemption. Just those who walk the corridors of power. \nJust those with access to political influence.\n  You know what that does? It strengthens politicians even more. Look, \npoliticians are in the business of granting dispensations, granting \nexceptions. That means everybody in the country who wants some \nexception better come to politicians and support them.\n  If you want to talk about something corrosive to our system of \ndemocracy, why do you think the American people hold this body in low \nregard? Because we pass laws that treat us better than everybody else. \nTonight we are listening to the American people. We need to make DC \nlisten.\n  By the way, I have been told that during the course of this \nfilibuster, the ``#MakeDCListen'' has at times been trending No. 1 in \nthe country.\n  I say to my colleagues who have come to the floor in support of this \neffort that it is because the American people understand and are \nfrustrated as to why Washington doesn't listen to them, and for at \nleast a brief moment each of us together--the Senator from Wyoming and \nthe Senator from Oklahoma--are trying to serve as a voice for the \nAmerican people who don't often have a voice in Washington. We need to \nmake DC listen. There is nothing more important we can do than that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. A lot of people have forgotten the cost of this. I would \nlike to go over a couple of things if it is all right with the Senator. \nFirst, I wonder if the same thing is happening in his State--which is \nto the south of Oklahoma--of Texas that is happening in my State of \nOklahoma. We are just a week away from when people will have to start \nsigning up for ObamaCare. I commend Senator Cruz for reminding the \nAmerican people that this law doesn't have to be a new reality. It \ndoesn't have to be that way. We can stop it. There are still lingering \nquestions about exactly what this is all going to look like.\n  We do know this reform law, as they call it, continues to be \nexpensive and overreaching. When it started out, it didn't sound too \nbad to the American people. It is estimated that the program will now \ncost as much as $2.4 trillion over the years.\n  As I have suggested to my friend from Texas, around here we know what \n$1 trillion is, but most people don't know what that means. It is hard \nto understand this as far as what is going on in America. It will cost \n$2.6 trillion over 10 years once this is fully implemented, assuming \nthey are successful in doing it. The cost estimates have only continued \nto rise since the law was passed.\n  Most recently the administration asked for another $5.4 billion in \ndiscretionary funds next year for implementation. That is $5.4 billion \nin discretionary funds. Let's stop and think about that. One of the \nworst things about the Obama administration--and the Senator from Texas \nunderstands this since he is on the Senate Armed Services Committee--is \nhow this President has been disarming America. The discretionary money \nthat would be coming out of this is money that otherwise could be used \nfor our systems and to support our warfighters over there. That is just \nthe cost of the Federal Government. It doesn't include the lost hours, \nwages, and employees who have lost their jobs and the cost it will be \nto their families.\n  Everyone agrees the premiums will rise. In my home State of Oklahoma \nwe have a guy named John Doak. After talking to the insurance \ncompanies, he said Oklahomans' insurance will increase by a minimum of \n30 percent and up to 100 percent. He also said that one in four \ninsurers in Oklahoma will have their rates vary from $143 a month for a \n30-year-old with basic coverage to $673 a month for a 64-year-old who \nwants the best coverage.\n  Remember, the President promised to lower the premiums by $2,500. \nWhat I want to do, if I could, is share a little bit of good news. I \nknow the Senator from Texas is aware of it, but I don't know how many \nother people are aware of this. We have a great attorney general in the \nState of Oklahoma whose name is Scott Pruitt. I suspect the Senator \nfrom Texas has met Scott Pruitt. Before we voted on this issue, we had \na question on whether some of these subsidies would go any further. \nScott Pruitt, through the courts, filed a lawsuit and is leading the \ncharge to dismantle ObamaCare and put an end to it.\n  Last month the judge overseeing the lawsuit ruled against a motion \nfiled by the Obama administration to dismiss the case, which means the \ncase will proceed. That is huge. If this goes through, this whole thing \nwill be dismantled. That is why we need to go ahead and fight this as \nbest we can, recognizing that there are other areas where the American \npeople are speaking. Certainly Scott Pruitt is doing great things.\n  I heard the Senator mention Congressman Louie Gohmert. Congressman \nGohmert is a very close friend of mine. We have been together on a lot \nof things. I was visiting with him. He is in the Chamber right now and \nwould like to share some of the things that are happening in his \ndistrict, which is eastern Texas.\n  These are some of the letters that he gets from constituents. This \nsays:\n\n       To get setup on the software was too expensive. She also \n     didn't want to be limited on the time she felt she needed to \n     spend with her patients. Therefore, she stopped taking \n     Medicare. Had to go on strictly cash basis.\n\n  This text says:\n\n       My wife's doctor has just retired because he did not want \n     to deal with ObamaCare.\n\n  This is a letter that came from someone whose name is Katy Smith. She \ngoes through quite a bit, and then says:\n\n       The explanation from IBM was that they ``projected that \n     health care costs under the current IBM Medicare-eligible \n     retiree plan options will nearly triple by 2020.''\n\n  This is another letter from Riverside Cottages. I guess that is \nsomeplace in eastern Texas.\n\n       We were notified July 15, 2013 that my husband's insurance \n     coverage, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana/Montana \n     Comprehensive Health Association will terminate December 31, \n     2013. When my husband contacted Blue Cross Blue Shield, they \n     told him that this policy will no longer exist due to Obama \n     Care. He will need to find new coverage.\n\n  And it goes on and on.\n  The interesting thing--and the reason I am reading Texas letters \nright now--is that we receive a lot of them, and they are up in my \noffice someplace. So this hits home and hits home hard.\n  I ask my friend from Texas if he has received a lot of these \nanecdotal letters from people who are suffering serious hardships and \nare now anticipating what will happen when this becomes a reality?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from Oklahoma for his excellent question. \nLet me say from the outset that I am grateful for Senator Inhofe's \nleadership and his courage. From the outset Senator Inhofe has been \nwith me on this fight, fighting to defund ObamaCare.\n\n[[Page S6736]]\n\n  I want to also note that Senator Inhofe, like some of the other \nSenators who have come to the floor of the Senate this afternoon--\nincluding Senator Roberts, Senator Sessions, and Senator Enzi--are \nrespected veterans of this institution. They are leaders who have \nearned the respect of their colleagues.\n  I am grateful for Senator Inhofe being willing to stand up and be a \nleader in this fight. That courage is contagious. I hope it will \ncontinue to be even more contagious in the Republican Congress. I hope \nby the time we come to the cloture vote on Saturday that we see all 46 \nRepublicans united in voting against shutting off the debate and \nagainst allowing majority leader Harry Reid the ability to fund \nObamaCare with a straight 51 party vote.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Before that happens, I think it is important that the \npeople of this country have to know what this is all about. This is \nsocialized medicine. A lot of them didn't believe that. Last week \nmajority leader Harry Reid was on the PBS ``Nevada Week in Review.'' He \nwas asked whether his goal was to move ObamaCare to a single-payer \nsystem. His answer was: Yes, yes. Absolutely yes. Do a lot of the \npeople know what a single-payer system is? That is essentially \nsocialized medicine.\n  I was around during the Clinton administration when there was a thing \ncalled Hillary health care. Does my friend from Texas remember Hillary \nhealth care?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I do indeed. I remember in particular at the time the press \nand all of the graybeards in Washington at the time saying that Hillary \nCare was unstoppable. It can't stop it. Republicans need to get \ntogether.\n  If the Senator from Oklahoma will recall, initially the response was \ndescribed as like Hillary care lite. Back then in the midst of the \nHillary care fight there were a few courageous leaders in the House who \nstood up against Hillary Care. What changed that battle was the \nAmerican people rising. At the end of the day, it is the only thing \nthat can win any fights.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is exactly what did happen. I can remember going \nfrom Washington to my hometown of Tulsa. Normally I have to go through \nChicago. Chicago is where the AMA has their headquarters, and it is \nprobably still there. I will always remember this. I was rejoicing. I \nwas coming back after the long fight against Hillary health care or \nsocialized medicine. I remember saying the question on the Senate \nfloor: Try to explain this to me: If socialized medicine doesn't work \nin Great Britain, Sweden, or Canada, why would it work in this country? \nThey never said it, but what they were thinking was: If I were running \nit, it would work. We got that point across.\n  They started way ahead with Hillary health care, and then we started \nto catch up. Just like now people are realizing this is a failed \nsocialized medicine effort. We had won.\n  That kind of relates to what is happening today. I was on that plane \ngoing through Chicago to Tulsa, and I picked up the Wall Street \nJournal, and there was a full-page ad by the AMA supporting Hillary \nhealth care. Of course, when I stopped in Chicago, I went and visited \nthe AMA. This is an organization that represents a lot of real smart \ndoctors and others who were saying that we can't win. We can't win this \nand therefore let's go ahead with it. We had already won when they ran \nthat ad. I don't know how many days before that they put the ad in, but \nnonetheless we had won.\n  I don't know if my friend remembers that because my friend was not in \nthe Senate at that time. That is exactly what happened, and it is very \nanalogous to a lot of things that are happening today.\n  The other thing I wanted to mention is that anytime desperation \nstarts to set in, there are a lot of things that go around to confuse \npeople. Let me tell everyone what happened in Oklahoma today. This will \nsurprise my friend from Texas. There are 14 people who started this--\nthe Senator from Texas, myself, and 12 other people about 6 weeks ago. \nDuring this time we have been in lockstep to see what we could do to \nstop this from happening to my 20 kids and grandkids and the rest of \nAmerica.\n  People realized I was there from the very beginning, as the Senator \nfrom Texas mentioned, and yet we have some of the Obama people who are \ndoing robocalls in my State of Oklahoma posing as tea party people and \nsaying to call Inhofe because he is for ObamaCare.\n  I say to my good friend, I can't believe something like that is \nhappening. It shows a level of desperation where they are trying to get \npeople confused as to what the issue is and want to get to these \ndeadlines so we can get past this and have this thing as a reality. \nEvery liberal in America is probably for it.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from Oklahoma for that question. I have \nto say I am not surprised. There is an old adage among courtroom \nlawyers: If you have the facts, pound the facts. If you have the law, \npound the law. If you don't have either, pound the table.\n  To be honest, the approach by ObamaCare defenders is an awful lot of \ntable pounding. It is an awful lot of ``let's discuss anything other \nthan what, in fact, happened.'' Pick up any newspaper and it is talking \nabout this issue. What will the reporters, the political reporters in \nWashington, DC, write about? I think some may be frustrated because \nthey wanted to be Hollywood gossip reporters because they covered these \nissues as a battle of personalities. If you want to get a story on the \nfront page of the paper, find some anonymous congressional staffer to \nsay something scurrilous, ideally include profanity in it, and the \npolitical reporters eat it up, because, apparently, the only thing that \nmatters is the personalities bickering back and forth. In many ways, \nthat is not surprising, because if one is trying to defend a law that \nthe lead author calls a train wreck, that the unions who supported it \nare desperately trying to get out from under, that you and your \nDemocratic Senate colleagues are desperately asking for yourselves to \nbe exempted from it, then you sure as heck don't want to talk about how \nthe law is operating. You sure as heck don't want to talk about all of \nthe people who are losing their jobs because of ObamaCare. You sure as \nheck don't want to talk about all the people who can't get jobs, all \nthe small businesses that aren't growing because of ObamaCare. You \ncertainly don't want to talk about all of the people forced into part-\ntime work, 29-hours-a-week work. You don't want to talk about the \ninsurance premiums that are going up, pricing people out of the \ninsurance market, and you especially don't want to talk about all the \npeople losing their health insurance.\n\n  My colleague read the stories from East Texas of citizens there \nlosing their health insurance. That is happening all over the country.\n  So it doesn't surprise me that the Senator from Oklahoma is seeing \nrobocalls in the State of Oklahoma because they don't want to debate on \nthe merits of ObamaCare because it is indefensible. So the only \nstrategy is smoke and mirrors. The only strategy is, if we can't talk \nabout the law, let's convince them about something else. Let's distract \nthem. Let's figure out anything to take people's minds off of the \nunderlying issue.\n  I would note to my friend from Oklahoma, the only way that strategy \nworks is if the American people don't believe Washington will listen to \nthem.\n  Look, there are a lot of reasons for the American people to believe \nWashington is not going to listen to them because Washington hasn't \nbeen listening to us for a long time. Politicians on both sides of this \naisle have lost touch with their constituents. They don't go home, \ndon't go to townhall meetings, and view the desires of their \nconstituents as simply uninformed and not relevant to doing our jobs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator from Texas will yield, because he said \nsomething that is so profound.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am yielding for a question but not yielding the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Of course. The Senator from Texas said if you don't have \nlogic on your side or the facts on your side or the public on your \nside, what do you do? It is not just pounding the table. It is name-\ncalling.\n  I went through this, I would suggest to my friend, 12 years ago when \nthe Kyoto treaty was up and everyone thought global warming was coming \nand that was going to be everyone's trip to the White House to support \nglobal warming, until we realized what the cost would be. I was the bad \nguy\n\n[[Page S6737]]\n\nbecause I stood and said: No, this isn't true. First of all, it is a \nhoax; and secondly, even if it is not, we couldn't do it. That is when \nall the name-calling started. I can remember being called--in writing \nand by a fairly prominent person--I should be hanged for treason at \nthat time. That is what they get, and that is what my friend is going \nthrough right now with a lot of people who don't agree with him.\n  Twelve years later, what has happened? People realize I was right. I \nam not suggesting it is going to be 12 years before they realize the \nSenator from Texas is right on this, but it means the behavior of \npeople today is something that has happened many times in the past.\n  So I would just ask my friend to remember that and to realize that \nquite often, when a person is right on a controversial issue, they are \ngoing to be the subject of a lot of criticism, a lot of cussing, a lot \nof name-calling, and a lot of violence. So this isn't the first time.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from Oklahoma for his very kind remarks \nof support and encouragement and for his friendship from day one since \nI arrived in the Senate. I do hope other colleagues in this body don't \nlisten to all of the remarks of the Senator from Oklahoma and suddenly \ndiscover that hanging for treason is an option because that may not \nwork out terribly well for me. I hope that becomes purely fictional.\n  I will know that at the end of the day--listen, the Senator from \nOklahoma and I, and all 100 of us, are incredibly fortunate. We have \nlived lives in this country of relative privilege. We, everyone in the \nSenate, enjoys a good home, has a soft bed, I suspect, has air-\nconditioning, has food on the table. I feel blessed to have a wife who \nis my best friend in the world and whom I love with all my heart, to \nhave two precious little girls who are the joy of my life. To be able \nto come to work every day, to walk on this Senate floor, there is not a \nday when that doesn't take my breath away. The idea that the son of a \nCuban immigrant with nothing, who finds himself suddenly elected to the \nSenate, to have the opportunity to come in every day, it is truly \nawesome, in the real sense of the word. There was a time when the word \n``awesome'' was a Valley girl phrase for everything, but awesome, in \nits real sense of inspiring awe--I will tell my colleague I find it \nawesome every day to walk into this Capitol and to have the amazing \nprivilege to serve, as the Senator from Oklahoma and I do, as do all \n100 of us. The slings and arrows one deals with serving in public \noffice, to be perfectly candid, are all chickenfeed. The old phrase \nabout sticks and stones--listen, someone saying something mean about \nanother is nothing compared to the suffering that so many people across \nthis country are experiencing.\n  I sat down with one single mom who is working her heart out to \nprovide for her kids because she wants her kids to have a good home, \nshe wants her kids to have an education, she wants her kids to have a \nfuture. Her hours have been reduced to 29 hours a week and she doesn't \nknow what is coming next. That is hard work. That is suffering. This \nain't nothing.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma speaks with disabled veterans, as I know he \nhas done many times, and he is worried about the impact of ObamaCare on \nour economy, of jobs drying up. He is worried about his grandson who is \njust coming out of school right now but who can't get a job. That is a \nlot more important than the political bickering back and forth. That \nwas my point about all of the press coverage dealing with--it is not \nabout any personality here; it is about listening to the American \npeople.\n  The American people do not give a flying flip about any Member of the \nSenate--none of the 100 of us. What the American people are interested \nin is what we have always been interested in, which is freedom, our \nfamilies, providing for our kids, being a good example to our kids, \nworking for a better world and working so our kids and their kids have \nan even better future and opportunity than we have had. If we go back \ncenturies, we see that every generation of Americans has been able to \ngive to the next generation a brighter future, greater prosperity, \ngreater opportunity. We are on the verge of being the first generation \nof Americans not to do so. If we want to put our fingers on the \ndiscontent so many Americans feel, that goes right to the heart of it: \nWhat we are doing in Washington isn't working.\n\n  The economic malaise. I refer to the last 5 years as the ``great \nstagnation'' because for 4 consecutive years our economy has grown on \naverage 0.9 percent a year. It is not working. Intelligent, rational \npeople looking at a set of policies that aren't working would do the \nintelligent, rational thing. We would correct course. We would say, OK, \nthis isn't working. What has worked? But that is not happening. It is \nnot happening because even though it is not working, the failures \naren't visited on Congress. The failures are visited on the American \npeople. Congress exempts itself from ObamaCare. It doesn't even do it \nin the law. The law says we are covered by it, but, instead, Democratic \nSenators go to the President and say: We want a special exemption for \nus that doesn't apply to the American people. So the fundamental \nproblem is that elected officials are not listening to the people.\n  Earlier, I was reading the article about the lost generation of young \npeople from the Wall Street Journal that ran on September 19. I made it \nabout halfway through. Let me finish that article because I think it \nraises some very important issues. The last thing I read was about the \nyoung man, 23 years old, working a job where he says his job at the \ngrocery store--he doesn't have a college degree, but he is seeing more \nand more college degrees getting in, and he is saying: Gosh, I thought \nthis was a job that helped me pay my way through school. If this is the \nend job after you get a degree, what does it say about opportunity?\n  The last quote I read was:\n\n       I think a lot about whether I am ahead or behind. I really \n     hope I'm not ahead.\n\n  The article continues:\n\n       Americans aren't the only ones asking such questions. The \n     financial crisis that began in the U.S. quickly rippled \n     across the Atlantic, bursting similar credit and property \n     bubbles in countries such as the U.K., Ireland and Spain, and \n     crippling a European banking sector that had dense links with \n     the U.S. financial system.\n       Much of Europe's economy was plunged into its worst postwar \n     slump and has struggled even more in the U.S. to regain its \n     precrisis levels of growth and jobs. In Europe, the banking \n     crisis also triggered a second-wave crisis--massive capital \n     flights from Southern European countries that relied on \n     foreign borrowing--that came close to unraveling the euro.\n\n  Let me move forward beyond the Europeans, back to where it discusses \nAmerican young people again:\n\n       But there are signs that the weak economy is leading to \n     deep societal changes. An entire generation is putting off \n     the rituals of early adulthood: Moving away, getting married, \n     buying a home and having children. The marriage rate among \n     young people, long in decline, fell even faster during the \n     recession, and the birth rate for women in their early 20s \n     fell to an all-time low in 2012.\n\n  Why do we think it is that young people are putting off marriage and \nputting off kids?\n\n       According to a recent Pew Research Study, 56 percent of 18- \n     to 24-year-olds lived with their parents in 2012, up from 51 \n     percent in 2007--\n\n  Fifty-six percent of 18- to 24-year-olds lived with their parents in \n2012--\n\n     an increase that looks particularly dramatic because the \n     share had changed little in the previous four decades.\n\n  Moreover, many young people are losing hopes of matching the \nprosperity of their parents' generation.\n  I talked a minute ago about the hope of all of us that our kids have \ngreater opportunity. What does it say that young people are losing hope \nof even matching where we are, much less having greater prosperity?\n\n       Just 11 percent of employed young people in a recent Pew \n     survey said they had a career as opposed to ``just a job''; \n     fewer than half said they were even on track for one.\n       John Connelly thought he was on the right track in life. \n     The son of a New Jersey auto mechanic, he was the first in \n     his family to go to college when he enrolled in Rutgers in \n     2009.\n\n  I will note as an aside, my uncle went to Rutgers. I went to college, \nto Princeton in New Jersey, and my uncle was often fond of reminding me \nthat the very first collegiate football game that ever was played in \nthe United States was played between Rutgers and Princeton. At every \nThanksgiving, my uncle would then remind me who won and it was Rutgers \nwho won. Princeton\n\n[[Page S6738]]\n\ngot whipped in that Princeton game. I am sure John Connelly is quite \naware that Rutgers won the first collegiate football game in the United \nStates.\n\n       Four years later, the 22-year-old found himself $21,000 in \n     debt, without a permanent job and sleeping on friends' \n     couches in New Jersey and Brooklyn. ``I hear a lot of stuff \n     that people in my generation aren't buying cars or houses, \n     and I'm a step beyond that--I can't even pay rent on time,'' \n     Mr. Connelly says. ``I have a hard time planning 10 years in \n     the future when I can hardly plan three months in the \n     future.''\n       At Rutgers, Mr. Connelly was an honors student and \n     president of the student assembly. But wary of taking on more \n     debt, he ended up withdrawing from school with three credits \n     to go until graduation. After a summer spent living with \n     friends while working a temporary job at a Brooklyn \n     nonprofit, he found a grant that allowed him to reenroll in \n     school this fall, but he still doesn't know what he will do \n     when he graduates at the end of the semester. ``I kind of did \n     everything I was quote-unquote ``supposed'' to be doing,'' he \n     says.\n\n  I am still reading from the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       The costs of a ``lost generation'' go beyond the impact on \n     young people themselves. A 2012 analysis commissioned by the \n     Corporation for National and Community Service, a federal \n     agency, estimated that the 6.7 million American youth who are \n     disconnected from both school and work could ultimately cost \n     taxpayers $1.6 trillion in lost tax receipts, increased \n     reliance on government benefits and other expenses. Look \n     at broader economic and social effects such as lost \n     earnings and increased criminal activity and the impact \n     tops $4.7 trillion, the researchers estimated.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. My understanding is that the Senator's position is, if we \ndo not defund ObamaCare, as he has characterized it--the health care \nreform act--that he believes we should shut down the government on \nOctober 1. Is that the Senator's position?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Illinois for that question. That \nmost assuredly is not my position, so I thank the Senator for the \nopportunity to clarify it.\n  Let me be very clear. I do not believe we should shut down the \nFederal Government. The only reason we might shut down the Federal \nGovernment is if President Obama and Majority Leader Reid decide they \nwant to force a government shutdown.\n  What I believe we should do is the same thing the House of \nRepresentatives did, the same thing the House courageously did, which \nwas last Friday the House of Representatives voted to fund every aspect \nof the Federal Government--every bit of it, including parts they \ndisagree with--except for ObamaCare. I would note to my friend from \nIllinois, they did so in response to the American people because the \nAmerican people are hurting under ObamaCare.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator has spoken at length many times, including \ntoday, about his education. I respect him. He has gone to some very \nfamous schools. Certainly, the Senator understands it takes 60 votes to \nachieve the goal he is trying to achieve, which means the Senator \nbelieves he has at least all the votes on his side of the aisle and \nanother 14 votes on the Democratic side of the aisle to repeal \nObamaCare. Does the Senator have that belief?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator for that question, and I thank the \nSenator for the comment he has made in public, noting that having \nattended the schools I have that perhaps I had not learned to count to \n60. I will note that I am quite familiar with what is necessary to \ndefund ObamaCare. What I have said for months is this is a long \nprocess. I am not remotely Pollyannaish. I am not remotely under the \nillusion that this is going to be a short, quick process, that suddenly \nObamaCare will be defunded.\n  I am getting to the answer to the Senator's question, but it is a \ndetailed answer, so if he will forgive me, I will take a few moments to \nlay it out.\n  In my view, the first step to this process was unifying and \nmotivating the American people. This process was never going to work \nunless the American people became engaged in historic numbers. So I \nspent much of the month of August and September during our recess \ntraveling the State of Texas, traveling the country, doing everything I \ncould to go directly to the American people, to go around the \nlobbyists, to go around the entrenched interests in Washington, and go \nstraight to the American people.\n  I will tell the Senator, the response was incredible. Everywhere I \nwould go, I would see 1,000, 2,000 people show up. We have seen over \n1.6 million Americans sign a national petition to defund ObamaCare.\n  That was the first step. That was not going to be enough, but it was \na critical first step.\n  The second step was what happened last week. It was the House of \nRepresentatives voting to defund ObamaCare.\n  I would note, as the Senator from Illinois is well aware, that as \nrecently as a couple weeks ago, every learned observer, every pundit, \neveryone in Washington said: It is impossible that the House is going \nto pass a continuing resolution that defunds ObamaCare. It is not going \nto happen. Yet on Friday it did. Why did it pass it? Because the House \nof Representatives listened to the American people, because the Speaker \nof the House and House conservatives stood and did the right thing and \nmade a courageous vote. I will note, two Democrats joined the House \nRepublicans in that vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield further for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I would like to finish answering the Senator's last \nquestion, and I am happy to yield for another. But let me finish \nanswering the Senator's question.\n  The third step is where we are now as the Senate. In the Senate, we \nare going to have to do two things. The first thing we are going to \nhave to do in order to successfully defund ObamaCare is to unify \nRepublicans, to bring together all 46 Republicans, opposing cloture, \nopposing Harry Reid being able to fund ObamaCare on a straight 51-vote \npartisan vote. I believe every Republican should be unified in that. \nRight now we are not. Right now there are divisions in the Republican \ncaucus. I am hopeful Republicans will listen to our constituents. I \ncannot convince my colleagues. The only people who can convince my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle or that side of the aisle are the \npeople all of us work for, the American people.\n  If we are able to unify Republicans, the next step--the Senator asked \nme: How do we ultimately get to 60? I assume the predicate of that \nquestion is that the first thing we would have to do is to get to 51--\nso if we got 46 Republicans and we initially got five Democrats. How \nwould we get five Democrats? As the Senator from Illinois is well \naware, there are quite a few Democrats who are up for election in red \nStates, States where their citizens understand ObamaCare is a train \nwreck. It is not working. I believe if those Democratic Senators, \nparticularly in red States, begin hearing from their constituents in \noverwhelming numbers, that will change their calculus.\n  Let me readily admit, as long as Republicans are divided, as long as \nwe are shooting at each other, there is not a lot of incentive for \nDemocrats to come join us. But if we can unify Republicans, then I \nbelieve we will start with red State Democrats who will potentially \nlose their jobs if they continue not listening to their people.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Sure.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might question the Senator's premise as to whether the \nHouse was going to vote the way it did. Since it has voted 42 times to \nabolish ObamaCare, it came as no surprise.\n  But let me ask a specific question. One of the reasons I voted for \nhealth care reform--and I am proud that I did--was illustrated by a \nwoman whom I met in southern Illinois. The Senator has spoken today \nabout hard-working people, including members of his own family, and I \ndo not doubt that.\n  This woman's name is Judy. Judy is a housekeeper at a motel that I \noften go to, and we have become friends. Judy has worked her whole life \nin manual labor. She has been everything you\n\n[[Page S6739]]\n\ncan imagine--a cook, a waitress, a housekeeper, all of these things. \nShe is 62 years old. Judy told me that she had never had health \ninsurance one day in her life, ever. She worked every single day she \ncould, but she never had health insurance. It turns out Judy was \ndiabetic, and we found some doctors and hospitals locally in her area \nto give her some care.\n  We have just had an announcement in Illinois that is going to be \nofficially released tomorrow about what this new health insurance \nmarketplace in Illinois means for people such as Judy. It means we are \ngoing to offer 165 different health insurance plans in Illinois by \neight different insurers. The premiums at the lowest level of health \ninsurance, for those who are not under Medicaid, will be in the range \nof $84 a month. But the good news for Judy is that her income is so low \nshe now qualifies for Medicaid for the first time in her life. For the \nfirst time in her life, Judy who would be turned down because of the \npreexisting condition of diabetes, is going to have the peace of mind \nof health insurance.\n\n  The Senator and I are blessed to have the best health insurance in \nAmerica as Members of the Senate. So when the Senator says he wants to \ndisband and stop ObamaCare, does he want to deny the opportunity for \nJudy and millions more just like her for the first time in their lives \nto have the protection of health insurance they can afford?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Illinois for that question. I will \nsay, I respect his sincerity and passion in believing that government \nsolutions from Washington can fix this problem. I do not know if the \nSenator from Illinois shares the views that Majority Leader Reid \nexpressed on television. I do not know if his objective is as Majority \nLeader Reid said his was: to move to single-payer, government-provided, \nsocialized health care. But it may be. I do not want to put words in \nthe Senator's mouth. Certainly, I do not know one way or the other what \nhis view would be.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you.\n  Mr. CRUZ. But I will say this. The Senator tells the story of Judy. \nThe best way for Judy or anyone to have health insurance is to have an \neconomy that is booming where people can get jobs and have \nopportunities. Indeed, let me respond with two things.\n  No. 1, before the Senator from Illinois came to the floor of the \nSenate, I read a number of letters that have come from people all over \nthe country. Let me just read the next one in my stack because it \nhappens to actually be a counterpart to his story about Judy. This is a \nconstituent from Brackettville, TX, who wrote earlier this year:\n\n       Since the passage of what is known as Obama Care, my \n     insurance premiums have gone up three times. That doesn't \n     count the increases in my Medicare Part A and B that have \n     also risen. I was also informed prior to passage that certain \n     retirees from one group would see their company support \n     terminated after 2013 and my support will terminate after \n     2018. In the meantime, I've lost two family doctors who have \n     left the practice . . . and must settle for nurse \n     practitioners and physician assistants. I am fortunate to \n     have good coverage, for which I pay dearly, that is accepted \n     everywhere; but I fear the day I can no longer afford it. I \n     am paying for Obama's train wreck ever since the bill was \n     passed. Surely, there must be some way to defund or repeal \n     the bill. . . . Please help.\n\n  I would note for the Senator from Illinois, these pleas for help are \ncoming from all across the country.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator's answer to Judy is: You need a \nbetter job. After working a lifetime--62 years, hard work, the best she \ncan do; she has never had health insurance--and I think the Senator's \nanswer was: Judy, get a better job.\n  So let me ask another question.\n  When I voted for ObamaCare, health care reform, one of the things \nthat motivated me was the fact that health insurance companies would no \nlonger be able to discriminate against Americans with preexisting \nconditions.\n  I have had a situation in my family, a child who had a serious \nphysical problem, who could not have qualified but for group health \ninsurance that was available to me as a Member of Congress. If I had \ngone in the open market to buy a policy, I am not sure I would have \nbought one for my family to cover my child.\n  So when the Senator says he wants to abolish ObamaCare, does he want \nto abolish that part of ObamaCare which says you cannot discriminate \nagainst people with preexisting conditions when it comes to health \ninsurance? If those people are victims of asthma, diabetes, cancer \ntreatment, mental illness, does the Senator want to abolish ObamaCare \nand that protection?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Illinois for that question.\n  Let me answer it in two different ways. Let me talk generally about \nwhat the Senator talked about, about his health insurance and my health \ninsurance as a Member of the Senate and let me talk about preexisting \nconditions separately.\n  The first point I will make is that the Senator from Illinois is \npassionate and has been quite eloquent describing what he perceives to \nbe the benefits from ObamaCare. Yet I think it speaks volumes that the \nSenator from Illinois and I and every other Member of Congress have \nbeen exempted by President Obama from the plain text of the statute.\n  The statute provided--and it was inserted quite deliberately--if we \nare going to impose rules on the American people, we should be subject \nto the same rules, we should be put in the exchanges similar to \nmillions of other Americans. The Senator just talked about the \nwonderful exchange. The text of ObamaCare provides that he and I should \nbe in those exchanges. It also provides that, just like the other \npeople in the exchange, our employers cannot subsidize it once we get \nin that exchange.\n  Once it passed into law, the Democratic caucus met with President \nObama. Obviously, I was not in that meeting. But I read the public \nreports of what occurred there. I read the press accounts. The press \naccounts all indicated that the majority leader and the Democratic \nMembers of the Senate asked President Obama: Please get us out from \nunder this. We do not want to be in the exchanges.\n  I see my friend from Illinois is shaking his head. I was not in the \nroom. The press reports all say that is what occurred. But regardless, \nthat is what happened.\n  So that message was heard by the President because shortly thereafter \nthe administration issued a ruling that exempted Members of Congress \nand exempted our staff.\n  I am curious, if the Senator from Illinois is such a fan of the \nexchanges, is such a fan of the health care that has been provided to \nJudy, would the Senator from Illinois then support Senator Vitter's \namendment to provide that every Member of Congress, every one of our \nstaffs, every political appointee in the Obama administration--and, \nfrankly, I would like to see every Federal employee all put under the \nexchanges--so if we are going to make the rules for the American \npeople, that we be subject to those same rules, those same plans, so \nthat when we go on television and say the exchanges are very good, we \nare not talking about something someone else is experiencing, we are \ntalking about our own health care.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would yield, I would like to respond and \nask a question.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The point I would like to make is that the Senator is \njust plain wrong. What he has stated is just plain wrong. Here is the \nstate of the situation: The health insurance that you enjoy and the \nSenator from Alabama and I enjoy, as well as the Senator from Virginia, \nis the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. It covers 8 million \nFederal employees and their families, including Members of Congress and \nour staff. The premiums we pay for the health insurance we choose--the \nFederal Government as our employer pays 72 percent of the premiums. \nThis is not an unusual situation--150 million Americans, which is half \nof our population, have exactly the same arrangement. These are \nemployer-sponsored employer contributions to the health care of their \nemployees.\n  What the President did was to say, No. 1, that you, Senator Cruz, I, \nand others will now have to buy our health insurance through the \ninsurance exchanges that we created in ObamaCare.\n\n[[Page S6740]]\n\nWith it, we will get the employer contribution, as we do now--as you \nenjoy now personally and I enjoy--for that purchase of health \ninsurance.\n  My wife and I will be choosing a policy from the health insurance \nmarketplace in the State of Illinois. We will have 8 different \ninsurance companies and 165 choices. That is our insurance.\n  What you quarrel with is the employer contribution to health \ninsurance. If that is now your position and the position of Senator \nVitter and the Republican Party, that it is a Federal subsidy which \nshould be stopped, you are affecting the health insurance not just of \nMembers of Congress and their staff but 150 million Americans. You \nbetter think twice about this. If you want to stop employer \ncontributions to health insurance, that will be the headline for \ntomorrow morning. I do not support that. My question is, Do you?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his certainly genuine \npolitical advice and counsel. I would note that the experience \nDemocratic Senators found under ObamaCare of suddenly facing the \nprospect of losing their health insurance, of being forced into the \nexchanges, health insurance that had been employer provided--being \nforced into the exchanges with no employer subsidy, is a disconcerting \nexperience. It is an experience nobody liked. It is an experience that \nis lousy. There is a reason why Democratic Senators were so upset. \nThere is a reason why congressional staff were so upset.\n  What my friend from Illinois is not focusing on is that right now \nthere are Americans all over this country who are experiencing that \nsame exact sentiment because of ObamaCare. Just a few weeks ago UPS \nsent a letter to some 15,000 employees saying: We are dropping spousal \nhealth insurance because of ObamaCare. That is 15,000 UPS employees who \nhad insurance for their husbands and wives, and suddenly those husbands \nand wives are left without health insurance and being told: Go on an \nexchange with no employer subsidy. Senator Durbin just made a \npassionate case for why that is a terrible thing to tell people. I \nagree.\n  Listen, my preferred outcome is not to subject Members of Congress, \ncongressional staff, political appointees of the administration, and \nFederal employees to the exchanges and ObamaCare. My preference is to \nsubject nobody to that. But the reason Senator Grassley inserted that \namendment is because we have a problem of a ruling class in \nWashington--in both parties; this is a bipartisan affliction--that \nbelieves the rules that govern working Americans do not govern us.\n  So if we are going to set up a system, if ObamaCare is going to force \nAmericans all over this country to lose their employer-provided health \ninsurance, to be forced into the exchanges with no subsidies, then the \nmen and women who serve in this body should feel that pain exactly the \nsame. So when we go on television and say ``this is great,'' we should \nknow of which we speak because we got skin in the game and we are not \nbeing treated better. I think under no circumstance should Members of \nCongress be treated better than hard-working Americans. That is what \nPresident Obama did. He did so, by all reports, at the request of \nDemocratic Senators in this body.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for one last question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask one last question.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am going to yield to the Senator from Alabama. I am happy \nto return to the Senator from Illinois if he would like to remain, but \nI want to be fair because the Senator from Alabama has been waiting for \nsome time. So I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  An econometric firm and others have studied what is likely to happen \nin our economy. As I understand it, they predict that far more people \nwill be dumped from coverage into the exchanges than they have today. \nSo people who are under health care coverage today--it is being paid \nfor by their employer. The employer discovers it would be less \nexpensive to quit providing health care coverage and let those \nindividuals go into the exchange, and they may or may not provide any \nsubsidy to them.\n  So I do think the extent to which we as Senators go into the exchange \nand are guaranteed the full subsidy we have been getting--that is \ndifferent from what is going to happen to millions of Americans. I \nguess the Senator maybe has heard that argument and how it is possible \nthat if businesses decide to drop health care, individuals can then be \nforced to go into the exchange without any subsidy at all. I would ask \nSenator Cruz if he understands that is possibly what could happen to \nlarge numbers of Americans.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I think the Senator from Alabama is exactly right. We are \nseeing Americans all over this country hurt by ObamaCare.\n  I want to suggest that the problem we are debating today is bigger \nthan this continuing resolution, it is bigger than ObamaCare, and it is \nbigger even than the Federal budget. The problem is that the men and \nwomen of DC are not listening. They are not listening to the millions \nof Americans who are asking for more accountability, more \nresponsibility, and more truth from their elected officials. It is time \nto make DC listen.\n  I would observe that during the course of this afternoon, the hashtag \n``MakeDCListen'' has been trending No. 1 because the American people \nare frustrated. They are frustrated that the Democratic Senate is not \nlistening to them. They are frustrated that the Republican Senators are \nnot listening to them. The whole debate we are having right now is not \nabout strategy, it is not about process, it is not about procedures, \nand it is not about all of the pundits and pollsters and consultants. \nThe problem is that DC is not listening.\n\n  Everyone in America knows that ObamaCare is destroying jobs. What the \nSenator from Alabama so eloquently talked about, the econometric \npredictions--you have to get outside the beltway to any of the 50 \nStates and actually talk to people who are trying to find jobs and talk \nto small business owners who are struggling under the 20,000 pages of \nregulations. Everyone in America knows ObamaCare is destroying jobs and \ndriving up health care costs.\n  Let me encourage right now everyone in America--President Obama 3\\1/\n2\\ years ago promised the average American that by the end of his first \nterm, by the end of last year, the average American family's premiums \nwould drop $2,500. Let me encourage everyone in America whose premiums \ndropped $2,500 to go online and tweet ``ObamaCare cut my premium.'' You \nknow what. I am willing to venture that in every one of these States, \nif all of the Democratic Senators who support ObamaCare are willing to \nsay ``I will take only the votes of those of you whose premiums have \ngone down,'' I can tell you right now on the Republican side that I \nwill happily take the votes of everybody else because I am going to \npredict that is not going to be a 50/50 election, it is not even going \nto be a 60/40 election. Everyone knows this thing is not working, and \nWashington is pretending it does not know. This process is rigged. That \nis why we have to make DC listen.\n  In traveling across Texas, just like the Senator traveling across \nAlabama, I hear the stories everywhere I go. It does not matter what \ntown I am in, it does not matter whom I am talking about, I hear the \nstories. I see people with disabilities saying: Please stop ObamaCare \nbefore I lose my health insurance. I see young people who would like to \nbe working toward a career saying: Please, I would like a job.\n  I met with a whole bunch of service men and women who had just come \nback from Afghanistan at a military base in Texas. I asked them, as I \ntry do in any gathering that is a small enough group that I can do \nthis: Go around, share an issue that is weighing on your heart, that \nyou pray about, that you are concerned about.\n  I remember one young soldier said: I am most worried about jobs. When \nI come out of the military, am I going to have a job? All of my \nbuddies, when they come out, they cannot find jobs.\n  Everyone nodded and said: That is exactly right.\n  The American people want to stop this madness. So do I.\n  Here in Washington we pass million-dollar bills and billion-dollar \nbills no one has ever read, without even voting on them. We call it \nunanimous consent.\n\n[[Page S6741]]\n\nIt is only unanimous because we do not let the American people know. It \nwould be very interesting to bring 100 of our constituents in on any \nunanimous consent that is spending $1 billion here, $1 billion there, \nand see what our constituents think about that. The system is designed \ndeliberately to hide what we are doing.\n  In this debate right now there are many Members of this body who are \nhappy that the debate is covered with obscurity over pressure, \nobscurity over a motion for cloture on a motion to proceed. Nobody \nknows what that is. You know what. That benefits Members of this body \nbecause it lets all 100 go back to their citizens and say: What were \nyou for? Yeah, yeah, I was for that because I was for the motion to \nwhatchamacallit.\n  No one understands what that is.\n  You know, one of the things we see is our leaders demand approval for \nbills before they are amended. So we are being asked this Friday or \nSaturday to vote to shut off debate on this bill before we know what \nthe bill will be. We do not know what amendment Harry Reid is going to \nfile, but we are asked to cut off debate nonetheless. It is like former \nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi when she said: Pass it to find out \nwhat is in it. You wonder why the American people are disgusted with \nwhat happens in Washington. That is business as usual in this town.\n  Listen, the way this is planning to unfold is very simple. Majority \nLeader Reid has said that if he succeeds in cloture, if he succeeds in \nshutting off debate on Friday or Saturday, that he is going to \nintroduce one amendment--and by all appearances only one amendment--to \nfund ObamaCare in its entirety. That will be subject to a straight 51-\nvote threshold.\n  There are a couple of dynamics going on. No. 1, Republicans are \nactively debating among ourselves: Should Republicans vote with Harry \nReid and Senate Democrats to allow Harry Reid and Senate Democrats to \nfund ObamaCare with a straight 51-vote partisan majority? I do not find \nthat a difficult question. I think that should unify all 46 Republicans \nto say no. We should not enable ObamaCare to be funded, and a vote for \ncloture on Friday or Saturday is a vote to fund ObamaCare. They are one \nin the same. They are identical.\n  If you vote to give that power to Harry Reid to fund ObamaCare, then \nyou are responsible for it being funded--and, by the way, for it being \nfunded in the same broken process where there are no amendments, there \nis no opportunity to change it, there is no opportunity to offer \nanything. The Presiding Officer will not have an opportunity to offer \nan amendment, and I will not have an opportunity to offer an amendment. \nInstead, it is brute political force.\n  But I will tell of an upside--an upside, frankly, from some Members \nof the Republican caucus. If debate is cut off, they can tell their \nconstituents: I voted for the House bill. That is not true, but they \ncan tell them that. But even better, a 51-vote threshold--here is the \ndirty little secret people do not want to admit: There are more than a \nfew Republicans on this side who affirmatively want a 51-vote threshold \non funding ObamaCare. Why? Because they want two outcomes. No. 1, if we \nhave a 51-vote threshold on funding ObamaCare, I promise you all 46 \nRepublicans will vote against it. It will be a straight party-line \nvote, which means every Republican can go back to their district and \nsay: Mr. and Mrs. America, when I had the opportunity to vote against \nObamaCare, I did it. I did what you wanted.\n  I did what you want. The rest of it is kind of hidden in the \nprocedural mumbo jumbo. But the beautiful outcome--and the reason why \nsome Republicans want a 51-vote threshold--is if it is 51 votes we will \nlose. The President is well aware there are more than 51 Democrats in \nthis body. It will be a partisan party-line Democratic vote, exactly \nhow ObamaCare got passed into law.\n  I am going to suggest that Republicans going along and saying we want \na symbolic vote is not listening to the people. Look, the dysfunction \nis on both sides. The Democratic Members of this Chamber--I understand, \nlook, ObamaCare is a Democratic law passed and signed into law by a \nDemocratic President, passed into law with only Democratic votes.\n  It is hard, if you are a political party, to admit, gosh, this thing \nthat we put a lot of political capital in, it ain't working. That is a \ndifficult, risky thing for anyone to say.\n  I am going to encourage--and my hope is that by the end of this \nprocess we will see some Democrats, Senate Democrats, listen to their \nvoters and say: Listen, I thought this thing would work, I hoped it \nwould work, but it hasn't. That is what the unions have said. The labor \nunions that publicly, vocally supported ObamaCare--and many of them \nwere active proponents of getting it passed--have looked at it and \nsaid: Do you know what, we thought it would work and it hasn't.\n  There is no shame in admitting you tried something and it didn't \nwork. I very much hope over the course of this debate we will see some \nDemocratic Senators doing so. I would note that the fact that Senate \nDemocrats are not participating, are not here, makes it less likely. \nBut on the Republican side, the game is the same.\n  Washington, DC, is a strange place in many regards, one of which is \nsymbolic votes are treated as tremendously important. I am told of a \nconversation that Senator Lee had with a Member of the House when early \non the House had not yet voted to defund ObamaCare, but there was \ndiscussion about casting a symbolic vote to do so. The American people \nwere quite unhappy with that and expressed that view.\n  Both Senator Lee and I expressed the view that we shouldn't be \nengaging in procedural games; we should actually be defunding \nObamaCare. One particular House Member who will remain unnamed called \nSenator Lee and made a comment that I thought was particularly \nrevealing. He said: You guys should be grateful. We gave you your vote.\n  I remember thinking what a curious turn of phrase, ``grateful.'' What \nan odd, Washington view of things. Why should we feel gratitude for \ngetting a vote that is 100 percent destined to lose because it is \noffered in such a way that Harry Reid, on a party-line vote, can fund \nObamaCare, and yet we can all have a symbolic vote. The reason, \nfrankly, is that this is a town where for a long time neither side has \nlistened to the team. This is the town where for a long time there have \nbeen elected politicians who want symbolic votes.\n  Let me be very clear. I don't want any symbolic votes on anything. I \nthink everyone--our constituents should know what we believe. Whether \nor not we get a vote on it to demonstrate it shouldn't matter, because \nif we are standing and fighting, and if we are walking the walk, our \nbeliefs should be self-evident.\n  DC responds, the DC establishment responds, if anybody tries to tell \nthe truth--look, I promise you, my observations right now that there \nare some Republicans that would like a symbolic vote and then would \nlike to lose so that they don't have any risk of it actually being \ndefunded, I promise you those comments are not getting me invited to \nany cocktail parties in Washington anytime soon. That is perfectly \nfine. I don't particularly enjoy cocktail parties anyway.\n  This town needs a lot more truth telling. It is absolutely true. \nEveryone here knows it, but we are not supposed to say it out loud. \nThere is a custom where we kind of wink at each other and say, listen, \nyou are telling your constituents one thing, I am telling my \nconstituents one thing. Let's not bother to give them the opportunity \nto know the truth.\n  If we got 100 of your constituents or mine, if we got 100 citizens \nfrom any of the 50 States and we put them in this room instead of 100 \nSenators, I promise you, No. 1, our constituents would not care about a \nsymbolic vote. If you got 100 people, why would you want a symbolic \nvote? What is the point of that?\n  It is only the politicians who make a living staying in office that \nwant symbolic votes. Symbolic votes are useful for getting reelected. \nThey don't actually change the country. They don't make the lives of \npeople better. But they do help politicians who want to get reelected \nand want to run a campaign ad saying, here is what I voted to do.\n  If you have 100 citizens in the Commonwealth of Virginia, the great \nState of Texas, the great State of Alabama, what they would say on \nObamaCare is,\n\n[[Page S6742]]\n\nwe have to fix this. We have to get people back to work. We have to \ndeal with all the young people that are stuck in dead-end jobs because \nthey can't get a job coming out of school. We have to deal with all the \npeople, all single moms working in diners who are finding themselves \nworking 29 hours a week because of ObamaCare. We have to deal with all \nof the people who are struggling because their health insurance \npremiums are skyrocketing under ObamaCare. We have to deal with all of \nthe people who are losing their health insurance under ObamaCare.\n  This is why I am speaking out today and why so many others have come \nhere speaking out because we have to make DC listen. That is what this \nfight is about, to make DC listen to the American people. I very much \nhope that the debate over the course of this week has a real effect \nchanging the culture. That is why this body has held 10, 12, 14 percent \napproval ratings.\n  I remember a few months ago when all of us were in the Old Senate \nChamber, all 100 Senators. It was a bipartisan meeting, and it was \nactually a very interesting, productive conversation. I remember a \nnumber of Senators commenting about the low approval ratings that \nCongress has and saying something to the effect that it is because we \nare not more efficient, that we don't pass more laws.\n  I have to say I think that gets it exactly backwards. I have never \nonce found any constituent in the State of Texas--and I suspect there \nare not many in your State, in my State, or in anyone else's State--who \nsays the problem is you guys aren't passing enough laws. That is not \nwhat I hear from people.\n\n  It is what you hear from politicians in Washington who would like to \npass as many laws as possible so they can take credit for them. But it \nis not what you hear from people. The people at home say: You guys have \ndone enough damage already. I will tell you why I think we are held in \nsuch low esteem. It is because we don't listen to the American people.\n  In every poll that has been done for years of the American people, in \nany State, whether your State, my State, any State, even bright blue \nStates, Democratic States, if you ask the American people what is their \ntop priority, jobs and the economy is the overwhelming answer. This is \ntrue if you ask Republicans, even if you ask only Democrats. If you ask \nonly Democrats in bright blue States, jobs and the economy are still \nthe top priority--or independents, Libertarians, anyone in the United \nStates.\n  Yet the Presiding Officer and I have both served in this body 9 \nmonths. I would note the 9 months we have been here the Senate has \nspent virtually zero time talking about jobs and the economy. It is not \non the agenda. We don't talk about it. We spent 6 weeks talking about \nguns, talking about taking away people's Second Amendment right, and no \ntime talking about fundamental tax reform, fundamental regulatory \nreform. Today we are talking about defunding ObamaCare, the biggest job \nkiller in the country. If you want to get jobs and the economy going, \nthere is nothing we could do that is more important than defunding \nObamaCare.\n  What is the case? There are right now three Members of the Senate on \nthe floor of the Senate and two Members of the House of \nRepresentatives. Ask the American people, how many Senators should be \nhere in the debate over defunding ObamaCare, the biggest job killer in \nthis country? Because the American people's top priority is jobs and \nthe economy, the people would say to all 100 Senators, what possibly do \nyou have that is more important to do?\n  I expect some of my colleagues are at a fundraising dinner. Some of \nour colleagues are at home with their families.\n  Do you want to know why Congress is held in such low esteem? It is \nnot that we don't pass enough laws; it is that the priorities of the \nmen and women in this body are not the priorities of the men and women \nin America. We are not listening to America.\n  The most important objective, what I hope will come of this week, \nmore important than the continuing resolution and the budget, more \nimportant than ObamaCare, is that we make some real progress to \nchanging the culture of this place so that both Democrats and \nRepublicans start listening to the people. That is the way our \ndemocratic republic is supposed to work. Right now, unfortunately, it \nis not how it is working.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I yield for a question without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator made an important point about too often \nwhat goes on around here is that we have to obscure the reality of what \nis happening. I think that is important. I wish to ask about it. The \nSenator asked Senator Durbin--I didn't see exactly how he answered. I \nthink the Senator asked him whether or not he believed in a single \npayer. I don't think he answered. We know for a fact, though, that \nSenator Reid in August said, when squarely asked: Do you believe in a \nsingle payer, he said: Yes, yes, absolutely yes.\n  What we have learned since then is that others are making the same \nstatement. This spring, Senator Sanders of Vermont, a nice and able \nSenator in the Budget Committee, said this bill is not going to work; \nreally, in my view, it is not going to work; It needs to be a single \npayer.\n  Senator Sanders is one of our more liberal Members--and I think it \nwas how he identified himself, as a socialist, but he is an honest, \nable advocate. He said the truth: this bill, as written, will not work. \nIt has to be a single payer.\n  Only this afternoon in the Budget Committee, one of our esteemed \nMembers of the Democratic Party, when asked--when I made a comment \nabout Senator Reid, that the majority leader of the Senate said he \nwanted a single payer--he said, this ought to be a single payer system.\n  I don't know how many others have. The President said, in 2003, when \nhe was running, he flat out said he wanted to have a single payer. Then \nhe backed off and began to obscure that position, it seems to me. It \nseems to me that they realize that the American people were nowhere \nready to have their government take over health care. So what did they \ndo? It seemed to me that they obscured what the reality of this \nlegislation was. They began to move away from it, and they began to say \nthat it was something that it wasn't.\n  In the last few days it is almost like they have come out here in the \nopen and begun to say that is what should happen. I understand the \nDemocratic leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, has said that she favors \na single-payer system.\n  I think I will say to Senator Cruz that I feel you are doing \nimportant work because the American people may not yet fully know how \nhuge an issue it is before this Congress. This is huge.\n  Let me ask again, when we say there is a single payer--hair begins to \nstand up on my neck--I think I know who the payer is. Who would be the \nsingle payer for all health care in America if that kind of agenda took \nplace?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank Senator Sessions for that very important question. \nThe payer would be the U.S. Government, which means the payer would be \nthe U.S. taxpayer, which means the payer would be hard-working \nAmericans, once the Federal Government starts paying for all health \ncare in all of America, which has been the stated position of the far \nleft for a long, long time.\n  The Senator from Alabama made reference to Senator Bernie Sanders. I \nagree. I respect Senator Sanders's commitment to his principles. As you \nknow, he previously ran as a socialist. That is correct. I respect that \ndegree of candor. Quite frankly, I would be very happy if this body had \n10 more Bernie Sanders and 10 more Mike Lees, because I think there \nwould be far more truth in advertising and then we could have real \ndebate about what the role of government should be in our lives.\n  Should we have socialized medicine? That is a very good debate to \nhave, especially because--and I know the Senator from Alabama agrees \nwith me on this--the facts are on our side. In every country on Earth \nwhere socialized medicine has been implemented it hasn't worked. We \nknow what the results are. If you implement socialized medicine, you \ninevitably see poor quality. You see rationing, you see scarcity. You \nsee the government getting between you and your doctor, the government \ndeciding you want a health treatment, your mother wants a health \ntreatment, your child needs a health\n\n[[Page S6743]]\n\ntreatment. And you have a government bureaucrat deciding whether you \nget one. Maybe the bureaucrat tells you: Well, you can get that hip \nreplacement you want in 6 months, in 1 year. But they may turn to \nSenator Lee and say: You know what. Your mom can't get that treatment. \nWe have determined in our tables it doesn't make sense to give her that \ntreatment. I guess she is at the end of her road.\n\n  That is what happens. It is the government that decides who gets \nhealth care and who doesn't. And you know what. Americans \noverwhelmingly don't want that. This is another point that is critical. \nIt is not just that Majority Leader Reid said he likes single-payer \nsocialized health care; it is that he says, and a number of others \nhave, that ObamaCare is designed to lead to that. I think it is very \nimportant to ask the question: Why? How does it lead to that? Because \nthat goes to both sides of the aisle.\n  There are many Republicans who have said: We shouldn't fight this \nfight. It is risky. We will get political blame. All of the DC pundits \nsay we shouldn't do this. Let's sit quietly and let ObamaCare collapse. \nIt is collapsing of its own weight, it is not working. If we sit \nquietly, it will collapse and the Democrats will take the blame. I am \nsuggesting there is far too much worry about blame and credit. Who \ncares? I don't care if Democrats take the blame. I would prefer to \navoid the collapse and spare the Democrats the blame. Who cares?\n  But if it collapses, why is it that Majority Leader Reid says \nObamaCare will lead to single payer? Because in the process of the \ncollapse, it will take our private health insurance system with it. \nYes, it will collapse, but it will leave a wreckage. It will leave \nmillions of people losing their health insurance, being pushed more and \nmore into the exchanges, with one insurer after the other pushed out of \nthe market. So when it collapses, there is no private health insurance \nmarket to go back to. That is why Majority Leader Reid can tell the \nAmerican people: Hey, I want the single-payer socialized medicine. And \nrelax, ObamaCare will take us to that.\n  But that is also a real message to all the Republicans who right now \nhave not yet announced they are going to oppose cloture on this bill. \nBecause if we wait for ObamaCare to collapse--yes, it will collapse--\nwith it will go the private health insurance system, and we may find \nourselves in single payer. I think instead of worrying about blame, \ninstead of trying to play the politics and think through it--and, \nlisten, I am not nearly smart enough to play through all the political \nangles and everything else--it is a lot simpler to stand and do the \nright thing. One of the easiest ways to do the right thing is to listen \nto the American people.\n  You want to know what the American people are worried about. Go home \nand listen to your constituents. Their concerns are: I am trying to get \na job and I can't get a job. I am trying to grow my small business and \nObamaCare is driving us out of business. I am afraid of losing my \nhealth insurance and ObamaCare is taking away health insurance.\n  Look, we have read, and I have stack after stack that I am going to \nkeep reading, from individual constituents--constituents in Texas and \nVirginia and Utah and Alabama and all over the country--who are losing \ntheir health insurance because of ObamaCare, who are losing their jobs \nand being forced into part-time work. We need to listen to the people.\n  I told the men and women who are watching tonight if they were to \ntweet the hashtag ``MakeDCListen,'' which has been, over the course of \nthis, trending No. 1, that I would share some of the tweets they sent. \nSo with your indulgence, I would like to do so to help give them a \nvoice.\n  Many of these folks right now presumably cannot walk on to the Senate \nFloor and give a speech. Maybe in a few years some of them might. Maybe \nin a few years, if enough politicians in this body don't listen to the \nAmerican people we may get quite a few of these tweeters who show up as \nnew Senators committed to listening to the American people. But in the \nmeantime--\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Texas yield?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. When the Senator thinks about those people who have \ntweeted and e-mailed and called and have written, most know something \nabout the American system. If you were in Illinois or Alabama or Texas \nor Utah and you talked about this and said: This law has got real \nproblems and it can't work the way it is, wouldn't the Senator think \nthey would think the Senate would be able to take up this legislation \nand actually discuss it in a grownup way; that amendments could be \noffered that could fix it and be voted on up or down?\n  Doesn't the Senator think the fact we are in this situation--the \nSenator called it a steamroller--where the majority leader is blocking \nall amendments, all ability to attempt to fix this legislation and make \nsomething that would actually work, even though the House has passed \nrepeatedly changing this law and ending this law, that the average \nAmerican would be shocked to think we are incapable in this Senate of \nbringing up legislation and having it voted on in order to fix this \nbill?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I think Senator Sessions is absolutely right. The Senate \nisn't trying to fix this bill. The Senate isn't trying to respond to \nthe needs of the American people. It isn't trying to respond to the \njobs that have been lost, to the people who have been forced into part-\ntime work, to the people who have lost their health insurance. Instead, \nit is responding to political power.\n  I will note that any Republican--on Friday or Saturday when we have \nthe cloture vote--who votes to cut off debate is voting to give \nmajority leader Harry Reid the ability to force funding for ObamaCare \nwith no changes--no amendments, shutting off amendments. The Senator \nfrom Alabama can't offer amendments, I can't offer amendments, and we \ncan't do anything. It is a pure exercise of political power on a \nstraight party-line vote. That will make many Republicans happy because \nthey will get to symbolically vote against it, and then we will be \ncertain to lose if it is a 51-vote threshold.\n  Part of the reason, I would suggest--and one can understand why the \nmajority leader wants to do that. Listen, if you are defending a law \nsuch as ObamaCare, that is a train wreck, in the words of the Democrat \nwho wrote the bill, you don't want to debate the substance of it. When \nthe esteemed Senator from Illinois was down on the floor--and I \nappreciate his coming--he sure didn't want to debate why there is a \ncongressional exemption, why Members of Congress are treated better \nthan average Americans, why President Obama has said Members of \nCongress are going to be exempted from ObamaCare but hard-working \nAmerican families are not.\n  Look, I understand. If I were the Democratic majority leader and I \nwere defending that position, I wouldn't want to defend it either. \nBecause I have to tell you there is not a State in the Union where \nour constituents wouldn't just about tar and feather us if we stood in \nfront of them and defended that, yes, there should be a special \nexemption for Members of Congress but not for you. And for big \nbusiness. President Obama granted a special exemption for big business, \nbut not for you, not for hard-working Americans.\n\n  Look, what a perfect example of the broken system, of the disconnect \nbetween DC and the American people. It is indefensible on the merits, \nand so this whole process is designed not to debate on the merits. It \nis designed never to have that debate because, as I observed earlier, \nthe old adage in the courtroom--and my friend Senator Lee will \nrecognize this from his days as a litigator, as will the Chair--if you \nhave the facts, pound the facts; if you have the law, pound the law; \nand if you don't have either, pound the table.\n  So if you are defending ObamaCare, if you are defending exemptions \nfor giant corporations and Members of Congress that don't go to the \naverage American family, you don't want to talk about the facts and you \ndon't want to talk about the law, so you want to pound the table. You \nwant to talk about shutting down the government. You want to scare \npeople. You want to threaten cutting off the funding of the men and \nwomen in the military, which is grossly irresponsible. I think Congress \nshould never ever imperil the salaries\n\n[[Page S6744]]\n\nof the men and women who risk their lives to protect us.\n  This body should immediately take up the Defense authorization bill \nthe House passed so that we can make sure the men and women in the \nmilitary are always paid. And, by the way, even without that--if there \nwere a partial shutdown--the President has all the authority he needs \nin existing law to pay the men and women in the military.\n  But if you don't want to debate the merits, you have to distract \npeople. So it is a game. If you talk to a professional magician, \nmagicians are good at banter and they are good at smoke and mirrors and \ndistraction. Sometimes when they raise their hand and they have a shiny \nobject over here and they want everyone to look over here, it is \nbecause they are pulling a card out of the deck with this hand. There \nare a lot of professional magicians in this Senate. There is a purpose \nto all of the discussion about shutdown and, for that matter, all of \nthe personal politics--all of the attacks, more than a few of which \nhave occurred within the Republican conference, more than a few of \nwhich have been directed at Senator Lee, more than a few of which have \nbeen directed at myself, and more than a few have been directed at the \ncourageous House conservatives who led the fight in the House to get \nthe House of Representatives to do the right thing and defund \nObamaCare. It is not even the purpose that appears on the face of it. \nOne would think the purpose is as it appears on the face. One would \nthink the purpose for leaking nasty quotes, trying to beat up people, \nsending congressional staffers to get anonymous quotes--a little bit of \nprofanity, a sort of mean, wicked sense of humor is because they are \ntrying to pound somebody. It is not that, although that is an added \nside benefit. It is all about distraction. Make it about the \npersonalities, make it about the people, make it about anything, \nanything, anything other than ObamaCare.\n  If we were actually talking about ObamaCare, if we were listening to \nthe people--listen, if we were listening to the people, the people \ndon't give a flip about any of the hundred of us. They don't care about \npoliticians. And for good reason. There are very few people in America \nwho say, when asked what do you want to do on the Fourth of July, they \nwant to pal around with a bunch of elected politicians. Most people \nwant to be in their backyard grilling burgers with their kids. God \nbless them. That is why America is the greatest country on Earth, \nbecause we have families and it is not about government. You know, in a \ntotalitarian regime, everyone thinks about government almost all the \ntime. Because when you have a jackboot on the back of your neck, it is \nhard to think about anything else.\n  The game in Washington is smoke and mirrors. The game in Washington \nis distract from anything, anything, anything, except the thing the \nAmerican people care about--fixing the jobs and the American economy. \nThat is not what is happening.\n  All right, let me read some tweets.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield one more time for \na question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question. I would note my friend \nfrom Alabama seems bound and determined to stop the tweets. God bless \nhim.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am interested in those tweets. I just wanted to thank \nthe Senator for what he has done, because I think he is alerting all of \nus to the critical importance of the health care issue.\n  This is a plan, it seems to me, and the Senator has expressed it, I \nbelieve, to take over health care by the U.S. Government. We can all \ndisagree. I was here when everybody on the Republican side fought this \nlegislation until Christmas Eve, when it was finally rammed through \nshortly before Scott Brown from Massachusetts could take office and \nkill it. That is how close it was. I know people disagree about how to \ndeal with it, and I understand and respect people with differing \nvisions, but I wanted to say the Senator's leadership has served a \nvaluable purpose tonight, and I am pleased to be able to support his \neffort. I wish him every success in those efforts, and I hope, as the \nSenator continues tonight, he will drive home the critical importance \nof this issue as we go forward. It is a matter this entire Nation \ncannot look away from. It is a matter we need to consider fixing \nbecause the legislation, as presently written, will not work.\n  We have two choices, it seems to me. We move forward to a single \npayer, as Senator Sanders said we must do because this legislation \nwon't work as written or will we move back to the classical American \nview of insurance and private health care and our own personal \nphysicians.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas and would be pleased to hear some of \nthose great tweets I know he has.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Alabama, and I thank him for his \nperseverance, his leadership, and his courage. I will say there have \nbeen more than a few legislative fights, and even a few while I have \nserved in this body, on which Jeff Sessions and I have been fighting \nside by side, and I appreciate his friendship and wisdom, and it \nmatters in this body.\n  Let's hear from the American people some of the tweets that were sent \nthis afternoon during this discussion:\n\n       Already got a second job again because taxes are squeezing \n     me dry. Make D.C. listen.\n       Congress passes laws that they don't follow, lives large \n     off our money, and has contempt for those they represent. \n     Make D.C. listen.\n       2700 pages when it was passed, over 20,000 pages now to \n     implement. Make D.C. listen.\n       Vote no on cloture. A vote for cloture is a vote to fund \n     ObamaCare. Defund ObamaCare. Make D.C. listen.\n       We will not go quietly into this disaster called ObamaCare. \n     Make it cover everyone or no one. Make D.C. listen.\n\n  What a great point. If ObamaCare is such a terrific thing, as its \ndefenders say, then all of us should be subject to it--big businesses, \nMembers of Congress, our staffs, President Obama, every political \nappointee in the government, every Federal employee.\n  If that is a burden--and I believe it would be a huge burden--I would \nnot be eager about that personally, but if that is a burden, then it \nshouldn't cover anyone. If there is some reason why that would be \nunacceptable--I actually think, of all of those, our friends on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle would probably get the most pushback from \nhaving it apply to all Federal employees because Federal employees \nwould push back mightily for good reason. But the right thing to take \nfrom that is not, well, all these guys should be exempt. It is, why \nwould they push back?\n  If Members of Congress and their staff, Federal employees, the \nPresident, and the executive branch employees all found themselves \nsubject to the same exchanges, the same rules that hard-working \nAmericans find themselves subject to and they would be really, really \ndismayed, that should motivate every one of us to say: Hey, I am a lot \nmore worried about the single mom working in a diner than I am about \nthe IRS tax agent making $125,000 a year who is dismayed about being \nsubject to the same rules as that single mom. And if we wouldn't be \nwilling to make it apply to everyone, then it shouldn't apply to \nanyone.\n\n       Make D.C. listen. Do the right thing and defund this \n     abomination of an unfair tax.\n       Listen up, America. This is your wake-up call. Make D.C. \n     listen.\n       Defund ObamaCare now. We do not need this injurious \n     legislation to be enacted. Make D.C. listen.\n       Stay strong. Vote no on cloture. ObamaCare must be stopped. \n     The will of the majority of Americans is to defund ObamaCare. \n     Make D.C. listen.\n       Sick of our employees deluding themselves into believing \n     they are our bosses. Make D.C. listen.\n\n  For those who didn't follow it, we are the employees, the elected \nrepresentatives who work for the American people, and yet an awful lot \nof people in this body think we are the bosses. That is exactly \nbackward.\n\n       We don't want ObamaCare. We never did. Defund it. Make D.C. \n     listen.\n       Just finished college. Can't get a full-time job. Thanks, \n     ObamaCare. Make D.C. listen.\n       There should be no law that exempts a few and burdens the \n     citizens. We, the people, do NOT want ObamaCare. Make D.C. \n     listen.\n       D.C. a leader out of touch. IRS has no business being \n     involved with health care. Make D.C. listen.\n       Make D.C. listen, because ObamaCare and its tax will damage \n     the opportunity of Americans to choose the course of their \n     own lives.\n       My insurance premiums went from $450 in 2010 to $880 in \n     2013 with $1500 deductible. Make D.C. listen. ObamaCare is a \n     job killer, will ruin health care.\n\n  Let's look at those numbers again. Two thousand ten was just a few \nyears\n\n[[Page S6745]]\n\nago, and $450 was that individual's health insurance premium. Now it is \n$880 in 2013. That is the impact ObamaCare is having.\n  Here is a nice one:\n\n       Thank you for reading tweets so the American people can be \n     heard. Make D.C. listen.\n\n  You are welcome. It is a privilege to have a chance to in some small \nway help provide a voice for the American people.\n\n       IRS bureaucrats don't want ObamaCare, either, but they are \n     happy to force everyone else to conform to it. Make D.C. \n     listen.\n       ObamaCare has turned America into a part-time nation. \n     People are losing their homes. They can't feed their children \n     properly. Make D.C. listen.\n\n  I wish to think about that last tweet for a second. ObamaCare has \nturned America into a part-time nation, and people are losing their \nhomes. They can't feed their children properly. If any Member of this \nbody was forced to work part-time, was losing his or her home, couldn't \nfeed his or her children properly, it would be a crisis. Talk about \ngetting our attention--it would be a crisis. If it was a family member, \nif it was our parents, if our kids were facing that, we would move \nHeaven and Earth to address it. Yet here it is our boss, the American \npeople who are experiencing that, and most Members of this Senate are \ndoing something else other than being here.\n  I will note that we have Congressman Louie Gohmert, Congressman Paul \nBroun, and Congressman Richard Hudson was here earlier. But where is \nthe Senate?\n  We don't feel the pain of the American people like it is ours, like \nit is us. It is not surprising because President Obama has exempted \nCongress from ObamaCare, so we are not feeling the pain. That is the \nproblem.\n\n       ObamaCare has turned America into a part-time nation and \n     people are losing their homes. They can't feed their children \n     properly. Make D.C. listen.\n       Three years and they still can't get it going. Make D.C. \n     listen.\n       Make D.C. listen, because D.C. is not listening to the \n     American people. HELP US.\n       Defund ACA. It is job killing and not affordable and we \n     won't get care, and our politicians act like it is good for \n     us.\n\n  Well, that is true. A lot of politicians do act as though this is \nreally good for you. Mind you, we don't want to be subject to it, but \ntrust us, it is good for you. Different rules apply to the Washington, \nDC, ruling class than apply to the American people. That is the \nproblem.\n\n       Help revive the economy. Make D.C. listen and defund \n     ObamaCare. Fight for real reform.\n       ObamaCare is a disaster. Make D.C. listen.\n       Letters saying your plan is cancelled due to the ACA ruins \n     the ``like it, keep it'' narrative. Make D.C. listen.\n\n  By the way, that is from an individual who is @demcalal. Makes me \nwonder if that is a Democrat in California named Al. I don't know if it \nis, but it would be interesting if it were.\n  What is interesting about this is that if you get outside of \nWashington, it is not just Republicans who understand ObamaCare isn't \nworking; it is Democrats, Independents, libertarians.\n  I feel quite confident that James Hoffa, the president of the \nTeamsters, is not a Republican. I really have no doubts on that. Yet \nMr. Hoffa in a public letter has said that ObamaCare is destroying the \n40 hour workweek that is the backbone of the American middle class.\n  Those are just the facts. That is what is happening. If we were \nlistening to the American people, every one of us would be here doing \neverything we could to turn it around now. We wouldn't be happy to wait \nuntil the end of the week. We would say: Now, let's stop this job \nkiller.\n\n       Defund ObamaCare, because I know what is best for my health \n     care, not some bureaucrat. Make D.C. listen.\n       Defund ObamaCare. The majority of America is against this \n     intrusion into our private relationship with our doctor. Make \n     D.C. listen.\n       Make D.C. listen because ObamaCare is killing full-time \n     jobs.\n       Make D.C. listen. Defund ObamaCare because it takes our \n     freedom away.\n       If you love your country, value freedom and choice, oppose \n     tyranny-style government laws, then make D.C. listen to you.\n       Tired of Senators who won't listen. Make D.C. listen.\n       Make D.C. listen. Please stop ObamaCare. It is killing this \n     country.\n       We need the government to listen to the people and do what \n     is best for the country. I support defunding ObamaCare 100 \n     percent. Make D.C. listen.\n       Make D.C. listen. We don't want government intrusion into \n     our health care.\n       D.C. isn't listening. Everyone in America understands that \n     ObamaCare isn't working. Make D.C. listen.\n       The health care reform that the President sold America \n     isn't the health care reform that America is getting. Make \n     D.C. listen.\n       ObamaCare. AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT!!! Make D.C. \n     listen.\n       Way to go. Make D.C. listen to our voices calling for \n     individual liberty.\n       Make D.C. listen. We don't get an exception, so you \n     shouldn't either.\n\n  I agree. I think all of us should get an exception. Every American \nshould get an exception. And there is no world in which Congress should \nbe treated better than hard-working American families.\n\n       I don't want more government. Make D.C. listen.\n       I wish the Senate would listen to us. Please listen to the \n     people. We don't want this bill. We want freedom. Make D.C. \n     listen.\n       Make D.C. listen. ObamaCare is turning us into a part-time \n     economy.\n       Government is designed to go by the will of the people, not \n     the other way around. Make D.C. listen.\n       We don't want it, don't need it, can't afford it. Please \n     tell them to listen to its citizens. Make D.C. listen.\n       Ronald Reagan warned us about government-run health care. \n     Bad. Bad. Bad. Make D.C. listen.\n       Make D.C. listen. Analysts, experts, and business people \n     agree that the ACA will hurt our economy.\n       Americans are fed up with our elected officials not \n     listening. WE don't want ObamaCare. Make D.C. listen.\n       Let the free market make health care more affordable by \n     allowing sales across state lines. Make D.C. listen.\n\n  Let me say, by the way, that is a terrific proposal. Once we defund \nObamaCare, there will be a lot we will need to do on health insurance. \nThere is a lot we need to do on health care reform to make it more \naffordable, to make policies personal and portable so they go with you \nregardless of what job you are in.\n  One of the best things we can do is allow interstate competition. \nRight now it is illegal to purchase health insurance across State \nlines. Why does that matter? Well, the biggest barrier to access for \npeople who don't have health insurance is the cost. You get government \nregulators who drive the cost up and up because they mandate this bell \nand this whistle, and you have to cover everything they want. It is a \ngreat thing for politicians because if you mandate that every health \ninsurance policy has to cover this procedure, it lets politicians come \nto the people and say: I am giving you free what-have-yous. But one of \nthe simplest principles of government is that there ain't no such thing \nas a free lunch. Every time you mandate that a health insurance plan \nmust include whatever benefit it is that politicians want to give away \nto the people, it drives the cost up. Every time the cost goes up, \nthere are more and more people who can't afford it. So you can have a \nlot of politicians giving away free stuff, and when you do that, it \nwill mean there will be a whole bunch of people who get no coverage at \nall because they can't afford it.\n  If we were to allow purchases across State lines, we would see a true \n50-State national marketplace, true competition. There would be real \nchoice.\n  By the way, the people who may be the biggest losers of all under \nObamaCare are the young. It is difficult to design a bill to do more \ndamage to young people. The ``lost generation'' is what economists are \nnow dubbing young people, in significant part because of the \nconsequences of ObamaCare. If you are a young healthy person, it may \nwell make sense to purchase catastrophic health insurance--health \ninsurance that if, God forbid, you get hit by a truck tomorrow or you \nget diagnosed with some horrible life-threatening disease.\n  The odds are relatively small that is going to happen to any of us, \nbut if it does, it is very bad, and that is when we want health \ninsurance. If you could purchase insurance across State lines, there \nwould be a 50-State market and you could get low-cost, inexpensive \ncatastrophic health insurance.\n  If you think about health insurance right now, it doesn't work like \ninsurance. I wish to compare it to an insurance market that works. Most \nof us are familiar with car insurance. Most of us who have cars have \ncar insurance. With car insurance, if you need to change the oil in \nyour car, you do not call Allstate and say: Change the oil in my car. \nIf you get a flat tire, you typically do not call Allstate and say: \nHey, I\n\n[[Page S6746]]\n\nhave a flat tire, change the tire on my car. God forbid, if you get hit \nby an 18-wheeler and your car gets totaled, then you call your \ninsurance company and say this catastrophic event happened; that is why \nI have insurance. A lot of people when it comes to health insurance \nthough, right now the system is treated as just a third-party payer \ninstead of dealing with catastrophic, unlikely events. That is a reform \nthat would make a real difference.\n  If you want access to low-cost health insurance, allowing people to \npurchase it across State lines after we defund ObamaCare would make a \nreal difference, and if we added to that reforms that expanded health \nsavings accounts so you could save in a tax-advantaged way to meet \nroutine prevention and maintenance, to take care of the equivalent, in \nthe auto context, of changing the tire, that would go even further; and \nif we changed the tax law right now--most people do not know that \nemployer-provided health care is an historical anomaly. It actually \narose during World War II. Shortly thereafter, when wage and price \ncontrols were in effect, employers had a challenge. They wanted to \nrecruit employees, but they could not raise wages. It was against the \nlaw. So they began offering health insurance as a way to attract \npeople, to say come work for my company, we will give you health \ninsurance.\n  Right now the Federal tax laws heavily favor employer health \ninsurance. The problem is, we don't live in 1950s America now. There \nwas a time when people would get a job in a big company and work 30, \n40, 50 years, retire, get a gold watch, and that would be it. We don't \nlive in that kind of world anymore.\n  Most people will work for one company, then another company, then \nanother company--relatively unlikely that American workers are going to \nstay with one company their entire life. They are going to switch jobs, \npossibly a lot, sometimes voluntarily and sometimes not voluntarily.\n  When you and I were in the private sector, Mr. President, if we lost \nour jobs and got fired, you didn't lose your life insurance. You didn't \nlose your car insurance. You didn't lose your house insurance. The only \ninsurance you would lose if you lost your job was your health \ninsurance. That doesn't make any sense. Of all of them it is the worst \none to lose.\n  The Senator from Illinois asked about preexisting conditions. If we \ncould change the law so health insurance plans were personal and \nportable, just like your car insurance, regardless of where you happen \nto work it goes with you, it travels with you, that goes a long way to \nsolving the problem of preexisting conditions, because where \npreexisting conditions have such a big impact is when somebody loses \none job and is trying to get coverage for the next job. If you could \ntake your personal portable plan with you, that goes a long way to \nmitigating it. Let me point out all of those reforms have a \nfundamentally different philosophy than ObamaCare. ObamaCare has a \nphilosophy empower government over your life, put a government \nbureaucrat between you and your doctor. The reforms I laid out are all \nabout empowering you, the American people, empowering you, the patient, \nto make a choice, empowering you to make decisions about your health \ncare with your doctor, with no government bureaucrat anywhere near you. \nI am going to suggest the difference is those plans come from listening \nto the people. ObamaCare is the opposite of listening to the people.\n  Mr. LEE. Will the Senator from Texas yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield to my friend from Utah for a question, \nand I will return with yet more tweets at a later point.\n  Mr. LEE. I say to Senator Cruz I have come with some updates from the \noutside world, updates based on what I am hearing from my constituents \nat home. You may be interested in learning, I say to Senator Cruz, that \njust today in the last 12 hours or so my office has received nearly \n1,100 e-mails, 1,093 to be precise. Almost every single one of those is \nasking us to do whatever we can, do whatever it takes, to defund \nObamaCare. People are asking us to fund government, keep government \nfunctioning, but to defund ObamaCare.\n  I also have some news from a local paper in the State of Utah. This \nis from the Box Elder News Journal in the northern part of my State. In \nan article written by Mike Nelson, an associated editor with the Box \nElder News Journal, we read about Brigham City moving to adjust its \npay, to cut its payroll, in order to avoid certain ObamaCare \nprovisions. I am going to quote just from part of it here. It says:\n\n       Changes are coming for paid on-call employees at Brigham \n     City Emergency Services Department in an effort by the \n     department and the city to avoid employee eligibility for \n     health care under the Affordable Care Act. ``Back in February \n     it became apparent the ACA--\n\n  Or for those of you who see the newspapers, ObamaCare--\n\n     was going to dramatically impact the way we manage our fire \n     and ambulance crews,'' said emergency services director Jim \n     Buchanan, while addressing the issue at an August 1 city \n     council meeting.\n\n  This is one of many examples of not just businesses but also local \ngovernments that are having to make cuts in their payroll in order to \nadjust for this law. This is having a real impact on real people.\n  It is having an impact also on students. I received a message from a \nstudent in Utah named Sarah. Sarah, today, a college student, writes:\n\n       I am a student facing a shrinking job market with fewer \n     options. Now it seems ObamaCare is going to force me as a \n     healthy young person to pay more to keep the President's \n     health plan functioning. How is that fair?\n  She asks rhetorically. Sarah, it is not fair. Sarah, I would add to \nthat, we have this health care law called the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act. The idea of it is it is supposed to make health \ncare more affordable. What we have found in recent months is that it is \ngoing to make health care less affordable, with premium hikes expected \naround the country. What we are seeing is that this law will make \nhealth care not only less affordable, it is also fundamentally unfair. \nIt is unfair in that it is forcing a lot of people to have cuts made to \ntheir wages, cuts made to their hours. In many cases, people are losing \naccess to health care plans that they have enjoyed for years. In some \ncases, they are even seeing that they will no longer have access to the \nsame physician or other health care provider that they have enjoyed for \nyears.\n  This is a law that while touted as making health care somehow more \naffordable is actually making it less affordable. It is also being \nimplemented in a manner that will make our health care system \nfundamentally unfair. Within my State, the State of Utah, we have no \nfewer than five school districts and three universities that have been \nannouncing cuts in their hours, cuts in their number of employees, all \nin response to this law. It is interesting that what we are discussing, \nmuch of what we have been discussing, has been on the upcoming cloture \nvote. There have been those who have argued that if you want to support \nthe continuing resolution passed by the House of Representatives--\nremember, this is the continuing resolution that will keep our Federal \nGovernment funded while defunding ObamaCare--that if you want to \nsupport that, that you must vote yes on the cloture vote on the bill.\n  That is an interesting take on it because not withstanding the fact \nthat some in my party have been making that suggestion, it is \nanticipated that Mr. Harry Reid--the Senator from Nevada who is \ncurrently serving as the Senate majority leader--that Harry Reid and 53 \nDemocratic allies will, as I understand it, all be voting for cloture \non that bill. That begs the question, are those same people who are \nsuggesting that if you support the House-passed continuing resolution, \nthe one that funds government, keeps government funded while defunding \nObamaCare, that you have to vote yes on cloture on the bill, does that \nmean that Harry Reid and the 53 Democrats who are likely to follow him \nare also supporting the House-passed continuing resolution, the one \nthat keeps government funded while defunding ObamaCare?\n  I find that a little strange. I find that a little counterintuitive. \nI think it is important that we remember, and we continually remind \nourselves, what this is about. When this continuing resolution passed \nby the House last week--heroically in my opinion. It showed a real \nstrong sense of leadership by Speaker John Boehner and by\n\n[[Page S6747]]\n\nthe other Republican leaders in the House of Representatives and by the \nrank-and-file Members of the House who voted for this legislation. When \nthey voted for this legislation to keep government funded while \ndefunding ObamaCare they stood with the American people who asked them \nfor relief from this bill.\n  American people had been telling them: Look, we need help. They have \nbeen asking: How many of us will have to see our hours cut? How many of \nus will have to experience wage cuts? How many of us will have to lose \naccess to the health care we have enjoyed for many years before \nCongress acts?\n  The House of Representatives did act. The body within our government, \nthe branch within Congress that is most responsive to the American \npeople, acted to protect the American people from this harmful law \nwhile simultaneously keeping the Federal Government operating.\n  Now that that has happened and that bill is moving over to the \nSenate, the ball is in our court, we have a couple of possible \nresponses to that. The first would be we could take it up and we could \nvote on it as is. We could vote on it just as it was passed by the \nHouse. We could vote on it, up or down, as is without any amendment. \nThat would be fine. I would be fine with that. If that is what we were \ndoing, I would be voting yes on the cloture vote. Of course I would. I \nsuspect my friend, the junior Senator from Texas, would as well.\n  There is another option. We could say rather than vote on it as is, \nlet's make adjustments to it. Let's invite amendments. Let's have an \nopen amendment process whereby Senators, whether Democrats or \nRepublicans or the couple of Independents we have, could submit \namendments as they deem fit, have those amendments not just proposed \nbut debated, discussed, and ultimately voted upon. That would be an \nacceptable alternative.\n  People around here often call this, the Senate, the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. They call it that because this is a place where, in \ntheory, we are supposed to have access to an open amendment process; \ntheoretically unlimited debate. Is it time consuming? Yes. Is it \ncumbersome? Absolutely. Can it be frustrating? Without question. But it \nis one of the things that distinguishes this body. It is one of the \nthings that makes this the Senate.\n  So if we were to have an open amendment process, it would take a lot \nof time and it might even require another all-night session just like \nwe had a few months ago in connection with the budget resolution, but \nit would be worth it. It would be entirely acceptable, and I would be \nvoting yes on cloture on the bill if that is what we were faced with. \nBut what we are faced with, what we are told is going to happen, what \nwe are told is being prepared to accept is neither of those options; \nnot being given the opportunity to vote yes or no, up or down on the \nresolution passed by the House of Representatives nor would we be given \nthe opportunity to have an open amendment process, one that allows \nindividual Senators to propose amendments and have those amendment \nconsidered, voted on in this body.\n  What we are being told instead is that what we will have is a single \namendment brought forward by the Senate majority leader, one amendment \nand one amendment only, and that amendment, by the way, would strip out \nthe defunding language, it would gut the House-passed continuing \nresolution of a provision that many would consider the ``without which \nnot'' part of the House-passed bill, meaning the part without which the \nHouse of Representatives could not and would not have gotten the \nnecessary 218 votes to pass a continuing resolution. That is a problem. \nThat is a problem indeed because that suggests that by voting for \ncloture in that posture, where Senator Reid is contemplating allowing \nneither an open amendment process nor an up-or-down vote on the House-\npassed resolution in as-is condition--in either of those circumstances, \nwe would be fine. But we are not getting that. We are getting stuck \nwith something else. He wants to gut the House-passed continuing \nresolution with the defunding language without any open amendment \nprocess and without the opportunity for an up-or-down vote.\n\n  So in that circumstance, I don't understand why it would be the case \nthat Republicans would feel that voting yes would be supporting the \nHouse of Representatives and voting no would be voting against the \nHouse of Representatives. In fact, it seems to me, I say to Senator \nCruz, that would be quite the opposite of that. It seems to me that if, \nin fact, one wanted to stand behind the House of Representatives and \nstand behind their willingness to defend the American people and \nprotect them from this harmful law, at the end of the day that would \nentail that anyone who wanted to stand with the House of \nRepresentatives on that point would necessarily need to vote no if, in \nfact, Senator Reid does what we expect him to do later this week.\n  Would the Senator agree that is what one could expect in that \ncircumstance? And would the Senator also agree that Senator Reid is \nlikely to have 53 Democrats going along with him, and if Senator Reid \nhas 53 Democrats going along with him, doesn't that rather undercut the \nargument that in order to support the House-passed bill one must vote \nyes on the cloture vote on cloture on the bill?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank Senator Lee for his very good question. I think the \nanswer is absolutely yes. If the objective of any Senate Republican is \nto support the House Republicans, the bill they passed to defund \nObamaCare, then one obviously would not vote to allow Majority Leader \nHarry Reid to strip out all of the operative language and to fund \nObamaCare with a 51-vote pure-partisan Democratic majority. That is not \ncomplicated. To be honest, it is something every Senator in this body \nunderstands. All the Democrats understand it. It is why Harry Reid is \nvoting yes on cloture. It is why, presumably, every Democrat will vote \nyes on cloture. Why? It is the reason some of our colleagues have used \nas well: A ``yes'' vote on cloture says that they support the House of \nRepresentatives' bill and support defunding ObamaCare.\n  I suppose that means, then, that Harry Reid suddenly supports \ndefunding ObamaCare and that every Democrat supports defunding \nObamaCare. I say to my friend Senator Lee that I would be very happy if \nthat were the case. If that interpretation were right and suddenly \nHarry Reid and every Democrat supported defunding ObamaCare, that would \nbe terrific. We know for a fact it is not the case. We know for a fact \nit is not the case because they publicly said it. We know for a fact it \nis not the case because just yesterday I asked for unanimous consent to \nsimply pass the House bill. If every Democrat and Harry Reid supported \ndefunding ObamaCare, he wouldn't have objected.\n  Everyone understands that the cloture vote on Friday or Saturday will \nbe a vote to allow Harry Reid to fully fund ObamaCare using only a 51-\nvote majority that allows it to be done on a straight partisan line. \nThere is no confusion on that. Every Democrat understands that, and \nevery Republican understands that.\n  However, there is some confusion, but not in this body, and it is so \nSenators believe with the American people because Senators think, well, \nthe politics and procedural mumbo-jumbo is confusing enough that I can \nvote yes, give Harry Reid the ability to fund ObamaCare, and at the \nsame time I can run paid advertisements--as more than a few of our \ncolleagues may well be doing right now--that say: I want to defund \nObamaCare. They can't do both. They can't hand Harry Reid the ability \nto fund ObamaCare and claim they want to defund it. Pick a side. Pick a \nposition and stand by your beliefs.\n  I will give an analogy. The House of Representatives passed a bill \nthat cut taxes, and then it came over to the Senate. Majority leader \nHarry Reid announced that he wanted to file for cloture on that bill, \nand then after that happened, he would file an amendment to erase all \nthe tax cuts and to jack up taxes by $1 trillion. Let's suppose he \nannounced this publicly and told everyone: This is what I plan to do--\nand by the way, it is going to be the only amendment. I will totally \ngut the House bill and turn a tax cut into a tax increase. I am \nabsolutely certain if that were the case all 46 Republicans would vote \nagainst cloture. We get the game.\n  Voting to cut off debate is voting to allow the majority leader to \ngut the\n\n[[Page S6748]]\n\nHouse bill. So any Senator who votes for cloture is saying: I want the \nmajority leader to be able to gut the House bill. But it is even better \nthan that. What was it that P.T. Barnum said? You can fool some of the \npeople all the time, and all the people some of the time, but you can't \nfool all of the people all of the time. There are a lot of Members of \nthis body who think: Some of the people all of the time will be just \ngood enough for me. If I can vote to give Harry Reid the ability to \nfund ObamaCare, and then, beauty of all beauty, when we get to a 51-\nvote threshold on ObamaCare, I can vote against funding ObamaCare, I \ncan go home and say: Hey, I voted twice the right way. Of course, I did \nit in a way that guaranteed 100 percent that we are going to lose. It \nguaranteed that ObamaCare would be funded.\n  Now, for that strategy to work, it depends upon voters being really \ngullible and confused.\n  I was reading tweets earlier. Earlier we talked about how we are not \nliving in the 1950s. In many respects we are not living in the 1950s. \nOne of those respects is we no longer have three big networks that \ncontrol all the news and limited avenues for the American people to \nfind out what is going on. We have seen a democratization of \ninformation. We now have cable TV and more channels, it seems, than one \ncould possibly imagine. We have avenues such as FOX News that get out \ncontent that the mainstream media won't cover in an effort to provide \nfair and balanced news. We have talk radio. God bless talk radio. It is \nan avenue to reach out to millions of Americans, and it is able to go \nright around the media gatekeepers. We have the Internet. We have \nsocial media. We have Facebook and Twitter. We can disseminate \ninformation directly.\n\n  In the 1950s one could do some procedural smoke-and-mirrors. One \ncould hide an obfuscation, and people wouldn't know. One of the \nfascinating things--and I suspect the Presiding Officer has done this \nas well as an avid student of history--is listening to the old L.B.J. \ntapes. L.B.J. would be talking to one group on tape and say: I am \ntotally with you. And then he would be on tape talking to the other \nside saying: I am totally with you. He would tell different groups \nthings that were 180 degrees opposite of each other. He would say one \nthing to one group and another thing to another group. They were so \ndifferent, they would never get a chance to reconcile.\n  I would suggest that in 2013 that is a lot harder to do. In 2013, if \nthey tell one group they are totally with them, you better believe the \nother group will find out about them.\n  In 2013, if a Member votes--I hope they don't, but some Republicans \nmight--to give Harry Reid the power to fund ObamaCare on a straight \npartisan 51-vote threshold, then that Member is voting to fund \nObamaCare and their constituents are going to know about it. It is not \nanything any of us are going to do because our constituents are now \nengaged and following this debate directly. So the ad that says ``I am \nfor defunding ObamaCare'' while at the same time fighting to keep \nfunding ObamaCare doesn't work in the Internet age. It doesn't work.\n  What is the old line? I try not to lie. I try to tell the truth \nbecause it is so hard to keep track of the lies. Instead of telling \npeople multiple positions, just stand and fight for what you believe \nin.\n  Earlier we were talking about Bernie Sanders. I respect the heck out \nof Bernie Sanders. Actually--and this is a comment that often surprises \nour friends in the media and even some Democrats--I respect President \nObama. I respect the man a great deal because I think he is deeply \ncommitted to his principles. I think he has taken political risks for \nhis principles, I think he has fought for them, and I think he is a \ntrue believer. Everything I have seen about his entire course of life--\nI think he believes genuinely, earnestly, and with all of his heart in \ngovernment solutions, government control of the economy and our lives, \nand in redistribution of wealth. I have no reason to doubt that the \nPresident sleeps like a babe at night believing that he is fighting to \nbetter America. At the same time, I believe the ideas the President \nbelieves in and the policies he has advanced are profoundly harmful--\nnot a little bit wrong but profoundly harmful to this country.\n  You know what. That is a debate we can have. That is a policy debate \nI welcome. Has it been good or bad for Americans to implement \nObamaCare? Has it been good or bad for Americans to see jobs drying up? \nHas it been good or bad for Americans to see small businesses not grow \nanymore? Has it been good or bad for Americans to see health insurance \npremiums skyrocketing? Has it been good or bad for Americans to see \nmore and more people losing their health insurance? That is a debate I \nam happy to have on the substance. That is an honest debate. The \nPresident embraces that policy.\n  I will confess that what produces more of the cynicism and skepticism \ntoward Washington are the politicians who don't have the honest debates \nand don't say: You know what. I am not all that fond of ObamaCare, but \nit doesn't matter enough to me to risk anything on it. I care more \nabout staying in office than I do, actually, about fighting a fight. So \nI want to take some symbolic votes, and I don't want to risk any chance \nof anyone blaming me for the downside.\n  I get why voters are frustrated with that. I get why voters are \nfrustrated with politicians saying one thing and doing another. It \nshouldn't be complicated. Do what you say. It shouldn't be complicated. \nStand for your principles. If you don't believe ObamaCare should be \nfunded and that Obamacare is hurting Americans, then stand and say: \nLet's defund ObamaCare.\n  I have made it very clear that we could end this debate right now if \nthe majority leader would come down and say--look, the best way to end \nthis debate would be if he would agree to pass the House continuing \nresolution to fund all of government except for ObamaCare. I recognize \nthat is not likely to happen anytime soon, but it would be the best \nway, and it would be the way that is most responsive to the American \npeople. But the second way to end this debate--and, by the way, to \nexpedite this whole process--is to simply have the majority leader \nagree to have open amendments and have those amendments subject to a \n60-vote threshold.\n  The Presiding Officer and I have both been here the same number of \nmonths--9 months. During the time we have been here, we have seen vote \nafter vote after vote with a 60-vote threshold. That is very common.\n  The Presiding Officer will remember the guns debate we had. Guns are \nan emotional and passionate issue. It is an issue people on both sides \ncare a lot about. I get that. The Presiding Officer will remember that \nwhen we voted on the floor of this Senate, every single amendment was \nsubject to a 60-vote threshold.\n  In the course of that debate, I introduced, along with Senator Chuck \nGrassley, the Grassley-Cruz bill. It was a law enforcement alternative. \nInstead of restricting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding \ncitizens, it was targeting violent criminals. It was going after felons \nand fugitives who tried to illegally buy guns. It was going after those \nwho commit violent crimes with guns. It was going after States that \ndon't report mental health records to the background check system.\n\n  We just saw a horrific shooting in Washington, DC. All of us are \nmourning for the victims and the families there. The individual, it \nappears, had significant mental health issues. The Grassley-Cruz bill \nwould have mandated significant incentives and penalties for States to \nget them to report mental health records, because our background mental \nhealth system doesn't work if we don't have the mental health records \nin them. As of a date relatively recently--I don't recall the date off \nthe top of my head but relatively recently this year--I believe there \nwere 18 States that reported 100 or fewer records.\n  The Presiding Officer will recall what happened with that bill, and \nevery amendment. We got a majority. A majority of Senators voted for \nthe Grassley-Cruz bill. Indeed, nine Democrats voted for the Grassley-\nCruz bill. It was the most bipartisan of any of the comprehensive gun \nlegislation that was considered by this body. There was no other \ncomprehensive bill that had anywhere close to that level of bipartisan \nsupport across the aisle. Yet the Grassley-Cruz bill did not pass into \nlaw. It\n\n[[Page S6749]]\n\ndidn't even get sent over to the House. Why? Because there was a 60-\nvote threshold because, effectively, Majority Leader Reid filibustered \nit.\n  As important as guns are, I think restoring jobs and the economy, \nrestoring economic growth, dealing with the train wreck that is \nObamaCare, is at least as important to the American people. The idea \nthat somehow a 60-vote threshold was OK there but here there has to be \na partisan exercise in brute power in my view is completely \ninconsistent with the traditions of this great body. But I will note it \nserves the purposes of politicians on both sides of the aisle. It \nserves the purposes of Democrats because most Democrats right now still \nwant to preserve ObamaCare.\n  Most Democrats, in my view, are privately getting more and more \nnervous about the train wreck that this is. They are seeing--we can't \ngo home and talk to our constituents without seeing the job loss and \nthe health insurance premiums going up and people losing their health \ninsurance. I think most Democratic Senators are nervous about it but \nnot yet ready to abandon ship. On the Republican side, there is not a \nRepublican here who doesn't enjoy giving speeches about ObamaCare. We \ncan give speeches, humdingers sometimes. But there are more than a few \nRepublicans who are nervous about actually doing anything that has a \nreal chance of happening, because anytime we take a stand that has \nrisk, there is downside to risk. If we hold our ground, if the House \nholds their ground, it is entirely possible that majority leader Harry \nReid and President Obama will force a government shutdown. I don't \nthink they should. I think it will be a mistake. But they have said \nthey are willing to shut the government down in order to force \nObamaCare on the American people. That has a lot of people on the \nRepublican side in the conference nervous because they think, Well, if \nPresident Obama and Harry Reid shut the government down, they will \nblame it on Republicans and the media will all repeat that attack. The \nmainstream media, every one of them, will repeat word for word the \ntalking points. It will get to the point that the stories we read in \nthe major newspapers will read as if they were written by the White \nHouse Press Office.\n  But that has been the way of the world for a long time. So there are \nRepublicans nervous about, Well, even if the President and Harry Reid \nforce a shutdown, Republicans will get blamed and we don't want the \npolitical blame so we don't want to fight this fight. In fact, a lot of \nRepublicans have gone out to the press and said, We can't win, we can't \nwin, we can't win. When we have a lot of Republicans saying we can't \nwin, that is one way to make it less likely we are going to win.\n  It is true if Republicans don't stand together on this, we can't win. \nSome have asked, Why haven't Democrats come over to join us? Listen, \nthe Presiding Officer and I both know no Democrat is going to come join \nus as long as half the Republican conference is split and throwing \nrocks at us. There is no incentive for anyone to do that now. The only \nhope of bringing Democrats over to join us is if we first unify \nRepublicans. If we get all 46 Republicans to stand together opposing \ncloture and to say, No, we are not going to let Harry Reid shut down \nall amendments; we are not going to let Harry Reid fund ObamaCare on a \nstraight partisan party-line vote; and then, if those Democrats elected \nin red States begin hearing from their constituents in incredible \nnumbers--listen, I will tell my colleagues, the people of Arkansas, the \npeople of Louisiana, the people of North Carolina, they understand \nObamaCare is a train wreck. They would like their Senators to listen to \nthem. The Presiding Officer and I both know, when we start to hear from \n5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 50,000 of our constituents, it changes our \ncalculus. If there is one thing the men and women of this body like, it \nis to get reelected. The only way this fight is going to be won is if \nthe American people speak so loudly that the politicians in this body \nhave no choice but to listen to the people.\n  Let me give an example, an example the Presiding Officer and I spoke \nabout at the time. About a month ago, we all remember that President \nObama publicly announced his intention to launch a unilateral military \nattack on the nation of Syria. When that happened, bipartisan leaders \nin both the House and the Senate fairly quickly came out in support of \nthat plan. Just about every commentator--just about every talking head \nin Washington--said there was no chance of stopping it. It was going to \nhappen. It was a done deal. It was going to happen. In fact, they were \nthe same voices who are saying now, with regard to defunding ObamaCare, \nit can't be done, accept it, accept it, it can't be done, it can't be \ndone. All of those exact voices said about Syria: He is going to \nattack, there is nothing we can do, it will be done.\n  The Presiding Officer and I both spoke out loudly, saying the \nPresident should bring the issue to Congress, and I commend the \nPresident for listening to bipartisan calls. That was not easy. I have \nno doubt there was significant dissension among his advisers who didn't \nwant him to do so, and I commend the President for listening to those \nbipartisan calls. It was the right thing to do. Once he submitted it to \nCongress, what happened next the Presiding Officer and I both know \nbecause we both went home to our respective States. People in our \nStates were not evenly divided on the question of Syria. It wasn't a \nclose call. I can tell my colleagues in my office the calls literally \nwent 100 to 1 against the United States launching a unilateral military \nattack against Syria and getting involved in that sectarian civil war \nin a way that didn't further our national security. We had over 5,000 \ncalls from Texans opposing getting us in the middle of that Syrian \ncivil war. We had roughly 50 in support of it. I think the percentage \nin our office at one point was 99.13 percent of the calls were against \nmilitary intervention.\n  We saw something even more incredible. Everyone said it was a done \ndeal and the Senate was going to vote to approve it. The more the \nAmerican people spoke up, the more people in this body began listening, \nthe more some of those who early on were fans of the military \nintervention suddenly began listening to their constituents and saying, \nI am not so sure this makes sense.\n  And then astonishingly, remarkably--and I give him credit for this--\nthe President of the United States listened, and the President went \nbefore this Nation and asked this body, do not vote on this. I am glad \nhe did, because if we had voted, I think at that point it was very \nclear he would have lost the vote, that Congress would not have voted \nto authorize military force. The House clearly would have voted against \nit and I think there is a good chance the Senate would have also, \nalthough the Senate is a little harder to predict. I am glad the \nPresident asked us to call off that vote, because I don't think it is \ngood for this country, for Congress to vote against the Commander in \nChief on issues of national security and defending this Nation, so I am \nglad we didn't have that vote. But I am glad he listened to the \nAmerican people.\n  I want to point out, for everyone who says defunding ObamaCare is \nimpossible, they are the same voices who said stopping the attack on \nSyria was impossible--the exact same voices, graybeards--all of the \nmedia.\n  The only thing that is going to change the dynamic in this body, the \nonly thing that is going to unite 41 Republicans against cloture, \nagainst ObamaCare, and to defund ObamaCare, is if the voice of the \npeople becomes so loud it can't be ignored. The only thing that is \ngoing to start moving red State Democrats is if the voice of the people \nin their States becomes so loud they cannot be ignored. Ultimately, \nthat is how we win this fight. It comes down to the people.\n  I would also like to have a bit of a discussion on an issue that I \nwould note the Presiding Officer and Senator Lee both care about and \nare quite expert in, which is constitutional law and the separation of \npowers. We have often seen pundits go on television and they use a \nphrase that I think is particularly asinine. They say, Republicans \ncannot expect to--fill in the blank here--defund ObamaCare, cut taxes, \npush tax reform, have regulatory reform--do anything--Republicans \ncannot expect to X because we control just one-half of one-third of the \ngovernment. The only thing the Republicans have in Washington is a \nmajority in the House, and they can't do anything from one-half of one-\nthird of the government. There is a technical legal\n\n[[Page S6750]]\n\nterm for that argument: It is poppycock. It is complete and utter \nnonsense. That is not the way our constitutional system works.\n  It is true that Democrats currently have a majority in the Senate and \nthat a Democrat sits in the White House. That is true. But the \nConstitution gives different branches different responsibilities and in \ntheir respective spheres each branch has exceptional power. So when it \ncomes to ordering our military troops into battle, to selecting \ntargets, to making direct decisions of military conflict, the President \nof the United States is Commander in Chief, and it does not matter if \nthe President is a Democrat or whether 535 Members of Congress are \nRepublicans. When it comes to being Commander in Chief, when it comes \nto ordering our troops into battle, to making decisions in the midst of \nconducting war, the Constitution gives the President preeminent \nauthority on that under article II.\n  When it comes to adjudicating the constitutionality of law--one could \nmake arguments about whether this is right--but as a practical matter, \nthe Constitution and modern acceptance gives the Supreme Court \npreeminence in adjudicating whether a law comports with the \nConstitution. I would note that is true even if five Justices of the \nCourt are appointed by a different political party, the party that \ncontrols both Houses of Congress and the Presidency. We could have five \nJustices appointed by a Democratic President and 535 Republican Members \nof Congress and a Republican President. Yet on the questions of \nadjudicating the constitutionality of the law, the Supreme Court would \nstill have preeminence and very significant authority.\n  When it comes to appropriations, when it comes to the power of the \npurse, when it comes to spending, article I of the Constitution gives \nCongress preeminence and, in particular, the House of Representatives. \nSo I will be perfectly honest. If I were to pick one thing for \nRepublicans to have control over, particularly when it comes to funding \nor defunding something, it would be the House of Representatives. Every \npundit who goes on television and says, Well, we just control one-half \nof one-third of the government--what complete and utter nonsense. Not a \nsingle law can pass into law without the House of Representatives. It \nis a necessary but-for. And on questions of spending, the House of \nRepresentatives has preeminence. So this notion that it can't be done--\nand a related point. There are some on the Democratic side of the aisle \nwho make the argument this is the settled law of the land. Accept it \nalready. You guys are bitter enders. We passed it into law. We won a \nPresidential election again. Game over. You lose.\n  I understand the political virtue of making that argument. It is \nalways good to convince those who disagree with you to give up their \nbeliefs. Sometimes those on this side of the aisle oblige by doing so. \nBut it is not an argument that has any basis in the Constitution. Is \nObamaCare currently the law of the land? Of course. It was passed into \nlaw, it is in the statute. It is on the books.\n  No one on this side of the aisle has argued it is not. We are arguing \nit should not be. That is a very different thing than saying it is not.\n  Congress has the power of the purse. Congress has the power--let me \nfinish this point, and then I am happy to yield for a question. \nCongress has the power to appropriate. There is no obligation for \nCongress to appropriate, to fund a law that is not working, that \nevidence and experience--that what the American people are experiencing \nhas demonstrated it is not working.\n  So the House of Representatives in voting to defund ObamaCare, while \nfunding the rest of government, is fulfilling its constitutional \nfunction. If this body took up that same gauntlet, kept government \nfunded, never shut down government, funded every aspect of government \nexcept ObamaCare because it is not working, it is hurting the American \npeople, we would be fulfilling our constitutional function as well.\n  (Mr. MURPHY assumed the Chair.)\n  I would note the Senator from Virginia rose for a question. I am \nhappy to yield for a question without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. KAINE. I thank the Senator.\n  I would ask the Senator to yield for a series of questions around two \nissues--first, comments the Senator made earlier about helpful reforms \nthat could be made to the health care system and, second, the Senator's \ncomments about the need for Members of this body to listen to their \nconstituents. Being in the chair and hearing the Senator, I could not \nresist but to follow up on those two items.\n  On the issue of reforms, I understood one of the Senator's points to \nbe that a helpful reform might be for Congress to take up and \npotentially eliminate the current prohibition of purchasing insurance \nacross State lines. Did I hear that correctly?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Yes, that is correct.\n  I am happy to yield for a second question without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. KAINE. In addition, I think I understood, and I agree with a \ncomment the Senator made about potential reforms--that even the whole \nnotion of health care provided through employers is a little bit of a \nhistorical anomaly that came up in the aftermath of World War II.\n  I was not sure if the Senator was suggesting that as part of a health \ncare reform he would want to alter that norm of employers providing at \nleast some health care provision for their employees.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator for that question.\n  What I was suggesting is we should do tax reform that encourages \npolicies to be personal and affordable. Right now, Federal tax laws, \nFederal laws heavily favor employer-provided health insurance, and that \ncreates some real failures in the market where when someone loses their \njob, they lose their health insurance. We would be better serving, I \nbelieve, our constituents if health insurance became like car \ninsurance, something that went with you regardless of what job you were \nin.\n  Mr. KAINE. I say to the Senator, you engaged in a colloquy with the \nSenator from Illinois about a provision that I wanted to follow up on.\n  Prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, it was completely \nlawful and, in fact, common for insurance companies to turn down \nindividuals for insurance because of preexisting health conditions. I \ndo not think--but I want to make sure about this--I do not think the \nSenator was arguing that we should go back to that day and that we \nshould go back to a status quo where children would be turned down for \nhealth insurance because of preexisting health care conditions.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator for that question.\n  Let me point out that preexisting conditions and the individual \nmandate of ObamaCare are integrally connected because the way the \ninsurance market works--let me take an example that does not deal with \nhealth care. Let's talk about fire insurance, fire insurance on your \nhome.\n  I suspect both our homes have fire insurance. Imagine if Congress \nwere to pass a law that says fire insurance companies cannot take into \naccount preexisting conditions, such as whether the home has already \nburned down in a fire.\n  If that were the law, what any rational person would do--we would \nboth cancel our fire insurance policies because our house had not \nburned down, and if it did burn down, we could then buy a fire \ninsurance policy and say: Please pay for my house.\n  Under that rule, the whole insurance regime collapses because the \nentire basis of insurance is you get people whose homes have not burned \ndown to pay relatively small premiums to create a pool of capital that \nwill be used to compensate--we do not know who, but somebody's home is \ngoing to burn down. If enough people whose homes have not burned down \nput in money in premiums, there will be a pool to pay for whichever \nunlucky soul faces their home burning down.\n  The health insurance market works quite similarly. If the rule is \nsimply that for anyone, regardless of their medical condition, any \ninsurance company has to cover them, no matter what, then the incentive \nis the same as with fire insurance; that if the Senator and I are \nhealthy, it is, frankly, irrational to get health insurance, if the \nrule is, if I get sick, then I can get health insurance and they have \nto cover me. What you end up with is insurance that consists only of \npeople\n\n[[Page S6751]]\n\nwho have sicknesses, who have grave diseases, and that bankrupts every \ninsurance plan. If you have a mandate that you cannot take into account \nwhether someone is already sick before giving them insurance, it means \nthe insurance companies go out of business, and what it leads to is \nwhat Majority Leader Reid has argued for--it leads ultimately to \nsingle-payer government health insurance.\n  Mr. KAINE. Does the Affordable Care Act require that insurance be \nprovided to folks despite preexisting conditions at the same rate \nacross the board?\n  Mr. CRUZ. It restricts the terms at which the rates are given.\n  Mr. KAINE. So then, to make sure I understand, the Senator is opposed \nto the provision in the current Affordable Care Act that requires \ninsurance companies to write insurance to individuals within those \nlimitations, regardless of preexisting conditions.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Let me finish my explanation on that. I will answer the \nSenator's question, but I wish to finish the explanation. That is the \nreason ObamaCare includes the individual mandate. Because, to use the \nfire example again, it would be the equivalent of, if you are saying \nyou have to issue a fire policy to anyone regardless of whether their \nhouse has already burned down, it would be the equivalent of saying we \nare requiring everyone who has a house to buy a policy. Because that is \nthe only way you prevent the insurance market from being bankrupt.\n\n  So the individual mandate, the reason ObamaCare says we are forcing \neveryone to buy insurance--whether you want to or not--is because of \nthe preexisting condition.\n  Now listen, my view on preexisting conditions is we ought to reform \nthe market to deal with that problem. I do not think ObamaCare is the \nright solution. I think ObamaCare is the wrong solution. I think we \nought to defund it all now. I think we ultimately ought to repeal it in \nits entirety.\n  But on preexisting conditions, I will point out, No. 1, if you have \nan issue--and there have been issues with insurance companies acting in \nbad faith, with insurance companies dropping someone when they get \nsick, and I think there the legal system should work to prevent that. \nIf you have purchased insurance, if you have paid your premiums, your \ncompany should not be dropping you when you become sick. I think there \nis a vital role for State insurance regulators to be involved there and \nfor our contract and tort system--the legal system--to be involved.\n  I think if we move toward changing the Federal tax laws to make \nhealth insurance policies portable, personal, it will go a long way to \nsolving the problem of preexisting conditions. I am not maintaining it \nwill solve it in every instance 100 percent of the time. It is very \ndifficult to come up with a Federal rule that will address 100 percent \nof the inequitable circumstances one could come up with, and if we \ntried to the unintended consequences could be staggering.\n  ObamaCare was justified in terms of wanting to provide insurance for \nthose without insurance. Listen, I would like to see those without \ninsurance get health insurance. I would like to see a competitive \nmarket where low-cost catastrophic policies were attractive to people \nand they chose to purchase it. But one of the best ways for someone to \nget health insurance is for them to get a good job, for them to \nactually start making real money, have some disposable income, start \nclimbing the economic ladder.\n  The unintended consequence of ObamaCare is it has ended up hammering \neconomic growth, hammering small businesses. So a lot of the people the \nlaw was trying to help have been made worse off.\n  Mr. KAINE. If I could, let me ask: A reform in the Senator's view \nthat might encompass a different solution for the preexisting condition \nor an ending of the ban on interstate purchasing of insurance, if we \nget through this week and we are into next week and ObamaCare has not \nbeen defunded and we have funded government operations going forward, \nthe Senator could introduce a reform bill proposing to do just those \nthings, could he not?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator for that question.\n  I could. I will confess, our policy team is working on a number of \naffirmative health insurance reform policies.\n  I will confess--and for some reason we are kind of going with the \nhome fire analogy, so let's stick with it right now. There are some \nwho, in the course of health care matters, argue that the heavy focus \nof those of us who are opposed to ObamaCare should be what is the \nalternative, that should be the heavy focus. Listen, I absolutely think \nthe health care system needs reforms to change real problems in it. I \nam a strong believer in that.\n  But an analogy I have used before is, if your home is on fire, you \nput out the fire first before building an addition to the house. \nLikewise, with ObamaCare, I think ObamaCare is such a train wreck, is \nsuch a disaster that the first imperative is to stop the damage from \nObamaCare. Then I think we should work, and I would like it to be in a \nbipartisan way. The Senator and I have talked many times about how we \ncould work together. We have yet to find a great opportunity to do so. \nBut I am hopeful that will change because I would like to see us listen \nto our constituents and work constructively to fix the problems that \nhard-working Americans are struggling with.\n  When it comes to introducing affirmative health care legislation, I \nfully anticipate our team will do so, and we are working on proposals \nnow. As the Senator knows well, our having been here just 9 months, it \nhas not been a quiet 9 months.\n  Mr. KAINE. I say to the Senator, if we get to that point and he \nintroduces affirmative legislation to reform the health care system--\nafter we get through this debate--that would be legislation that would \nnot be connected to the question, the existential question, of whether \nthe government would continue to operate on October 1. So it would not \nbe integrally wrapped up with sort of a threat to the economy that \nwould be posed by a potential government shutdown, and it could be \nanalyzed just on its own merits: Is this a good reform or a bad reform, \nwithout being wrapped around the question of whether we would shut down \nthe government and do we lay off or put on some kind of furlough the \nnurses at Fort Belvoir Hospital who are taking care of wounded warriors \nevery day. That would be a reform bill where we could dig into the \nreform and talk about the reform and analyze what is good and what is \nbad and what should be fixed and maybe what should not be, without it \nbeing wrapped around the question of a government shutdown.\n  Would the Senator not agree with that?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  I would certainly agree that this body should spend considerable time \nworking, and working together, on positive, proactive health care \nreforms, to expand competition, to empower patients.\n  I also agree with something else the Senator from Virginia said, \nwhich is that we should not be threatening a government shutdown. I do \nnot want a government shutdown. I want the government to continue.\n  I salute the House of Representatives for passing a continuing \nresolution that keeps the government funded. But it also defunds \nObamaCare. In my view, that is responsive to the suffering that so many \nmillions of Americans are experiencing--to the loss of jobs, to being \nforced into part-time work, to facing higher health insurance premiums, \nto losing their health insurance.\n  Mr. KAINE. I ask the Senator, would he not agree that the best way to \navoid a government shutdown or threats of a government shutdown or \ntalking about the consequences of a government shutdown would be to \nseparate out his question of what are the right reforms of the health \ncare system from the funding of government operations?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I certainly agree with the Senator from Virginia that we \nshould stop holding hostages. So an ideal way--and I had an earlier \nexchange with Senator Enzi from Wyoming, who pointed out that the \nentire reason we are having this continuing resolution battle is \nbecause Congress failed in its job to pass appropriations bills.\n  For example, the House of Representatives has passed a Defense \nappropriations bill. It is sitting here in the Senate. Majority Leader \nReid has not taken it up. I think we should take it up and pass it \nimmediately so that any discussion of government shutdowns does not in \nany way, shape or form\n\n[[Page S6752]]\n\neven remotely threaten the salary of the men and women of our military. \nI am confident the Senator and I agree, under no circumstances should \nanyone who is risking his or her life to defend the rest of us find \ntheir compensation, their salary threatened.\n  In my view, existing law allows and even requires the President to \nfund the military regardless of what happens on the continuing \nresolution, regardless of if we had a partial temporary shutdown.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/24/senate-section/article/S6752-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/24/senate-section/article/S6752-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/24/senate-section/article/S6752-3", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6752-S6753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-3103.

Mr. President, Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota and I \nare submitting this resolution today because of the significant role \nthe North American Bison has played in the history of our Nation. This \nresolution honors that legacy by designating November 2, 2013, as \nNational Bison Day.\n  Since our frontier days, the bison has become a symbol of American \nstrength and determination. The bison has also been integrally linked \nto the economic and spiritual lives of many Native American tribes over \nthe centuries. The Department of Interior has depicted the bison on its \nofficial seal since 1912 and several sports teams across America have \nchosen the bison as their mascot. At one point in American history, \nbison were brought in to graze outside the original Smithsonian \nInstitution Building here in Washington, DC.\n  In 1911, when sculptor James Earle Fraser was tasked with designing a \nnew nickel, he wanted to ``do something totally American.'' On the \nreverse of his design, he chose to depict the American bison, as a \nsymbol of America's western background that was ``100 percent \nAmerican.'' This coin came to be known as the buffalo nickel and played \nan important role in modernizing our currency in the early 20th \ncentury.\n  I must also add that my home state of Wyoming is one of three states \nthat recognize the bison as its official state mammal and has honored \nan image of a bison on the Wyoming state flag since it was first \nadopted in 1917. Today, thousands of American bison freely roam \nYellowstone and Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. The bison is also \nimportant to our state's economic well-being with a growing number of \nranchers raising bison for consumers all over the world.\n  This resolution is supported by a wide variety of stakeholders. I \nwant to recognize the National Bison Association that represents the \ninterests of the bison ranchers in nearly every single State. Also \nbehind this effort is the\n\n[[Page S6760]]\n\nIntertribal Bison Council that supports the cultural role the bison has \nplayed in Native American history.

I appreciate the question from the Senator from Virginia. I \nwould note, I do not think we should shut anything down except \nObamaCare. I think we should fund it all. Indeed, I have indicated a \nwillingness--the Senator from Virginia knows well that I think we have \na deep spending problem in this country and Congress has abdicated its \nresponsibility and built a record debt.\n  It has gone from $10 trillion when the President was elected to now \nnearly $17 trillion--over a 60-percent increase. So if you ask me, do I \nlike a continuing resolution that funds everything the Federal \nGovernment is doing without significant spending cuts, no. I would much \nrather have real spending cuts, roll up our sleeves and address the \nout-of-control spending and debt.\n  But I am perfectly willing to vote for a continuing resolution that \nmaintains the status quo on everything, except for ObamaCare, because I \nview the gravity of ObamaCare, the threat of ObamaCare to hard-working \nAmerican men and women so grave. As you know, in politics and in life \nyou have got to pick your battles. We have to pick our battles one at a \ntime.\n  So over time, I would prefer for us to work to have real spending \ncuts. But I do not think the avenue to doing that is that we should \nshut down the government. In my view, we should not shut down the \ngovernment. The only way a government shutdown will happen--it may \nhappen--is if majority leader Harry Reid and President Obama decide \nthey want to shut down the government in order to force ObamaCare on \nthe American people.\n  Mr. KAINE. So the Senator will not vote to continue government \noperations unless ObamaCare is defunded?\n  Mr. CRUZ. The Senator from Virginia is correct, and I have stated \nthat I will not vote for a continuing resolution that funds ObamaCare. \nI believe this body should not vote for a continuing resolution that \nfunds ObamaCare. Why? Because the facts show it is not working.\n  That is why the unions that used to support it are, one after the \nother, coming out against it.\n  Mr. KAINE. I want to switch and ask the Senator a question about \n``MakeWashingtonListen.'' That is the second piece. If the Senator will \nlet me get back into a little bit of campaigning activity, he and I \nwere candidates at the same time in 2012, and I gather that he told his \nconstituents that he was opposed to ObamaCare and that he would vote to \nrepeal or defund it if he were elected to office. Is that correct?\n  Mr. CRUZ. That is most assuredly correct.\n  Mr. KAINE. I believe I am correct that the Senator won his election \nnot by a small margin but by a large margin. Is that correct?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Thanks to the work of a whole lot of Texas men and women \nacross the State who really worked their hearts out. Yes, we were \nprivileged to win the primary by 14 points and to win the general \nelection by 15 points.\n  Mr. KAINE. Would it be fair to say that part of the Senator's mission \nhere is he told his voters what he would do. They knew what the Senator \nwould do and chose him to do the job. One of the things the Senator is \ndoing today on the floor with this effort is to basically live up to \nthe promise that he made to them, and the mandate that they gave to \nhim?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I would agree with all of that.\n  Mr. KAINE. Let me offer a hypothetical situation. Contemplate another \nState and another race between two candidates, where one candidate took \nthe strong position that ObamaCare should be repealed and the other \ncandidate took the strong position that ObamaCare should not be \nrepealed. In that State, the candidate that won by a sizable margin was \nthe candidate who said ObamaCare should not be repealed, having been \nplain about it with the voters, and the voters having heard the choices \nand made a choice. Does the Senator think it is also the case that a \nSenator in that hypothetical State should come to the body and do what \nhe said he was going to do for his voters?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I appreciate the question from the Senator from Virginia. \nHe raises a very good and a fair point. I think that point is \nparticularly valid for those Senators--I would note that all three of \nthe Senators in the Chamber right now were elected in 2012. I think the \npoint that he raises is particularly valid for those of us who were \nruining in 2012, when this was an issue before the voters.\n  Now, in the hypothetical given, which I am not sure is entirely \nhypothetical, what I do not know is the exact representation that \ncandidate made to the voters in his or her State, the exact statements \nthat candidate made. I absolutely agree that he should honor the \ncommitments made to the people. I would also note that all of us have \nan obligation to take note of changed circumstances, to take note of \nnew facts that come to light, and even honoring your commitments does \nnot mean that you ignore changed circumstances.\n  To give an example, prior to World War II, there were quite a few \nMembers of this body and in the House of Representatives who campaigned \nand said they would keep America out of the war. Following Pearl \nHarbor, it was a different circumstance. It was a changed circumstance. \nI think, quite reasonably, people change their views.\n\n[[Page S6764]]\n\nConstituents change their views and representatives change their views \nbased on changed circumstances. So I would submit--listen, the argument \nthe Senator makes is a serious one. I would not encourage any Member of \nthis body to disregard the commitments they made to their constituents.\n  But I would, at the same time, encourage every Member not just to \nkeep in mind the promises made on the campaign trail but the ongoing \nviews of their constituents, because as circumstances change all of us \nrespond to changed circumstances including our constituents. So one \nmust certainly respect the promises made, but at the same time in the 9 \nmonths we have been here, in the year since the 3 of us were active \ncandidates, the situation on ObamaCare has changed.\n  Look, I very much was opposed to ObamaCare a year ago, 2 years ago, \nand 3 years ago. At the time it passed, I thought it was a bad idea. \nBut a year ago, the unions did not oppose it. A year ago, the President \nhad not granted exemptions for big corporations. A year ago, Members of \nCongress had not gone to the President and asked for an exemption and \ngot it. A year ago, we had not seen companies all over this country \nforcing people into 29 hours a week. A year ago we had not seen one big \ncorporation after another dropping their health insurance coverage, \nsuch as UPS telling 15,000 employees: Your spousal coverage is being \ndropped because of ObamaCare. Your husbands and wives have just lost \ntheir coverage. So I would submit that the circumstances have changed.\n\n  Mr. KAINE. The last thing I would ask the Senator is--the three \nSenators who are now in the Chamber are each from different States. We \nall ran in 2012. I do not know about the presiding officer's situation. \nI was in that hypothetical, as you understand, running against a \ncandidate who promised to repeal ObamaCare. I promised to work on \nreform efforts but to reject any effort to repeal or defund ObamaCare. \nThe voters of Virginia chose the candidate who was not for repeal of \nObamaCare. I do not know if it was the same situation in Connecticut or \nnot. I suspect it probably was. We each represent one State.\n  There was also a national election in 2012, between a candidate, a \nPresident, who said that the Affordable Care Act was the law of the \nland and I am willing to work on it and improve it, but I will fight \nagainst efforts to repeal it or defund it, and a candidate who pledged \nto repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n  An election result in a Presidential election is listening to \nAmerica, I believe. I am a believer in this system. I am a believer in \ndemocracy and the power of Presidential elections and mandates. I think \nthe result in that election between the candidate who promised to \nmaintain the Affordable Care Act and work to improve it and the \ncandidate who promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act was not \nparticularly close. I think it was a 53 to 47 percent election among \nthe large size of a national electorate, rejecting the repeal of the \nAffordable Care Act position.\n  Is that something that this body should at least consider or take \ninto account as we wrestle with this question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I appreciate the question from the Senator from Virginia as \nwell. Look, there is no doubt President Obama was reelected. I wish he \nhad not been. I obviously did not support his election, but the \nmajority of the American people voted for him to be reelected. That is \nto his credit.\n  I would point out that I do not agree with one of the premises of the \nquestion proposed by the Senator from Virginia, which is namely that \nthe national election was fought over ObamaCare. I think the national \nelection--No. 1, President Obama is a spectacularly talented candidate, \na far more talented candidate than the Republican candidate. I think \nMitt Romney is a good and decent man, but not the political candidate \nthat Barack Obama is.\n  But, No. 2, once we got to the general election, much to my great \ndismay, Republicans did not make the election about ObamaCare. In fact, \nif you contrast the elections in 2010 and 2012, in 2010 Republicans ran \nall over the country on let's stop ObamaCare. The result was a tidal \nwave election for Republicans in the House of Representatives and in \nthe Senate. It resulted in new personnel in both places. It resulted in \nRepublicans taking over the House of Representatives. It resulted in a \nsignificant number of new Republicans in this body.\n  In 2012, Republicans did not focus. Indeed, the general election did \nnot make nearly as much of an issue about ObamaCare and how it was \nfailing the American people as it should have. As a consequence, I \nthink an awful lot of people stayed home. I will commend the Obama \ncampaign. They did a fabulous job of mobilizing their supporters. They \nalso did a very good job of focusing on a lot of issues other than \nObamaCare. Indeed, I would suggest to the Senator from Virginia, that \nif the premise of his question were correct, then President Obama would \nhave campaigned on: I passed ObamaCare. Vote for me and let's preserve \nObamaCare. We would have seen TV ads saturating that this is the \nsignature achievement. It was very interesting. That was not the \ncampaign President Obama ran. There was almost a bipartisan agreement \nnot to mention ObamaCare; unfortunately, Republicans did far too little \nof it. But it is not like the President ran a lot focusing on it \neither.\n  Mr. KAINE. I have a comment and a final question. I am not skilled at \nhow campaigns are run, but I would challenge the Senator's assertion. I \nthink virtually everyone in the country who voted in the Presidential \nelection in 2012 knew that one candidate, the President, would fight to \nmaintain the Affordable Care Act, and another pledged to repeal it.\n  How much they did it in ads and on TV I cannot count. I actually saw \na lot of ads about the very subject in the battleground State of \nVirginia. But I think the voters knew exactly the position of the two \ncandidates on this issue. While it was not the only issue in the \ncampaign, it was an important one. They had that before them as they \nmade the decision.\n  The last question I will ask is a little bit of a rhetorical one but \nit is a sincere one. I very much hope that regardless of the outcome of \nthis debate over the next few days--and I strongly want the outcome of \nthis debate to be that government continues and that we continue to \nprovide the services that we need to provide, and that we save the \ndebate about health care reform for another day. But I very much hope \nthat the Senator introduces legislation about health care reform ideas \nand that the legislation not be wrapped up with the question of whether \ngovernment should shut down or not but that it be stand-alone \nlegislation, that it not be wrapped up with a question of whether we \nshould default on our debts or not, but that it should be stand-alone \nlegislation.\n  I have a feeling that there are many Democrats and Republicans that \nwould love to work on reform ideas. In this body and in the House we \nhave a somewhat limited bandwidth. We are trying to deal with a lot of \ndifferent issues. Health care is a hugely important one.\n  Its connection to the economy is equally important, and I think there \nare a lot of Members here who would love to have a debate about reform.\n  But for the last 3-plus years the only debate has been about the \nrepealing or defunding instead of about reform. That makes it a fairly \nsimple vote for many of us. It makes it a simple vote for many of us \nwho feel as though the will of this body has been expressed, that the \nSupreme Court has rendered an opinion about the Affordable Care Act, \nthat the American public rendered an opinion about two positions in a \nPresidential election in 2012.\n  A defunding repeal strategy, which has been now done four dozen times \nby the House, is actually a pretty simple thing to move aside based on \nthe foregoing, but if we set aside those efforts and try to take up the \nkinds of concrete reform ideas the Senator talked about earlier, I \nactually think there might be a number of things that we could all do \ntogether to improve the situation, but we don't need to do it while we \nare talking about the shutdown of the government or defaulting on \nAmerica's bills for the first time in our history.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor, and I yield back.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I appreciate the question from the Senator from Virginia. \nLet me say I appreciate the good faith and seriousness with which he \napproaches\n\n[[Page S6765]]\n\nthis issue and the other issues before this body. One notable thing: Of \nthe three Senators who are on the floor right now, all of us are \nfreshmen. One of the things I appreciate about this freshman class, as \nall of us came to Washington before we were sworn in as Senators, we \nhad a weeklong orientation process. We went and had dinners with our \nspouses, and we got to know each other as human beings. That is \nsomething that doesn't happen very often in Washington anymore. It used \nto happen in a bygone era, but it doesn't happen much anymore.\n  One of the interesting consequences that not many people have \ncommented about--but it is something I find quite significant--is in \nthe freshman class there were far more Democrats than Republicans, but \nto the best of my knowledge, no freshman has spoken ill of another \nfreshman. I am not aware of it if it has happened. I think part of the \nreason for that was spending that time together, getting to know each \nother as people.\n  The Senator from Virginia and I disagree on a number of issues. Yet I \nhope and believe that we each understand that the other is operating in \ngood faith based on principles he believes are correct. That is a \nfoundation for actually solving problems and moving forward in this \ncountry.\n  One of the unfortunate consequences as you see both sides of this \nChamber pommel each other is that many of us don't even know each \nother. One of the interesting dynamics, from my perspective, is that \nmany of the senior Democrats frequently choose to say some fairly \nstrident things directed at me. Many of them I don't really know. I \nhaven't had the opportunity to get to know them, and I have had \nconversations with freshman Democrats asking the senior Republicans: Do \nyou know them? The answer I have been told is, not really. We sit on \ncommittees, but most of us are on four or five committees. We are \nrunning from one hearing to another. You often run into a hearing, you \nask a few questions, you run out, and you are off to the next meeting. \nYou are meeting with your constituents, you are doing this and doing \nthat. You don't have an opportunity to get to know each other. I am \nhopeful that the good will we have seen among the freshmen can spill \nover more broadly.\n  I wish to say also, on the point the Senator from Virginia made about \nreasonable and productive amendments to improve the system, look, it is \nvery difficult to have the sorts of reforms I have talked about with \nObamaCare in place because ObamaCare has so dominated the health care \nmarket. It has made government the chief mover and operator. You can't \nhave positive free market reforms with ObamaCare there. The approach I \nam advocating doesn't work as long as ObamaCare makes the government \nthe chief mover and operator. That is much the same in situations and \nnations that have adopted single-payer socialized health.\n  I would note that the Senator from Virginia expressed an interest in \npositive reforms to address some of the most egregious aspects of \nhealth care. I would encourage the Senator from Virginia to direct \nthose comments to the majority leader of this body because the majority \nleader of this body has decided on this vote, that we will have one \namendment and one amendment only, as far as I understand. That \namendment will be funding ObamaCare in its entirety. The majority \nleader has decided we are not going to have amendments on the sorts of \nthings the Senator from Virginia suggested, ways to improve the system.\n  If, for example, the majority leader does not want an amendment, \napparently, on addressing the medical devices tax--a large majority of \nSenators in this body voted during the Budget proceeding against the \nmedical devices tax because we understand it is killing jobs, \ndestroying innovation, and it is one of the most punitive, destructive \naspects of this bill. Yet the majority leader, as I understand it, said \nwe are not going to have a vote on that. Why? Because that would \nactually affirmatively help fix things, and so we are not going to do \nthat. I am putting words into the why, but that is the only reason I \ncan think of.\n  Another example is Senator Vitter's amendment to repeal the \ncongressional exemption. I understand many Members of Congress don't \nwant to be in the exchanges, don't want to lose their subsidy, don't \nwant to have the same rules apply to them that apply to millions of \nAmericans. I understand that personally, but I think it is utterly \nindefensible for Members of Congress to be treated better than the \nAmerican people. I think we ought to have a vote on the Vitter \namendment.\n  I have stated before that I think it ought to be expanded so that \nevery Member of Congress, all the congressional staff, the President, \nthe political appointees, and every Federal employee should be subject \nto ObamaCare. They shouldn't be exempted. There shouldn't be a gilded \nclass in Washington that operates on different rules than those of the \nAmerican people. That would be a positive reform indeed. Indeed, I \nwould suggest it would be a populist reform. Yet the majority leader \nhas said: No, we can't vote on that. I am going to assume part of the \nreason is because having a debate on that, on the merits--the position \nthat Congress should have a privileged position is indefensible.\n  Another example: The House of Representatives has voted to delay the \nindividual mandate. They have said: Listen, if you are going to delay \nthe employer's mandate for big businesses, why treat big businesses \nbetter than individuals and hard-working American families? Let's delay \nthem both. If you are going to delay one, delay them both.\n  That passed the majority of the House--and, indeed, a considerable \nnumber of Democrats. I don't have the number in front of me, but a \nconsiderable number of Democrats in the House voted for that. The \nmajority leader of the Senate has said: No, we are not going to vote on \nthat.\n  Yet another instance: We have all been astonished and dismayed by the \nabuse that has occurred in the IRS that has been made public and has \nbeen admitted to. Quite a number of Members of this body would like to \nsee the IRS removed from enforcing ObamaCare.\n  That is a position a large majority of Americans support. The \nmajority leader of this body, as I understand it, has said: No, we \ncan't vote on that. We are not going to have that positive reform. We \nare not going to have a vote. We are only going to vote to fund it all.\n\n  There are a great many amendments we could make that would make this \nsituation better. It is only because the majority leader has decided to \nshut down the Senate to not make this process worse, but we are not \nhaving those amendments.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia. I would urge him to make those \narguments to the leader of his party and this institution so that we \ncan have full and open debate and vote on these amendments because this \nisn't working. It is fundamentally not working. We need to respond to \nthe American people. We need to listen to the American people, and we \nneed to fix it.\n  At this point I wish to return to reading some more tweets. As the \nnight goes on, I hope to read even more tweets. I would encourage \nanyone who would like to see--the folks in the gallery who just waved, \nI am not sure if they have their electronics. If you do tweet, it may \nend up here and I may have the chance to read it, the ``MakeDCListen.''\n\n       Make D.C. listen because ``We the People'' are on to you \n     and will not stand for tyranny. Hoorah.\n\n  I like that.\n\n       Defund ObamaCare because if I can't get a job now, what \n     hope will I have later. Make D.C. listen.\n       Make D.C. listen because it makes entry-level jobs \n     disappear for young Americans.\n       Make D.C. listen because I want to keep my own doctor. \n     Defund ObamaCare because we don't want government-run health \n     care. Make D.C. listen.\n       ObamaCare is a job killer. We can't afford it. Make D.C. \n     listen.\n       Make D.C. listen. If it is bad for Congress, they have no \n     right to force it on their constituents. Vote to defund it.\n       I want my 40 hours. Make D.C. listen.\n       Start listening to the people instead of who is lining your \n     pockets. We are the ones who vote. Make D.C. listen.\n\n  Here is a tweet from Greg Abbott, my former boss, the attorney \ngeneral of Texas, who is running for Governor of Texas, and a very good \nman.\n\n       ObamaCare is destructive to our economy, to jobs, to \n     liberty, and to health care access. Make D.C. listen.\n\n  Thanks, boss. I appreciate it, and I agree.\n\n       Make D.C. listen by committing to always cast your vote for \n     those who do listen and act accordingly.\n\n[[Page S6766]]\n\n       Make D.C. listen because government is too large already.\n       ObamaCare violates our rights. We cannot, as America, allow \n     this ``solution'' to continue. Make D.C. listen.\n       Small business owners. If ObamaCare is implemented, I will \n     be forced to drop my group insurance for my employees. Make \n     D.C. listen.\n       When can the citizens expect our way. If everyone else is \n     getting them, shouldn't we make D.C. listen?\n\n  That is a great point. Why is it that President Obama treats giant \ncorporations and Members of Congress better than hard-working \nAmericans? I think it is indefensible. Yet this body right now, unless \nwe act differently, is going to allow that status quo to continue.\n\n       The same Senators should live by the same rules as the \n     American people and should not be controversial. It should be \n     obvious. Make D.C. listen.\n\n  That is exactly right.\n\n       Congress has exempted itself and staffers from the \n     monstrous law for an obvious reason. Don't we deserve the \n     same? Make D.C. listen.\n       Make D.C. listen. Make Americans finally see what is in the \n     bill, and we hate it.\n       Thank you for standing up to the status quo in D.C.\n       Senate phone lines are jammed. Start using facts, social \n     media. Go to . . .\n\n  And it lists a private Web site for a list of Twitter accounts.\n\n       Make D.C. listen.\n\n  I think that point, by the way, is really quite potent, that as \neffective as the phones are--I think the phones are very effective--\nthere is e-mail, Facebook, Twitter. There are an awful lot of ways for \nthe American people to speak up and make DC listen.\n\n       Today the Cleveland Clinic saved my dad's life. The U.S. \n     Senate saved their jobs. Make D.C. listen.\n\n  That is powerful.\n\n       How can any American support a law that punishes success. \n     That is unAmerican. Defund ObamaCare now. Make D.C. listen.\n       Defund ObamaCare because it is a tax that was never read \n     until it was passed. ``We the People'' demand representation. \n     Make D.C. listen.\n       Defund ObamaCare because it will ruin our generation and \n     will destroy America and the American Dream. Make D.C. \n     listen.\n       ObamaCare is destructive to our country. Defund ObamaCare. \n     Stand up for our freedom. Make D.C. listen.\n       If ObamaCare is so great, why is everyone not going to have \n     it? Make D.C. listen.\n       The Congress, the President, and Federal workers have \n     forgotten they work for us and should have to obey the same \n     laws and rules we do. Make D.C. listen.\n       Make D.C. listen. My children cannot get full-time jobs \n     because of ObamaCare. Can't wait to see how much my premiums \n     will go up during open enrollment. Defund ObamaCare because \n     it is not good enough for Congress. Make D.C. listen.\n       The American people are screaming to STOP OBAMACARE. Make \n     DC listen. Leave us alone.\n\n  At this point I want to talk about the topic of rate shock. We all \nremember some 3\\1/2\\ years ago when President Obama told the American \npeople that by the end of his first term the average American family's \nhealth insurance premiums would drop by $2,500. The end of his first \nterm, as we know, was last year, and that hasn't happened. That has not \nbeen the effect.\n  What has happened instead? According to a Kaiser Family Foundation \nreport in 2012, the average cost of premiums for family coverage has \nrisen by more than $3,000 since 2008. Now, $3,000 compared to $2,500 is \na $5,500 swing. That is a big swing. That is a big impact for any hard-\nworking American family.\n  But you know who is impacted the most? Those who are struggling the \nmost. Single moms, working one or two jobs trying to feed their kids, \ntrying to put food on the table. You know, $5,500 a year is a real \ndifference. The consistent pattern is that the people who are the \nbiggest losers under ObamaCare are the most vulnerable among us--they \nare young people, African Americans, Hispanics, single moms. They are \nthe ones not able to get jobs, they are the ones being laid off from \ntheir jobs, they are the ones being forcibly put into part-time work at \n29 hours a week, they are the ones facing skyrocketing health insurance \npremiums, and they are the ones losing their health insurance.\n  The actuarial firm of Oliver Wyman estimates premiums in the \nindividual market will increase an average of 40 percent. The Society \nof Actuaries estimates an average premium increase of 32 percent in the \nindividual markets.\n  The Obama administration unilaterally delayed a provision of the law \nthat limits out-of-pocket payments--e.g., deductibles, copayments--to \n$6,350 per individual or $12,700 per family.\n  According to Avik Roy, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and \nwriter for Forbes.com:\n\n       If you compare the cheapest plan on health care.gov to the \n     cheapest ``bronze plan'' on the new Covered California \n     insurance exchange, premiums for healthy 25 year olds will \n     increase by 147 percent, a median of $183 on the exchange \n     versus $74 today; and premiums for healthy 40 year olds will \n     increase by 149 percent, a median of $234 on the exchange \n     versus $94 today. And because California bars insurers from \n     charging different rates based on gender--and so do Colorado, \n     Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New \n     Jersey, New York, Oregon and Washington--the war on young \n     people's premiums will fare just as poorly for women in \n     California and many other States. Despite ObamaCare \n     subsidies, many Americans will still be paying higher \n     premiums in 2014 as a result of ObamaCare.\n\n  Even with the government subsidy they are going to be paying higher \npremiums.\n\n       For example, Americans earning as little as $25,000 will \n     still pay more, even including subsidies.\n\n  The Ohio Department of Insurance--we talked about this earlier, how \nevery 4 years both parties focus rather intensely on Ohio. When it is a \nPresidential year, when it is a swing State, suddenly Ohio is the \ncenter of the universe. We get to 2013, a nonpresidential year, and \nOhio seems to command an awful lot less attention in this body. But \nwhat is happening in Ohio? Well, the Ohio Department of Insurance \nannounced ObamaCare will increase individual market health premiums by \n88 percent. That is not a mild increase. That is not a percent or two. \nEighty-eight percent is a big deal for a family struggling to pay their \nbills.\n  In California, ObamaCare is estimated to have increased individual \nhealth insurance premiums by anywhere from 64 percent to 146 percent.\n  In Florida, Florida's insurance commissioner Kevin McCarty told the \nPalm Beach Post that insurance rates will rise by 5 to 20 percent in \nthe small group market and by 30 to 40 percent in the individual \nmarket.\n  If the men and women in America can easily afford to pay an extra 30, \n40 percent or, in the case of California an extra 146 percent on health \ninsurance, then we don't have anything to be worried about. But when I \ntravel home that is not what the men and women of America tell me. That \nis not what Texans say. Texans say they are working hard to make ends \nmeet; that their life has gotten harder because of ObamaCare.\n  A constituent in Vidalia, TX, wrote on September 19, 2013:\n\n       I decided to do some research on ObamaCare insurance for me \n     and my husband since neither of us have any insurance. I used \n     the calculator to calculate how much ``affordable insurance'' \n     would cost us. I had really hoped this might be our chance to \n     get insurance. To my SHOCK it would cost us $16,026, and this \n     was for the silver plan, which only pays 70 percent. My \n     husband is disabled and receives Social Security benefits, \n     but they say he cannot get Medicaid for 2 years after he was \n     approved. He has another year before he qualifies. He is 62 \n     and I am 56, and we have been without insurance since he lost \n     his job 4 years ago. There is no possible way to pay $16,026 \n     from our take-home pay, plus have to pay an additional 30 \n     percent cost on any health costs we may incur. This is not \n     affordable health care. The crime of it all is that if my \n     husband and I do not enroll we will be fined. This is crazy. \n     Please stop this madness.\n\n  I will pass on some more words from Texans. Today we received welcome \nnews of support from several of our friends in the Texas legislature \nwho are backing our effort to fund the government and to defund \nObamaCare. The Texas Conservative Coalition--67 members of the Texas \nlegislature--released a letter which I would like to read. It begins:\n\n       Dear Senators Cornyn and Cruz and Texas Members of the \n     House of Representatives: Representing the State of Texas, \n     with its 26 million people, we write at this most urgent hour \n     for you to do all you can to defund ObamaCare and fund the \n     Federal Government.\n       We have done all that we can to help stop ObamaCare from \n     harming Texans. No. 1, we refused to create the ObamaCare \n     health exchanges and No. 2 we have refused to expand the \n     Medicaid Program under the false pretense of taking Federal \n     money now while burdening taxpayers with millions of dollars \n     in new costs later.\n       But some of the most pernicious parts of ObamaCare can only \n     be stopped at the Federal level. Only you can stop the \n     Federal\n\n[[Page S6767]]\n\n     Government from enforcing the individual mandates. Only \n     you can stop the government from creating a new budget-\n     busting entitlement that will drive up the cost of \n     insurance around the country. Only you can stop Federal \n     bureaucrats from drafting and imposing thousands of pages \n     of redtape. And only you can stop the Federal Government \n     from destroying the quality of our health care system.\n       Therefore, we applaud the action of the United States House \n     of Representatives on Friday, September 20, 2013, to pass a \n     bill that defunds ObamaCare and funds the Federal Government. \n     Next, it is up to Senators Cornyn and Cruz to hold the line \n     and make sure Democratic Senate majority leader Harry Reid \n     does not use procedural tricks to strip the defunding \n     language from the House bill.\n\n  I would note--and this is not in the letter, this is me speaking--\nthis is exactly the debate we are in the middle of right now. The vote \non Friday or Saturday on cloture is going to be the critical vote in \nthis battle in the Senate. If Republicans stand together, we can \nprevent Harry Reid from shutting off debate, we can prevent Harry Reid \nfrom funding ObamaCare using 51 Democratic votes on a straight party-\nline vote. But that is only if Republicans stand together. If \nRepublicans, instead, choose to vote for Harry Reid, choose to vote for \ngiving the Democrats the ability to fund ObamaCare, then that too will \nbe our responsibility. And it will be incumbent upon each of us to \nexplain to our constituents why we voted to allow Harry Reid and the \nDemocrats to fund ObamaCare despite the fact it is destroying jobs and \nhurting millions of Americans.\n  Returning to the letter:\n\n       We know Republican Senators will need continued support \n     from the Republican-led House to prevent Democrats from \n     funding ObamaCare. Together, we can prevail. Remember the \n     spirit of so many Texans who have fought much worse odds in \n     the past. Stay strong, stay resolute, and do not give in.\n\n  I am thankful my home State of Texas has such principled \nconservatives among its elected officials to have fought hard to resist \nObamaCare, and I am very grateful for their support and their \nencouragement. Their leadership is the reason Texas has one of the \nstrongest economies in the Nation and is one of the fastest growing \nStates in the Nation. Texas is proof that conservative principles put \nin practice actually work and provide opportunity for the most \nvulnerable among us.\n  There is a reason why so many people from all across this country are \nmoving to Texas, and it is because Texas is where the jobs are. If you \nlook across this country, ObamaCare is killing jobs all over this \nNation.\n  I want to look now at the impact to my home State of Texas. ObamaCare \nwill devastate jobs, growth, and the economy. It hasn't even been fully \nimplemented and yet it is already hurting Americans, even those in \nconservative States that have worked hard to resist the influence of \nObamaCare.\n  According to the Advisory Board's Daily Briefing, 15 Governors are \nopposing Medicaid expansion. I applaud those conservative leaders--\nGovernor Haley in South Carolina, Governor Walker in Michigan, Governor \nJindal in Louisiana, Governor Bentley in Alabama, Governor Brownback in \nKansas, and many others--but particularly Governor Perry in my home \nState of Texas. Texas leaders in the House and Senate elected statewide \nhave stood united to resist the influence of ObamaCare in our State. \nBut the tragedy is, even with their efforts, Texans still aren't exempt \nfrom its negative impact.\n  Governor Perry in March of 2012 said:\n\n       ObamaCare will cost the State of Texas at least $27 billion \n     over the next 10 years.\n\n  Senator Jane Nelson, Texas Senator and chair of the Senate House of \nHealth and Human Services, said in September 2012:\n\n       ObamaCare is the wrong approach to our health care \n     challenges. It does more harm than good. It will hurt our \n     economy, eliminate jobs, balloon the State budget, and \n     perhaps most importantly stretch to the limit our already \n     overburdened health care system.\n\n  Senator Nelson also observed:\n\n       Texas is a large, geographically diverse border State with \n     challenges that are unique from other States. The one-size-\n     fits-all approach of ObamaCare is wrong for Texas. If given \n     the opportunity, we can design an efficient system that \n     better meets the needs of our citizens.\n\n  In March of 2012 Senator Nelson observed:\n\n       ObamaCare creates more problems than it solves, ballooning \n     the deficit, overwhelming our health system, and burdening \n     employers at a time when they are just struggling to survive.\n\n  In March of 2010 Senator Nelson observed:\n\n       In Texas, I am deeply concerned about the devastating \n     impacts Federal health care reforms will have on our State \n     budget. The Health and Human Services Commission estimates it \n     will cost up to $24 billion over a 10-year period. \n     Considering our projected budget shortfalls for the upcoming \n     legislative session will be somewhere between $9 billion and \n     $16 billion, it is clear that our Health and Human Services \n     budget--which accounts for a third of the total spending \n     already--will continue to consume precious resources that \n     would otherwise be available for our schools, our highways, \n     and other important services. I am concerned that the Federal \n     Government's plan will jeopardize our efforts on the State \n     level. One size does not fit all, especially in Texas. Our \n     State government spreads more health care dollars across more \n     terrain than any other State. We have challenges along the \n     border in our remote rural areas and in our inner cities that \n     are unique to our State and our costs will be \n     disproportionately high.\n\n  One could perhaps listen to those who say: Those are conservative \nRepublicans. We expect conservative Republicans to oppose ObamaCare. \nBut how about others? How about those who are not conservative \nRepublicans? On April 24, 2013, the United Union of Roofers published a \npress release opposing ObamaCare because it jeopardizes their existing \nhealth plans. Their press release read: Roofers union seeks repeal-\nreform of Affordable Care Act. Cites loss of benefits to members, harm \nto industry and multiemployer health plans.\n  Washington, DC. The United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers, and \nAllied Workers International President Kinsey M. Robinson issued the \nfollowing statement on April 16, 2013, calling for a repeal or complete \nreform of the President's Affordable Care Act.\n  This is not the union calling for a slight adjustment. This is the \nunion calling for repeal: Repeal the law outright.\n\n       Our union and its members have supported President Obama \n     and his administration for both of his terms in office.\n\n  So these are President Obama's supporters. These are the labor \nunions.\n\n       But regrettably, our concerns over certain provisions in \n     the ACA have not been addressed, or in some instances totally \n     ignored. In the rush to achieve its passage, many of the \n     act's provisions were not fully conceived, resulting in \n     unintended consequences that are inconsistent with the \n     promise that those who were satisfied with their employer-\n     sponsored coverage could keep it. These provisions jeopardize \n     our multi-employer health plans and have the potential to \n     cause a loss of work for our members, create an unfair \n     bidding advantage for those contractors who do not provide \n     health coverage to their workers, and in the worst case may \n     cause our members and their families to lose the benefits \n     they currently enjoy as participants in multi-employer health \n     benefits.\n       For decades, our multi-employer health and welfare plans \n     have provided the necessary medical coverage for our members \n     and their families to protect them in times of illness and \n     medical needs. This collaboration between labor and \n     management has been a model of success that should be \n     emulated rather than ignored. I refuse to remain silent or \n     idly watch as the ACA destroys those protections.\n\n  Let me read that sentence again, because that is coming from the \nleader of a labor union that has supported President Obama in two \nelections:\n\n       I refuse to remain silent or idly watch as the ACA destroys \n     those protections. I therefore call for repeal or complete \n     reform of the Affordable Care Act to protect our employers, \n     our industry, and our most important asset, our members and \n     their families.\n\n  Let me ask right now. Do Members of the Senate have concern for hard-\nworking union members? Do Members of the Senate have concern for the \nfamilies of hard-working union members who are saying in writing, We \nsupported the President, but this law isn't working?\n  If Members of the Senate were listening to the people, this letter \nwould get our attention. If Members of the Senate were listening to the \npeople, Democratic Senators and Republican Senators would stand up and \nsay, This thing isn't working.\n  The IRS employees union doesn't want to be subject to ObamaCare. The \nunion representing IRS workers, tasked with enforcing ObamaCare, \nvocally opposes participating in the law's exchanges. IRS union leaders \nprovided their members with a form letter expressing concern with \nlegislation to ``push Federal employees out of the\n\n[[Page S6768]]\n\nFederal Employee Health Benefits Program and into the insurance \nexchanges established under the Affordable Care Act.''\n  Now I want to focus on exactly what happened here. The IRS employees' \nunion sent letters to their members, form letters, drafted to you and \nme, drafted to Members of this Senate, where the IRS employees union \nasked the IRS employees: Write a letter to your Senators, write a \nletter to your congressmen saying, Exempt us from ObamaCare. \nApparently, the IRS employees union believes Congress will listen to \nthem.\n  How about the American people? These are the men and women in charge \nof enforcing ObamaCare. These are the men and women the statute gives \nthe responsibility to go to every hard-working American and say, We are \ngoing to force you to participate in ObamaCare. They don't want to be \nin it. I would suggest that is not an accident. They know exactly what \nthey don't want to be a part of, and the fact that they have sent those \nletters ought to be a warning call that sounds from the high heavens.\n  And yet another example--and this is an example I have made multiple \nreferences to tonight--is a letter from the Teamsters. I would note \nthat neither Leader Reid nor Leader Pelosi on the House side are on the \nfloor. Neither are listening or participating in this debate.\n\n       Dear Leader Reid and Leader Pelosi. When you and the \n     President sought our support for the Affordable Care Act, you \n     pledged that if we liked the health plans we have now, we \n     could keep them. Sadly, that promise is under threat. Right \n     now, unless you and the Obama administration enact an \n     equitable fix, the ACA will shatter not only our hard-earned \n     health benefits but destroy the foundation of the 40-hour \n     workweek that is the backbone of the American middle class.\n       Like millions of other Americans, our members are the \n     frontline workers in the American economy. We have been \n     strong supporters of the notion that all Americans should \n     have access to quality, affordable health care. We have also \n     been strong supporters of you.\n\n  This is directed to majority leader Harry Reid and minority leader \nNancy Pelosi.\n\n       In campaign after campaign we have put boots on the ground, \n     gone door to door to get out the vote, run phone banks, and \n     raised money to secure this vision. Now this vision has come \n     back to haunt us.\n\n  Let me read that again. This is the president of the Teamsters \ndescribing the political efforts that members of the Teamsters all over \nthis country have done to elect Democrats to the Senate and the House. \nIn his words, he said, because of ObamaCare and their vision of \nsupporting Democrats politically, ``Now this vision has come back to \nhaunt us.'' If that doesn't get the attention of the men and women in \nthis body, I don't know what does.\n  The letter continues:\n\n       Since the ACA was enacted we have been bringing our deep \n     concerns to the administration seeking reasonable regulatory \n     interpretations of the statute and to help prevent the \n     destruction of nonprofit health plans. As you both know \n     firsthand, our persuasive arguments have been disregarded and \n     met with a stone wall by the White House and the pertinent \n     agencies.\n\n  The average American does not have the political sway that a major \nlabor union like the Teamsters has. The average American especially \ndoes not have the political sway that a major labor union has with this \nPresident--a Democratic President--with a Democratic majority in the \nSenate. And yet the head of the Teamsters says that:\n\n       . . . their persuasive arguments have been disregarded and \n     they have been met with a stone wall by the White House and \n     the pertinent agencies.\n\n  If a powerful labor union with friends in high office in Washington \nis met with a stone wall, what is the average American met with? Do you \nthink the reception is more welcoming to the average American? Perhaps \nthe average American doesn't even get to see that stone wall to be \nrejected, doesn't even have the forum to raise those arguments to have \nthem disregard and rejected.\n  The letter continues:\n\n       This is especially stinging, because other stakeholders \n     have repeatedly received successful interpretations for their \n     respective grievances. Most disconcerting of course is last \n     week's huge accommodation for the employer community, \n     extending the statutorily mandated December 31, 2013 deadline \n     for the employer-mandated penalties. Time is running out. \n     Congress wrote this law. We voted for you. We have a problem. \n     You need to fix it. The unintended consequences of the ACA \n     are severe. Perverse incentives are already creating \n     nightmare scenarios.\n\n  ``Nightmare.'' That is the word the Teamsters used. ``Nightmare.'' \nSome Democratic Senators object to the use of the word ``train wreck.'' \nPerhaps ``nightmare'' would be better. That comes from the Teamsters in \nwriting, describing what ObamaCare is doing.\n  Nightmare is fitting. It is past midnight. Why are we here? Because \nthe American people are experiencing the nightmare that is ObamaCare \nand we need to help them wake up from this very bad dream.\n  The Teamsters letter continues:\n\n       First, the law creates an incentive for employers to keep \n     employees' work hours below 30 hours a week. Numerous \n     employers have begun to cut workers' hours to avoid this \n     obligation, and many of them are doing so openly. The impact \n     is twofold. Fewer hours means less pay while also losing our \n     current health benefits.\n\n  How does that sound? The majority leader told the American people on \ntelevision that ObamaCare is terrific. Fewer hours meaning less pay and \nlosing your current health benefits, that doesn't sound terrific to me. \nThat doesn't sound terrific to the millions of Teamsters, the millions \nof union workers, the millions of hard-working Americans who are \nexperiencing the negative consequences of ObamaCare.\n  The letter continues:\n\n       Second, millions of Americans are covered by nonprofit \n     health insurance plans like the one in which most of our \n     members participate. These nonprofit plans are governed \n     jointly by unions and companies under the Taft-Hartley Act. \n     Our health plans have been built over decades by working men \n     and women. Under the ACA, as interpreted by this \n     administration, our employees will be treated differently and \n     not eligible for subsidies afforded other citizens. As such, \n     many employees will be relegated to second-class status and \n     shut out of the help offered to buy for-profit insurance \n     plans. Finally, even though nonprofit plans like ours won't \n     receive the same subsidies as for-profit plans, they will be \n     taxed to pay for those subsidies. Taken together, these \n     restrictions will make nonprofit plans like ours \n     unsustainable and will undermine the health care market as \n     viable alternatives to the big health insurance companies.\n       On behalf of the millions of working men and women we \n     represent--\n\n  I would note, he didn't say on behalf of the hundreds or on behalf of \nthe thousands. He said:\n\n       On behalf of the millions of working men and women we \n     represent and the families they support, we can no longer \n     stand silent in the face of elements of the Affordable Care \n     Act that will destroy the very health and well-being of our \n     members, along with millions of other hard-working Americans.\n\n  I want to remember that phrase, ``We can no longer stand silent.'' I \nam going to return to it in a moment.\n\n       We believe that there are commonsense corrections that can \n     be made within the existing statute that will allow our \n     members to continue to keep their current health benefits and \n     plans, just as you and the President pledged. Unless changes \n     are made, however, that promise is hollow. We continue to \n     stand behind real health care reform, but the law as it \n     stands will hurt millions of Americans, including the members \n     of our respective unions. We are looking to you to make sure \n     these changes are made.\n       James P. Hoffa, General President, International \n     Brotherhood of Teamsters.\n\n  I don't have to remind anyone that the Teamsters and Mr. Hoffa are \nnot loyal Republicans. They are not even disloyal Republicans. They \nhave been active foot soldiers in the army to elect President Obama and \nto elect Democrats to this body.\n  This letter describes ObamaCare as a nightmare. This letter describes \nhow it is hurting millions of Americans, including the members of their \nrespective unions. And interestingly enough, this letter uses the same \nphrase, ``We can no longer stand silent,'' that the roofers union used. \n``We won't stand silent, either.''\n  Why is it that both of these unions used that same phrase? Everyone \nin this body understands politics, understands sticking with your team, \ndancing with the team that brought you. No union is eager to criticize \nPresident Obama. They have too much invested in this administration. \nAnd there is a lot of pressure--a lot of pressure--on the labor unions. \nI can't imagine what the repercussions were to Mr. Hoffa and to the \nTeamsters after this letter was sent. I am quite certain it did not \nproduce joy and celebration in the political classes of Washington.\n  I think it is quite striking, though, that both the roofers union and \nthe\n\n[[Page S6769]]\n\nTeamsters said we can no longer stand silent, because the pressure is \nenormous.\n  Let me tell you about another group that is right now standing silent \nthat I hope can no longer stand silent and that consists of elected \nDemocrats in this body. Elected Democrats in this body--these union men \nand women knocked on doors, worked to elect many Members of this body. \nIf their union leaders cannot stand silent, I hope the politicians who \npledged to fight for them won't stand silent either.\n  What a remarkable thing it would be to see a Democrat to have the \ncourage of James Hoffa, to see a Democratic Senator stand and have the \ncourage to say: You know, look, I supported ObamaCare. That is what Mr. \nHoffa said. I supported it at first because I believed the promise that \nwas made. I thought this thing might work, but we have seen it has not. \nIt is a nightmare. It is hurting hard-working American families. Any \nDemocrat who did so would be certain to receive serious repercussions \nfrom the party. Political parties do not like it when you rock the \nboat. I can promise you Senator Lee and I have more than a passing \nawareness of that in our respective party. But at the end of the day, \nif you are responding to the American people, if you are listening to \nthe American people, you are doing their job. I hope in the course of \nthis week that of the 54 Democrats in this body, we will see one, two, \nthree--I hope we see a dozen who have the courage Mr. Hoffa showed, \nhave the courage to speak out about the train wreck, about the \nnightmare that is ObamaCare, that is hurting Americans, that is killing \njobs, that is pushing people into part-time work, that is driving up \nhealth care premiums and is causing more and more people to lose their \nhealth insurance. That is the courage we need.\n  But you know what. It will not come from business as usual in \nWashington. It will not come from wanting to be popular in the \nconference lunches. It will only come from elected officials making the \ndecision, the radical decision to get back to the job we are supposed \nto do in listening to the people. Make DC listen. That is what we \nshould be doing.\n  Mr. LEE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEE. As I listened to the Senator's remarks, I am reminded of \nmany events throughout our Nation's history. It is a storied history \ninvolving a lot of comebacks. There were a lot of instances in which \nthe American people were up against a brick wall of sorts, in which a \nsmall group of Americans, often not just a minority but sometimes a \nminority within a minority, faced a substantial obstacle.\n  The founding of our Republic, at the moment of our independence, \ninvolved a battle against what was then the world's greatest \nsuperpower. Even within our own continent we did not have unanimous \nsupport. Even among our own people, at times it was a minority within \nan a minority who believed that the cause of independence was \nworthwhile, that it was worthy of the great effort that declaring \nindependence and fighting a war for it would inevitably require.\n  Yet we persevered, we rallied together as a people, believing \nfundamentally that our cause was just. And it worked. We followed that \nformula many times when it has mattered and we have not backed away \nfrom fights when those fights were necessary. This may be one of those \nmoments where even though those who are willing to fight against this \nlaw, those who are willing to take this effort are not in the majority, \nare in the minority--in this case in a sense we are a minority within \nthe minority--it is still worth fighting.\n  I commend my colleague, the junior Senator from Texas, for his \ndedication, his commitment, his leadership on this issue. Senator Cruz \nhas never shrunk from this. He has been willing to fight hard for it. \nHe has been willing to speak his mind even at moments when it was \ndifficult, even at moments when many were suggesting it could not be \ndone or should not be done. It reminds me of other examples we have \nseen over the years, of Senators who were willing to speak at great \nlength.\n  I see our pages who are here tonight, pages who serve us well and who \nare willing to stay late at night, working hard. I am reminded that 27 \nyears ago I was a page much like these who are serving us here today. I \nremember a young Senator then in his first term. His name was Harry \nReid. I remember watching him speak at great length for 10, 12--I don't \nknow, maybe 13 hours at a time. I am not certain what the issue was at \nthe time, but I know it was important to him. I know it was an issue on \nwhich he was somewhat outnumbered. I know that I saw his colleagues \napproaching him. Some of them were quite critical of the effort in \nwhich he was engaged. Yet he stood by his message, he did not shrink \nfrom it, because he had an inner commitment to the people he \nrepresented and I respected that about him. I could tell he had that \nkind of tenacity.\n  I watched, as I was a Republican page at the time--I watched my \nDemocratic page colleagues as they brought him a lot of water, hoping \nperhaps that eventually he would drink enough water that he would \ndecide it was no longer in his best interests to continue speaking on \nthe floor. Yet somehow he managed to stay speaking for, I don't know, \n10, 12, 13, 14 hours at a time, and I have a great deal of respect for \nwhat he did at that moment. I hope there is some aspect of Senator Reid \nthat is able to sympathize with what Senator Cruz is going through, \nthat is able to respect the great level of commitment it takes to stand \nhere, hour after hour, and engage in this discussion, a discussion that \nis important for the American people to have.\n  We all continue to hear from our constituents about some of the \nthings ObamaCare might do, some of the things ObamaCare might do to the \npeople rather than for them. I received this one from James in Utah. \nJames writes:\n\n       Sir, as a retired U.S. Marine Corps gunny, I would like to \n     express my view and ask that you vote to defund ObamaCare. I \n     am part of the security team here at--\n\n  And I have deleted the name of his employer.\n\n     --and our new contract has a massive increase in the cost for \n     health coverage. I fought for the people of this country. Now \n     I ask the same from you. Please help us.\n     Gunnery Sergeant Charlie Jones, U.S. Marine Corps, retired.\n\n  From Utah.\n  Then I hear comments such as this from constituent after constituent, \nfrom people who will write in from throughout my State and from \nthroughout the country. Steven from Minnesota writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Lee. Please do all you can to stop the \n     implementation of ObamaCare. My work insurance went up 8.1 \n     percent in January in anticipation of ObamaCare. I make about \n     $40,000 a year. We do not have any extra money after bills. I \n     would like to see health care available to everyone. We've \n     gone without health care insurance at times but I believe \n     that ObamaCare is not the solution and will result in poorer \n     quality health care overall, and hurt our economy.\n       Thank you for considering a Minnesota resident's concerns.\n\n  Steven, I am happy to consider your concerns and I am happy to share \nthose with my constituents. This next one comes from Kevin from \nMassachusetts.\n\n       Dear Senator. I strongly urge you to approve and vote yes \n     on the House resolution bill passed by the House and is now \n     before the Senate that fully funds the Government and \n     protects the full credit of the United States but defunds the \n     Affordable Care Act as provided for in the bill and \n     continuing resolution sponsored by Congressman Graves. It is \n     unfair to exempt everyone with political connections from \n     ObamaCare and not to exempt the rest of us. You must \n     understand that ObamaCare is undermining American workers and \n     selling out hard for union benefits. It is not fair for \n     businesses to reduce workers' hours to survive. It is time to \n     defund the Affordable Care Act until such time when it can be \n     repealed and things can be straightened out and workers \n     protected.\n       I urge you please to delay funding for ObamaCare now.\n\n  That is Kevin, from Massachusetts.\n  When we look at these examples and we read other similar examples \nlike them from people writing from throughout my State of Utah, people \nwriting from throughout the country, we see a consistent pattern. \nAmericans are justifiably, understandably fearful of losing their jobs, \nof having their wages cut, of having their hours cut, in some instances \nlosing access to health care--sometimes through a health plan upon \nwhich they and their families have relied on for many years. This is a \ndifficult situation for them because\n\n[[Page S6770]]\n\nhealth care is an especially unusually personal thing.\n  Access to health care is something people do not necessarily want to \nentrust entirely to their government. Yet that seems to be the \ndirection in which ObamaCare inevitably takes us. It puts more and more \nof our health care into the control of the Federal Government and, as \nhas been suggested on the floor tonight, as some of my colleagues, some \nof my Democratic colleagues from within the Senate have acknowledged, \nthis is but a step in the direction of what they hope will be a single-\npayer, government-funded, government-run health care system, funded, \noperated, and administered entirely from Washington, DC.\n  There are some things government can do in the sense that there are \nsome things that government is rather uniquely empowered to do. \nProviding, for example, for our national defense, that is something we \ndo from Washington. That is a power that is entrusted to us by article \nI, section 8, of the Constitution with roughly one-third of the \nprovisions of article I, section 8, being dedicated in one way or \nanother to our national defense. That is something Washington can do. \nIt is something Washington must do and that Washington is rather \nuniquely empowered to do under our constitutional system.\n  Health care is of course important, undeniably important. In many \nrespects it is as important as national defense. The fact that it is \nimportant doesn't necessarily make it a responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment nor does it necessarily qualify the Federal Government as a \npractical matter, setting aside the constitutional question. It doesn't \nnecessarily qualify the Federal Government as an effective health care \nprovider. Many people fear the day when our Federal Government becomes \nmuch more empowered over the very personal decisions of our lives, \nparticularly those affecting our access to health care.\n  Many people are also suspect of the new taxes imposed by this law, \nthe new permutations this law will introduce into the lives of the \nAmerican people. We have discussed several times today the manner in \nwhich this law was enacted, the manner in which it was introduced as a \nbill, brought to the floor of the House of Representatives after then-\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi informed her Members that they needed \nto pass their bill and then they could find out what is in it.\n  One of the things we have not discussed as much is the fact that even \nafter that was passed, without Members of Congress having adequate \nopportunity to review this legislation--even after that happened, \nsetting aside the 20,000 pages of regulations that have been added to \nthis corpus of Federal law up until this point, we have had two \nsignificant revisions of the law, revisions that were brought about not \nlegislatively but by the judicial branch of government, revisions the \njudicial branch of government had no authority to impose.\n  I would like to talk about both of those. When the Affordable Care \nAct was challenged as to its constitutionality, there were two primary \nconstitutional challenges brought to the attention of the Federal court \nsystem that ultimately made their way to the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. One of those challenges involved a constitutional attack \non Congress's authority to enact the individual mandate. The provision \ncompelled individuals to buy health insurance--and not just any kind of \nhealth insurance but the kind of health insurance the Federal \nGovernment in its infinite wisdom deemed appropriate, necessary, \nessential, and indispensable to every American everywhere.\n  The argument presented in those constitutional challenges culminating \nat the Supreme Court of the United States was that Congress had acted \npursuant to its authority under the commerce clause, article I, section \n8, clause 3 of the Constitution, which empowers Congress to regulate \ncommerce among the several States, Indian tribes, and foreign nations. \nThe argument said that Congress does have the power to regulate \ninterstate commerce, and the Supreme Court has interpreted that power \nrather broadly since 1937.\n  Yet, even under that extraordinarily broad interpretation of the \ncommerce clause, the argument was that Congress doesn't have the power \nto regulate an activity. The failure to purchase health insurance is \nnot an interstate commercial transaction. In fact, it is not a \ntransaction at all. It is a failure to act.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States accepted that argument and \nconcluded that even under the extraordinarily broad deferential \nstandard of review used by the Supreme Court since 1937, this could not \npass muster as a valid, legitimate exercise of Congress's commerce \nclause authority. The Supreme Court Justices rejected that argument by \na vote of 5 to 4. Oddly, however, the Supreme Court went on to conclude \nthat the individual mandate was nevertheless constitutional--not under \nthe commerce power but under Congress's power to tax. In essence, what \nthey had was five Justices of the Supreme Court--led by the Chief \nJustice of the United States, the Honorable John Roberts--who, as I see \nit, effectively rewrote the individual mandate provision as a tax. They \nsaved it only by recasting it as a tax or as a valid exercise of \nCongress's power to impose taxes.\n  There were a couple of problems with that interpretation. First and \nforemost, Congress could have imposed a tax as an enforcement mechanism \nto bring about compliance with the individual mandate provision. Yet it \ndecidedly did not. It used language that--under at least a century's \nworth of jurisprudence--was clearly and unequivocally a penalty and not \na tax. There is a long line of cases that help courts decide whether \nsomething is a penalty or tax. Under a century or more of \njurisprudence, this was a penalty and not a tax.\n  It is also important to note that the House of Representatives \ninitially considered language that would have attempted to enforce \ncompliance with the individual mandate provision by means of a tax and \nusing language that under a century's worth of jurisprudence would have \nbeen regarded as a tax. Yet, interestingly enough and not surprisingly, \nthat language was rejected. That proposal did not carry the day. That \nproposal could not carry the day. Why? Well, most Americans \nunderstandably are reluctant to raise taxes on middle-class Americans. \nIt was soundly rejected. It could not carry enough votes even in the \nCongress that was in place during the first 2 years of President \nObama's administration. It could not carry the day in a Congress that \nwas overwhelmingly Democratic in both the House of Representatives and \nin the Senate.\n  The Constitution requires that revenue bills originate in the House \nof Representatives. If this was a new tax, it would have to originate \nin the House. In a very significant sense, one could argue that the \nbill that ultimately became the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, did \noriginate in the House. It came over here to the Senate and had its \nprovisions stripped out and replaced by Senate language, but many \npeople still consider that a House bill.\n  The problem here has a lot to do with the fact that the tax language \ndid not originate in the House or in the Senate. Instead, it originated \nacross the street with five lawyers wearing black robes whom we call \nJustices. Those five lawyers wearing black robes whom we call Justices \nare no more empowered than the Queen of England to impose a tax on the \nAmerican people. Yet they imposed a tax on the American people. This is \nnot OK. This is not acceptable. This was a lawless act. This is \nsomething we should be ashamed of as Americans. It was a sad, shameful \nmoment when the Supreme Court of the United States took upon itself the \nmantle of a superlegislative body, which it is not.\n  Unable to bring about a massive tax increase on the middle class, \nCongress adopted what it could. What it did adopt the Supreme Court \nfound to be unconstitutional on its own terms as it was written. The \nSupreme Court--apparently unwilling to do its job and all too eager to \ndo the job of the legislative branch rather than acknowledging the \nunconstitutionality of that provision--simply resurrected it by \nrewriting it as something that it is not, was not, and never could be.\n  Interestingly, this was not the only insult to the Constitution in \nconnection with that case. In the same dispute in which the Supreme \nCourt rewrote ObamaCare in order to save it, in\n\n[[Page S6771]]\n\nthe same case in which the Supreme Court of the United States rewrote \nthe individual mandate provision as a tax when in fact it was a \npenalty, they did something else: A separate and even larger majority--\na 7-to-2 majority--concluded that another aspect of the Affordable Care \nAct as written could not withstand constitutional muster.\n  The Medicaid expansion provisions left the States with no option, no \nalternative, and no choice other than to accept a significantly \nexpanded Medicaid Program, which is a program that is administered by \nthe States. It is partially funded by the Federal Government but \nultimately administered by the States.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States, citing longstanding \nprecedence, said: This is not OK. Congress doesn't have the power to \ncommandeer the State's legislative and administrative machinery for the \npurpose of implementing a Federal policy. Congress may not do that.\n\n  It is not within our power. Yet a large majority of the Supreme Court \nconcluded that is exactly what Congress did in the Affordable Care Act. \nSo faced with yet another constitutional problem, the Supreme Court \nadopted another rewrite that the Supreme Court of the United States was \nnot constitutionally empowered to bring about. What the Supreme Court \ndid in that circumstance was to just read in or write in an opt-out for \nthe States so as to make it constitutional.\n  Some have tried to defend this by saying: Well, that is what courts \ndo. When courts find that something is unconstitutional, they have to \nlook a second time to see whether they can read into it a different \ninterpretation that might be fairly plausible--a fairly plausible \ninterpretation that could allow them to save it. But in this case there \nwas nothing there. There was nothing that could allow them to do this.\n  The Court's job at that moment was to figure out whether the \nunconstitutional provision could be severed from the rest of the \nstatute, whether it could be excised, sort of like a cancerous tumor, \nallowing the healthy tissue to remain with the cancerous tissue gone \nforever. There are rules and standards the Supreme Court is supposed to \nfollow when engaging in this exercise, and whenever it does this, it \nfollows decades-old severability jurisprudence. Well, that standard, I \nbelieve, if followed, would have inevitably culminated in the Supreme \nCourt of the United States finding that the Medicaid expansion \nprovisions could not be severed from the rest of the statute--the other \nprovisions in the Affordable Care Act. I suspect that may well be why \nthe Supreme Court did not engage in severability analysis. Instead, it \nrewrote the law.\n  So the Supreme Court of the United States rewrote ObamaCare not just \nonce but twice in order to save it. This is not OK. This is not \nconstitutional. This is not America.\n  The next response the defenders of this law usually bring up is, \nwell, it is, after all, the Supreme Court's job to decide what is \nconstitutional and what is not constitutional. So if they say it is \nconstitutional, then it must be constitutional, and who is anyone else \nto second guess their judgment as to constitutionality?\n  OK. Well, I understand that argument. That argument is fine, perhaps, \nas far as it goes. You can't read too much into that statement. It is \nnot fair to say that the Supreme Court is the sole expositor of \nconstitutional meaning. It is true, of course, that within our Federal \nsystem the Supreme Court has the last word in deciding questions of \nFederal statutory and constitutional interpretation for the purpose of \ndeciding discrete cases and controversies properly before the Court's \njurisdiction. However, that does not excuse the rest of us from \nindependently exercising our own judgment, nor is it the case that \nevery constitutional infraction and every constitutional indiscretion \nis necessarily within the competence of the Federal courts to resolve.\n  In fact, there are countless circumstances in which, either because \nthe courts might lack jurisdiction or because no plaintiff can be \nbrought forward with article III standing necessary to challenge the \nFederal action in question or because the courts have recognized that \nthere is a nonjusticiable political question at stake--for whatever \nreason, courts might not be competent to address a particular issue. In \nother circumstances, a case for whatever reason simply is not brought. \nIn many circumstances the courts don't have occasion to address a \nconstitutional infraction.\n  Regardless, we are never excused. We, as Senators of the United \nStates, having taken an oath under article VI of the Constitution to \nuphold the Constitution of the United States, are never excused from \nour responsibility to look out for, protect, and defend the \nConstitution of the United States. When we see an unconstitutional \naction, we need to call it out as such, and we need to do whatever we \ncan to stop the Constitution from being violated.\n  The Constitution was violated, the Constitution was distorted, and \nthe Constitution was manipulated. It was defiled not once but twice by \nthe Supreme Court of the United States when the Court rewrote the \nAffordable Care Act twice in this decision that was rendered at the end \nof June 2012.\n  This is one of many reasons why I think it is important for us to \nhave this debate and discussion about whether we fully fund the \nimplementation and enforcement of this law--a law that was never read \nby those who enacted it, a law that has become less popular rather than \nmore popular subsequent to its enactment, a law that has now spawned \nsome 20,000 pages and counting of new regulatory text.\n  This same law was rewritten not just once but twice by a supreme \ncourt of the United States that openly flouted the Constitution of the \nUnited States. They thumbed their noses at their own constitutional \nresponsibilities. We are now being asked whether we should continue \nfunding the implementation and enforcement of that act, and I think \nnot.\n  In addition to the unconstitutional rewriting by the Supreme Court of \nthe United States, we now have several instances in which the President \nof the United States himself has attempted to rewrite the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act. The President of the United States \nhas said that although enforcement of the employer mandate provision is \nset to begin on January 1, 2014, the President's administration will \nnot implement and enforce that provision effective January 1, \n2014. Although the President lacks any constitutional or statutory \nauthority to make this decision, although the President has neither \nsought nor obtained a legislative modification from the legislative \nbranch of government--Congress--the President is treating the law as if \nit contained that modification already.\n\n  There was another modification that took place with respect to the \nimplementation of the out-of-pocket spending limits, the spending caps. \nThis, too, was done without any legislative or any constitutional \nauthority. There is another modification the President made with \nrespect to proof of eligibility for subsidies on the exchange network \nset up by the Affordable Care Act. All three of these modifications \nwere made by the President without any statutory authority, and they \nwere, therefore, extra constitutional modifications.\n  As I understand it, a few weeks ago somebody asked the President of \nthe United States why this was appropriate. Somebody challenged the \nPresident of the United States with regard to his authority on these \nmodifications. His response was something similar to this: Under \nordinary circumstances, under more ideal circumstances, perhaps I might \nhave gone to Congress to get Congress to modify the statutory \nprovisions in question, but these are not ordinary or ideal \ncircumstances.\n  I am not sure exactly what he meant, but it sounds to me as though \nwhat he was saying was, I am in a tough spot so I have to do what I can \ndo, what I can get away with, because I have a Congress that is now \nless cooperative, less inclined to cooperate with me, less inclined to \ndo what I as President of the United States want Congress to do, than \nthe Congress that was in place in 2010 when the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act was enacted into law.\n  That is interesting. It is interesting on a number of levels because, \nNo. 1, one of the reasons Congress is now less inclined to be \ncooperative with the President, one of the reasons the Congress is no \nlonger as inclined to do the\n\n[[Page S6772]]\n\nPresident's bidding is, interestingly enough, because of the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act, because of the widespread public \noutcry that came from across this country as a direct result of the \nenactment of this statute.\n  It is not at all unusual to have a divided Congress. It is not at all \nunusual for one or both Houses of Congress to be under the control of a \nparty other than the President's own political party. Yet it has never \nbeen the case and can never be the case if there is somehow an \nexception to the Constitution, if there is somehow an exception to \narticle I's provision that all legislative powers granted by the \nConstitution shall be vested in a Congress consisting of a Senate and \nof a House of Representatives.\n  The fact that the President finds political dissent within the \nCongress irritating does not make him a king. The fact that Congress \nwill not always do the President's bidding does not vest him with the \npowers of a despot. When someone holding the office of President of the \nUnited States purports to wield legislative power, when the President \nof the United States purports to make law by the stroke of the \nexecutive pen, we have exited the territorial confines of \nconstitutional government.\n  These are some of the reasons we have focused this debate back on \nObamaCare. People are frequently bringing up the argument: This is law. \nThis is settled law. Because it is settled law, you must fund it. First \nof all, I am aware of no constitutional command that says that simply \nbecause a law has been adopted, Congress must fund any and every \nprovision authorized under that law. In fact, quite to the contrary. \nBecause Congress holds the power of the purse, Congress may--Congress \nmust--continue to have the authority to decide which programs to fund \nand which programs not to fund. Were it otherwise, we would have a \nstraining set of circumstances in which one Congress could bind another \nCongress simply by passing a piece of legislation and not by a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  That is not the case. It never has been the case. It never could be, \nshould be or will be the case under our constitutional system today.\n  What we see is the fact that this is not simply a partisan political \ndebate. Many are casting it as that. Many are pointing to the fact that \nwe have some Republicans agreeing with some Democrats, but for the most \npart we see widespread disagreement between Republicans and Democrats. \nBut that dramatically oversimplifies the matter. This is no longer \nsimply a dispute between Republicans and Democrats. In many respects, \nthis represents a dispute between the political ruling establishment in \nWashington, DC, on the one hand and the American people on the other \nhand.\n  One of the things we are often told we have to face is that we have \nto choose to keep everything funded or we have to choose to fund \nnothing. It is a frequent source of frustration to many who serve in \nthis body. It certainly has been a frequent source of frustration to me \nand to the 3 million people I represent in the State of Utah. It is odd \nthat we find ourselves in a position to vote on a continuing resolution \nthat funds everything in government or nothing in government. It is a \nfrustrating exercise we have to go through. Because of the fact that we \nhave chosen to appropriate this way year after year, we basically have \none opportunity to decide what we are going to fund in government and \nwhat we are not going to fund in government. I wish what we could do \nis, at a minimum, a bare minimum--it should be a lot more than this--\nbut at a bare minimum, to have two different debates, two different \ndiscussions, both starting with the presupposition that we fund nothing \nbut culminating in funding or not funding something; one that would \ndeal with funding for ObamaCare and another one that would deal with \nfunding for everything else in government. It would be nice if \nObamaCare funding had to stand or fall on its own merits. If we were \nstarting from zero when it came to providing ObamaCare funding and we \nhad to justify it, we had to make the case for it, and we had to say, \nlet's prove to the American people why we ought to be funding the \nenforcement of this law--this law that will make health care less \naffordable rather than more and this law that is being implemented in a \nfundamentally unfair manner, I think that would prove a very different \ndebate and discussion. But very often the way things work in \nWashington, the way continuing resolutions work, is we are faced with a \nset of circumstances that don't accurately reflect the way we make \ndecisions in any other aspect of our lives.\n  I sometimes am inclined to analogize this kind of continuing \nresolution spending default. This is a vast oversimplification, but \nsuppose someone lived in a very remote area. Suppose the closest town \nto where they lived was at least 100 miles away, but there was one \nmarket, one grocery store just 1 mile from their home. It was the only \ngrocery store within at least 150 miles, let's just say. One day the \nperson's spouse calls them on their way home from work and says: Stop \nat the store. We need bread, milk, and eggs. The person goes to the \ngrocery store and finds the bread, puts it in the cart, finds the milk \nand eggs, puts them in the cart, and goes to the checkout counter. The \ncashier checks out those things and then the cashier says: Wait a \nsecond. You can't just buy these things. You cannot just buy bread, \nmilk, and eggs.\n  You say: Why on Earth can I not buy just these three items? This is \nall I need.\n  This is a different kind of grocery store. This is a grocery store \npatterned after the U.S. Congress. In order to buy bread, milk, and \neggs, we are also going to require you to buy a bucket of nails, a half \nton of iron ore, and you can use our wheelbarrow to take it out to your \ncar, a book about cowboy poetry, and a Barry Manilow album.\n  You say: I don't want any of those things. And the cashier says: That \nis fine. Then you don't get your bread, your milk, and your eggs.\n  At that point, the shopper, not wanting to come home to a very \ndisappointed spouse, is likely to say: Fine, even though I don't want \nthe nails or the iron ore or the cowboy poetry book, and I definitely \ndon't want the Barry Manilow album, I am going to buy those things \nbecause I can't buy the things I need unless I also buy those things.\n  That is how we spend in the Congress. Whether we like it or not--and \nmost of us don't like it--that is what we are stuck with. So that is \none of the reasons we are having this debate now, one of the reasons I \nthink it is appropriate for us to have this debate in connection with \nthis. It is unfortunate in many respects that we tie something so \nfundamental to who we are as a country, something so essential to our \nongoing existence as a nation as national defense. It seems absurd that \nwe should tie that to funding for ObamaCare. Yet that is where we find \nourselves because of the fact that we have been operating under a \ncontinuous string of back-to-back continuing resolutions for the last 4 \nor 5 years.\n  It is time for us to start breaking away from those false and \nultimately ridiculous choices. It is time for us to demand more as a \npeople from our Congress. It is time for us as a people to start to \ndemand independent debate and discussion, debate and discussion that \nfar more closely reflects the will of the American people and their \nongoing needs.\n  If the Senate must choose between standing with the longstanding \ninterests, the entrenched interests of the political governing class in \nWashington on the one hand or, on the other hand, standing with the \nAmerican people, I hope--I expect--that we will stand with the American \npeople. If we ask any Member how constituents are feeling about the \nAffordable Care Act, how constituents are feeling about ObamaCare and \nits coming implementation and enforcement, the response we will get is \nthat, at best, constituents are mixed. In many cases, they are \napprehensive, they are uncertain. But overwhelmingly, we will find a \nlot of opposition from people who are seeing those all around them \nfacing job losses, wage cuts, cuts to their hours, and cuts to their \nhealth care benefits.\n  How long are we going to have to continue to hear these things before \nwe act? Are we as a Congress willing to just look at these things and \nsay: Yes, well, bad things happen. Let's just allow them to happen. Are \nwe willing to do that? Those who are Democrats, are they willing to do \nthat saying, yes,\n\n[[Page S6773]]\n\nI know this law is not perfect, but it is a speed dump that we have to \ncross over on our way to a single-payer system run by the health care \nsystem? As Republicans, are we willing to endure that, saying, yes, it \nis a train wreck, but the good news is it might inure to our political \nbenefit if it gets in? I hope we are not willing to do that. I hope we \nhave not descended to such a shameful, cynical low that we would be \nwilling to allow those political interests to trump the needs of the \nAmerican people who are calling out, crying out for help and for \nrelief.\n  Ultimately, as we think about our responsibilities as Senators, as we \nthink about our responsibilities as citizens, I hope we will reflect \nfrom time to time on the fact that we have all taken an oath to uphold \nthis document, this 226-year-old document, a document that I believe \nwas written by the hands of wise men raised up by their Creator for \nthat very purpose, to help foster and promote what will become--what \nhas become--the greatest civilization the world has ever known.\n  To the extent that we respect and honor this document, to the extent \nthat we follow it, to the extent that we defend it, we uphold it at \nevery turn, to the extent that we consider it not just a responsibility \nof the judiciary but also of the political branches of government, \nincluding our own branch, we have prospered as a country. And to the \nextent that we will return to those practices, we will benefit directly \nas a result.\n  So I have to ask Senator Cruz, as a constitutional lawyer, as one of \nour Nation's preeminent appellate litigators, as one who has argued \nmany times before the U.S. Supreme Court, and as one who clerked for \nthe late Chief Justice William Rehnquist and now as a U.S. Senator, how \ndoes the Senator see this role, the role of what some describe as \ncoordinate branch construction of the Constitution? What role does it \nplay in this body? What role does the Constitution play in the Senate? \nDoes it have a place or is that something that is supposed to be left \nto the nine men and women wearing black robes across the street who are \nlawyers and hold a different constitutional office than we do?\n  (Mr. SCHATZ assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. CRUZ. Well, I thank my friend the junior Senator from Utah for \nhis very fine, learned question. It is truly a privilege to serve in \nthis body alongside a constitutional scholar, alongside a Senator who \ntakes fidelity to the Constitution so seriously, so appropriately \nseriously.\n  Senator Lee's question is exactly right: How seriously do the men and \nwoman in this body take the Constitution? How seriously do we take the \nobligation? Each of us swears to uphold the Constitution. Yet it is \neasy, particularly in an era in which the Supreme Court is deemed to be \nthe primary arbiter of constitutionality, for Members of Congress, \nmembers of the executive branch, to say: That is their problem. We pass \nthe laws; the Court figures out if they are constitutional.\n  I would very much agree with Senator Lee's proposition that doing so \nis an abdication of our responsibility, that every one of us has an \nobligation to not support any law that is contrary to the Constitution \nand to oppose any law that is.\n  I would note that among the House Members who joined us was \nCongressman Justin Amash. He came to the floor of the Senate to join us \nto support this effort. I note Congressman Amash has the unique \ndistinction of joining you and me and Senator Paul in the description \nof being--I believe the term was ``wacko birds,'' which, I for one--I \nam not sure to which particular avian species that refers, but \nwhichever one it is, if it reflects a fidelity to the Constitution, a \nfidelity to liberty, and a willingness to fight to defend the \nprinciples this country was founded on, then I--and I believe I can \nspeak for you and Rand and Congressman Amash--and I think quite a few \nothers of us are very, very proud ``wacko birds.''\n  We are talking about an important topic. We are talking about a topic \nthat impacts millions of Americans. But at the same time, we cannot \nlose our sense of humor, and we cannot lose our sense of hope and \noptimism.\n  I will note that my staff has been with me here all night, tirelessly \nfighting because they believe in America. We believe in America. We \nbelieve there can be something better. You look at the explosion of \ngovernment, the explosion of spending, the explosion of debt, the \nexplosion of taxes, the explosion of regulation, the stagnation of \neconomic growth, and it is easy to throw up your hands and say: Can we \never get back to that United States of America we once were?\n  But there are signs, glimmers of hope. Look right now at one of the \nmost popular television shows in the United States--``Duck Dynasty.'' \nThis is a show about a God-fearing family of successful entrepreneurs \nwho love guns, who love to hunt, and who believe in the American dream. \nIt is something that, according to Congress, almost should not exist, \nyet a lot of wisdom. Millions of Americans tune in to ``Duck Dynasty.'' \nSo I want to point out just a few words of wisdom from ``Duck Dynasty'' \nthat are probably good for all of us to hear.\n  Willie observed:\n\n       You put 5 rednecks on a mower, it's gonna be epic.\n\n  Phil said:\n\n       In a subdivision, you call 911. At home, I AM 911!\n\n  Si said:\n\n       Some people say I'm a dreamer, others say, ``If you fall \n     asleep at work again we're going to let you go.''\n\n  Jase said:\n\n       Redneck rule number one, most things can be fixed with duct \n     tape and extension cords.\n\n  That is actually very true.\n  Phil said:\n\n       I think our problem is a spiritual one.\n\n  Phil also said:\n\n       When you get older and you start dating, I want you to be \n     able to say one thing, ``I can bait a hook.''\n\n  One day maybe Caroline and Catherine will be able to say that.\n  Phil also said, very simply:\n\n       Happy, happy, happy.\n\n  I say this to the junior Senator from Utah, when we defund ObamaCare, \nwe are all going to be happy, happy, happy.\n  Miss Kay said:\n\n       Our marriage is living proof that love & family can get you \n     through everything.\n\n  Si said:\n\n       I live by my own rules (reviewed, revised, and approved by \n     my wife) . . . but still my own.\n\n  Jep said:\n\n       Faith, family, and facial hair.\n\n  Let me point out to the junior Senator from Utah that if we continue \ndoing this long enough, we may have facial hair on the floor of Senate. \nThat is all right.\n  Willie said:\n\n       Are you kidding me? I'm straight up hunger games with a \n     bow.\n\n  Si said:\n\n       Ford F150, Chevy Silverado, Dodge Ram, Toyota Tundra. As a \n     married man, these are the only pickup lines I am allowed to \n     use.\n\n  Jase said:\n\n       Where I come from, your truck is an exact reflection on \n     your personality.\n\n  Si said:\n\n       I make up people all the time to get out of stuff.\n\n  Si also said:\n\n       A redneck walkin' into Bass Pro Shops gets more excited \n     than a 12 year old girl going to a Justin Beaver concert.\n\n  Let me point out that that is Justin Beaver, B-e-a-v-e-r.\n  Si also said:\n\n       Your beard is so hairy, even Dora can't explore it.\n\n  Si also said:\n\n       Your beard's so stupid it takes 2 hours to watch 60 \n     minutes!\n\n  And finally Si said:\n\n       I am the MacGyver of cooking. You bring me a piece of \n     bread, cabbage, coconut, mustard greens, pigs feet, pine \n     cones . . . and a woodpecker, I'll make you a good chicken \n     pot pie.\n\n  Let me suggest that kind of homespun wisdom is what this country was \nbuilt on. It is who we are. Look, there are some things to chuckle on, \nbut there is an awful lot of common sense.\n  On the same theme, I want to point to one of my favorite songs. It is \na song that came out following the tragic attacks on this country of 9/\n11, but it speaks more broadly to who we are as Americans, that we can \novercome any challenge, any obstacle, including, I think, the obstacle \nof ObamaCare--admittedly, a very, very different challenge than that \nwhich occurred on 9/11,\n\n[[Page S6774]]\n\nbut ultimately the American spirit and faith and freedom that underlie \nit will help us overcome every challenge. That is Toby Keith's song \n``Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue.''\n  Toby Keith observed--and, Mr. President, I am going to make a promise \nto you. I am not going to endeavor to sing because even if it might not \nviolate the Senate rules, it would violate rules of musical harmony, \nhuman decency, and possibly even the Geneva Conventions. So I will not \nsubject you to my musical rendition, but I will at least share the \nwords from ``Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue.''\n\n     American Girls and American Guys\n     We'll always stand up and salute\n     We'll always recognize\n     When we see Old Glory flying\n     There's a lot of men dead\n     So we can sleep in peace at night\n     When we lay down our head.\n\n     My daddy served in the army\n     Where he lost his right eye\n     But he flew a flag out in our yard\n     Until the day that he died\n     He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister and me\n     To grow up and live happy\n     In the land of the free.\n\n     Now this nation that I love\n     Has fallen under attack\n     A mighty sucker punch came flyin' in\n     From somewhere in the back\n     Soon as we could see clearly\n     Through our big black eye\n     Man, we lit up your world\n     Like the 4th of July.\n\n     Hey Uncle Sam\n     Put your name at the top of his list\n     And the Statue of Liberty\n     Started shakin' her fist\n     And the eagle will fly\n     Man, it's gonna be hell\n     When you hear Mother Freedom\n     Start ringin' her bell\n     And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you\n     Brought to you Courtesy of the Red White and Blue.\n\n     Justice will be served\n     And the battle will rage\n     This big dog will fight\n     When you rattle his cage\n     And you'll be sorry that you messed with\n     The U.S. of A.\n     'Cause we'll put a boot in your [posterior]--\n\n  Edited for our friends on C-SPAN--\n\n     It's the American way.\n\n     Hey Uncle Sam\n     Put your name at the top of his list\n     And the Statue of Liberty\n     Started shakin' her fist\n     And the eagle will fly\n     Man, it's gonna be hell\n     When you hear Mother Freedom\n     Start ringin' her bell\n     And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you\n     Brought to you Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue.\n\n  If you want to talk about the American spirit, it is hard to listen \nto that song and not think about who we are as a people, not think \nabout the threats.\n  Let me give you an example of a different threat, a different threat \nto our liberty that every bit as much we have to rise up against. I \nwant to read for you a statement of September 12, 2012, that Hobby \nLobby put out on ObamaCare and religious freedom. Religious freedom is \nfoundational to who we are. So let's read what David Green, the CEO and \nfounder of Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., stated.\n\n       When my family and I started our company 40 years ago, we \n     were working out of a garage on a $600 bank loan, assembling \n     miniature picture frames. Our first retail store wasn't much \n     bigger than most people's living rooms, but we had faith that \n     we would succeed if we lived and worked according to God's \n     work. From there, Hobby Lobby has become one of the nation's \n     largest arts and crafts retailers, with more than 500 \n     locations in 41 states. Our children grew up into fine \n     business leaders, and today we run Hobby Lobby together, as a \n     family.\n       We're Christians, and we run our business on Christian \n     principles. I've always said that the first two goals of our \n     business are 1) to run our business in harmony with God's \n     laws, and 2) to focus on people more than money. And that's \n     what we've tried to do. We close early so our employees can \n     see their families at night. We keep our stores closed on \n     Sundays, one of the week's biggest shopping days, so that our \n     workers and their families can enjoy a day of rest. We \n     believe that it is by God's grace that Hobby Lobby has \n     endured, and he has blessed us and our employees. We've not \n     only added jobs in a weak economy, we've also raised wages \n     for the past four years in a row. Our full-time employees \n     start at 80% above minimum wage.\n       But now, our government threatens to change all of that. A \n     new government health care mandate says that our family \n     business must provide what I believe are abortion-causing \n     drugs as part of our health insurance. Being Christians, we \n     don't pay for drugs that might cause abortions. Which means \n     that we don't cover emergency contraception, the morning-\n     after pill or the week-after pill.\n       We believe that doing so might end a life after the moment \n     of conception, something that is contrary to our most \n     important beliefs. It goes against the biblical principles on \n     which we have run this company since day one. If we refuse to \n     comply, we could face $1.3 million per day in government \n     fines.\n       Our government threatens to fine job creators in a bad \n     economy. Our government threatens to fine a company that has \n     raised wages four years running. Our government threatens to \n     fine a family for running its business according to its \n     beliefs. It's not right.\n       I know people will say we ought to follow the rules, that \n     it's the same for everybody. But that's not true. The \n     government has exempted thousands of companies from its \n     mandates, for reasons of convenience or cost. But it won't \n     exempt them for reasons of religious belief.\n       So, Hobby Lobby--and my family--are forced to make a \n     choice. With great reluctance, we filed a lawsuit today, \n     represented by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, asking \n     a federal court to stop this mandate before it hurts our \n     business. We don't like to go running into court, but we no \n     longer have a choice. We believe people are more important \n     than the bottom line and that honoring God is more important \n     than turning a profit.\n       My family has lived the American dream. We want to continue \n     growing our company and providing great jobs for thousands of \n     employees, but the government is going to make that much more \n     difficult. The government is forcing us to choose between \n     following our faith and following the law. I say that's a \n     choice no American--and no American business--should have to \n     make.\n\n  Now, you might ask, what does that letter from Hobby Lobby have to do \nwith Toby Keith's terrific song? I am going to suggest they have an \nawful lot to do with each other. Our Nation was founded by men and \nwomen fleeing religious persecution from across the globe, fleeing \ngovernments that sought to impose their rules to restrict the religious \nliberty of men and women.\n  Our Founding Fathers, the people who formed the United States of \nAmerica, fled those countries and came here. Why? To establish a \ncountry where everyone could worship God with all of your heart, mind \nand soul, according to the dictates of your conscience. The men and \nwomen watching this at home--not all of you may share the religious \nconvictions of the CEO of Hobby Lobby. You may or may not be \nChristians. If you are Christians, you may or may not share his faith \nand his interpretation of what his faith requires.\n  But if you look at the history of our country, the Federal Government \nis telling that CEO--the Federal Government is telling Catholic \nhospitals and Catholic charities that they must violate their religious \nbeliefs. Why? Because government knows best. You know, there is a \nreason why the Bill of Rights begins with the First Amendment and why \nthe First Amendment begins with protecting religious liberty, \nprotecting the religious liberty of all of us, because it is \nfoundational. The Founding Fathers who formed our country understood \nthat if you did not have the freedom to seek out God, then every other \nfreedom could be stripped away. Yet this administration has \ndemonstrated a hostility to religious faith that is staggering, indeed.\n  In recent months, we saw an Air Force chaplain in Alaska face \npunishment and repercussions for posting a blog post in which he \nstated, ``there are no atheists in foxholes.''\n  Now, mind you, this was a chaplain. His job is to minister to the \nspiritual life of the men and women of the Air Force. Yet that \nstatement was deemed inhospitable to atheists and inconsistent with the \nmilitary and this administration. Now, the irony, of course, is that \nparticular statement was said previously by a general named Dwight D. \nEisenhower, who as we all know was President of the United States.\n  Indeed, President Dwight D. Eisenhower had more than a passing \nfamiliarity with the military. That statement comes from a speech \nPresident Eisenhower gave to the American Legion--I believe it was in \n1954--in which he was describing a story of four immortal chaplains. \nThat story is a story young people do not learn any more. It is a story \na lot of people do not know. President Eisenhower told it.\n  I had the opportunity recently to speak at the American Legion's \nnational convention. I had the opportunity to share it. There were a \nnumber of particularly older veterans, World War II veterans, who knew \nthe story of the four immortal chaplains.\n\n[[Page S6775]]\n\nThat is the story of the USS Dorchester that was hit by a U-boat \ntorpedo and was sinking. There were four chaplains aboard that ship.\n  I believe two were Protestant, one was Catholic, and one was Jewish. \nThey were handing out life vests. They realized they did not have \nenough life vests for the men and women on that ship. Each of those \nfour chaplains removed his life vest and gave it to another passenger. \nThose other passengers were saved and those four chaplains stood \ntogether on the deck of the ship singing and praying as the ship went \ndown.\n  The point of the story is, when the chaplains put their life vests on \nother passengers, gave their life vests, gave their lives for other \npassengers, they did not ask each passenger: Are you a Christian? Are \nyou a Jew? Is your religious faith the same as mine? Because, as \nPresident Eisenhower explained, there are no atheists in foxholes, and \nthey were there sacrificing for their fellow man.\n  You know religious liberty is foundational to who we are. One of the \nmost pernicious aspects of ObamaCare is that it disregards religious \nliberty, when you have the Federal Government getting so intimately \ninvolved in health care. It has necessitated the Federal Government \ntrampling on good faith religious beliefs.\n  Look, nobody has questioned the good faith religious beliefs of the \nowners of Hobby Lobby. Even if you do not share their views, what about \nyour religious beliefs? If the government can order them to violate \ntheir religious beliefs, what is to stop them from ordering you to \nviolate yours?\n  That is wrong. That is inconsistent with who we are as Americans. \nThat is one of the many reasons Americans are fed up with what is \nhappening under ObamaCare.\n  You know, earlier I was reading some of the stories from individual \nconstituents. I would like to return to that. A constituent in Humble, \nTX, wrote on September 10, 2013:\n\n       I am one of many Americans adversely affected by Mr. \n     Obama's health care. I just received a letter stating that as \n     the Affordable Care Act draws fuller to close implementation, \n     I will no longer have access to the group medical PPO plan, \n     the group dental plan, or the group vision plan effective \n     January 1, 2014. I am 62, in good health, but need health \n     insurance. I do not know what my options will be if I can \n     even afford a government-run plan.\n\n  That is not me speaking. That is reading a letter from one individual \nwho is 62 years old who had insurance but is losing that insurance \nbecause of ObamaCare. Not working. It is simply not working.\n  Another constituent from Fort Worth, TX, wrote on September 9, 2013:\n\n       My husband was with IBM for over 30 years. We considered \n     the health insurance was part of our salary. Two weeks ago, I \n     found out that they are canceling the insurance for retirees \n     and their spouses because of ObamaCare. They say they will \n     give me a lump sum of money to buy another plan. But I assume \n     once that money is gone, I will be responsible for the \n     payments. Thank you for all you're doing to stop ObamaCare. \n     By the way, my primary physician just closed his practice \n     because of ObamaCare. He said he didn't think he could give \n     the kind of care to his patients that they deserve.\n\n  There are two things there that are very striking. No. 1 is the \nsituation of this woman so many Americans across this country are \nexperiencing. They had a health plan they liked. They had health \ninsurance they liked. We remember 3\\1/2\\ years ago when the President \npromised the American people: If you like your health insurance you can \nkeep it. We now know that statement was flatly, objectively 100 percent \nfalse. We now know that it is not the case, if you like your health \ninsurance you can keep it, because ObamaCare is causing people all over \nthe country, like this woman in Ft. Worth, TX, to lose her health \ninsurance.\n  They are understandably not happy about it. They are hurting. They \nare suffering. But, secondly, I think it is very interesting, the point \nabout her primary physician. We are also seeing doctors leaving the \npractice of medicine, advising young students: Don't go to med school \nbecause ObamaCare is destroying the practice of medicine. If the goal \nis to expand access to health care, driving good physicians out of the \npractice of medicine is completely antithetical to that goal.\n  Another constituent, a retired couple from Bayou Vista, TX, wrote on \nthe September 9, 2013:\n\n       My wife and I are retired living on a fixed income. We \n     worked hard our whole lives protecting our credit and saved \n     enough money to buy a modest home in Bayou Vista, TX. If the \n     insurance premiums being published in the local newspaper \n     materialize, we will no longer be able to afford to live in \n     our home. We could not sell it either. The facts, if left \n     unchanged, will destroy many coastal communities and result \n     in our personal financial ruin. We would have no choice but \n     to walk from our mortgage. We would lose all of the \n     investment we have made in this house. Our credit would be \n     ruined.\n\n  These are the words of a retired couple living on a fixed income who \nmanaged to save up to buy a home for their retirement for their golden \nyears. ObamaCare is threatening to turn their retirement into a \nnightmare. I remind you that the word ``nightmare'' is not mine. That \nword ``nightmare'' is the word of James Hoffa, the president of the \nTeamsters.\n  That nightmare is very real for that couple. It is real for so many \nAmericans. Yet it is a nightmare. It is now late at night. I am going \nto venture to say most Members of the Senate are home in bed asleep \nwhile America lives the nightmare. If we were listening to the people, \nwe would not be home asleep. If we were listening to the people, we \nwould be experiencing that nightmare, we would be waking up--much like \nmy little girls do sometimes when they have a scary dream--but we would \nbe responding like any parent does when your child has a nightmare. You \ncome in and try to make the nightmare go away.\n  America is experiencing that nightmare and it is even worse. Because \nhere, the Senate caused that nightmare. We passed the law that is the \nnightmare for the American people, and Senators on both sides of the \naisle have been telling the American people they are too busy, there \nare too many other priorities on their list to even talk about the \nnightmare that is ObamaCare.\n  That is wrong. That is fundamentally wrong. We need to make DC \nlisten.\n  Mr. LEE. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEE. I wish to ask the Senator from Texas his reaction to a \ncouple of stories that I think relate well to what the Senator from \nTexas is saying to us about the fact that Congress has adopted a law \nthat has brought about a series of nightmares for the American people, \nonly these are real. This is not some dream we are going to wake up \nfrom and discover that this is a figment of our subconscious mind that \nis causing us torment. It is real.\n  Sometimes we react as a lawmaking body to situations in such a way \nthat we don't necessarily improve upon the status quo. We identify a \nproblem, and we try to act. Sometimes the results aren't necessarily \nwhat we intend them to be. Sometimes the results can be quite the \nopposite of what was intended at the outset. I think this may well have \nbeen the case with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which \nat the end of the day neither protects patients nor makes health care \nmore affordable.\n  It reminds me a little bit of a story, something I experienced a few \nyears ago when I was working at the Supreme Court. I shared an office \nwith three other law clerks at the time.\n  We discovered something very interesting about our office space. \nDuring the summer months, when we started our clerkships, our office \nwas almost unbearably cold, something that was unusual for me because I \nlike an office or a home to be relatively cool, but this was unusually \ncold. It was so cold we were tempted to wear gloves in the middle of \nthe summer indoors because our office was so cold. It was so cold that \nsometimes we would open our windows to our office, even though it was \nhot outside, and it would let in this hot, humid air. Sometimes we were \ntempted to build fires in the fireplace in our small office in the \nmiddle of the summer, because it was so cold in the office that our \nhands would get numb and we could barely write. That is a significant \nportion of a law clerk's job is to write, write a lot of material.\n  We would walk over to the thermostat thinking that might solve the \nproblem. It was too cold, so we turned the thermostat up thinking that \nwould make it a little bit warmer and, therefore, more tolerable in our \noffice. First\n\n[[Page S6776]]\n\nwe would move it up a little. It didn't do any good. Then we would move \nit up a lot and it still didn't do any good. It was still freezing cold \nin our office in the middle of the summer in Washington.\n  When it came to be wintertime, we had a similar problem but at the \nopposite end of the thermometer. In the wintertime we found that our \noffice was intolerably hot. It was hot all the time. It was so hot that \nwe were sweating. It is hardly appropriate, when working as a law clerk \nat the Supreme Court of the United States, to wear shorts to work, \nespecially in January, so we didn't do that. Because it was so hot we \nfrequently found ourselves tempted to open the windows again, letting \nin very cold air from the outside. Because we were so hot we had to do \nsomething to balance out the temperature. Again, we went to the \nthermostat to no avail. It was intolerably hot so we, of course, turned \nthe thermostat down, first a little, and it didn't do any good, and \nthen a lot, and it still didn't do any good.\n  After a while we called the maintenance people of the building. In \nfact, we called several of the maintenance people in the building. It \nwas an old building, finished in 1935. It was undergoing renovation at \nthe time. The renovation went on for many years. We ultimately got to \nthe top maintenance and management supervisor in the Supreme Court. He \nended up spending a fair amount of time trying to find out what was \nwrong with our heating and air conditioning system, trying to figure \nout why on Earth it was so intolerably cold in our office in the summer \nand why it was so intolerably hot in the wintertime.\n  His conclusion was relatively simple, and it was not what we \nexpected. He came to us and he said, OK, I have dismantled your entire \nsystem and I found the problem. Your thermostat was installed backward. \nWhen you turned the thermostat up, trying to make it warmer, it had the \nopposite effect. It was only making it colder. When you turned the \nthermostat down, trying to make it cooler, it was only making it hotter \nin your office, hence your problem.\n  As he said this, I looked out the window across the street at the \nCapitol, and I thought I wonder if there is something Congress can \nlearn from this. Sometimes Congress, out of an abundant, legitimate, \nwell-intentioned desire to achieve good in society will do something. \nSometimes that something is the only thing Congress knows how to do at \nthe moment. Why? Because Congress legislates. It is what we do.\n  As I have said before, sometimes when you are holding a hammer, \neverything starts to look like a nail. Sometimes when Congress acts, \neven with the best of intentions, it gets it wrong. The risk of this is \nespecially high when Congress acts in 2,700-page increments that no one \nhas read prior to passing those increments into law. I believe that is \nwhat happened here.\n  But the proper response to a broken thermostat, or a thermostat that \nis installed backward, is not to continue using the same thermostat. \nThe solution has to be to fix the thermostat, to replace it. We have \ngot a broken thermostat with this law and it needs to be replaced \nentirely.\n  I am also reminded of another story, a story that is somewhat related \nthat helps us understand some similar points.\n  One night when I was a teenager, I think I was about 14 years old, I \nwas out with my family. I grew up in a large family, seven children, \nbut in Utah that is sort of a medium-sized family, but that is a \ndiscussion for a different day. We were out somewhere with the family. \nI think we had gone out for dinner, and we were headed home. As we were \nalmost to our home, one of my younger sisters suggested to my dad that \nwe go out for ice cream as a family. We were almost home, and \nrecognizing that we were almost home, I all of a sudden realized I \ndidn't want to go out for ice cream because I had homework. I asked my \ndad to keep driving home, drop me off at the house. The rest of the \nfamily could continue on and go and get ice cream together. That way I \ncould stay home, get my homework done, and I wouldn't have to be up too \nlate.\n  It all worked well. I had all my siblings in the car. That is a lot \nof kids in the car, but my dad pulled up in front of our house to let \nme out. I was in the back seat of the car. I opened the car door, and I \nput one foot out of the car, starting to get out. I wish to tell you \nsomething a little bit about my father--my late father, may he rest in \npeace; he died 17 years ago. He was a very good man, a wise man, a \nsmart man. He was one of my greatest heroes in this life. He had many \ntalents, but he was also very absentminded. Sometimes he wasn't paying \nattention, and this was one of those moments.\n  As I stepped one foot out of our Oldsmobile, my dad started to drive \noff with half of my body still in the car. Somehow the Oldsmobile ended \nup on top of my foot turned around backwards. That is a little bit hard \nto describe. The Oldsmobile, with a whole bunch of kids in it, weighs a \nlot. All of a sudden the Oldsmobile was on top of my foot as it was \nturned around backwards. I was trying to explain to my dad we had a \nproblem, but all that came out were grunts and groans. I couldn't quite \nfind the words to tell him that we had a problem, because I was in so \nmuch pain.\n  He realized at that point I was still in the car, but it still didn't \noccur to him that the car was on top of my foot. Finally I mustered the \npresence of mind to get out one word, one word that I knew I could \npronounce, one word that would send the message unequivocally to my \nfather: Get the Oldsmobile off of my foot. But I couldn't utter that \nmany words, so I spit out one word. The word was ``reverse.'' Dad, \nreverse. Well, he got that message. He put the car in reverse, and he \ngot the Oldsmobile off my foot.\n  But for my ability to utter that one word in a relatively short \nperiod of time that seemed like an eternity under the circumstances, my \nfoot may well have been broken, my siblings probably would have found \nthat mildly amusing under the circumstances, and I probably wouldn't \nhave gotten my homework done that night. As it turned out, I was able \nto avoid that and it was because I was able to utter that one word, \nreverse.\n  Sometimes when you are doing something that hurts someone, you have \nto reverse. You have to turn off that which has been turned on which \nhas been harming people. This law, turned on 3\\1/2\\ years ago, is \nharming people. It is going to do a lot more if it remains in the on \nposition. We need to put this car into reverse. We need, at a minimum, \nto halt the operation of this law.\n  The best way, I believe the only way at this point, to achieve that, \nshort of repeal, is by defunding. Say: Look, at a minimum, let's halt \nthe spending on further implementation and enforcement of this law \nwhile we get certain things sorted out as a country, while we figure \nout what else we can do.\n  The objections to this are many. Some say this can't ever happen. You \ndon't have the political will to do that, and you don't have the \npolitical muscle to do that. It can't happen. We know one thing for \ncertain. It is never going to happen if we don't try.\n  We also know a number of other can't-win battles have been fought and \nultimately won. A few months ago, Americans were being told we are \ngoing to have significant gun control legislation, significant \nlegislation that could eat away in a meaningful way through your \nprivacy and your right to own a gun in this country. We are going to \nhave some form of gun registration system. We were told this is \nhappening, just accept it, just deal with it, there is nothing you can \ndo about it. A few people in Congress disagreed with that conclusion. A \nfew people in Congress resisted, and we stopped it.\n  Only a few weeks ago it was regarded as an indisputable truth that we \nwere going to get involved in some kind of military strife in Syria. A \nswelling group of lawmakers from both Houses in both political parties \nstarted expressing reservations with that idea. Before long people \nstopped saying resisting that effort was impossible. After a while, \nthey stopped saying it was improbable, and after a while movement to \nresist getting the United States involved in military action in Syria \nbecame absolutely unstoppable.\n  In one way or another, I believe the effort to stop ObamaCare might \nbear some resemblance to this. It might operate under a somewhat \ndifferent timeframe. Initially, people said the effort\n\n[[Page S6777]]\n\nto stop this law was one that was impossible.\n  I think we are reaching the point at which it is being described by \nmany as improbable. In time, as more and more Americans join this \ncause, as more and more Americans reach out to their Senators and their \nCongressmen, this effort will become absolutely unstoppable.\n  Because the American people love freedom, the American people were \nborn to live free. The sons and daughters of America have freedom as \ntheir birthright, and they don't take particularly well to \nmicromanagement from a large, distant, national government--one that is \nslow to respond to the needs of the people, one that often approaches \nthe people with something that does not exactly resemble deep sympathy \nor compassion, because this is not what large national governments are \nall about.\n  A large national government can do certain things well. It can do \ncertain things no one else can do well. But it can't be all things to \nall people, least of all physician and general caretaker to all. When \nwe try to do all things, we often cause far more problems than we \nresolve.\n  So in this circumstance, we have to remember the lesson we learned \nfrom the thermostat, the lesson I learned while working at the Supreme \nCourt; that sometimes if you have a broken thermostat, what you do \nmight actually be having the opposite effect of what you are trying to \ndo. What you are trying to do might actually make matters worse if your \nthermostat's broken, if it is installed backward.\n  We also have to remember that sometimes when you get into a position \nwhere you are causing harm or you could cause more harm unless you \nchange direction, that you sometimes just have to reverse. This, I \nbelieve, is one of those times.\n  To reframe all of this, we are here at nearly 2 in the morning on an \notherwise perfectly good Tuesday night. I guess now it is Wednesday \nmorning. We are here because we feel strongly about how best to proceed \nwith a funding mechanism passed by the House of Representatives. The \nHouse of Representatives last week responded to a call from the \nAmerican people--a call to do something very important, a call to keep \nthe Federal Government funded and operating but to do so while \ndefunding ObamaCare. Once that was passed by the House, once that \nstarted making its way over to the Senate, we in the Senate were faced \nwith several alternatives.\n  I believe there are two very good alternatives to addressing that. \nOne is to vote on the House-passed continuing resolution that funds \ngovernment but defunds ObamaCare on an up-or-down basis, either pass it \nor don't pass it, but pass it or don't pass it in as-is condition based \non how it was passed by the House.\n  That is one good option. Another option would be to subject that same \nHouse-passed continuing resolution that funds government but defunds \nObamaCare to an open amendment process, a process by which Senators, \nboth Republicans and Democrats, may propose alterations to that \ncontinuing resolution as they deem fit. This would require us to \ndebate, discuss, and vote on a number of amendments.\n  Either of these alternatives would be equally acceptable. I can see \narguments for either one of them. But what is not acceptable is for the \nSenate majority leader to do as he is expected to do by many, which is \nto say we will have one amendment and one amendment only to the House-\npassed continuing resolution and that amendment will be one to gut the \ncontinuing resolution of a provision that was the ``without which not'' \nmeasure of the entire bill to gut the defunding language.\n  At the same time, the majority leader is expected widely to fill the \ntree, meaning to say no other amendments will be allowed. This is it. \nThere is no more. If he is going to do that, he is not going to have my \nhelp doing it, and because he is not going to have my help doing it, \nthat means I must vote no on cloture on the bill.\n  In other words, Harry Reid is expected to ask his Members, and is \nexpected to be followed by the 53 other Members in his caucus, for a \ntotal of 54 Democrats who will vote yes when it comes to cloture on \nthis bill, who will vote yes knowing full well Harry Reid and the 53 \nDemocrats who follow him, for a combined total of 54, will vote on \ncloture on this bill. This doesn't mean they are in support of the \nHouse-passed resolution as adopted by the House, funding government but \ndefunding ObamaCare. Quite to the contrary, this means they are in \nfavor of gutting it, of severing, of cutting out its most important \nsingle provision.\n  If Harry Reid and the 53 Democrats who follow him want to do that, \nthat is their prerogative. As a Republican who was elected to combat \nObamaCare, to try to stop it, I will not be voting for cloture on the \nbill for that very reason. That could change, of course, if Harry Reid \ndecides to bring up this continuing resolution for a vote as is, on its \nown merits, as it was written or, alternatively, if Harry Reid decides \nto bring up the House-passed continuing resolution under an open \namendment process, allowing Senators to propose, debate, discuss and, \nultimately, vote on amendments.\n  But what is not acceptable is for him to allow one and only one \namendment, one gutting the continuing resolution of its most important \nprovision. With him doing that, the Democrats can oppose this if they \nwant. I will not be joining them, and I don't believe they need \nRepublican help if that is what they want to do. If they do want \nRepublicans to vote with them, I will not be among them. My job is not \nto make it easier for them to gut the House-passed resolution.\n  I stand with the House of Representatives. I stand behind Speaker \nBoehner and the Republicans who assisted him in getting this passed. I \nwant to get this passed. I would like to pass it as is. If we can't \npass it as is, on a single as-is vote, I want to see us with an open \namendment process. The Senate majority leader is proposing neither.\n  So I ask Senator Cruz: How does the Senator see this, how could one \npossibly see a ``yes'' vote on cloture on the bill, under the \ncircumstances I have described, as a vote in favor of the House-passed \ncontinuing resolution that funds government while defunding ObamaCare?\n  Mr. CRUZ. It is a very good question the Senator from Utah poses, and \nI would note there is only one way; that is, if you are trying to \nconfuse and deceive your constituents. There is no intellectually \nhonest way to do it.\n  If you ask any rational person: If the Republicans vote along with \nHarry Reid and 53 Senate Democrats to allow Harry Reid and 53 Senate \nDemocrats to fund ObamaCare, have they stood for defunding ObamaCare? \nOf course not. It is not a difficult question. It is not complicated.\n  Those who want to confuse their constituents want complication. Those \nwho have, at least initially, stated they intend to vote to allow Harry \nReid and the Democrats to fund ObamaCare are at the same time--often \nwithin hours of those statements--telling their constituents: I am \nleading the fight to defund ObamaCare, you can't have it both ways. You \ncannot have it both ways. You are either willing to stand for your \nprinciples and not just on an empty show.\n  There was an exchange earlier with the Senator from Illinois where he \nwas saying he wasn't surprised by the House vote. He was certain of \nthose votes because they had voted 40-some-odd times to defund \nObamaCare. But there was a big difference in this Friday vote, a big \ndifference in why the commentators in DC, the pundits, and all of the \nlearned gray beards said this one wouldn't happen. The other 40-some-\nodd times were symbolic votes. They never had a chance to pass it into \nlaw.\n  It is not difficult to get Republicans to vote in symbolic votes \nagainst ObamaCare. Indeed, in this body I have introduced two \namendments this year that at the time, when there were 45 Republicans \nin this body, all 45 Republicans voted against it. We are going to have \nanother vote. If Majority Leader Reid is successful in shutting off \ndebate on funding ObamaCare, then all 46 Republicans will have to vote \nagainst it, and they will tell people: Hey, I voted against him, when \nit didn't matter. They will leave out the ``when it didn't matter'' \npart. They will leave out that I voted to allow Harry Reid to do that, \nbut then once the matter was decided, I cast a vote against it to \nconfuse my constituents.\n  We wonder why Americans are cynical about politics. They are cynical\n\n[[Page S6778]]\n\nabout politics because too many leaders in this body, too many \nDemocrats and too many Republicans are not listening to the American \npeople.\n  Let me read statements from a number of think tank leaders across the \ncountry.\n  Matthew J. Brouillette from the Commonwealth Foundation in \nPennsylvania.\n\n       Giving more citizens health insurance is not the same as \n     giving them health care. The tragic outcome is that ObamaCare \n     will harm the very Pennsylvanians it purports to help.\n\n  Francis X. De Luca from the Civitas Institute of North Carolina.\n\n       ObamaCare is about neither health nor care. It is about \n     forcing Americans to buy a service they may neither need nor \n     want. In the end, it will reduce the availability of health \n     services for citizens while making those available more \n     costly.\n\n  That sounds like a great option: Fewer choices than the ones you have \nand more expensive. No wonder James Hoffa, head of the Teamsters, calls \nObamaCare a nightmare. No wonder so many Americans are suffering and \nasking for Congress to listen to their pleas to give them the same \nexemption President Obama has already given huge corporations and \nMembers of Congress.\n  Connor Boyack from the Libertas Institute in Utah:\n\n       The Affordable Care Act is unfair, invasive and an \n     illegitimate burden on taxpayers. In attempting to remedy \n     certain health care problems, it follows the historical \n     pattern of government intervention and creates even more of \n     them.\n\n  Ellen Weaver from the Palmetto Policy Forum in South Carolina.\n\n       South Carolinians are already starting to feel the front \n     end of the shockwave as several local employers cut work \n     schedules to part time. And we are left to imagine the \n     ultimate decimation on the budgets of Palmetto State families \n     as personal rates skyrocket and people are forced off their \n     current insurance that we were promised we would be able to \n     keep. In fact, just last week, Palmetto Policy Forum's \n     president received a letter telling her she would be losing \n     her private policy. And this is just the beginning of the \n     promised ``trainwreck.''\n\n  Sally Pipes from the Pacific Research Institute in California.\n\n       Unless ObamaCare is repealed and replaced, America will be \n     on the ``road to serfdom'' and there will be no off-ramp. We \n     will be headed for a single-payer, Medicare for all system \n     such as exists in Canada. Americans will face long waiting \n     lists for care, rationed care, and a lack of access to the \n     latest treatments and procedures. Where will the best doctors \n     and we as patients go to get first-rate care?\n\n  Interestingly enough, the majority leader of the Senate, Harry Reid, \nagrees with Ms. Pipes. Both Sally Pipes and Majority Leader Reid say \nthe end result of ObamaCare is--and indeed is designed to be--single-\npayer, government socialized health care. The only difference is that \nMajority Leader Reid thinks that is a good idea and Sally Pipes and the \nAmerican people think that is a terrible idea. Because we don't want \nour care rationed, we don't want government bureaucrats deciding who \ngets health care when, we don't want waiting periods, and we don't want \nlow-quality health care, which is what happens at the end of this road \nif we continue down it.\n  Justin Owen, the Beacon Center of Tennessee.\n\n       ObamaCare presents the most dangerous threat to \n     Tennesseans' jobs and health security than anything coming \n     out of Washington. And that says a lot these days.\n\n  Paul Gessing of the Rio Grande Foundation, New Mexico.\n\n       ObamaCare locks in the worst aspects of American health \n     care. Rather than restoring the patient-doctor relationship, \n     it puts the IRS and the Federal Government alongside \n     insurance companies between patients and their doctors.\n\n  Matt Mayer, Opportunity, OH.\n\n       ObamaCare is distorting insurance markets, forcing Ohioans \n     to make changes they do not want to make and expanding one of \n     the least effective and most costly government programs in \n     U.S. history.\n\n  Mike Stenhouse from the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and \nProsperity.\n\n       In Rhode Island, not only will up to 75 percent of those \n     currently uninsured remain uninsured after ObamaCare is \n     implemented, but our State has still not determined how to \n     pay for its wasteful exchange after the Federal subsidies \n     end.\n\n  Scott Moody from the Maine Heritage Policy Center observed:\n\n       The Maine Heritage Policy Center has profiled several Maine \n     businesses employing hundreds of Mainers that simply can't \n     afford to absorb the increased costs under ObamaCare. In \n     fact, in one case the higher ObamaCare costs will consume \n     anywhere from 54 percent to 134 percent of the company's \n     profits.\n       This burden could ultimately put this company out of \n     business, which would not only mean no health insurance for \n     their employees, but it would also mean no jobs either.\n\n  Doesn't that describe the nightmare James Hoffa of the Teamsters was \ntalking about--employees losing their jobs, employees being forced into \npart-time work and losing their health insurance all at the same time? \nNo wonder the unions are speaking out or remaining silent no longer.\n  How long will it be until we see Democratic Senators who have the \ncourage of James Hoffa to remain silent no longer and to speak out for \nthe men and women of America who are losing their jobs, who are being \nforced into part-time work and are losing their health insurance? How \nlong will it be before all 46 Republicans do more than give speeches \nagainst ObamaCare and actually stand and fight this fight, stop saying \nwe can't win it and actually stand up and start to win it?\n  Paul Mero from the Sutherland Institute in Utah:\n\n       The ACA is a hallucinogen for its recipients and defenders \n     in the search for prudent ways to address the medical needs \n     of our uninsured. A true Utah solution will rely on our \n     people, not the federal government.\n\n  Mike Thompson from the Thomas Jefferson Institute in Virginia:\n\n       It looks as if those on the low end of the income scale \n     will be harmed as part time employees will see their hours \n     cut and full time employees moved to part time. Small \n     businesses, the engine of job creation, are seeing their \n     health care costs rising forcing them to employ fewer people \n     than they would otherwise.\n\n  Wayne Hoffman of the Idaho Freedom Foundation:\n\n       Obamacare is destroying the quality of health care in \n     Idaho. The onslaught of new regulations and the fear of what \n     might come next from Washington is not only raising costs, it \n     has prompted countless Idaho doctors to give up medicine or \n     join large hospital or group medical practices. As a result, \n     the close knit doctor-patient relationships that have endured \n     in many of our communities have vanished entirely.\n\n  Do you like your doctor? Do you like continuing to see your doctor? \nWith ObamaCare, that relationship is in jeopardy. Why do you think so \nmany Americans are unhappy with this law?\n  Janie White of the Wyoming Policy Institute:\n\n       ObamaCare is closing businesses in the small populated \n     state of Wyoming. Full-time is going to part-time and in a \n     state where small business is prevalent, it's hurting an \n     entire state; not just one industry.\n\n  Dave Trabert of the Kansas Policy Institute:\n\n       Scholars at Kansas Policy Institute estimate that Medicaid \n     is expected to consume 31% of Kansas' General Fund Budget by \n     2023 under Obamacare and its proposed Medicaid expansion. The \n     ``woodwork effect'' of Obamacare alone is expected to cause \n     over $4 billion in tax increases or spending reductions for \n     other government services in just the first ten years of \n     Obamacare.\n\n  Gary Palmer of the Alabama Policy Institute:\n\n       Because of the Budget Control Act, which the Republicans \n     passed in 2011, spending reductions for the next fiscal year \n     are already set in place by law and will require \n     approximately $1.3 trillion in discretionary cuts over the \n     next eight years. These cuts can either be done through \n     another round of sequestration in which the Obama \n     Administration will determine what is cut, or it will be done \n     proactively by defunding ObamaCare which, according to the \n     latest Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimate, will cost \n     $1.85 trillion over the next 11 years. Keep in mind that in \n     2010 the CBO estimated that Obamacare would only cost $898 \n     billion for the first 10 years. With the U.S. already facing \n     a $16 trillion debt and continuing to run a trillion dollar \n     annual deficit, and with all the uncertainty surrounding what \n     Obamacare will actually cost, defunding Obamacare would be an \n     act of fiscal responsibility as intended by the passage of \n     the Budget Control Act.\n\n  Carl Graham from the Montana Policy Institute:\n\n       Obamacare has already resulted in the consolidation and \n     centralization of the health care industry in Montana, \n     removing choices and competition, especially in the state's \n     rural areas.\n\n  Andy Matthews of the Nevada Policy Research Institute:\n\n       At a time when Nevada is already suffering under the \n     highest unemployment rate in the nation, the so-called \n     Affordable Care Act now threatens to do even more damage to \n     the Silver State's jobs picture. Every day I hear from \n     frustrated business owners who would like nothing more than \n     to hire new employees but can't because of the many barriers \n     to hiring that this law has created.\n\n\n[[Page S6779]]\n\n\n  Trent England of the Freedom Foundation in Washington State:\n\n       Washington State's Freedom Foundation reports some small \n     businesses are already being told their health insurance \n     rates will double, punishing some of the state's hardest \n     working people, hurting job creation, and stifling economic \n     growth.\n\n  Robert Alt from the Buckeye Institute for Public Policy Solutions in \nOhio:\n\n       So far, Obamacare has been a game of drawing straws: a good \n     deal for the IRS and others who have the ability to secure \n     exemptions for themselves: Congress, a motley group of \n     companies with connections, some unions, and friends of the \n     Obama administration; and the short straws being won by \n     average Americans, medical professionals, small businesses, \n     the overwhelming majority of seniors who are happy with their \n     current plans, and our children and grandchildren. The \n     results of this rigged game are an invasion of privacy, \n     increase in healthcare and insurance costs, loss of freedom, \n     distortion of the free market, and a host of changes \n     Americans never hoped for.\n\n  Jim Stergios of the Pioneer Institute in Massachusetts:\n\n       The ACA will slow the future of innovation in \n     Massachusetts, especially in the medical device field, which \n     faces hundreds of millions of dollars in new taxes. In \n     addition, the so-called ``cadillac-tax'' that will burden \n     many Massachusetts Chevy drivers: Over half of the citizens \n     of the state by 2018, including union members, and hundreds \n     of thousands of the middle-class.\n\n  Kim Crockett from the Center for the American Experiment in \nMinnesota:\n\n       Minnesota has one of the finest health care systems in the \n     world. It is unfortunate that Gov. Mark Dayton has whole-\n     heartedly embraced the incursion of federal authority in our \n     state. The ACA is anything but affordable and threatens the \n     delivery of quality care to all but the most financially \n     secure Minnesotans. The gross misallocation of local, state \n     and federal resources could instead have been used to improve \n     health care. Instead we are bureaucratizing it. We continue \n     to advocate for portable, patient-owned defined contribution \n     plan as an alternative to one-size-fits-all health care.\n\n  Jim Vokal of the Platt Institute of Nebraska:\n\n       At the expense of middle class, every day Nebraskans, \n     Obamacare's implementation will cause undue hardship on the \n     families and the younger generation all across the state. \n     Governmental intervention rather than personal choice is not \n     the Nebraska way.\n\n  Ashley Landess from the South Carolina Policy Council:\n\n       SC business owners are forced to close their doors and sell \n     off family businesses, not only b/c they can't afford the \n     mandate but because they can't even predict the cost--and \n     neither can anyone else.\n\n  Brett Healy from the John K. MacIver Institute for Public Policy of \nWisconsin:\n\n       Before Obamacare, Wisconsin had one of the better health \n     insurance markets in the country that covered the vast \n     majority of our citizens. Now, under Obamacare, Wisconsinites \n     will see insurance premiums increase on average 51% and in \n     many parts of the Badger State, we will have only one company \n     to choose from and no consumer choice. In Wisconsin, the \n     Affordable Care Act is proving to be not affordable at all \n     and the uncertainty surrounding its implementation is \n     weighing on our employers and holding back our economic \n     recovery. Wisconsinites deserve better.\n\n  J. Robert McClure, III, from the James Madison Institute in Florida:\n\n       In Florida, where tourism and seasonal hiring are a way of \n     life, small businesses and large ones are confused and \n     frustrated as to how to move forward. Arbitrary delays and \n     enforcement by the federal government of this invasive and \n     unwieldy law have created a climate of paralysis in Florida \n     when it comes to job creation and planning. In a state of \n     roughly 19 million people, where the economic climate is \n     poised in every way to take off, no organization be it in \n     business, education, healthcare or government knows how to \n     proceed. The Affordable Care Act has only created stagnation \n     and insecurity in Florida--with a hefty price tag to come, \n     paid for on the backs of every taxpayer in the state.\n\n  State representative Geanie Morrison from the Texas Conservative \nCoalition:\n\n       The so-called Affordable Care Act is not even fully \n     implemented, and is already costing jobs, leading to costly \n     increases in insurance premiums, and promising billions of \n     dollars in new taxes. Texans should not have to shoulder the \n     cost of Obamacare, which is why we implore our Texas \n     delegation to defund this unpopular, unworkable, and \n     unaffordable law.\n\n  And Finally, Jim Waters of the Bluegrass Institute of Kentucky:\n\n       Obamacare will devastate Kentucky's already-struggling \n     economy. We already have entire areas where expectant mothers \n     in rural areas must drive two hours to see an ob/gyn. But \n     there will be nowhere that any Kentucky family or small-\n     business owner can go to hide from the increased costs and \n     destruction of our personal liberties resulting from this \n     policy of redistribution.\n\n  That list of quotes spans the country. It wasn't just one region. It \nwasn't just Republican States. It wasn't just Democratic States. Those \nare quotes from think tanks in North Carolina, Utah, South Carolina, \nCalifornia, Tennessee, New Mexico, Ohio, Rhode Island, Maine, Utah, \nVirginia, Idaho, Wyoming, Kansas, Alabama, Montana, Washington State, \nMassachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Carolina, Wisconsin, Florida, \nand in the State of Kentucky.\n  Let me ask everyone watching: Have the Senators from each of those \nStates come out and said they will defund ObamaCare? Have the \nDemocratic Senators from each of those States said: I have listened to \nmy constituents, I have listened to the people who are losing their \njobs, who are being pushed into part-time work, who are seeing health \ninsurance premiums skyrocket or losing their health insurance. Have the \nDemocratic Senators representing those States said that?\n  And have the Republicans representing those States said, we will \nstand together, and Republicans will be united against cloture on this \nbill because we are not going to vote to allow Harry Reid and the \nDemocrats to fund ObamaCare, to gut the House Republican bill? And if \nthey haven't, it is a reasonable question to ask why. Why aren't \nelected officials listening to the people? We need to together make \nD.C. listen.\n  Mr. LEE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEE. I have two sons and a daughter. My two sons are twins. They \nare teenagers. They are good boys. They are both 4.0 students, and I \ncouldn't be more pleased with them. They work hard.\n  I had an experience with them about 1\\1/2\\ years ago that comes to \nmind. I was driving down the street with them in my car one day. We \nwere listening to the radio, as I often do with them. We were listening \nto a popular song familiar to all three of us, a song we had heard on \nmany, many occasions.\n  On this particular occasion I started noticing the lyrics more than I \nhad on previous occasions in the past. All of a sudden, for whatever \nreason, I noticed that these were not good lyrics. These were not \nwholesome lyrics. These were not lyrics that any God-fearing father of \nteenaged boys would necessarily want his sons listening to. All of a \nsudden I pointed out to my twin sons, turning down the radio, These \nwere terrible lyrics, and I asked them: Have you ever really listened \nto the words of this song? Do we like the message that is in this song?\n  My son John didn't miss a beat. Without hesitating, without batting \nan eye, John looked right at me and said, Dad, it is not bad if you \ndon't think about it. I immediately thought it was funny that was his \nresponse. This was teenage reasoning at its very best. It is not just \nteenage reasoning. It is the way a lot of us think about things by \nsaying certain things aren't bad if you don't think about them.\n  In many respects, that is reflective of what we face in our country \ntoday. A $17 trillion debt growing at a rate approaching $1 trillion a \nyear isn't bad if you don't think about it. Having a 2,700-page health \ncare law with 20,000 pages of implementing legislation isn't bad if you \ndon't think about it; having between $1.75 trillion and $2 trillion a \nyear in existing Federal regulatory compliance costs is not bad, if you \ndon't think about it; having the world's highest corporate tax rate, at \nleast the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world, isn't bad \nif you don't think about it. A lot of these problems we face are not \nbad, but only if you don't think about them.\n\n  The problem is in the Senate it is our job to think about these \nproblems. It is our job to think about the fact that we have on the \nbooks a law called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that \nwill make a lot of things worse for a lot of people, a law that will \nhave an effect not consistent with the lofty sounding title of that \nlaw, an effect that will actually result, in many instances, in health \ncare that is both unfair and less affordable.\n  We have to think about what our responsibilities are. We have to \nthink\n\n[[Page S6780]]\n\nevery single day about how this is going to affect the American people. \nWe have to be willing to say we are not going to allow certain things \nto persist, things that would harm the American people, and that means \nwe have to listen to the American people when they cry out for help.\n  They have cried out for help in recent weeks as they have asked \nCongress again and again to defund ObamaCare, as they have asked \nCongress to keep government funded. They don't want a shutdown. We \ndon't want a shutdown. I know I don't want a shutdown. I don't think \nSenator Cruz wants a shutdown. In fact, I don't think I know any Member \nof Congress of either House or either political party representing any \nof our country's 50 States who wants a shutdown.\n  What we want is to keep government funded. What the American people \nwant is for us to fund government while defunding ObamaCare. That is \nprecisely what the House of Representatives has done. I salute the \nHouse of Representatives. The House of Representatives, the Republican \nleadership, has been thinking about it. They have been thinking about \nthis law and the many problems it threatens to create for our Nation's \n300 million-plus people.\n  We have to think about the fact that every time we make a law we are \nexpanding the reach of this government. We have to think about the fact \nthat we became an independent nation, a nation that flies its own flag \nrather than the Union Jack, a nation that pays tribute to the \nsovereignty of the people rather than to the supposed sovereignty of a \nmonarch. A couple of centuries ago this was not just an act of \nrejection of the idea of having a monarch, this was not just a \nrejection of the Union Jack, this was not just a statement to the \neffect that we did not want to sing ``God Save the King'' or ``God Save \nthe Queen.'' We became our own Republic at least in part because we \nwere subject then to a large distant national government, a large \ndistant national government that was so far from the people that it was \nsometimes slow to respond to the needs of the people, and that national \ngovernment based not in Washington, DC, because Washington, DC, did not \nexist then. What is now Washington DC was then part of the colony of \nMaryland.\n  Our national capital, based in London, taxed the people too much. It \nregulated the people too aggressively, too oppressively. When the \npeople called out for help, that government was slow to respond to \ntheir needs--in part because it was so far from them, so distant from \nthem. It was not just distant from them in terms of measurement, in \nterms of geography, but also distant from them in that its interests \nwere somewhat detached from those of the American people.\n  Ultimately we became our own country. Ultimately we declared our \nindependence, we fought for it, we won our independence. Instinctively, \nreflexively, quite understandably we established a national government \nbecause we knew we would need one. We knew that each of these Thirteen \nColonies could not exist independently as a freestanding Republic. We \nknew we would need a national government to provide for those basic \nthings that a national government generally must provide.\n  We knew that national governments, at least our national government \nin this circumstance, would need to be in charge of a few basic things \nsuch as national defense. Yet we feared what national governments could \ndo because we know that when governments become big there is a greater \nrisk toward tyranny--even if it is a type of tyranny that exists only \nby degrees. We knew that the risk of this kind of tyranny--some might \ncall it soft or incremental tyranny--exists even in republics, even \nwhen democratic forces are at play. We knew this type of risk of soft \ntyranny, as some would describe it, is greatest within national \ngovernments.\n  The bigger the nation, the more powerful the government and the fewer \nthe restrictions on that government, the greater the risk that the \nrights of the people will be undermined; the greater the risk the \npeople of that great nation will become subjects rather than \nsovereigns--which of course they should always be.\n  So for that very purpose we put in place a very limited-purpose \nnational government, originally under the Articles of Confederation. We \nput together a weak national government. It was so weak in fact it was \nineffective. It was not able to do the things our basic national \ngovernment needed to do. Congress, under the Articles of Confederation, \nhad some powers but they proved to be not enough. It had no power of \nraising revenue independently of the States. It had no power of \nregulating commerce or trade between the States and with foreign \ncountries. So after a period of just a few years under the Articles of \nConfederation, our Founding Fathers came together in that hot, fateful \nsummer of 1787 in Philadelphia and they put together a compromise \ndocument. They said we need a national government that is at once \nstrong enough to be able to do what a National Government must be able \nto do in order to protect us so we can be a nation. Yet we also need \nthose powers to be sufficiently limited that the risk of tyranny, even \nincremental tyranny or tyranny by degrees, will be kept to a minimum.\n  So our Founding Fathers wisely came up with a list, a list of powers \nthat we knew the national government would need powers that we knew \nneeded to be exercised at the national level. Those powers, the vast \nmajority of which are found in one part of the Constitution--often \noverlooked but perhaps the single most important portion of the \nConstitution, at least for our purposes here--the part of the \nConstitution we have to look to more frequently here, article I, \nsection 8.\n  Article I, section 8, has 18 clauses and goes through the basic \npowers of Congress. Congress, of course, has the power to tax and the \npower to spend within the powers authorized by the Constitution. \nCongress has the power to regulate trade--referred to in the \nConstitution as commerce--among the States, with foreign nations and \namong the Indian tribes. Congress has the power to coin money and \nregulate the value thereof; develop the uniform set of laws governing \nnaturalization or what we would today call immigration; the power to \nprovide for our national defense; to declare war; the power to come up \nwith a system of laws dealing with bankruptcy; to establish a uniform \nsystem of weights and measures; to establish postal roads. There are a \nfew other powers, but this is the basic gist of them.\n  Then there is my favorite power, the power to grant Letters of Marque \nand Reprisal, a power that we too often fail to recognize, a power I \nwish we would get to debate and discuss longer and more frequently in \nthe Senate. A Letter of Marque and Reprisal was effectively a hall pass \nissued by the U.S. Congress in the name of the U.S. Government that \nentitles the bearer of that hall pass to be a pirate on the high seas. \nRegardless of how long I might serve in the Senate, I hope one day to \nbe granted a Letter of Marque and Reprisal so I can become a pirate as \nI longed to be as a child. You are all invited to join me when I get \nthat Letter of Marque and Reprisal.\n  The point is the powers of Congress are limited. These are powers \nthat James Madison cited in defending the Constitution against people \nwho questioned him, against those who feared this Constitution might \ngive rise to a general purpose national government, one empowered with \nso many powers that it could become a tyrant. He tried to set at ease \nthe concerns of the people in Federalist 45 when he said:\n\n       The powers that would be granted to the newly established \n     federal government upon ratification of the Constitution are \n     few and defined while those reserved to the States are \n     numerous and indefinite.\n\n  He was right and he was persuasive. Upon the advice of James Madison \nand others, the States ratified the Constitution. They did so with that \nvery understanding, that this body, the legislative body created by the \nConstitution, the U.S. Congress, consisting of a Senate and a House of \nRepresentatives, would possess legislative powers that were not so \nbroad as to encompass all the day-to-day interactions of human beings. \nWe would not possess what people refer to as general police powers. We \ndo not have the power to make whatever law we think is a good idea. A \ngood idea is not nearly enough. We have to find something in the \nConstitution that puts us in charge of legislating within that area to \npromote that good idea. We have to find something in the Constitution \nthat gives us the power to do it.\n\n[[Page S6781]]\n\n  During the first 100, maybe 150 years of our Republic as it operated \nunder the Constitution, we followed pretty closely this document, what \nsome describe as the enumerated powers doctrine. Sure, there were \narguments from time to time over this or that legislative proposal. \nThere were arguments that arose, for example, over whether we should \nhave a national bank.\n  You had debates among and between the political branches of \ngovernment, meaning Congress and the Presidency, that often centered on \nthe principles of the Constitution. It was very common to have \nconstitutional concerns brought up on the floor of this body or on the \nfloor of the House of Representatives as a basis for halting serious \nconsideration of a legislative proposal on grounds that it simply was \nnot within Congress's power to enact.\n  It was not necessarily considered acceptable to say let's let another \nbranch of government think about it. Let's let the Supreme Court iron \nit out. Let's let the Supreme Court decide whether it is \nconstitutional. Within the political branches of government, frequently \nproposals were stopped on grounds that they were unconstitutional.\n  Fast forward 130, 140, 150 years, and things started to change. The \nSupreme Court, early in the administration of President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt, pushed back on a lot of FDR's more aggressive attempts to \nexpand the reach, the size, the scope, the cost of the Federal \nGovernment. It resisted those and said: Look, regardless of what the \npolicy merits might be of this Federal program or that one, we still \nhave a limited purpose as the Federal Government and not an all-purpose \nnational government. That limited purpose--the national government--has \nto find something in the Constitution each time it legislates. If it \nfails to do that, then no matter how good of an idea it is, it can't \nfly.\n\n  By the end of F.D.R.'s Presidency, the Court changed course. There \nare a number of reasons for this, but the prevailing theory is that the \nSupreme Court got scared. It got scared as a result of F.D.R.'s Court-\npacking plan.\n  In 1935, the Supreme Court moved into its new building across the \nstreet, the shining marble palace we see just outside the door to the \nSenate. The Justices liked their new white marble palace. They enjoyed \nit. They didn't want F.D.R., or any other President, raining on their \nparade by packing the Court and fundamentally altering the nature of \nthe Court's composition. So for that reason, many theorized, the Court \nchanged its position. The Court stopped resisting F.D.R.'s attempts at \nexpanding the Federal Government's power.\n  People trace the change in jurisprudence to a number of different \nmoments. I think one of the pivotal moments occurred in 1937 when the \nSupreme Court of the United States decided a case called the NLRB v. \nJones & Laughlin Steel Company. In that case, the Supreme Court adopted \nan early version of what has become its modern common clause \njurisprudence. The Supreme Court started concluding that where there is \nan activity that is commercial or economic in nature, Congress may \nregulate that activity so long as there is a substantial connection \nbetween that activity and interstate commerce. It was in that case that \nthe Supreme Court, for the first time, smiled upon Federal regulation \nof what were previous to that time considered local activities, such as \nlabor, manufacturing, agriculture, and mining.\n  That is not to say those things should not be regulated by any \ngovernment anywhere. It is not to say the Supreme Court--prior to NLRB \nv. Jones & Laughlin Steel--ever suggested otherwise, but it is to \nsuggest that prior to that case regulation of local activities, such as \nlabor, manufacturing, agriculture, and mining were considered more \nappropriate for State and local governments and not for our national \ngovernment. Within the next 5 years, the Supreme Court solidified its \nposition on the commerce clause, and in many respects it allowed its \npower to reach a high watermark in the 1942 case of Wickard v. Filburn.\n  Let's talk about that case for just a minute because I think it bears \non what we are talking about. That case involved a farmer by the name \nof Roscoe Filburn. He got in trouble with the law. You might be asking \nyourselves: What did farmer Roscoe Filburn do? What did he do to get in \ntrouble with the Feds? Was he a bank robber? No, he didn't rob a bank. \nWas he a drug dealer? No, he didn't do that. Was he a murderer or a \nkidnapper? No. You want to know what Roscoe Filburn did? He committed a \ngrave offense against the United States. He grew too much wheat. Yes, \nscary but true. Roscoe Filburn grew more wheat than Congress, in its \ninfinite wisdom, saw fit for any American to grow in any 1 single year.\n  By then Congress decided it needed to regulate every aspect of human \nexistence, if possible. It even had the wisdom and foresight necessary \nto direct the entire economy right down to how much wheat a particular \nfarmer could legally grow. Roscoe Filburn was fined many thousands of \ndollars for growing too much wheat. That was a lot of money in those \ndays.\n  Fortunately, Mr. Filburn had a good lawyer. Mr. Filburn was \ndetermined not to allow his life to be micromanaged by Federal \nofficials in Washington, DC. Mr. Filburn challenged the enforcement of \nthis law against him with a theory. He said: Look, the statute I have \nbeen accused of violating was enacted pursuant to the commerce clause \nof the U.S. Constitution, article I, section 8, clause 3. The commerce \nclause applies to interstate commerce or commerce for trade occurring \nbetween the States and not intrastate commerce--commerce within a \nState. Commerce which is within a particular State is not subject to \nCongress's authority and the commerce clause.\n  Roscoe Filburn argued--through his lawyer--that the wheat he grew in \nexcess of the national wheat production limit never entered interstate \ncommerce because it never entered commerce at all. Roscoe Filburn used \nthat wheat entirely on his farm. He used some of it to feed his \nanimals, some of it to feed his own family, and he reserved the balance \nof that grain to use as seed for the following season.\n  So on that basis, he said: Look, you can get after me for any reason \nyou want. You can get after me, if you want, for violating this wheat \nproduction limit, but the fact is this law can have no application here \nbecause this wheat never entered interstate commerce or any other form \nof commerce. It never left my farm.\n  Interestingly enough, the Supreme Court of the United States saw it \ndifferently. The Supreme Court of the United States found that even \nthat wheat that never left Roscoe Filburn's farm was subject to the \nlong arm of Congress and the long arm of the Federal Government. It was \nsubject to that same Federal power that James Madison once described as \nfew and defined. All of a sudden the supposedly few and defined powers \nwere broad enough somehow to extend to Roscoe Filburn's pernicious \nwheat.\n  The Supreme Court said, in essence, that this wheat, because it was \ngrown and used on Roscoe Filburn's farm in excess of the grain \nproduction limit imposed by Federal law, it was grain that Roscoe \nFilburn would have otherwise purchased but did not have to purchase on \nthe open market, a market that was distinctively interstate.\n  Because he grew it and used it on the farm and did not buy it \nsomewhere else, thus by growing too much wheat, Roscoe Filburn \nshamefully distorted and undermined the interstate market and wheat. He \nundermined it in the sense that it drove the price in a different \ndirection than Congress, in its infinite judgment, saw fit to direct \nthe economy. So the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the fine \nthat was assessed against Roscoe Filburn. The reasoning of the Supreme \nCourt employed in Wickard v. Filburn is a fascinating study in legal \nand verbal gymnastics. It is a fascinating study in the idea that \neverything affects everything else. They basically said that the wheat \nRoscoe Filburn grew on his farm affects the interstate wheat market in \nmuch the same way that butterflies flapping their wings in Brazil can \naffect weather patterns in North America.\n\n  We are somehow asked to have faith that this does, in fact, happen. I \nam told that climatologists can prove there is an impact by the \nbutterflies in South America on weather patterns in North America. I \ndon't know how, but you have to make a lot of inferences\n\n[[Page S6782]]\n\nbefore you get there. But as many inferences as has to be made with the \nbutterflies, I think there are even more inferences that have to be \ndrawn with respect to Roscoe Filburn's wheat.\n  I remember studying this case in my high school history class. I \nremember arguing with my history teacher about this. I remember my \nhistory teacher eventually telling me: Get over it, Mr. Lee. The \nFederal Government is big and powerful, and that is just the way things \nare. Yet I think we have a certain responsibility to look back through \nour history and to question from time to time the judgments of the \nSupreme Court of the United States, especially when those judgments \nenable the Congress to extend its power far beyond what Madison \ndescribed as few and defined powers.\n  In a sense, what we have done ever since Wickard v. Filburn is we \ncontinued to expand Federal authority beyond that. We have never fully \nretreated from that high watermark. What we have seen is a perpetually \nexpanding national government, one that is capable of imposing an \nestimated $2 trillion in Federal regulatory compliance costs alone, a \nFederal Government that imposes a couple of more trillion dollars in \ntaxes a year from the American people, and manages to spend between \n$3.5 and $4 trillion every single year. That is a very big government.\n  Since Wickard v. Filburn, there are only two instances in which the \nSupreme Court of the United States has invalidated an act of Congress \nas being beyond the scope of Congress's power under the commerce \nclause. Sometimes I almost add a third, but then I remember the Supreme \nCourt stopped short on that third.\n  The first two involved a case called the United States v. Lopez, \nwhich is a case from 1995 where the Supreme Court invalidated the Gun-\nFree School Zones Act prohibiting the bare possession of a handgun \nwithin a school zone. The Supreme Court concluded that the bare \npossession of a gun was not commercial activity at all. It was not \ninterstate commercial activity. It was not interstate commerce, and \nthey couldn't get to the point where they could conclude that this was \na valid subject of Congress's commerce clause authority.\n  The second case was decided in 2000. It was a case called the United \nStates v. Morrison in which the Supreme Court invalidated provisions of \nthe Violence Against Women Act, including that those provisions \nattempted to regulate acts of violence, however reprehensible, were \nthemselves neither interstate or commercial.\n  Then, of course, in 2012 the Supreme Court sort of invalidated the \npenalty provisions attached to the individual mandate in the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act. I say they sort of invalidated that \nprovision because the Supreme Court of the United States concluded that \nprovision, though enacted pursuant to the commerce clause, could not be \ndefended as a valid exercise of Congress's power under the commerce \nclause. To that extent, they concluded it was unconstitutional.\n  But then the Supreme Court went on somehow to conclude that this was \na valid exercise of Congress's power to impose taxes even though \nCongress had attempted unsuccessfully to pass this as a tax, even \nthough new taxes have to be introduced in the House of Representatives \nand passed into law by both Houses of Congress and signed into law by \nthe President, even though the Supreme Court of the United States has \nno authority to levy taxes, impose taxes or create taxes.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States created out of whole cloth a \nnew tax which it imposed on the American people. They imposed a middle-\nclass tax hike, which the Court has no power to impose. It has no power \nto levy taxes. Yet the Court did it anyway.\n  When I tell that story, I get asked all the time: How then did the \nCourt do it? If the Court has no power to do it, how did it do it? It \njust did. It just declared it to be so and the rest of us were expected \nto accept that and get over it and move on, just as I was told by my \nhigh school history teacher to accept, get over, and move on from \nWickard v. Filburn because the Federal Government is big and powerful \nand we can live with it. Well, we all just have to live with it but \nonly as long as the American people put up with it, only as long as the \nAmerican people are willing to accept it.\n\n  The American people have never been enthusiastic about ObamaCare--not \nfrom the beginning. Their satisfaction with this law has not improved \nover time, and it has not been enhanced. The American people don't \ndeserve to have to live under a law that imposes a massive middle-class \ntax hike on the American people, one that was not imposed by the \npeople's elected representatives in Congress but instead was imposed by \nfive of nine lawyers who wear black robes and sit in big fancy chairs \nin the building just across the street from us.\n  The American people deserve to live under a system where the laws are \nwritten by men and women of their own choosing, who serve in increments \nof 2 years in the case of Members of the House of Representatives and \nin increments of 6 years in the case of U.S. Senators.\n  Supreme Court Justices, of course, are smart men and women--every one \nof them. They are very intelligent, well-trained individuals. I am \nconvinced that each and every one of them loves this country and wants \nto serve it well. Yet the members of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates are not elected. They are not subject to election at regular \nintervals, and that is one of the many reasons we don't trust them with \nthe power to write law. It is one of the many reasons we don't trust \nthem with the power to impose taxes. They are there to decide cases and \ncontroversies based on the law and the facts before them.\n  In the case of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, they \nrewrote the law not just once but twice--once by transforming what was \nenacted as a penalty into a tax in order to save that law from an \notherwise certain doom, a doom necessitated by important constitutional \nlimitations; the second time when the Court concluded by an even wider \nmargin--7 to 2--that Congress had violated the Constitution by imposing \non the States a mandate to expand their Medicaid Programs without \ngiving them any reasonable alternative, any available alternative. The \nSupreme Court, again by a 5-to-4 margin, after 7 to 2--after the \nJustices, by a margin of 7 to 2, had found that this was \nunconstitutional, five of them--by a margin of 5 to 4--saved the \nprovisions simply by rewriting the law, by inserting into the law an \nexception in the law that the law did not provide.\n  I believe it may have been Shakespeare who originally penned the \nwords ``he will cheat without scruple who can without fear.'' I have \nalso heard it attributed to Benjamin Franklin. I am not sure which of \nthem was the originator of that quote, but I have heard it attributed \nto both. Regardless, there has to be a legal corollary to that. When \nSupreme Court Justices are able to make law, when Supreme Court \nJustices are able to impose taxes and no one calls them out on it, that \nis when the people have to live with that. That is when they get away \nwith it. That is when they are allowed to cheat the American people out \nof their right to have their laws made by men and women of their own \nchoosing, to have their taxes increased, if at all, only by men and \nwomen of their own choosing. This was wrong. This was a dastardly, \ncowardly act, one we can't simply ignore.\n  One of the things I found so offensive, so appalling, so disturbing, \nso distressing was the fact that in the wake of this decision, so many \npeople--many of them from my own political party--praised Chief Justice \nRoberts for his participation in this dastardly, inexcusable act of \nrewriting the Affordable Care Act not just once but twice in order to \nsave it. They praised him. Some of them said that this showed he was \nwilling to cross the aisle at the Supreme Court. Well, that is a \nproblem. There is no aisle in the Supreme Court of the United States. \nThey sit along a bench. At the center of the bench is the Chief \nJustice. There isn't an aisle. In fact, particularly once they have \nbeen appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, Supreme \nCourt Justices operate in a world in which partisan political \naffiliation has no meaning. This wasn't reaching across the aisle.\n  Some suggested that this was somehow a statesman-like act by the \nChief Justice, an act that revealed that he was willing to sort of \nbalance various\n\n[[Page S6783]]\n\ninterests, an act that some Republicans even were convinced was \ncarefully and wisely engineered to procure a Republican partisan \nvictory in the 2012 election cycle. That is absolutely nonsense, first \nof all. As a political matter, we saw that it turned out not to work at \nall. I don't necessarily think there is any validity to the theory that \nthat is what the Chief Justice was trying to bring about. If it was, \nthat would amount to an utter betrayal of his judicial oath. It would \nalso reveal him to be a really bad political tactician, but that is not \nthe Chief Justice's job. It is not the job of any justice or any \njurist. The job of any jurist is to decide each case before the court \nbased on the law and the facts of the particular case.\n\n  Some have suggested that this was designed to protect the enumerated \npowers doctrine or at least the idea that there is some limit to \nCongress's power under the commerce clause. I believe that is utter \nnonsense. This didn't do that. In fact, I think it blew a hole a mile \nwide in the enumerated powers doctrine because what this suggested is \nthat, OK, the Supreme Court is going to pay at least lipservice to the \nidea that the power of Congress is, in fact, limited. But if Congress \ncolors outside the lines, if Congress doesn't utter the magic words, if \nCongress really does something quite wrong in drafting such that its \npower can no longer be appropriately assigned, its power can no longer \nbe appropriately justified under the commerce clause, then all of a \nsudden the Supreme Court of the United States will find some other \nbasis in the Constitution upon which to rest this authority.\n  This is really disturbing because if the Supreme Court can do that \nand if the Supreme Court can do that even to raise taxes, then Congress \ncan pass all kinds of laws in theory purporting to be simply exercises \nof its regulatory power under the commerce clause and then rely on the \nSupreme Court of the United States to say: Yes, OK, this may not be a \nvalid exercise of Congress's power under the commerce clause, but we \nwill rewrite it as a tax. We will rewrite it as a tax and thereby \nuphold it, thereby stand behind it.\n  So we get back to the question--a question I get asked all the time \nby people around my State, by people across the country when they hear \nabout this decision. They ask: How can the Supreme Court of the United \nStates do this? How can the Supreme Court of the United States get away \nwith it?\n  Well, they can do it because they wear the black robes. They can do \nit because they have the printing press that prints out those decisions \nwith the fancy wording of the Supreme Court behind it. They can do it \nbecause the people still regard the decisions, the rulings of the \nSupreme Court of the United States as legitimate.\n  I do have to point out another aspect of this ruling. In the same \nruling in which the Supreme Court of the United States concluded that \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's individual mandate \nprovision was a valid exercise of the taxing power, the Supreme Court \nof the United States also said--with, by the way, the concurrence of \nChief Justice Roberts, who was the author of the majority opinion \nupholding it as a valid exercise of the taxing power--that same opinion \nauthored by the same Chief Justice concluded that this same provision \nwas not a tax for purposes of a law called the Anti-Injunction Act. Had \nthe Supreme Court of the United States not reached that conclusion, had \nit reached the same conclusion under the Anti-Injunction Act that it \nreached under the constitutional aspect of the challenge, and had the \nCourt concluded that this was, in fact, a tax and not a penalty, as it \ndid under the constitutional analysis, then the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States would have been without jurisdiction to hear the case \nbecause the Anti-Injunction Act said: If it is a tax, you can't review \nthe statute being challenged until after it has been enforced, which \nmeant that no legal, no judicial challenge could have been properly \nbrought, could have been countenanced by an article III court of the \nUnited States until, at the earliest, sometime in 2014, after \nenforcement of the individual mandate began.\n  So it was very odd that the Court, led by the same Chief Justice, \nconcluded at once that this was a tax for purposes of constitutional \nanalysis but that it was not a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction \nAct. Here again, how does the Court get away with that? It gets away \nwith it because we recognize the validity, the legitimacy of the \ndecision.\n  But the more people learn about this, the more they read about it, \nthe more they become upset. I have yet to explain this to a constituent \nwho isn't deeply disturbed by it. I have yet to explain this to anyone \nwho can really defend it on its own merits.\n  So we see that this was a law that was put in place quite improperly. \nIt was a law that was put in place not by an elected legislative body \nbut instead by a judiciary that, at least for purposes of this case, \ntransformed itself into a judicial oligarchy of sorts, a judicial \nlegislative body--one of the many reasons we need to defund the \nimplementation of this law. It was unconstitutional as written in two \nrespects and would have been invalidated but for the Supreme Court of \nthe United States rewriting it not just once but twice.\n  We have to ask ourselves these questions from time to time: Where do \nwe go with this? What do we do with it? That is where we get back to \nwhere we are now, where the House of Representatives boldly stood \nbehind the American people and decided to keep funding the government, \nfunding the operations of government while defunding ObamaCare. That \nbill, that continuing resolution is now moving over here. That \ncontinuing resolution is now before us.\n  Sometimes we have to ask ourselves these questions of what is it that \nwe are funding, why is it that we are funding it, and why is it that we \nshould continue to stand behind a law that is causing so much harm to \nthe American people--a law that was improperly brought into being in \nthe first place, a law that was improperly upheld and sustained, \nultimately rewritten by the Court, improperly, unconstitutionally \nrewritten by the President of the United States.\n  So I wish to ask Senator Cruz, does the Senator know how long the \nHundred Years War lasted?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Well, I thank my friend from Utah for his remarkable \ndiscourse on constitutional law.\n  As for the latest question he asked, one might think the Hundred \nYears War lasted 100 years, but think again.\n  It was 116 years.\n  Things are not always as they seem.\n  (Ms. BALDWIN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. LEE. Can the Senator tell me, where do Chinese gooseberries come \nfrom?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I yield for this question. Most would say China. But think \nagain. Chinese gooseberries actually come from New Zealand.\n  The way things are labeled are not always, in fact, what they are.\n  Mr. LEE. If the Senator will yield for another question.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I will yield for a question without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. LEE. Commercial airplanes, as far as I know, all airplanes in the \nUnited States, have within them something called a black box--a black \nbox that records the events of the cockpit. It also records critical \noperating data from the airplane so that in the event of an accident, \nthe data and the voice recordings can be reviewed to try to figure out \nwhat happened.\n  Does the Senator know what color the black box is?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I say to Senator Lee, I do. A lot of people would say it \nmust be black. If we were dealing with ordinary English language, it \nwould be black. But perhaps airplane manufacturers think like Congress \nbecause the black box on an airplane is orange.\n  Mr. LEE. There is something called a Panama hat. Can the Senator tell \nme what part of the world the Panama hat comes from?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I will yield for that question and note it could possibly \nbe Panama. You might think if you call it a Panama hat it would make \nsense that it would be Panama. But, no, think again. Ecuador. Ecuador \nmakes Panama hats. I do not know that anyone makes Ecuador hats.\n  Mr. LEE. The device known as a camel's hair brush, does the Senator \nknow what it is made of?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I yield for that question. Curiously enough, I do. You \nmight think a camel's hair brush must be made of camel's hair. There \nare lots of\n\n[[Page S6784]]\n\ncamels. They have hair. Surely you can make a brush. Well, maybe you \ncan. I do not know if you can. But a camel's hair brush is made of \nsquirrel fur. It makes you wonder. The squirrels apparently have a very \nbad marketing department if they give their fur that gets credited to \nthe camels.\n  Mr. LEE. What color is a purple finch?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Again, I will yield for the purpose of that question to \nnote a purple finch--listen, similar to most husbands, I have a color \npalate of about six colors. I remember once my wife asked me, with \nregard to a tile--we were redoing our bathroom. It was a white tile. \nShe was long distance. She said: What shade of white? I will note that \nwas a question I was utterly incapable of responding to. I was not \naware there were shades of white, and my vocabulary does not cover such \nthings. I finally dropped it in a FedEx envelope and simply sent it to \nher. I was like: It is a white tile. I know nothing beyond that.\n  But yet your question: What color is a purple finch? I would tend to \nthink it would be purple, but I would think wrong if that were the case \nbecause a purple finch is crimson red.\n  Mr. LEE. There is a chain of islands off the coast of Spain, a chain \nof islands known as the Canary Islands. Can the Senator tell me after \nwhat animal were these islands named?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I will yield for the purpose of that question as well. \nIndeed, I can tell you that. Now, you would think, if you call a chain \nof islands the Canary Islands, it must be a bird, maybe a bird in a \ncoal mine but some sort of bird. Think again. The Canary Islands are \nnamed after a dog. I would note, the Canary Islands are a chain of \nislands I have some real connection to because my grandfather, my \nfather's father, was born in the Canary Islands. Indeed, he moved to \nCuba when he was 1, was raised in Cuba. My father was born in Cuba, was \nraised in Cuba.\n  The lesson from all of these is striking. Labels do not always mean \nwhat they say. Some might wonder, what does this chain of insightful \nquestions from my friend, the junior Senator from Utah--how does it \nrelate to the issue of ObamaCare?\n  If we look at Senator Lee's tremendous discourse of the \nConstitution--and I would note, by the way, there is not another \nSenator in the Senate who could give that constitutional lecture that \nmy friend Senator Lee did, sharing with this body. I wish all 100 of us \nhad been here to hear that because a lot of Senators--all Senators \nwould be well served by learning or relearning those basic \nconstitutional principles.\n  Mr. LEE. But the question is, Would any of them be willing to listen \nto it or interested in it or would most of them consider it a form of \ntorture?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I yield for the purpose of that question as well--and they \nmight well.\n  One of the striking things--and although under the rules of the \nSenate I am not allowed to ask Senator Lee a question, I can pose a \nrhetorical question to the body, and should Senator Lee have thoughts \non that rhetorical question, he can choose to ask me a question that \nmight contain his thoughts on that rhetorical question posed to the \nbody.\n  So given that sort of convoluted reasoning, which may explain why we \nare in the Senate with the odd and precarious procedures that govern \nthis body, I am going to ask this rhetorical question to the body, \nwhich is, Senator Lee explained that the Supreme Court of the United \nStates upheld ObamaCare, after concluding it exceeded the commerce \nclause authority of Congress, by concluding that it was a tax. By \ncalling it a tax, it was able to force it into a different line of \njurisprudence and uphold it under the taxing clause, the taxing power \nof Congress.\n  I would ask rhetorically of this body, was it an accident that the \nObamaCare statute did not call the individual mandate a tax? Maybe it \nwas a scribe's error. Maybe it was they meant to call it a tax, they \nthought it was a tax, and a clerk writing just wrote the wrong word. So \ninstead of ``tax,'' the word ``penalty.'' Surely that is not \nconsequential. It must purely have been an accident. As a related \ncomponent of that, was it an accident that the President of the United \nStates went on national television and told the people of America, \nwhile this was under consideration, this is not a tax.\n\n  He affirmatively said this is not a tax.\n  Mind you, the argument that the U.S. Department of Justice made, the \nObama administration made to the Supreme Court was this is a tax, \nalthough the statute did not say it. The argument the Supreme Court \nultimately found persuasive was: This is a tax, although the statute \nsaid it was a penalty and not a tax.\n  The question I would rhetorically pose is: Was it an accident or is \nthere perhaps another reason why elected politicians would not call \nsomething a tax?\n  Mr. LEE. Will the Senator yield for question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I will be happy to yield for the purpose of a question.\n  Mr. LEE. Hearing the Senator from Texas, I started humming the theme \nto ``Jeopardy,'' while stating lots of these things in the form of a \nquestion. It does occur to me it is absolutely certain there was a \nreason why this was not called a tax when it was presented to the \nCongress. The reason is tax hikes are unpopular. Tax hikes are \nespecially unpopular when they are directed at the American middle \nclass. Tax hikes are especially unpopular when they are directed at the \nAmerican middle class, when they are presented by a President who ran \nspecifically on a campaign of not raising taxes on the American middle \nclass, which, of course, nearly all candidates for President will \npromise and in this case did promise.\n  So, no, it is not by any means an accident that this happened--the \nfact that language, consistent with 100 years' worth of jurisprudence, \nlanguage that was used in this law, created a penalty. There is a very \nclear distinction between a penalty under Federal law and a tax under \nFederal law. A tax under Federal law is something that is an \nobligation, a generalized obligation to fund government; whereas, a \npenalty is something that involves both a requirement under Federal law \nand a provision exacting a payment as something that occurs in response \nto noncompliance with that requirement. So no, this was not an accident \nat all.\n  So I would ask Senator Cruz whether this aspect of the Affordable \nCare Act--and also the fact that ObamaCare is called the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act--doesn't it strike the Senator that \nthis, in so many ways, is a misnomer in much the same way that the \nHundred Years' War did not last 100 years, Chinese gooseberries come \nnot from China but from New Zealand, that the black box is orange, that \nPanama hats come from Ecuador, that camel hair brushes are made of \nsquirrel fur--by the way, I do not ever want to try one of those; it \ndoes not sound pleasant--that the purple finch is actually red and that \nthe Canary Islands are named after a dog? So, too, the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act is a name that does not accurately \ndescribe the finished product because this is a law that will make \nhealth care less affordable rather than more, and it is a law that \nsubjects patients to a lot of harm rather than protecting them.\n  Does that mean we should think again about ObamaCare in the same way \nthat we need to think again in the answers to some of these questions?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I think the good Senator from Utah is exactly correct. \nIndeed, as he quite rightly explained, it was not an accident that \nCongress deliberately did not call the individual mandate in ObamaCare \na tax, nor was it an accident that the President of the United States \nexplicitly said it is not a tax, because the effort was to represent to \nthe American people that it was something quite different.\n  Indeed, again, asking a question rhetorically to the body--I know \nSenator Lee is aware; I know many other Senators are aware--of a lot of \ncases in the Supreme Court, the commandeering line of cases that \nprovides that one of the things this body cannot do, Congress cannot \ndo, is commandeer a State legislature, commandeer a State lawmaking \napparatus or a State executive agency to implement, to carry out \nFederal law and Federal policy.\n  Indeed, the Supreme Court has explained the reasoning behind the \ncommandeering line of cases; that fundamental to our democratic system, \nfundamental to our constitutional system is the notion of \naccountability, the notion that the voters should be able to determine \nwho is it that put this policy in place.\n\n[[Page S6785]]\n\n  If Congress could commandeer and force State legislatures to carry \nout Federal policies, it might be that voters would get mad at the \nState legislators, and they would be mad at the wrong people because if \nthe decisions were coming from Congress and yet it was the State \nlegislators being commandeered into acting, that would frustrate the \nprinciples of accountability that underlie our constitutional \nstructure.\n  So the Supreme Court has explained that to make the democratic system \nwork, the voters need to be able to understand who has made a decision, \nwhat that decision is, and if they do not like it, they need to be able \nto, as they say colloquially, throw the bums out.\n  The Affordable Care Act in Congress, declining to call it a tax. I \nmight ask, did the Supreme Court's rewriting the statute to call it a \ntax for Congress, to call it a tax for the President--despite the fact \nthat both had said it was not--did that contravene the accountability \nprinciples that underlie the Supreme Court's commandeering doctrine \nthat underlie the constitutional principles of, frankly, a republican \nform of government, where we may know who our elected officials are and \nwhat their actions are, and that they may be held accountable for those \nactions so that a democratic republic can function?\n  Mr. LEE. Will the Senator from Texas yield?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I will yield for the purpose of a question without yielding \nthe floor.\n  Mr. LEE. It occurs to me, as I think of this question that I am about \nto ask the Senator, that, inevitably, one constitutional violation \nfacilitates another. It cannot be that you violate one aspect of the \nConstitution, in this circumstance, especially, where you are tinkering \nwith the lawmaking power in ways that impact both federalism--the \nrelative power of States and localities, on the one hand, vis-a-vis the \nFederal Government on the other hand--and also when you manipulate the \npower to legislate, the power to impose taxes.\n  Anytime you distort the operation of the legislative power, anytime \nyou allow the judicial branch to commandeer the legislative machinery \nfrom Congress, you are also distorting the accountability you describe. \nIn other words, you have in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct a massive intrusion by the Federal Government into the sovereign \nauthority that is retained by the States and by the people.\n  The bigger the legislative package, the bigger the intrusion, and the \ngreater the potential threat to federalism. The more removed that \nlegislative package is from the people's elected representatives in the \nHouse and in the Senate, the greater the potential distortion that is \nat play in the constitutional system.\n  What we have at the end of the day is a new tax. Nobody knows who to \nblame. When the people are upset that they are going to be paying this \ntax, who do they blame? They go to their Members of Congress. You ask \nany Member of Congress who is still here who was here when this was \nenacted, any Member of Congress who voted for the Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act, and I can pretty well guarantee you they are \ngoing to say: Oh, no, I did not vote for a middle-class tax hike. I did \nnot vote to impose a new tax on middle-class Americans. No. No. I voted \nfor this, but I did not vote for that because this imposed a penalty \nand not a tax.\n  I know that because even in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in \n2012, people who supported this legislation in the House and in the \nSenate and in the White House continued to insist: No, this is not a \ntax, this is a penalty. This notwithstanding the fact that the Supreme \nCourt of the United States concluded it could not be upheld as a \npenalty, that it can be upheld only as an exercise of Congress's \nauthority to tax, an authority which Congress decidedly did not \nexercise. So the accountability is thrown off severely.\n  This is what prompted me to introduce a piece of legislation, S. 560. \nS. 560, which stands in rather stark contrast to the Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act with its 2,700 pages and 20,000 pages of \nimplementing regulations--S. 560, 1 page.\n  Here is what it says, to paraphrase: Section 1501 of the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act, the individual mandates provision, \nis hereby amended as follows: Nothing in this provision shall be \ninterpreted as a tax or as a valid exercise of Congress's power to tax \npursuant to article I, Section 8, clause 1, or the 16th Amendment.\n  You see, the part of S. 560 is that it gives those who voted for \nObamaCare, those in Congress who still defend ObamaCare, something \nother than a tax on the middle class, an opportunity to register that \nbelief, to register that belief by a vote, a vote that would say yes, I \ndo not believe this is a tax, and it should not be considered as a tax \nby the courts, and it should not be upheld by the courts as a tax. It \nshould not be construed under any circumstance as a tax, because we do \nnot regard it as that.\n  The interesting thing, of course, is that that is naturally the way \npeople who are the law's biggest defenders would like to vote in some \nrespects, because they want to tell the American public, and they are \nstill telling the American public: It is not a tax, it is a penalty. \nBut if, in fact, they actually put their vote in that direction, if \nthey put their money where their mouth is and they pass that into law, \nguess what happens to the Supreme Court's ruling. What would happen to \nthe Supreme Court's ruling in that circumstance, if we were to pass S. \n560 into law? Let's assume that somehow magically it passed the House \nand the Senate and President Obama signed it. Perhaps it united both \nparties behind this concept that this is not a tax. What then would \nbecome of the Supreme Court's ruling upholding the Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act on that basis?\n  Mr. CRUZ. It is an excellent question from Senator Lee. The answer is \nquite simple. If Congress acted to make clear that nothing in the \nAffordable Care Act created a tax, that would remove the entire basis \nfor the Supreme Court's upholding ObamaCare. Indeed, it would be a \nrelatively simple matter in subsequent litigation for the Court to \nconclude under the matter it has already concluded that the other bases \nfor upholding the act are not present.\n  When have you elected officials who go to the people, and go to the \npeople as Senator Lee still quite rightly noted and still say it is not \na tax, you would think they would happily vote for it, except there is \na vested interest. I would note there is a difference between calling \nthis a tax when Congress said and says it is not, and the examples we \nwent through of the Hundred Years War and the purple finch, and that \nthose are relatively innocuous misnomers, where there is something \ndesigned to be actively deceptive.\n  Indeed, another one you could add to that litany we went through is \nyou might think if an act were titled ``An act to amend the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986, to modify the first-time homebuyer's credit in \nthe case of members of the Armed Forces,'' you might think that is the \ntitle of an act that would concern something about the first-time \nhomebuyer's credit, perhaps even members of the Armed Forces. Depending \non the content of it, it might even be an act that Senator Lee and I \ntogether would support.\n  Yet think again. That act is ObamaCare. This is the 2,000-plus pages \nof ObamaCare, a little bit worse for wear. Right on the cover of it on \npage 1: December 24, 2009, ordered to be printed and passed. Resolved, \nthat the bill from the House of Representatives, titled H.R. 3590, \nentitled, an Act to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, to modify \nthe first-time homebuyer's credit in the case of members of the Armed \nServices and certain other Federal employees, and for other purposes, \ndo pass the following.\n  Then what was this amendment that was done? Strike out all after the \nenacting clause and insert. Everything for the first-time homebuyer's \ncredit, everything about the Armed Forces, that all got erased. The \ntitle stayed there but it all got erased. Suddenly, ObamaCare was born.\n  That was a creature, that was a fact that came out of the procedural \ngames that had to be played to force ObamaCare into law on a straight \nparty-line vote. But I would note that this body has not forgotten how \nto play those games. Indeed, I would ask again rhetorically to the \nbody, is the game the Democratic majority of Congress played in passing \nObamaCare, saying it was not a tax, when in fact it was a\n\n[[Page S6786]]\n\ntax, when it was not a tax, any different than what right now some \nmembers of the Republican conference are doing when they say they will \nvote for cloture in order to give Harry Reid and the Senate Democrats \nthe ability to fully fund ObamaCare, and that they will do so because \nthey want to defund ObamaCare? Is that fundamentally any different, \npresenting one story to tell the voters and a different story in terms \nof what will happen in this body? When it comes to accountability, I \nwonder if we are seeing much the same games played out again, games \nthat undermine the integrity of this institution, games that undermine \nthe confidence the American people have that our elected \nrepresentatives listen to us.\n  Mr. LEE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for the purpose of a question without \nyielding the floor.\n  Mr. LEE. It certainly is important that we call something by an \nappropriate name. It was important back then that the Congress properly \nname what it was doing. It was appropriate back then for the Congress \nto say: We are enforcing the individual mandate through a penalty and \nnot through a tax. In fact, it was so important that but for Congress's \ndecision to make this a penalty and not a tax, it would never have \npassed in the first place.\n  What you call something and what you make of it can mean all the \ndifference between passage and failure of a particular legislative \nproposal. When you dress something up in different language, something \nmight appear to be more palatable than it actually is. Certainly, it \ncould be argued that if there are people among us--if there are \nRepublicans among us who are saying that if you support the House-\npassed continuing resolution, then you must vote for cloture on the \nbill, cloture on the House-passed resolution, that would not be \naccurate, in my opinion. I would respectfully but strongly disagree \nwith someone who would make that claim. I certainly do not believe it \nis accurate to say that if you support the House-passed continuing \nresolution, the one that keeps government funding but defunds ObamaCare \nat the same time, I think it would be inaccurate to say you must vote \nyes on cloture on the bill in this circumstance.\n  It is not to say that in every circumstance you would have to vote \nno. In fact, it seems counterintuitive when you first approach it, say \nwhy would you vote no on cloture on a bill that you liked. There is one \ncircumstance where I can see where you would want to do that. It is a \ncircumstance in which the continuing resolution you want to support \nmoves over from the House of Representatives, and there are three \nalternatives the Senate could consider, but the Senate chooses only the \nthird, three doors the majority leader could choose to open. He chooses \nonly the third.\n  The first door is one in which he says: Okay, we are going to vote on \nthis. We are going to vote on it up or down on its merits as is. We are \ngoing to vote on it as it was passed by the House of Representatives.\n  Behind door two is another option. We are going to allow amendments. \nWe are going to allow individual Members, Democrats and Republicans, to \nsubmit amendments as they deem fit. We will debate and discuss those \namendments. We will consider them. We will vote on them. Some of them \nmay pass, some of them may not pass. But we will get to amendments. \nDoor one is okay. Door two is okay. They are both appropriate. I would \nbe okay with either one. I would vote yes on cloture on the bill if we \nwere going to go through either of those first two doors.\n  But door three is the one the majority leader appears likely to open. \nAnd behind door three is a very different alternative, one where the \nmajority leader says: I do not want to vote on it as is. But I also do \nnot want to allow an open amendment process. In fact, I am going to \nallow one and only one amendment. That amendment will gut the \ncontinuing resolution passed by the House of the single most important \nprovision relative to its ability to pass the House, the provision \ndefunding ObamaCare.\n  Door 3 is unacceptable. Door 3 is unacceptable because it allows the \nmajority leader to gut the House-passed continuing resolution funding \ngovernment but defunding ObamaCare.\n  I find door 3 unacceptable. Because I find door 3 unacceptable, I am \nnot going to help the majority leader get there. If he wants to get \nthere with the help of himself, his own vote, and the 53 Democrats who \nfollow him in his conference, that is fine. Let them do that. If he \nwants to try to convince some Republicans to join him in that effort to \nmake it easier for him to gut the House-passed continuing resolution, \nto strip out the language defunding ObamaCare, then that is the \nprerogative of anyone who may go along with him. I choose not to do \nthat because I was elected to fight this law, not to facilitate its \nimplementation.\n  I don't want to facilitate its implementation. I therefore don't want \nto facilitate the demise of what I regard as the single most important \nprovision of the House-passed continuing resolution. I will therefore \nvote against cloture on the bill.\n  I ask Senator Cruz, how does he view the upcoming cloture vote? I am \nspeaking here not on cloture on the motion to proceed but on the \ncloture on the bill, on the House-passed bill, the continuing \nresolution.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from Utah for that question.\n  On the motion to proceed, on the decision of whether to take up the \nbill, I think there is widespread agreement that we should take up this \nbill as there is no more important bill we could be debating now than \nthis. Indeed, in my view, there should not only be 3 Senators in this \nChamber, there should be 100. The urgency facing this country from \nObamaCare is such that we have nothing better to do. When James Hoffa, \nthe president of the Teamsters, says that ObamaCare is a nightmare, \nfrankly, Senators shouldn't be asleep while the Nation is undergoing a \nnightmare.\n  The vote that matters is the vote on cloture on the bill. It will \noccur on either Friday or Saturday of this week. On that vote, 60 \nSenators, vote yes for cloture. That is a vote to shut off debate, a \nvote to say we will not debate anymore. What it does is it opens the \ndoor, it sets the stage. It allows the majority leader Harry Reid to \nfully fund ObamaCare with just 51 Democratic votes. That means for the \nRepublican side of the aisle that any Republican who votes along with \nHarry Reid--and you quite rightly know that Leader Reid and presumably \nall of the Democrats will vote for cloture on a bill with which most, \nif not all of them disagree. They get the joke. There is no mystery to \nthis when the majority leader has announced: I am going to shut off all \nother amendments and I am going to add one amendment to totally gut the \nbill and to transform it, to do to this bill what they did to this \nbill.\n  Can you imagine if we were debating cloture? This is actually a very \ngood analogy. Imagine if this bill were coming over, the bill that was \nturning into ObamaCare, and we had the same procedural arrangement--\ncloture vote first at 60 votes and then all amendments to be approved \nat 51 votes. Imagine if Republicans said: I support an act to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code to modify the first-time home buyer credit in the \ncase of members of the Armed Forces. That is a good idea, so I am \nvoting yes for cloture.\n  That is the bill I supported. It is the bill that came over, and it \nis the bill that I have right now.\n  Imagine if that were the scenario, and imagine that majority leader \nHarry Reid had announced: Once we get cloture, I am going to offer an \namendment to strip every word of that bill you say you support, strip \nit all out and to replace it with 2,000 pages of ObamaCare.\n  I would suggest that any Republican who stood up and said: I am \nvoting for cloture to give Harry Reid the ability to strip out the bill \nthat I support--which he said he is going to do--and to replace it with \na bill that I say I oppose and not just oppose slightly, that I say I \noppose passionately, I would suggest that would be beyond irrational. \nIndeed, it would be so irrational to do that, and I would suggest no \nMember of the Senate is capable of such irrationality. This means, if \nthey are saying that, it is for a deliberate purpose. It is because \nthey affirmatively desire that outcome and yet they wish to be able to \ntell their constituents something different. It is fundamentally the \nsame dynamic that leads to the cynicism about Washington that ``our \nelected leaders don't listen to us.''\n\n[[Page S6787]]\n\n  I wish to note on a different front that serving in an elected office \nis a tremendous privilege. It is a humbling experience. You get to meet \npeople from all over the State, sometimes from all over the country. \nYou get to meet incredible people. You get to meet people who have done \nremarkable things.\n  One of the people I have been privileged to meet is my colleague and \nfriend Senator Mike Lee. We have learned tonight a number of \nextraordinary things about him, a number of things that border on the \nsuperhuman.\n  No. 1, we have learned that Senator Mike Lee would be willing to \npurchase a ton of rocks and a Barry Manilow record simply to bring his \nwife milk and eggs. That is extraordinary matrimonial fidelity.\n  No. 2, we have learned that Senator Mike Lee as a boy could be run \nover with a Buick filled with seven people and not have his foot \ninjured. That, too, is extraordinary and superhuman.\n  No. 3, we have been privileged with a tour de force constitutional \nlecture with no notes, with no materials in front of him that, frankly, \nwas reminiscent to me of a former boss of mine.\n  Senator Lee is the son of a legend in law. His late father, Rex Lee, \nwas the Solicitor General of the United States. I did not have the \nopportunity to meet his late father but have known him by reputation \nfor much of my life because he was revered as one of the finest Supreme \nCourt advocates who ever lived. I think Mike was all but weaned on the \nConstitution as a young lad.\n  The discourse Senator Lee just presented to this Nation reminded me \nof my boss, former Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who, like Senator \nLee, had a deep love for the Constitution and, like Senator Lee, had an \nencyclopedic knowledge of the Constitution and could weave the battles \nwe have had to rein in government power to protect individual liberty \ninto a tapestry of narrative that explained what it is we are fighting \nfor.\n  I will say that as we stand here now at 3:35 in the morning, I feel \nprivileged. I feel fortunate to be standing side by side with my \nfriend.\n  I will say this: If ever I am threatened by a Buick with seven people \nin it, I want to put Mike Lee between me and the Buick.\n  Mr. LEE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I yield to the gentleman without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. LEE. First, by way of clarification, it was not a Buick but an \nOldsmobile.\n  Those were not rocks I was purchasing in my hypothetical; it was \ninstead a half ton of iron ore. I am not sure it is critical to the \nmerits of the story, but I did think that deserved some clarification. \nI am not certain that I would, in fact, do that. I wish to be very \nclear. I did engage in a transaction like that.\n  It does remind me of how we are often asked to vote here. We tie \ntogether program after program. Things are funded not on their own \nmerits but on the merits of other programs. When you tie every single \npiece of government spending together, then all of a sudden it becomes \na must-pass piece of legislation. Everybody sinks or swims together, \nand it becomes a practice of collusive spending in which Congress funds \nthings not because each program deserves to be funded but because \nnobody wants to have his ox gored, and that does become a problem.\n  I appreciate the Senator's comments about my late father. He has been \ndead for the last 17 years. We miss him. We have missed him every day \nsince then.\n  The Journal of the American Bar Association once referred to him as \n``Huck Finn in a morning suit,'' referring to the ceremonial dress worn \nby the U.S. Solicitor General. They regard him as sort of the \nHuckleberry Finn character. It was not typical that a boy from the \nRocky Mountains, as he used to describe himself, ends up in that \nposition, but he loved that position and loved it very much.\n  It is worth noting that I have met the father of the junior Senator \nfrom Texas. He is an inspiring speaker. He is a true patriot. Even \nthough he was not born or raised in this country, the Senator's father \nhas a great love of the United States of America that is unparalleled, \ncertainly unexceeded by almost anyone I have ever met. He is one who \ncertainly can understand the angst the American people feel about laws \nlike ObamaCare. He is someone who I think can understand that in many \nrespects the very best kinds of jobs program the Senate could enact, as \nmy friend Jared Stone from Danville, CA, recently told me, would be \nlegislation defunding ObamaCare. As my friend Jared Stone pointed out \nto me, ObamaCare presents a sort of double whammy for the American \npeople. At once, it imposes a massive new tax on the middle class and \nat the same time kills job opportunities for the middle class. Most \npeople who work in real jobs or want to have a good job understand \nthis. That is why the overwhelming majority of Americans want the \nSenate to defund ObamaCare.\n  This is a principle that I think the father of the junior Senator \nfrom Texas understands very well. The father of the junior Senator from \nTexas came here as a young man, initially working at a restaurant \nwaiting tables, as I recall. This was a young man who had escaped \ntyranny in various forms, originally the form of tyranny Cuba saw under \nCastro's predecessor, Fulgencio Batista.\n  The Senator's father had quite an experience coming to this country. \nI was wondering if the junior Senator from Texas would be willing to \nshare a little bit more about his father's story, the story of Rafael \nCruz, how he came to this country, and how the Senator's father might \nlook upon ObamaCare based upon his rather unique experience coming to \nthis country.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from Utah for his very kind comments \nregarding my father, and I will say that he and I--I will paraphrase \nSir Isaac Newton, who said: If I have seen a little bit further, it is \nby standing on the shoulders of giants. I will say one thing. Senator \nLee and I are both fortunate. We are blessed to be the sons of fathers \nwhom we admire immensely and who, I think for both of us, played a big \npart in trying to raise us to be principled, to fight for liberty, and \nto fight for the Constitution.\n  When you think about the journeys to freedom that constitute who we \nare as American people, all of us have a story. It doesn't matter--in \nany group you go to, you could get 1,000 people in an audience, and \neach person could come up to the microphone and tell their family story \nof someone who risked everything to be here.\n  My dad as a kid was born in Cuba. We mentioned earlier that his \nfather had come from the Canary Islands when he was 1. As a young man--\nmy dad was 14 when he began to get involved in the Cuban Revolution. At \nthe time, Batista was the dictator. Batista was cruel, corrupt, closely \naligned with the Mafia, and he was oppressive.\n  The revolution occurred--dad was a 14-year-old boy, and I am looking \nat the pages who are sitting here now who are older than 14, and I \nwould suggest, if you could imagine at the age of 14 finding yourself \nin a war, finding yourself fighting a war, hoping to liberate the \ncountry, being asked to fight against the army, and being asked to \nfight for freedom. The revolution was being fought on behalf of Fidel \nCastro, and indeed my father was one of many freedom fighters who \nfought on behalf of Castro. My father didn't know Castro. He was a kid. \nHe was not a high ranking person in the revolution. I can tell you, my \ndad and the kids who were fighting, none of them knew at the time Fidel \nCastro was a communist. As my father describes it today, he says: Look, \nwe were all 14- and 15-year-old boys. We were too dumb to know about \nthat. We were just fighting for freedom. We just wanted to get out from \nunder the boot of Batista.\n\n  For 4 years my father fought with the revolution. When he turned 17, \nmy dad went out and partied. He was enjoying himself. He was a 17-year-\nold young revolutionary. He was in a white suit. You know, Senator Lee, \nLatinos love white suits. He was in a white suit and he was partying it \nup in Havana and he disappeared.\n  For several days my grandfather went looking for him. My \ngrandfather--my grandparents knew their son was involved in the \nrevolution. He hadn't hid that from his parents. And they also knew if \nyour son is involved in the revolution and he disappears, it is a bad, \nbad thing. Well, after searching for him for several days--searching \nthe jails, searching around--they found my dad. He was in a jail. He \nhad been imprisoned, and he had been tortured.\n\n[[Page S6788]]\n\n  I will confess to this day I don't know a lot about what happened. \nDifferent people have different experiences. My father doesn't talk \nmuch about it. To the best of my knowledge, other than our colleague \nSenator John McCain, whom all of us respect immensely for his \ntremendous service and sacrifice to this Nation, I am not aware of any \nof our colleagues in this body who have experienced anything like \nimprisonment and torture--and what my father experienced was a tiny \nfraction of what John McCain went through in the years he was in that \nVietnam prison. But my dad, when I was growing up, never would really \ntell me what happened there.\n  But I remember one night when I was a kid--I think I was in high \nschool, maybe junior high or high school, I don't remember--my dad and \nI had gone to see the movie Rambo. My dad and I both liked movies. He \nhad taken me to see Rambo, and it was a fun movie to see as a kid. It \nhappened that night--my parents owned a small business, and my dad had \none of his clients over for dinner--that during the course of dinner, \nmy father was talking to his client, and he was feeling a little \ngregarious, and he started talking. He said: You know, my son Ted and I \nwent to see Rambo this evening. And you might remember there is a \npretty nasty scene where Rambo is strapped to a bed frame and being \nsubjected to electric shock. Not a very pleasant scene in the movie. My \ndad was saying: You know, the Cubans weren't nearly so fancy when it \ncame to torture. We watched the movie Rambo. They didn't have any fancy \nbed frames and electric shock or anything. The Cubans were much more \nsimple in their torture. Basically, they would just come in every hour \nand beat the living daylights out of you. They would just beat you, and \nbeat you, and beat you. Then they would leave, come back in an hour and \ndo it again.\n  I can tell you my grandmother said when my dad came out of that jail \ncell in Cuba the white suit he was wearing, you couldn't see a spot of \nwhite on it, that every inch of that suit was covered with mud and \nblood from where he had been beaten. And my father's teeth, she said, \nwere dangling from his mouth in shards. Today, my father is a pastor in \nDallas, and his front teeth are not his own because when he was a kid \nthey were kicked out of his mouth in a Cuban jail.\n  He got out of that jail and at that point my grandfather told him, he \nsaid: Look, Rafael, they know who you are now. In fact, the Batista \npolice were following my dad hoping he would lead them to others in the \nrevolution. The only reason he got out is they thought: Well, maybe if \nwe let him go he will be dumb enough to go to some other people in the \nrevolution and we can track them down too. So my grandfather said: \nListen, they know who you are. At this point they are just going to \nhunt you down and kill you. You can't stay here.\n  So my father applied to three U.S. universities. He applied to the \nUniversity of Miami, he applied to LSU, and he applied to the \nUniversity of Texas. It was pure happenstance that the first one to let \nhim in was the University of Texas. Had it been otherwise, had it been \nthe University of Miami, I might today be a constituent of our friend \nMarco Rubio. But it so happened it was the University of Texas, and \nthat led to my father getting on a plane in 1957 when he was 18.\n  I want again to talk to the pages who are here. Some of you may be 18 \nor near it. I want you to imagine at the age of 18 getting on a plane \nand flying away from your family, thousands of miles away to another \ncountry--to a country where you don't know anybody, you don't have any \nfamily, and you don't speak the language. Imagine walking off the \nplane.\n  My father had the suit on his back. He couldn't take anything with \nhim. He couldn't take a suitcase or anything. He was wearing a suit. \nThe one possession he had was a slide rule that was in his pocket. I \nsee looks of somewhat confusion on the faces of the pages. I note \nanytime I talk to young people they have utterly no idea what a slide \nrule is. That was the one possession he had that he had taken from \nCuba. And my grandmother, before he left, sewed $100 into the inside of \nhis underwear. She wanted him to have at least a little money when he \nlanded.\n  So in 1957 he shows up in Austin, and his first priority was to get a \nplace to live. So he went and found a place to live. And then he had to \nget a job. And the job he got was washing dishes. Why washing dishes? \nBecause you didn't have to speak English. He couldn't speak English. He \nmade 50 cents an hour. He didn't have to talk to anyone. He could take \na dish, stick it under hot water, scrub it, and move on to the next \none. That he could do.\n  My dad worked 7 days a week washing dishes and then as a cook to pay \nhis way through the University of Texas. And times were tight. I can't \nimagine. I didn't have to go through that. I don't believe Senator Lee \nhad to go through the experience of going to school full time and \nworking full time. My dad worked 7 days a week while he was going to \nschool full time as a student. It wasn't that he wanted to. He didn't \nhave any other alternatives. There wasn't anyone else providing for \nhim.\n  I remember a couple of stories my father told me of his time in \ncollege. With the indulgence of the Chair, I will share those stories \nbecause they are stories, I think, of the American experience; they are \nshared experience.\n  The great thing about working in a restaurant is they let you eat \nwhile you work. So during the 8 hours, he would eat those 8 hours. The \nother 16 hours he wouldn't eat. It was even better when he got promoted \nto being a cook, because as a cook you really got a chance to eat. For \nexample, one of the things the restaurant served was fried shrimp. My \ndad had a policy that anyone who ordered a dozen shrimp, he would cook \n13 and eat one. During the course of the day a lot of people would \norder fried shrimp, and he would just eat one steadily throughout the \nday. My dad used to try to drink 6 or 7 glasses of milk during the day. \nHe figured there was no percentage in water, and he needed the \nnutrients. Because when he left, he was going another 16 hours without \neating until he came back to work the next day. He didn't have money \nfor food.\n\n  There was one little exception. There was a coffee shop he found in \ntown. He went in one day, and he splurged. It was one of the few times \nhe actually spent money, and he spent money for a cup of coffee. \nAnother gentleman in the coffee shop came in and ordered some toast. My \ndad saw the waitress take out of a bag a fresh loaf of bread, take both \nof the heels and throw them away, and then take two other slices of \nbread, put them in the toaster and toast them. My father said: What are \nyou doing? You are throwing away perfectly good food. And she said: \nwell, we can't serve the heels.\n  When you are desperate and you are hungry, you have incentive to do \nall sorts of things, and so my father said: Listen, do me a favor. Save \nthem for me. Just save them for me. You can't serve them, I will eat \nthem. He used to go into that coffee shop, and that waitress very \nkindly would save the heels when she opened a new loaf. When he would \ncome in she would have five, six, or seven heels. She would toast them \nand give him butter, and he would order one cup of coffee and have five \nor six heels of toast and drink his coffee.\n  Another similar story. There were a lot of immigrants at the \nUniversity of Texas who didn't have two nickels between them, and he \nwent over to some friends who I think were brothers and they invited \nhim over for dinner. He was sitting down for dinner with a big pot of \nblack beans. Cubans love black beans. When he was reaching in to get \nblack beans, they said: Watch out for the nail. Watch out for the nail? \nWhat on Earth are you talking about? These two brothers explained: \nLook, we don't have money for food. So what little money we have, we \nhave enough to have beans each night, and we have enough to purchase a \nlittle tiny paper-thin steak. The brothers said: Initially, we started \nto cut the steak in half so we would each eat it. To be honest, we both \nleft hungry and we weren't happy with that. So we decided instead of \ndoing that, we would take a nail, drop it in the beans, and we would \nfish for the nail. Whoever got the nail with their beans got the whole \nsteak and the other brother didn't get any steak at all.\n  They said: Rafael, since you are our guest--and he was kind of \nwaiting for them to say we are going to give you the steak, but they \nwere not quite that generous. But they said: Since you are\n\n[[Page S6789]]\n\nour guest, we will give you half of the steak and we are going to fish \nfor the nail for the other half.\n  One other story. In his freshman or sophomore year, I'm not sure \nwhich, my dad and a couple of other Cubans who were students there \ndecided they wanted to have a Christmas dinner. The Cuban tradition of \nChristmas is to roast a whole pig.\n  Indeed, if I may digress, when I was dating my wife Heidi--Heidi is \nthe love of my life, she is my best friend. She was raised in \nCalifornia. She and her whole family are vegetarians. I remember Heidi \nbrought me back to meet her parents for Christmas, and we were sitting \nthere having Christmas dinner. I would note that a vegetarian Christmas \ndinner is just like any other Christmas dinner except the entree never \ncomes. Everything else is wonderful, but you keep waiting for them to \nbring out the entree and it is not there.\n  My now in-laws, who are wonderful tremendous people, who were \nmissionaries and just wonderful people, they were trying to get to know \nthis strange young man their daughter had brought home. And they said: \nTed, tell us, how does your family celebrate Christmas? I said: Well, \nwe are Cuban, and the Cuban tradition is that on Christmas Eve we roast \na whole pig.\n  I must tell you the look of abject horror. If you can imagine a table \nfull of California vegetarians, when I said we roast a whole pig. I \ndon't think if I had said we consumed live kittens it would have more \nhorrified them than that so viscerally carnivorous tale.\n  But my dad and a couple of his Cuban buddies decided they wanted to \nhave a Christmas dinner, and to actually celebrate. So they drove to a \nfarm just outside of Austin. They found some farmers in central Texas \nand said: Listen, is there any chance we could somehow buy a little \npiglet from you? Can we do something so we could get it and roast it? \nWe would like to have it at Christmas Eve dinner. These farmers decided \nthey wanted to have fun with my dad and these kids, so they said: Tell \nyou what. We will take this little piglet and let him loose in a corral \nfilled with mud. If you can catch it, you can have him for free. My dad \nand his friends chased that piglet for close to an hour, running around \nin the mud. They finally caught the piglet, the farmers gave it to \nthem, they took it home, and they roasted it for Christmas Eve.\n  The epilogue to the story about my in-laws is that when Heidi and I \nbecame engaged, her mother called her and said: Sweetheart, are you \nprepared to catch the pig? Thankfully Heidi reassured her she was quite \nconfident in our marriage that there would be no pig catching that she \nwould indeed be carrying out, and that has indeed proven true.\n  All of us have stories about our families. My father has been my \ninspiration ever since I was a kid because I think it is a great \nblessing, a tremendous blessing to be the child of someone who has fled \noppression, to be the child of someone who came here seeking freedom. \nIt makes you realize that what we have in the United States of America \nis precious, it is wonderful, it is unique, and we cannot possibly risk \ngiving it up.\n  At the same time, I am amazed at how commonplace my father's story \nis. Every American has a story just like that. Sometimes it is us, \nsometimes it is our parents, sometimes it is our great-great-\ngrandparents. But I have yet to encounter someone who doesn't have a \nstory like that in their background, often closer than one might think. \nI think the most shared characteristic among all of us as Americans is \nwe are the children of those who risked everything for freedom.\n  Sometimes people ask, what differentiates Americans from, say, \nEuropeans, Americans from other countries? I think more than anything \nit is in our DNA to value liberty and opportunity above all else.\n  When ObamaCare was being passed 3\\1/2\\ years ago, I think the \nproponents believed--in fact, they stated--that once it is in place \nAmericans would come to love it and would give up their liberty, would \ngive up their freedom in exchange for bread and circuses. Yet 3\\1/2\\ \nyears later we see ObamaCare is less popular now than it was then. That \nis true all over the country. That is true in every region. That is \ntrue among Republicans, among Democrats, among Independents, and among \nLibertarians.\n  There are several reasons for that. One is simple facts. Forget party \nideology affiliations. The simple fact is this isn't working. If you \nlook at it on its face, it is a train wreck, as the Democratic Senator \nwho was the lead author of ObamaCare has described. On its face it is a \nnightmare, as James Hoffa, the president of the Teamsters, has \ndescribed it.\n  ObamaCare in practice is killing jobs all over this country. It is \ncausing small businesses to stay small, not to grow, not to create \njobs. It is causing Americans all over this country to forcibly reduce \nto 29 hours a week. Do you know who is being reduced the most? It ain't \nthe rich. It ain't, as the President likes to put it, the millionaires \nand billionaires. The millionaires and billionaires are doing great. \nThey are richer today than when President Obama was elected.\n  I think the biggest lie in politics is the lie that Republicans are \nthe party of the rich. I think it is a complete and total falsehood. \nThe rich do great with big government. Business does great with big \ngovernment. Why? Because big business gets into bed with big \ngovernment.\n  What have we seen with ObamaCare? The rich and powerful get special \nexemptions. Big businesses? The President exempts them. Members of \nCongress? The President exempts us. It is the little guy who doesn't \nhave an army of lobbyists, doesn't have special interests, the little \nguy is the one left out.\n  So who are the people losing their jobs? Who are the people forcibly \nhaving reduced hours? Who are the people facing skyrocketing health \ninsurance premiums? Who are the people having their insurance dropped? \nIt is people such as the disabled retirees whose letters I was reading \nearlier today. It is people like my father.\n  If ObamaCare was the law in 1957, when my father was washing dishes, \nI think it is a virtual certainty that he would have found his hours \nforcibly reduced to 29 hours a week--if he had been lucky enough to get \na job in the first place. He might not have been hired at all. That is \nhappening to people all over the country. The people who are losing \nunder ObamaCare are people like my dad, teenaged kids who don't speak \nEnglish, who are recent immigrants, who are Hispanic, who are African \nAmericans, single moms.\n  I have a good friend who is now a justice on the Texas Supreme Court \nwhose mom was a single mom and waited tables. He computed the distance \nshe walked as a waitress to bring him up. I don't remember the exact \nmeasurements, but it was some remarkable number of times walking from \nthe Earth to the Moon and back that she walked so her kids could have a \nbetter life. That single mom who was waiting tables, her son is now a \njustice in the Texas Supreme Court. That is the story of America. But \nif ObamaCare had been in place, that single mom waiting tables is \nworking 29 hours a week. Try feeding a family on 29 hours a week. You \ncan't do it. It cannot be done.\n  So what happens instead? People get their hours forcibly reduced. \nThey either can't earn enough to feed their family so they leave the \nworkforce altogether and they go on welfare. Not that they want to. \nThey want to be working. But if Congress has passed a law so that the \nonly job they can get is 29 hours a week, that is not enough to feed \ntheir family. Right now one in seven Americans is on food stamps. What \na travesty. It is not a travesty from the perspective of the budget; it \nis not a travesty from the perspective of the taxpayers. It is a \ntravesty from the perspective of those people on food stamps who would \nrather be working, who would rather have the dignity of work to provide \nfor their family and to climb the economic ladder.\n  My dad started washing dishes, but he didn't stay there. After \nwashing dishes he got a job as a cook. After a cook he got a job as a \nteaching assistant. After a teaching assistant he got hired at IBM as a \ncomputer programmer. Then he started his own business. If he doesn't \nget hired washing dishes, he doesn't get the next job as a cook, he \ndoesn't get the next job as a teaching assistant, he doesn't get the \nnext job at IBM, he doesn't get the next job starting his own business.\n\n[[Page S6790]]\n\n  If you look at those single moms who are waiting tables and suddenly \nget their hours reduced to 29 hours a week, if she ends up giving up, \ngoing on food stamps, going on welfare, saying I can't earn enough in \nthe market to provide for my family, not only does that have \ndevastating effects on her and on her kids, but it also means she won't \nhave a chance to move up the ladder. She won't have a chance to get \nthat next job. Maybe if she was waiting tables, she would get promoted \nto being assistant manager and then manager. Maybe she would have \nanother opportunity moving up the ladder. But if she doesn't get on \nthat first rung, we know to an absolute certainty you won't go to the \nsecond or third rung. What a travesty.\n  This is a country of unlimited opportunity, and ObamaCare is cutting \noff that opportunity. It is shutting down that opportunity. Those are \nwho are hurt the most under ObamaCare.\n  There are many reasons why ObamaCare is problematic. It is \nproblematic because it is the biggest job killer in America. It is a \ntrain wreck because it is forcing more and more people to be driven \ninto part-time work 29 hours a week.\n  The second thing the single mom can do--suppose she doesn't give up. \nSuppose she says, Darn it, I want to work to provide for my kids. I am \nnot going to give up. I am not going to go on welfare and stop working \nin the workplace. The other option is to go find another job. So then \nshe has two jobs at 29 hours a week. Her kids now see less of their \nmom. And, by the way, neither one gives her health care. So the \nAffordable Care Act and all the great benefits of that haven't helped \nher at all. Instead of being at one job where she could work and focus \non that one job and potentially climb the ladder to different \nopportunities, she is working two part-time jobs. Part-time jobs are \nmuch harder to advance in your career with. She is also dealing with \ncommuting. She has got to get from one job to the other. For a single \nmom whose time is at a premium, who would like to be at her kids' \nsoccer game if ever she could work the schedule to do that, if she has \nto drive from one place to the other back and forth, there are a lot of \nsoccer games that single mom is never getting to, not to mention the \nheadaches of having two different jobs and two different bosses. If you \nhave boss No. 1 who says, I want you to work Tuesday morning, and boss \nNo. 2 says, I want you to work Tuesday morning at my place, how do you \nbalance those? Both of them say, I don't care about your other job. I \nneed you here. What a nightmare.\n  ObamaCare is a train wreck. It is a nightmare because it is killing \njobs, because it is driving up health insurance, because it is causing \nmore and more people to lose their health insurance. But it is also \nfundamentally wrong for a broader reason: because it infringes on our \nliberty.\n  The Federal Government is telling every American: You must purchase \nhealth insurance. The individual mandate, we are going to make you \npurchase health insurance. If not, the IRS is going to come and find \nyou.\n  The Federal Government is telling Catholic charities and Catholic \nhospitals, Christian companies like Hobby Lobby: You must pay for \nhealth insurance procedures that violate your religious dictates. They \nmay not violate everyone's religious dictates. There may be a lot of \npeople in this country who have no religious qualms about that \nwhatsoever, and that is fine. Each of us is entitled--indeed, \nencouraged--to seek out God Almighty with all of our heart, mind, and \nsoul as best we can, and we will follow different paths. But I \nguarantee you, if the Federal Government can tell Catholic charities \nand Catholic hospitals: You must violate your religious beliefs or we \nare going to fine you out of business; if the Federal Government can \ntell that to Hobby Lobby, a Christian company, they can tell that to \nyou too. Whatever your religious beliefs happen to be, if the Federal \nGovernment can say: Violate your religious faith or we are coming after \nyou, that is a dangerous Rubicon we have crossed.\n  We are a nation that was founded on liberty. Always defend liberty. \nYou can't go wrong with that as a mantra.\n  In the interest of that, I would like to share a few excerpts of one \nof my favorite books, ``Atlas Shrugged'' by Ayn Rand. Let me encourage \nany of you who have not read ``Atlas Shrugged'' to go tomorrow and buy \n``Atlas Shrugged'' and read it. What is interesting is in the last 3 \nyears sales of ``Atlas Shrugged'' have exploded, because we are living \nin the days of Ayn Rand.\n  I will share a few excerpts that are all fundamentally about liberty \nand the liberty that ObamaCare infringes.\n\n       Productiveness is your acceptance of morality, your \n     recognition of the fact that you choose to live--that \n     productive work is the process by which man's consciousness \n     controls his existence, a constant process of acquiring \n     knowledge and shaping matter to fit one's purpose of \n     translating an idea into physical form, of remaking the earth \n     and the image of one's values--that all work is creative work \n     if done by a thinking mind, and no work is creative if done \n     by a blank who repeats in uncritical stupor a routine he has \n     learned from others--that your work is yours to choose, and \n     the choice is as wide as your mind, that nothing more is \n     possible to you and nothing less is human--that to cheat your \n     way into a job bigger than your mind can handle is to become \n     a fear-corroded ape--\n\n  There is a phrase you don't hear often in modern parlance.\n\n     --on borrowed motions and borrowed time, and to settle down \n     into a job that requires less than your mind's full capacity \n     is to cut your motor and sentence yourself to another kind of \n     motion: decay--\n\n  My, is that happening across this country as a result of ObamaCare, \npeople being forced to settle down into jobs that require less than our \nmind's full capacity\n\n     --that your work is the process of achieving your values, and \n     to lose your ambition for values is to lose your ambition to \n     live--that your body is a machine, but your mind is its \n     driver, and you must drive as far as your mind will take you, \n     with achievement as the goal of your road--that the man who \n     has no purpose is a machine that coasts downhill at the \n     mercy of any boulder to crash in the first chance ditch, \n     that the man who stifles his mind is a stalled machine \n     slowly going to rust, that the man who lets a leader \n     prescribe his course is a wreck being towed to the scrap \n     heap, and the man who makes another man his goal is a \n     hitchhiker no driver should ever pick up--that your work \n     is the purpose of your life, and you must speed past any \n     killer who assumes the right to stop you, that any value \n     you might find outside your work, any other loyalty or \n     love, can be only travelers you choose to share your \n     journey and must be travelers going on their own power in \n     the same direction.''\n\n  A few other excerpts.\n\n       What is morality, she asked. Judgment to distinguish right \n     and wrong, vision to see the truth, and courage to act upon \n     it; dedication to that which is good, integrity to stand by \n     the good at any price.\n\n  Boy, that is counsel the Senate should listen to. That is counsel I \nwould encourage for every Democratic Senator who feels the urge of \nparty loyalty, to stand by their party, to stand by ObamaCare because \nit is the natural thing to do. Yet we saw union leaders, we saw the \nroofers union, we saw James Hoffa of the Teamsters say they cannot \nremain silent any longer. Why? Because of the suffering ObamaCare is \nvisiting on so many working men and women. It is a nightmare, according \nto James Hoffa of the Teamsters. I encourage my friends on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, as difficult as it is to cross one's \nparty leaders--I say with perhaps a little familiarity with the \nconsequences of so doing that it is survivable and that ultimately it \nis liberating; that the Democratic Senators of this body maintain their \nfidelity, their loyalty not to the party apparatus, not to the party \nbosses, but to the men and women who sent them here, to the men and \nwomen like the union members of the Teamsters who are pleading with \nMembers of Congress: Hear our suffering. ObamaCare is a nightmare.\n  With that prism in mind, let me reread Ayn Rand's excerpt:\n\n       What is morality, she asked. Judgment to distinguish right \n     and wrong, vision to see the truth, and courage to act upon \n     it; dedication to that which is good, integrity to stand by \n     the good at any price.\n\n  You know, at any price? Look, at the end of the day, a Member of the \nSenate bucks his or her party leadership, and to be honest, the prices \nare all pretty piddly. What a coddled world we live in that we think \nthat if someone says a cross word to you at a cocktail party or, God \nforbid, even worse, leaks a scurrilous lie to some reporter, that truly \nis a grievous insult. Goodness gracious, compared to what the people \nhave gone through, compared to the suffering my dad went through being \ntortured in a Cuban prison, that is all mild. To be honest, compared to \nthe\n\n[[Page S6791]]\n\nsingle moms who are just wanting to provide for their kids, give them a \ngood home, give them a good example, help them get a good future, the \nretribution any political party can impose on us for daring to buck the \nleadership is so mild and inconsequential, it is not even worth \nmentioning.\n  Let me encourage every Democratic Senator to try to meet that \ndefinition of morality:\n\n       Judgment to distinguish right and wrong, vision to see the \n     truth, and courage to act upon it; dedication to that which \n     is good, integrity to stand by the good at any price.\n\n  Let me encourage my Republican colleagues, there may be some \nRepublicans who are inclined to vote for cloture on this bill, to give \nmajority leader Harry Reid and the Democrats the ability to fund \nObamaCare on a straight party-line vote, as some of my colleagues have \npublicly said they are so inclined. It is my sincere hope that between \nnow and the vote on Friday or Saturday, their better angels prevail.\n  Listen, any Democrat who crosses the aisle to vote with us will face \nswift retribution, but at the end of the day we have a higher \nobligation. We have an obligation to the constituents who sent us here.\n  Any Republican--I know there are some Republicans who are saying: I \nam going to support cloture. I am going to support giving Harry Reid \nthe ability to fund ObamaCare. Why? Because my leadership is telling me \nto, and I am a good soldier. I will salute and march into battle in \nwhatever direction leadership instructs.\n  I will confess that Republicans are sometimes even more susceptible \nto such commands to being orderly. Let me commend to every Republican, \nask yourself that same test that Ayn Rand laid out.\n\n       What is morality, she asked. Judgment to distinguish right \n     and wrong, vision to see the truth, and courage to act upon \n     it; dedication to that which is good, integrity to stand by \n     the good at any price.\n\n  I can tell you this: If any one of the 46 Republicans in this body \nasks not what does our party leadership want us to do but asks the more \nimportant question of, what do our constituents want us to do, I tell \nyou this: If I get any gathering of Texans, Texans are not conflicted. \nIf I ask a gathering of Texans--and by the way, it doesn't matter what \npart of Texas--east Texas, west Texas, the panhandle, down in the \nvalley.\n  I was in a gathering down in the valley a few weeks ago. The Rio \nGrande Valley in Texas is the poorest part of the State.\n  My friend Senator Lee knows the valley well because he was a \nmissionary down in the valley. In fact, he has darned good Spanish as a \nresult of living in the valley in Texas. In fact, I think that gives \nTexas a reason to claim him unofficially as a third Senator. He may not \nacquiesce to that, but we will claim him anyway.\n  I was at a gathering in the valley a few weeks ago, 200, 300 people. \nI would guess a significant percentage if not a majority of the people \nin that room were probably Democrats. A majority of them were Mexican \nAmericans.\n  You know, I try to make a policy of giving the same remarks standing \nfor the same principles regardless of whether I am talking with a group \nI think will necessarily agree with me or will not.\n  The bulk of the remarks I gave to that group before taking Q and A \nfrom the group for some time were focused on defunding ObamaCare, and \nit was really striking that in that group, which was largely if not \npredominantly Hispanic Democrats in the valley in Texas, when it came \nto defunding ObamaCare, to stopping the train wreck that is ObamaCare, \nthe result was rousing sustained applause and cheers. Why? Because if \nyou get out of the partisan prison that is Washington, it is not \ncomplicated.\n  There is a reason why labor unions want out. There is a reason the \nTeamsters, who describe that they have been knocking on doors as loyal \nfoot soldiers for the Democratic Party, are saying: This is a \nnightmare. Repeal ObamaCare. Repeal it because it is a nightmare.\n  There is a reason why Members of Congress, why Majority Leader Reid \nand Democratic Senators who support ObamaCare so much for the American \npeople said: Good golly, get us out from under it. We certainly do not \nwant to be subject to the same rules the American people are.\n  There is a reason why the IRS employees' union is saying: Even though \nwe are enforcing ObamaCare, please get us out from under it.\n  Under the objective facts, this is not working.\n  I urge every Republican who is here, before you make a decision how \nto vote on cloture on this bill on Friday or Saturday--and I think \ncertainly in the time I have been in the Senate this is the most \nconsequential vote I will cast and I believe any Member of this body \nwill cast during the time I have been here--I ask every Republican to \nask not simply what this party leadership wants you to do but what is \nthe right thing to do for your constituents. If you gather 100 of your \nconstituents together in a room and you ask them: How should I vote on \nthis motion--let me frame it a little more explicitly because, you \nknow, politicians are sometimes crafty characters. Some politicians \nsay: I could get 100 of my citizens, and I could frame in some abstract \nprocedural way how I would vote on the cloture to take up the bill to \ndo the whatchamacallit and it would really be supporting the House \nbill. What do you think? We can talk fast enough that we can confuse \nsome people in the room for a few minutes.\n  But let me suggest to any Republican Senator, gather at random 100 of \nyour constituents--I am going to suggest even broader: not 100 \nRepublicans, 100 constituents--and pose the following question to them: \nShould I as your Republican Senator vote to allow Harry Reid and the \nDemocrats to fully fund ObamaCare with no changes, no improvements to \naddress the train wreck that is ObamaCare on a purely party-line \npartisan vote of only Democrats? I will wager all the money in my bank \naccount that every one of the--by the way, you could pick the bluest \nState for which a Republican Senator represents that State--I will \nwager that in that State, if you grab 100 of your constituents, it \nwould not be a 50-50 proposition. I don't even think it would be a 60-\n40 proposition. Your constituents overwhelmingly would say: No, don't \nvote to give Harry Reid the ability to fund ObamaCare without fixing \nthis train wreck, without stopping this nightmare.\n  All that it takes for us to do the right thing is to listen to the \npeople. It is not complicated. It is not rocket science. Listen to the \npeople.\n  Ayn Rand in ``Atlas Shrugged'' also held:\n\n       The nation which once held the creed that greatness is \n     achieved by production is now told that it is achieved by \n     squalor.\n\n  She also observed:\n\n       Fight for the value of your person. Fight for the virtue of \n     your pride. Fight for the essence of that which is man: for \n     his sovereign rational mind. Fight with the radiant certainty \n     and the absolute rectitude of knowing that yours is the \n     Morality of Life and that yours is the battle for any \n     achievement, any value, any grandeur, any goodness, any joy \n     that has ever existed on this earth.\n       God has created men and women to be free creatures. It is \n     not benefiting anyone to strip them of their liberty, to make \n     them dependent on government.\n\n  I cannot tell you how many times I have said: Thank the good Lord \nthat when my dad was a teenage immigrant in Texas 55 years ago, how \ngrateful I am that some well-meaning liberal did not come and put his \narm around him and say: Let me take care of you. Let me give you a \ngovernment check. Let me make you dependent on the government. Don't \nbother washing those dishes. Don't bother working. I am going to take \ncare of your every need. And by the way, don't bother learning English. \nI respect your culture so much that I am going to lock you out of the \nbusiness and professional classes in this country. I am going to make \nsure that if you do work, you are almost surely going to be consigned \nto menial labor because you cannot communicate with the significant \nmajority of Americans.\n  What a destructive thing to do to someone. If someone had done that \nto my father and he had listened, I am hard-pressed to think of \nanything that would have been more destructive.\n  At the end of the day these points are not partisan or ideological; \nthey are common sense. They are who we are as Americans. Ask any abuelo \nor abuela: What do you want for your grandkids? Do you want your \ngrandkids dependent on government? Do you want your grandkids receiving \ngovernment support or do you want them working? Do\n\n[[Page S6792]]\n\nyou want them working in a job, working hard? Do you want them climbing \nthe economic ladder to success? Do you want them in a career where they \ncan have a better life than you had and their parents had? Do you want \nthem working in a job? I don't know of a grandmother in this country \nwho would find that a difficult choice. That is a choice that is basic \ncommon sense. It is fundamentally destructive to the human spirit not \nto be able to work and stand on your own feet.\n\n  After standing here for 14 hours, I can say that when you are \nstanding on your own feet, sometimes there is pain and sometimes some \nfatigue that is involved. But you know what. There is far more pain \ninvolved in rolling over, far more pain in hiding in the shadows, far \nmore pain in not standing for principle, not standing for the good, not \nstanding for integrity. That is what it means to be an American. We do \nthe hard things.\n  To all the Republicans who say fighting this fight is going to be \nvery hard, I sure hope they didn't run for the Senate because they \nwanted something easy to do. I sure hope they didn't run for the Senate \nbecause they wanted to avoid hard challenges. To the Democrats who say, \nI couldn't buck the party leadership, gosh, it would make the White \nHouse mad, make the party leadership mad, and make our leadership in \nthe Senate mad, we have to be united, Team, team, team. We are not a \nteam. We represent the people. You know the team that each of us is on? \nIt is the American team. It is a team where we have an obligation to \nthe men and women who sent us here. Let me be clear: We have an \nobligation to all the men and women who sent us here. I have an \nobligation not just to Republicans in the State of Texas and not just \nto those who voted for me in the State of Texas, although there were \nquite a few voters in the State of Texas who voted for President Obama \nand voted for me.\n  If you listen to Washington conventional wisdom, they would suggest \nthat is impossible. I was pleased to get a number of Texans who did \nthat. Even those who voted against me and disagree with everything I am \ndoing, I still have an obligation to represent them and to try to use \nmy best judgment and try to listen to them and fight for them.\n  I am convinced that every one of the 26 million Texans in my State \nwill be better. They will have a better future, a better life, and an \nenvironment where economic growth comes back and small businesses are \nthriving and creating jobs and not shrinking. They will have \nopportunities so they are not forced into part-time work but will have \nfull-time opportunities so more people who are like my dad--teenaged \nkids who can't speak English--can get that first job washing dishes. \nThat first job helps them to get the second job, the third job, and the \nfourth job.\n  I believe in the American dream with all of my heart and might. The \nAmerican dream is being jeopardized by ObamaCare, and that is a \ntravesty that should outrage and horrify everyone in the Senate. For \neveryone on the Republican side who said this is hard, we might be \nblamed; there might be some political blame; let's let it all \ncollapse--I have heard Republicans say, especially the pundits, Gosh, \nto get on TV--I will tell you that one of the best ways to get on TV is \nto just advise and then run away from any battle that matters. They put \nyou on TV a lot if that is your advice.\n  What they say is, if Republicans stand and fight this fight, the \nPresident and Harry Reid might force a shutdown and Republicans might \nget blamed and, gosh, that could hurt us politically. Beyond that you \nmight hear--and this is the very clever Republicans--ObamaCare is such \na train wreck and a nightmare that we just need to sit quietly. James \nHoffa said he couldn't sit silent anymore, but Republicans say to sit \nsilently and let ObamaCare collapse on its own weight.\n  Never mind that Harry Reid said when it collapses on its own weight, \nit will lead us to single-payer socialized health care. Why? Because it \nwill destroy the private health insurance. Never mind that. We have \nbeen told that if we do nothing, it will collapse on its own weight and \neveryone will blame the Democrats.\n  Let me make it very clear: Who cares? Listen, if everyone will blame \nthe Democrats, then consider me the person trying to actively save the \nDemocrats from that blame. I would gladly celebrate any Democrat brave \nenough to stand and say: Listen, I used to think ObamaCare was a good \nidea. I supported it, and I am persuaded by the facts and by my \nconstituents. This thing isn't working. People are hurting.\n  When President Obama reversed course and listened to bipartisan calls \nto submit his decision to launch a unilateral military attack on Syria \nto the will of Congress, I happily and loudly praised President Obama \nfor submitting to the constitutional authority of this party. When he \nwent even further and listened to the calls from the American people \nnot to put us in the middle of that sectarian war, I again happily and \nenthusiastically praised President Obama for being willing to change \nhis mind and turn back because he listened to the voice of the American \npeople. That was the right thing to do.\n  For everyone who thinks this is hard, I would like to turn to some of \nmy favorite remarks from a Republican President who I suspect many on \nthe Democratic side of the aisle admire as well because he was one of \nthe most progressive Republicans, although he was not shy in any way, \nshape or form.\n  Indeed, Teddy Roosevelt was once giving a speech, and he was shot \nduring the speech. He finished the speech before seeking medical \nattention. There was an old episode on ``Saturday Night Live''--the \npages have probably never seen this--that was ``Quien es mas Macho,'' \nwhich means who is more macho. You know what. Teddy Roosevelt quien es \nmas macho. If you get shot while giving a speech and stand there and \nfinish the speech, you win. Even Sean Connery is looking at him and \ngoing, wow, that guy is tough.\n  I will read the words Teddy Roosevelt delivered at the Sorbonne in \nParis on April 23, 1910. These are words for everyone who thinks this \nfight is too hard or that we shouldn't take a risk or we shouldn't risk \npolitical blame. These are words that every one of us should listen to:\n\n       It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out \n     how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could \n     have done them better. The credit belongs to the man--\n\n     Or the woman--\n\n     who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust \n     and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who \n     comes short again and again, because there is no effort \n     without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive \n     to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great \n     devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the \n     best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and \n     who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring \n     greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and \n     timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.\n\n  Yes, you can avoid risk. You can avoid doing the hard thing. You can \navoid doing the things where you might get politically blamed. You can \nstay silent and hope that the other party gets blamed because there \nwill be political benefits for that. But I am going to suggest to you \nthat is not doing our job. That is not what we were elected to do.\n  We were elected to stand and fight to do the hard things for the men \nand women of this country because it is an extraordinary and \nbreathtaking privilege to serve in this body. I cannot tell you how it \nbrings me virtually to tears to think about the opportunity I have to \nstand here at a time when our Nation is threatened as I have never seen \nbefore. You know what. The tears that I talked about, and am now \nexperiencing a little bit, are a very small reflection of the very real \ntears I have seen from men and women all across Texas.\n  Men and women have looked me in the eyes and said: I am scared for my \ncountry, my kids, and my grandkids. We are losing America. We are \nlosing the wonderful free enterprise system. We are losing the \nprosperity. We are losing growth.\n  Will my kids and grandkids have a better life than I did? I don't \nthink so. I cannot tell you how many Texans have said that. You know \nwhat. When you say that, that is not something you say like reporting \nthe weather: It is sunny today and 78 degrees. That is heartbreaking. \nAs Americans, it is fundamental in who we are. We believe in a better \ntomorrow. We believe morning\n\n[[Page S6793]]\n\ncan come to America, and we believe our kids and grandkids will live \nwith a better challenge.\n  If we continue down this road, we will be mired in what I call the \ngreat stagnation. Over the last 4 years, our economy has grown on \naverage at 0.9 percent a year. If we continue down this road, we will \nallow young people to be what economists are starting to dub ``the lost \ngeneration.'' I am sorry to tell young people that is what economists \nare calling them right now. This generation is coming of age at a time \nwhen there is no economic growth and no real prospect for that to \nchange.\n  What it means as a practical matter is that young people are not \ngetting that first job or they are getting jobs--and as Ayn Rand \nobserved--that are far less than their mind, their capacity, and their \ntalent is capable of. What that means is they don't get their next job \nor their next job, so they don't develop to their full potential, and \nthat stays with young people for decades to come.\n  This body needs to listen to the American people. We need to make DC \nlisten.\n  Mr. LEE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEE. My question relates to the nature of our government and the \nnature of our system which is a system of laws. One of the reasons \nAmerica has been attractive to so many people over the last few \ncenturies and one of the reasons people have wanted to move here from \nall over the world is that this has always been a land of opportunity. \nIt has been a place where you can be born into one station in life and \ndie in a much better station. We worry that land of opportunity might \ncease to be. We worry about the fact that people are being trapped at \nthe bottom rungs of the economic ladder and finding it increasingly \ndifficult to move up along that ladder.\n  One of the reasons this is the case is because the distinction \nbetween what is properly within the domain of government and what is \nproperly within the domain of people is sometimes blurred. In other \ninstances, that which is properly within the domain of the Federal \nGovernment and properly within the domain of the State and local \ngovernments in this country is blurred.\n  On other occasions, it is because what is properly within the domain \nof the legislative branch is usurped by the executive branch or the \njudicial branch or a combination of the two. The more our legal system \nbecomes deteriorated, the less faithful it becomes to the blueprint \nthat was created for our government some 226 years ago, and the more we \nstruggle in this country.\n  I quoted James Madison earlier. I referred to something he said in \nFederalist No. 62. I have the actual text of the language, which I \nlargely paraphrased earlier, and I wish to expand on it a little more \nand explain some of what he was saying.\n  He writes:\n\n       It will be of little avail to the people that the laws are \n     made by men of their own choice, if the laws be so voluminous \n     that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot \n     be understood; if they be repealed or revised before they are \n     promulgated, or undergo such incessant changes that no man, \n     who knows what the law is to-day, can guess what it will be \n     to-morrow. Law is defined to be a rule of action; but how can \n     that be a rule, which is little known, and less \n     fixed? Another effect of public instability is the \n     unreasonable advantage it gives to the sagacious, the \n     enterprising, and the moneyed few over the industrious and \n     uninformed mass of the people. Every new regulation \n     concerning commerce or revenue, or in any way affecting \n     the value of the different species of property, presents a \n     new harvest to those who watch the change and can trace \n     its consequences; a harvest, reared not by themselves, but \n     by the toils and cares of the great body of their fellow-\n     citizens. This is a state of things in which it may be \n     said with some truth that laws are made for the few, not \n     for the many.\n       In another point of view, great injury results from an \n     unstable government. The want of confidence in the public \n     councils damps every useful undertaking, the success and \n     profit of which may depend on a continuance of existing \n     arrangements. What prudent merchant will hazard his fortunes \n     in any new branch of commerce when he knows not but that his \n     plans may be rendered unlawful before they can be executed? \n     What farmer or manufacturer will lay himself out for the \n     encouragement given to any particular cultivation or \n     establishment when he can have no assurance that his \n     preparatory labors and advances will not render him a victim \n     to an inconstant government? In a word, no great improvement \n     or laudable enterprise can go forward which requires the \n     auspices of a steady system of national policy.\n       But the most deplorable effect of all is that diminution of \n     attachment and reverence which steals into the hearts of the \n     people, towards a political system which betrays so many \n     marks of infirmity, and disappoints so many of their \n     flattering hopes. No government any more than an individual, \n     will long be respected without being truly respectable; nor \n     be truly respectable, without possessing a certain portion of \n     order and stability.\n\n  We see in this an age-old warning, a warning about what happens when \ngovernments do certain things which tend toward voluminous legislation, \nexcessive regulation, and deliberate manipulation by those who have \naccess to the power lovers of government, whereby they may commandeer \nthe economic machinery of an entire civilization--commandeer it to \ntheir advantage, and thereby secure a position at the top end of the \neconomic spectrum of that society. When people do this, they very \nfrequently use really long, really complex laws. They necessarily rely \non extensive regulation, the kind of regulation that can be found in a \n2,700-page law passed by Members of Congress who have not read it, who \npass it after being told they have to pass it in order to find out what \nis in it, who do so only to discover later that this 2,700-page piece \nof legislation has become 20,000 pages of regulation.\n  As we stand this evening, or this morning, or whatever we call this \ntime of day as we move forward together on this path toward standing \nwith the American people, I invite my colleagues to join me on a \njourney back to a place and time not unlike our own. It was a turbulent \ntime of deep division within our young Republic. George Washington \nrecorded the events of March 4, 1797--his last day as President of the \nUnited States. Washington wrote:\n\n       It was with a heavy heart that I left my room today \n     thinking not so much of myself as of our country . . .\n\n  Walking out onto Chestnut Street in Philadelphia, Washington \ncontinued:\n\n       I was plain George Washington now, neither general nor \n     President. Suddenly I realized I was not alone. People were \n     following me, at first only a few, then a swelling crowd.\n       For a long moment, I stood face to face with them--the \n     young cobbler, the carpenter, the storekeeper, the laborer. \n     All of them stood facing me. They said not a word. I realized \n     that providence was showing me a vision of America, of what \n     it will become. I could feel assured that, come what may, \n     whether it be political bickering . . . or any other evil in \n     government, . . . our country rests in good hands, in the \n     hands of its people . . .\n\n  A similar crowd we might say gathers every time people converge at a \ntownhall meeting. It is not necessarily a crowd consisting of \ncarpenters, storekeepers, laborers, and cobblers. It might well consist \nof a crowd including schoolteachers, Web designers, business \nconsultants, mothers and fathers and friends.\n  Every time I hold townhall meetings, as I look around the crowd and I \nsee groups of people represented from those groups I described, I think \nabout the fact that today, as in Washington's time, the hands of our \ngreat Nation rest in good hands. It rests in the hands of its people.\n  So hand in hand and acting on the instincts of our better angels and \nconnected in the principle of civil society and in the principles that \nallow our country to be great, we know that we the people and not we \nthe government will form a more perfect union and help ensure that the \nvision of George Washington becomes the destiny of the Nation.\n  Our discussions tonight have been about keeping the country in the \nhands of the people and making sure the government serves the people \nand not the other way around, making sure the people are in charge of \ntheir own government; that whenever the things that government does \nbecome destructive of the ability of the people to achieve happiness \nand secure their own lives and their liberty and their pursuit of \nhappiness, it is important that the people restore to themselves the \npower which is rightfully theirs.\n  Throughout the history of the world, in many civilizations, people \nhave called that idea radical. They have called it crazy. They have \ncalled it insane. Here we call it a very American ideal.\n\n[[Page S6794]]\n\n  Here, tonight, we have been talking a lot about this law. We have \nbeen talking a lot about our ability to defund this law which we \nbelieve has become destructive of the people. We have been told by some \nof our colleagues--some from within our own party--that this effort is \nfutile, that we shouldn't fight it because, as we are told over and \nover, we don't have the votes. Those things can change and they do \nchange when the people speak to their elected representatives and they \nask their elected representatives to do that which they were sent to \nour Nation's capital to do.\n  There is a man named William Morris, a man whose political philosophy \nI don't share in many respects, but a man who occasionally said things \nthat were profound and reflect broader truths.\n  William Morris once wrote:\n\n       One man with an idea in his head is in danger of being \n     considered a madman; two men with the same idea in common may \n     be foolish, but can hardly be mad; ten men sharing an idea \n     begin to act, a hundred draw attention as fanatics, a \n     thousand and society begins to tremble; a hundred thousand . \n     . . and the cause has victories tangible and real; and why \n     only a hundred thousand? Why not a hundred million and more . \n     . . ? You and I who agree together, it is we who have to \n     answer that question.\n\n  So when we find ourselves with an idea in our head, when we find \nourselves listening to people, people who might begin with a chorus of \none calling out for Congress to do something to protect the American \npeople, we might be inclined to dismiss that one idea coming from that \none person as the product of madness. When two people join together, \nwhen 10, when 100, 1,000, 10,000, and so forth--with each order of \nmagnitude, we find that the idea acquires more potency, the idea \nacquires more lasting power, the idea moves more and more people.\n  The idea to defund ObamaCare is not new. It has been discussed since \n2010, since shortly after the law's enactment, since about the time \nwhen many people were predicting that the Republican Party might gain \ncontrol of at least one House of Congress. That is when it began in \nearnest.\n  We hoped, we expected, that once the Republican majority took hold, \nonce Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in \nJanuary 2011, in the wake of the 2010 election cycle, that the \ndefunding of ObamaCare would be imminent. In fact, H.R. 1, the \ncontinuing resolution, as I recall, was filed at the beginning of the \nlast Congress and originally was written to defund ObamaCare. I am not \nquite sure why that didn't move forward, but many expected it would \nhappen. It didn't happen. We have continued to pass continuing \nresolution after continuing resolution since January of 2011 to keep \nthe government funded and we have done so without defunding ObamaCare. \nThere have been reasons for that. There were many who expected the \nSupreme Court would invalidate ObamaCare, thus obviating the need for \nCongress to go through the process of defunding it and later repealing \nit. That didn't happen.\n  There were those who expected that a Republican would be elected to \nPresident of the United States in the 2012 election cycle, thereby \nmaking it possible for ObamaCare to be repealed or perhaps at least \nstalled out with the assistance of the President and with the \nassistance of an Executive order suspending many of its major \nprovisions. That, of course, didn't happen. We are now at the point \nwhen we are being asked to fund the operations of government \npotentially for the last time between now and the time when the law's \nmajor operative provisions will take effect.\n  This will not be the end of the debate, assuming this effort either \ndoes or doesn't succeed. I have no doubt this debate will continue for \nsome time. If we do not succeed in defunding ObamaCare at this point, \nit doesn't mean the cause is lost forever. It may nonetheless mean it \nbecomes far more difficult to stop this law.\n  Once a law such as this takes effect, it is frequently suggested it \nwill be much harder to stop, much harder to defund, and much harder to \nrepeal down the road. So before we take this step, I think it is \nappropriate that we consider very seriously defunding this law's \nimplementation and enforcement, especially in light of taking into \naccount the potentially devastating impact this law will have, could \nhave, and is already having on our Nation's workers, the impact it is \nhaving with regard to wages, to employment opportunities, to access to \nhealth care, and to the cost of health care. We have to take that very \nseriously, as the House of Representatives has done in passing this \ncontinuing resolution.\n\n  As we take that up, we have to remember the fate of this Nation lies \nin good hands. It lies in the hands of the American people--the people \nwho were represented well by the House of Representatives when it \npassed the continuing resolution funding the operations of government, \nwhile defunding ObamaCare.\n  I ask Senator Cruz the question: What can we do as citizens, what can \nwe do as Senators, to make sure the hands of our government will, \nindeed, remain in good hands, in the hands of its people, rather than \nin the hands of a perpetual oligarchy, albeit an elected oligarchy, a \nbipartisan political establishment that might limit the freedom of the \nAmerican people?\n  (Mr. DONNELLY assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from Utah for that very fine question. \nThe answer as to what we can do is to do what we must, as Americans, \nwhat we always have, which is to take the responsibility on ourselves, \non our shoulders, to step forward, to engage.\n  Edmund Burke famously said: The only thing necessary for evil to \nprevail is for good men to do nothing.\n  One of the tremendous aspects of the American character is Americans \nhave never been willing to sit back and do nothing.\n  People all over this country are disillusioned. They are \ndisillusioned because Washington does not listen to us. They are \ndisillusioned because Democratic Senators do not listen to the people \nand Republican Senators do not listen to the people. I understand that \ndisillusionment. I feel the same way. Everywhere I go in Texas that \nsentiment is expressed. I do not think there is a State in the Union \nwhere they do not feel that sense.\n  But there are moments--moments in time when we can change that. You \nthink back to earlier this year, to another filibuster that occurred on \nthis Senate floor with our friend Senator Rand Paul, when he was \nstanding up to the administration's drone policy.\n  Senator Paul began that filibuster, if I remember correctly, at 11:45 \na.m. When he started, virtually every Senator in this Chamber viewed \nwhat he was doing as an odd crusade. They did not support it. They did \nnot even understand it. What matters if the Federal Government can use \na drone to target a U.S. citizen, to kill a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil? \nWhat matters that, thought most Senators.\n  Senator Paul began a brave crusade. I would note, during that \nfilibuster, I was honored to stand side by side with my good friend \nSenator Lee as we were the first two Senators to stand in support of \nthat and to battle the length of those 13 hours in defense of the \nConstitution.\n  During the course of that filibuster, we saw what happens when the \nAmerican people get engaged. Because the American people got engaged at \nan incredible level, and it forced a change. For 3 consecutive weeks, \nPresident Obama had refused to do what he did that very next day, which \nwas admit in writing that the Constitution limits his authority to \ntarget U.S. citizens.\n  Indeed, earlier that day before the filibuster began, it so happened \nthat Attorney General Eric Holder was testifying before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. Senator Lee and I were both there as part of that \ntestimony. I remember an exchange with the Attorney General where three \ntimes I asked the Attorney General if, in his view, the Constitution \nallowed the U.S. Government to kill a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil if that \nindividual did not pose an imminent threat, and three times he \nresponded: I do not think it would be appropriate to do so.\n  The first time he gave that response, I responded to the Attorney \nGeneral. I said: Mr. Attorney General, you seem to have misunderstood \nmy question. I was not asking about propriety. After all, he was not \nthere testifying as an etiquette columnist for the local newspaper. I \nsaid: You are the Attorney General of the United States. You are the \nchief law enforcement officer for the United States of America. Does \nthe\n\n[[Page S6795]]\n\nDepartment of Justice have a position on whether the Constitution \nallows the U.S. Government to use a drone to target and kill a U.S. \ncitizen on U.S. soil if that individual does not pose an imminent \nthreat? Again, the response was: I do not think it would be \nappropriate.\n  After the third time, I almost felt as if the response was: I do not \nunderstand this Constitution to which you are referring. Finally, he \nconceded in that back and forth: Well, when I say ``appropriate,'' I \nmean ``constitutional,'' which I find a curious notion that somehow \n``appropriate'' and ``constitutional'' are coterminous.\n  You want to talk about what the American people can do? We saw during \nthat, had not that filibuster and the American people mobilized, \nPresident Obama would have never admitted in writing what he admitted \nthat next day, which was the Constitution limits his authority. And \nthat matters.\n  We saw another example with the gun debate. Following the tragic \nshooting in Newtown, CT--which every one of us was horrified at--the \nPresident, sadly, did not come out and say: Let us go after violent \ncriminals.\n  And listen, I think we should come down on violent criminals like a \nton of bricks. Instead, the President, unfortunately, took it as an \nopportunity to go after the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding \ncitizens, instead of targeting violent criminals, those who would prey \non the innocent.\n  The conventional wisdom in Washington was the momentum behind those \nefforts was unstoppable. Indeed, all the talking heads, the same \ntalking heads who during Rand's filibuster said this is foolish, this \nis a fool's errand, this cannot work--the American people rose up and \nspoke and that was proven wrong.\n  During the gun debate, those same talking heads--it is interesting, \nin the world of punditry there are no consequences for being proven \nwrong. You just keep going back to making those same gosh darn \npredictions. And you know what. If you keep making the same prediction \noften enough, eventually it is going to prove right.\n  In the gun debate all those same talking heads said: You cannot stop \nit. This is unstoppable. What happened again? The American people got \ninvolved by the thousands, by the tens of thousands, calling their \nSenators, e-mailing their Senators, speaking out at townhalls, saying: \nDefend the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. We want the \nconstitutional rights of law-abiding citizens to be protected.\n\n  I remember on the floor of this Senate, when it came for a vote, \nevery single proposal of the President that would have undermined the \nSecond Amendment was voted down. That astonished observers. They said \nit was impossible. It was impossible until the American people engaged.\n  As we discussed not too long ago with Syria, the President advocated, \nsaid he was going to engage in a unilateral military strike within \ndays. It was imminent. It was happening. There was bipartisan support \nfrom the leadership of both Houses of Congress. All those same \npundits--Mr. President, if you are noticing a pattern here, there is a \npattern here. These same pundits over and over again said: Whatever \nPresident Obama says, that is inevitable. It cannot be stopped. There \nis nothing we can do about it. There is nothing to see here. Move on.\n  At first the President, quite rightly, listened to bipartisan calls \nto submit that decision to the constitutional authority of Congress. I \nwas quick to praise him for doing so. And, second, even more difficult, \nthe President showed the wisdom, the prudence to listen to the voice of \nthe American people when the American people spoke out overwhelmingly \nand said: We do not want to be involved in a sectarian civil war in \nSyria when we do not have a dog in the fight, when the rebels are in \nsome significant way allied with Al Qaeda, Al-Nusra, radical \nterrorists, when there is no national security interest in getting us \nin the middle of this. It was overwhelming, and the entire ship of \nstate turned on a dime. What was inevitable stopped. And it stopped \nbecause of the American people.\n  So the question my friend Senator Lee asked--what can the American \npeople do? Do the same thing. But let me tell you now, you have to do \nit 10 times louder. You have to do it in even greater volume. Because I \nam sorry to say, Members of this body are dug in at a level they were \nnot dug in on drones, at a level they were not dug in on guns, at a \nlevel they were not dug in on Syria.\n  The Democrats in this body, I am sorry to say, have not yet shown the \nwillingness to speak out like James Hoffa of the Teamsters has, have \nnot yet shown the willingness to speak out for their constituents and \nsay: ObamaCare is failing and it is not working.\n  The Republicans in this body--there are quite a few of them who are \nangry we are having this fight. They believe it is not worthy of the \ntime of this institution. They find themselves offended that the \nAmerican people would expect us not just to have a symbolic show vote \non a ObamaCare but actually to do something. Goodness gracious, this is \nCongress. We do not do something. Let's have another symbolic vote, and \nthen we can put out a press release.\n  About an hour ago, a member of my staff showed me that this \ndiscussion--even though virtually every Senator has gone home and gone \nto sleep--that this discussion, this debate is not just trending No. 1 \nin the United States, but in one way, shape, or form is trending No. 1, \nNo. 2, No. 3, and No. 4. I have never seen anything like that.\n  No. 2, I will confess, is Duck Dynasty, but I am going to claim Duck \nDynasty as part of it since not too long ago I took the opportunity to \nread some words of wisdom from Duck Dynasty and I suspect that is not \nentirely disconnected.\n  I have to admit, I have seen things trend No. 1. I have never seen \nthem trend Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 all at the same time.\n  Given the Senate Chamber has been largely empty for most of the \nnight, it is self-evident that kind of involvement from the American \npeople is not a factor of personalities. It is not a factor of myself \nor Mike or anyone else. And by the way, everyone who wants to distract \nfrom the subject of this debate will try to make it about \npersonalities. If they can get the Washington press corps to write \nstories about personal flights, about back and forth, about civil war--\nmy goodness, how many times have we seen the words ``civil war'' in the \nlast week in the press? I am wondering if reporters have it now on a \nmacro: ``Alt'' ``C'' and it types ``civil war.'' Who cares? You know \nwhat. If you get out of Washington, DC, I do not know anyone who cares. \nWhat Americans care about is they want jobs back. They want economic \ngrowth back. They want to get back to work. They want their health care \nnot to be taken away because of ObamaCare. Every effort to talk about \nanything else is all a deliberate effort to distract from the issue \nthat matters.\n  The reason this is trending Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 is because, for a \nmoment, at least, some in this body are listening to the American \npeople. I hope and believe and think that a great many Americans want \nto believe that more of us will do so, that more of us on the \nRepublican side of the aisle and more of us on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle will forget party, forget the battle, and actually listen to \nthe people and fight to fix these problems.\n  The question Senator Lee asked is: What can the American people do? I \nwill say, nothing gets the attention of elected representatives more \nthan hearing from their constituents in jaw-dropper numbers, in phone \ncalls and e-mails and tweets and Facebook posts.\n  Some Members of this body express annoyance that why would their \nconstituents have the temerity to dictate to us--the solons of \nWashington--what to do. The answer is simple. Because our constituents \nare our boss. We work for them. They have every right to dictate to us.\n  I will note, on a lighter note, my friend Congressman Louie Gohmert, \nwho has been here all night, handed me something that was quite nice. \nIt is from the Daily News. It ran on Friday, November 4, 1949. It is \nentitled ``Ode to the Welfare State.'' It reads:\n\n       Mr. Truman's St. Paul, Minn., pie-for-everybody speech last \n     night reminded us that, at the tail-end of the recent session \n     of Congress, Representative Clarence J. Brown (R-Ohio) jammed \n     into the Congressional Record the following poem, describing \n     its author only as ``a prominent Democrat of the State of \n     Georgia'':\n\n[[Page S6796]]\n\n  It is titled ``Democratic Dialogue.''\n\n     Father must I go to work?\n     No, my lucky son.\n     We're living now on Easy Street\n     On dough from Washington.\n     We've left it up to Uncle Sam,\n     So don't get exercised.\n     Nobody has to give a damn--\n\n  We've all been subsidized.\n\n     But if Sam treats us all so well\n     And feeds us milk and honey,\n     Please daddy, tell me what the heck\n     He's going to use for money.\n     Don't worry bub, there's not a hitch\n     In this here noble plan--\n     He simply soaks the filthy rich\n     And helps the common man.\n     But father, won't there come a time\n     When they run out of cash\n     And we have left them not a dime\n     When things will go to smash?\n     My faith in you is shrinking son,\n     You nosy little brat.\n     You do too damn much thinking son,\n     To be a Democrat.\n\n  That is from the Daily News, Friday, November 4, 1949, apparently \ninserted into the Congressional Record by a Member of Congress.\n  Let's take it a different direction. We talked about liberty, liberty \nthat is at stake here. I want to talk about that same principle. On one \nlevel, on the real, on the personal, on the hard-working American \nfamilies, they are facing a loss of jobs. They are facing small \nbusinesses that are not growing. They are facing skyrocketing health \ninsurance premiums. They are facing losing their health insurance.\n  But on another level, we are facing an assault on liberty. Before, we \nwent through some of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged. Now, I want to go \nfurther back to 1850, to read some excerpts from a classic that I would \nrecommend to everyone to read, Frederic Bastiat's, ``The Law.'' The Law \nis a primer in free enterprise.\n\n       Though expansion of government programs may be tempting, \n     the designers often have selfish aims, and the program almost \n     always thwarts the liberty and prosperity of the people.\n\n  He warns of the dangers of programs and the way in which government \nprograms deprive the people of their rights. So Bastiat observes:\n\n       Life is a gift from God, which includes all others. This \n     gift is life--physical, intellectual, and moral life.\n       But life cannot maintain itself alone. The Creator of life \n     has entrusted us with the responsibility of preserving, \n     developing and perfecting it. In order that we may accomplish \n     this, he has provided us with a collection of marvelous \n     faculties. And He has put us in the midst of a variety of \n     natural resources. By the application of our faculties to \n     these natural resources, we convert them into products, and \n     use them. This process is necessary in order that life may \n     run its appointed course.\n       Life, faculties, production--in other words, individuality, \n     liberty, property--this is man. And in spite of the cunning \n     and artful political leaders, these three gifts from God \n     precede all human legislation, and are superior to it. Life, \n     liberty, and property do not exist because men have made \n     laws. On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, \n     and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws \n     in the first place.\n       Each of us has a natural right--from God--to defend his \n     person, his liberty, and his property. These are the three \n     basic requirements of life, and the preservation of any one \n     of them is completely dependent on the preservation of the \n     other two. For what are our faculties but the extension of \n     our individuality? And what is property but an extension of \n     our faculties? If every person has the right to defend even \n     by force--his person, his liberty, and his property, then it \n     follows that a group of men have the right to organize and \n     support a common force to protect these rights constantly.\n       Thus the principle of collective rights--its reason for \n     existing, its lawfulness--is based on individual right. And \n     the common force that protects this collective right cannot \n     logically have any other purpose or any other mission than \n     that for which it acts as a substitute. Thus, since an \n     individual cannot lawfully use force against the person, \n     liberty, or property of another individual, then the common \n     force--for the same reason--cannot lawfully be used to \n     destroy the person, liberty, or property of individuals or \n     groups.\n       Property and plunder. Man can live and satisfy his wants \n     only by ceaseless labor; by the ceaseless application of his \n     faculties to natural resources. This process is the origin of \n     property.\n       But it is also true that a man may live and satisfy his \n     wants by seizing and consuming the products of the labor of \n     others. This process is the origin of plunder.\n       Now, since man is naturally inclined to avoid pain--and \n     since labor is pain in itself--it follows that men will \n     resort to plunder whenever plunder is easier than work. \n     History shows this quite clearly. And under these conditions, \n     neither religion nor morality can stop it.\n       When, then, does plunder stop? It stops when it becomes \n     more painful and more dangerous than labor.\n       It is evident, then, that the proper purpose of law is to \n     use the power of its collective force to stop this fatal \n     tendency to plunder instead of to work. All the measures of \n     the law should protect property and punish plunder.\n       But, generally, the law is made by one man or one class of \n     men. And since law cannot operate without the sanction and \n     support of a dominating force, this force must be entrusted \n     to those who make the laws.\n\n  That would be us.\n\n       This fact, combined with the fatal tendency that exists in \n     the heart of man to satisfy his wants with the least effort \n     possible, explains the almost universal perversion of the \n     law. Thus it is easy to understand how law, instead of \n     checking injustice, becomes the invincible weapon of \n     injustice. It is easy to understand why the law is used by \n     the legislator to destroy in varying degrees among the \n     rest of the people, their personal independence by \n     slavery, their liberty by oppression, and their property \n     by plunder. This is done for the benefit of the person who \n     makes the law, and in proportion to the power that he \n     holds.\n\n  I would note throughout the course of this debate, the central theme \nI have been focusing on is the disconnect between Washington and the \npeople and the practice right now of Democrats and Republicans not to \nlisten to the people. Let me read again that sentence from Bastiat \nwritten in 1850--not written in response to the Senate in 2013--in \n1850. He says:\n\n       This is done for the benefit of the person who makes the \n     law, and in proportion to the power he holds.\n\n  It seems almost as though Bastiat were writing about Congress right \nnow, about the Obama administration granting exemptions from ObamaCare \nto the friends, to those with political influence, the giant \ncorporations, and to Members of Congress. Why do Members of Congress \nget an exemption from ObamaCare that hard-working American families do \nnot?\n  Bastiat tells us this 160 years ago. This is done for the benefit of \nthe person who makes the law and in proportion to the power he holds. \nBastiat goes on to talk about the victims of lawful plunder.\n\n       Men naturally rebel against the injustice of which they are \n     victims. Thus, when plunder is organized by law for the \n     profit of those who make the law, all the plundered classes \n     try somehow to enter--by peaceful or revolutionary means--\n     into the making of laws. According to their degree of \n     enlightenment, these plundered classes may propose one of two \n     entirely different purposes when they attempt to attain \n     political power: Either they may wish to stop lawful plunder, \n     or they may wish to share in it.\n\n  Now, let me note at this point, this goes directly to the question \nSenator Lee asked a little bit earlier this morning: What can the \nAmerican people do? The plundered class, the hard-working American \nfamilies that are finding their jobs going away, that are finding \neconomic growth stripped away, they are finding themselves forcibly put \ninto part-time work. They are seeing their health insurance premiums \nskyrocket or are seeing their health insurance jeopardized or taken \naway. They can come together and force our elected officials in both \nparties to listen to the people--make DC listen. That is what Bastiat \nis talking about there.\n\n       Woe to the nation when this latter purpose prevails among \n     the mass victims of lawful plunder when they, in turn, seize \n     the power to make laws! Until that happens, the few practice \n     lawful plunder upon the many, a common practice where the \n     right to participate in the making of law is limited to a few \n     persons. But then, participation in the making of law becomes \n     universal. And then, men seek to balance their conflicting \n     interests by universal plunder. Instead of rooting out the \n     injustices found in society, they make these injustices \n     general.\n       As soon as the plundered classes gain political power, they \n     establish a system of reprisals against the other classes. \n     They do not abolish legal plunder. (This objective would \n     demand more enlightenment than they possess.) Instead, they \n     emulate their evil predecessors by participating in this \n     legal plunder, even though it is against their own interest.\n       It is as if it were necessary, before a reign of justice \n     appears, for everyone to suffer a cruel retribution--some for \n     their evilness, and some for their lack of understanding.\n\n  It is almost as if that sentence was written about ObamaCare. I would \nsuggest when you read that sentence and then you pick up and read the \nletter from James Hoffa of the Teamsters saying: We knocked on doors. \nWe supported President Obama. We block walked. We phone called. We \nsupported your agenda. Now we have discovered\n\n[[Page S6797]]\n\nthat this law, which is your signature achievement that you fought for, \nis a nightmare that is hurting millions of Americans and their \nfamilies. That is what James Hoffa said. Or, as Bastiat said:\n\n       It is as if it were necessary, before a reign of justice \n     appears, for everyone to suffer a cruel retribution--some for \n     their evilness, and some for their lack of understanding.\n\n  Bastiat continued.\n\n       Enforced Fraternity Destroys Liberty.\n       Mr. De Lamartine once wrote to me thusly: Your doctrine is \n     only the half of my program. You have stopped at liberty; I \n     go on to fraternity.\n       I answered him: The second half of your program will \n     destroy the first. In fact, it is impossible for me to \n     separate the word fraternity from the word voluntary. I \n     cannot possibly understand how fraternity can be legally \n     enforced without liberty being legally destroyed, and thus \n     justice being legally trampled underfoot.\n       Legal plunder has two roots: One of them, as I have said \n     before, is in human greed; the other is in false \n     philanthropy.\n       At this point, I think that I should explain exactly what I \n     mean by the word plunder. Plunder violates ownership. I do \n     not, as is often done, use the word in any vague, uncertain, \n     approximate, or metaphorical sense. I use it in its \n     scientific acceptance--as expressing the idea opposite to \n     that of property [wages, land, money, or whatever.] When a \n     portion of wealth is transferred from the person who owns \n     it--without his consent and without compensation, and whether \n     by force or by fraud--to anyone who does not own it, then I \n     say that property is violated; that an act of plunder is \n     committed.\n       I say that this act is exactly what the law is supposed to \n     suppress, always and everywhere. When the law itself commits \n     this act that it is so supposed to suppress, I say that \n     plunder is still committed, and I add that from the point of \n     view of society and welfare, this aggression against rights \n     is even worse. In the case of legal plunder, however, the \n     person who receives the benefits is not responsible for the \n     act of plundering. The responsibility for this legal plunder \n     rests with the law, the legislator, and society itself. \n     Therein lies the political danger.\n       The Law and Charity. You say: There are persons who have no \n     money, and you turn to the law. But the law is not a breast \n     that fills itself with milk. Nor are the lacteal veins of the \n     law supplied with milk from a source outside the society. \n     Nothing can enter the public treasury for the benefit of one \n     citizen or one class unless another citizen or other classes \n     have been forced to send it in.\n       If every person draws from the treasury the amount that he \n     has put in it, it is true that the law plunders nobody. But \n     this procedure does nothing for the persons who have no \n     money. It does not promote equality of income. The law can be \n     an instrument of equalization only as it takes from some \n     persons and gives to other persons. When the law does this, \n     it is an instrument of plunder.\n\n  I would note the adage that any legislator who proposes to rob Peter \nto pay Paul can always count on the support of Paul.\n  Going back to Bastiat:\n\n       With this in mind, examine the protective tariffs, \n     subsidies, guaranteed profits, guaranteed jobs, relief and \n     welfare schemes, public education, progressive taxation, free \n     credit, and public works. You will find that they are always \n     based on legal plunder, organized injustice.\n       Legislators Desire to Mold Mankind.\n       Now let us examine Raynal on this subject of mankind being \n     molded by the legislator. The legislator must first consider \n     the climate, the air, and the soil. The resources at his \n     disposal determine his duties. He must first consider his \n     locality. A population living on maritime shores must have \n     laws designed for navigation. . . . If it is an inland \n     settlement, the legislator must make his plans according to \n     the nature and the fertility of the soil.\n\n  Frederic Bastiat--1915--explained principles of liberty that continue \nacross the ages, principles of liberty that we owe it to every man and \nwoman in America to protect his or her life, liberty, and property. \nObamaCare does violence to the natural rights of every American; it \ndoes violence to their opportunity.\n  Do you know the cruelest joke of all? ObamaCare has been justified: \nLet's help the least among us. That is a noble goal. We should all care \nabout helping the least among us. The cruelest irony is that the people \nwho are being hurt the most by ObamaCare are the least among us.\n  The rich, as the President frequently inveighs, millionaires and \nbillionaires, are not hurt by ObamaCare. They are doing just fine. In \nfact, they are doing better. The richest segment of this country is \ndoing better today than they were when President Obama was elected.\n  Who is getting hurt? Who is losing their jobs? Who is not finding \njobs? Who is getting their hours forcibly reduced to 29 hours a week? \nWho is losing their health insurance?\n  I have read one letter after another from people across Texas and \nacross this country, and not one of these letters said: I am \nindependently wealthy, cruising on my yacht in the Caribbean, and yet \nObamaCare has crimped my style. That is not what is happening. These \nare letters I read from the retired couple in Bayou Vista who had saved \ntheir whole life to buy their home, and now they are at risk of losing \ntheir home because of ObamaCare.\n  Let me read from another constituent in Houston, TX, my hometown, who \non July 11, 2013, wrote:\n\n       My wife and I are currently both working jobs where there \n     is no provided health care coverage. My wife is a self-\n     employed physician and I am in sales. We have never gone \n     without health coverage our entire lives.\n       My father was in the military, so I had health care until I \n     graduated college. My wife had coverage through her parents \n     until she graduated. We never wanted to go without coverage, \n     so anytime our coverage had a break we went ahead and bought \n     catastrophic short-term coverage, even knowing we would have \n     coverage soon.\n       While my wife was in medical school, I had employer \n     coverage, and I bought an individual policy for her because \n     it was much less costly than group coverage. When my \n     employment status changed and neither of us had employer \n     coverage, I bought individual policies for both of us. We \n     would not risk going without health insurance.\n       Because we were both young and healthy at the time, the \n     policies were very affordable, about $130 a month. Purchasing \n     coverage was a no brainer.\n       While in her residency, we got family coverage through her \n     work. When she finished her residency in 2012, neither of us \n     had employer coverage, so it came time for another policy. We \n     looked around at all the options for a family of four, two \n     30-year-old adults, a 2-year-old boy and a newborn girl. We \n     found a HTIP plan for $400 a month with a $10,000 deductible.\n       We also had scrimped and saved so that in the event we had \n     a catastrophe we would have a deductible coverage. After that \n     our plan paid for 100 percent. This is the best coverage I \n     had ever purchased. I had become an educated consumer in \n     health care, shopping around for the best deals on \n     medications, and informing doctors of our situation so they \n     coded it properly. When we needed care we opted for urgent \n     care and physicians' offices instead of emergency rooms.\n       Many of my young healthy friends now have these plans, \n     either individually purchased or through their employers. As \n     of January 1, most of these plans will go away for us, as \n     most of my friends are around 30 years old. These plans are \n     actually decreasing the cost of health care as they inspire \n     us to be educated consumers. Unlike what the President said, \n     I don't get to ``keep my plan.''\n       I never thought that not purchasing insurance would be an \n     option for my family. I have done a fair amount of research \n     using the IRS info, current and estimated prices, even my own \n     insurance company's estimates. It looks like for the \n     cheapest, bronze plan, the estimated cost will be about \n     $1,600 per month, which is $20,000 per year. We don't qualify \n     for subsidies.\n       If I choose not to comply, I would pay a fine which, for \n     us, amounts to about $2,000 and save the $18,000 balance in a \n     bank account. Our fine will max out at about $5,000, so I \n     will still have $15,000 per year. I will now begin paying \n     cash for my health care and negotiate with doctors and \n     hospitals myself.\n       As I get older I will consider big insurance when it looks \n     like the cost-benefit ratio is better. No one in my family \n     has ever gone without coverage because health care is the No. \n     1 priority on our list. It still is, but this individual \n     mandate has caused us to consider going without insurance for \n     the first time. I would gladly keep my fine if I could keep \n     my current insurance, but that is not an option either.\n       Here is one of my friends' stories. He is a high school \n     teacher and his wife is a stay-at-home mom with two kids. His \n     district pays for all of his coverage and none of his \n     spouse's. This year they opted to purchase an individual \n     plan for her because it was more affordable, $150 a month \n     versus $500. Beginning January 1, she will be forced into \n     the exchange, where her estimated cost will be about $400.\n       They currently cannot afford this, and they don't qualify \n     for a subsidy because her employer offers coverage for her, \n     even though her income would qualify her for a 50 percent \n     subsidy. They will choose not to have insurance coverage on \n     them.\n\n  Many of the young, healthy people I have talked to told me they plan \nto go without insurance--people who currently purchase individual \nplans--because the coverage would be too expensive and the fine for \nmost of them is much less than the coverage.\n  As was told to the American people, if you like your health coverage, \nyou can keep it. We now know that promise was simply, objectively, 100 \npercent false. For Americans all over this country, the facts are \notherwise.\n  It is incumbent on us, representing our constituents, to look to the \nreality of these facts.\n\n[[Page S6798]]\n\n  Look to the young people. I don't think you could design a plan \ndesigned to harm young people more than ObamaCare. It is more than a \ncrying irony that some 70 percent of young people voted for the \nPresident. I recognize that young people didn't necessarily understand \nthe consequences of ObamaCare and how it is impacting their future. It \nis one of the things on which I hope this debate will focus.\n  If you are a young person coming out of school, have some student \nloans, and let's say you are hoping for a job and for a future, if you \ncan't get that first job or if you are forced into part-time work, you \nare not going to gain the skills you need to get that second job, the \nthird job, the fourth job, or to build a career, to get married, and to \nprovide for your family.\n  We read earlier from the Wall Street Journal describing how \neconomists now talk about young people as the ``lost generation.'' One \nof the striking consequences of this is that young people are putting \noff marriage and putting off kids. We know that has societal \nconsequences. That has societal consequences that are altogether \ndetrimental. And they are doing it not for matters of individual \nchoice, they are doing it because the economy is so terrible for young \npeople that they have no options. They have no options to provide for a \nspouse, to provide for kids, so they rationally choose not to begin \nthose families until they have a job sufficient to provide for their \nfamilies.\n  This thing isn't working. Every one of us owes it to our constituents \nto listen, to listen to the young people who are suffering, to listen \nto the single moms, to listen to the seniors, to listen to those with \ndisabilities, to listen to the African Americans, to listen to the \nHispanics who aren't getting jobs, are getting forcibly put in part-\ntime work, facing skyrocketing health insurance premiums, and who are \nlosing their health insurance.\n  We can vote party loyalty. That is easy to do. It is the way \nWashington often works. We can vote and say: Congress is exempted. We \nhave special rules that apply to us, so it is not our problem.\n  Yes, it hurts hard-working Americans. If there is one thing \nWashington knows how to do, it is ignore the plight of hard-working \nAmericans. Or we can show a level of coverage that has been rare in \nthis town and step up and say we will risk retribution from our own \nparties. We will stand up and speak the truth. We will stand up and \nchampion our constituents. Elected officials need to listen to the \npeople. Together, we must make D.C. listen.\n  Mr. LEE. Will the Seantor yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I yield for a question without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. LEE. As the Senator was mentioning, the fact that it is time for \npeople to stand for their own rights and it is time for the people's \nelected representatives in Washington to stand for them reminds me of \nthe fact that sometimes people do take this challenge, and sometimes \nthey don't. Sometimes people will square their shoulders heading into a \nchallenge, and other times people will simply engage in shoulder-\nshrugging and ignore problems all together.\n  A few years ago I was traveling through southern Utah with my family, \nand we went to a restaurant. It was sort of a fast food restaurant that \nhad a salad bar. For some strange reason, instead of ordering a \ncheeseburger, I ordered a salad. I don't know why, but I got the salad \nbar. I went through the salad bar with my plate, and I was putting all \nof these horribly healthy foods on my plate--lettuce, vegetables. Then \nI saw at the end of the salad bar something that I didn't expect, a \nlittle bonus. There was a little tub of chocolate pudding, and I \nthought, this is fantastic. I can feel like I am eating a healthy meal \nbecause I am eating a salad, but I get chocolate pudding in with salad, \nso I put a bunch of that on my salad plate.\n  I sat down a few minutes later, and, of course, rather than eating \nthe salad, I went right for the pudding. There was only one problem: \nThe pudding was disgusting. It was spoiled rotten. It tasted as if it \nhad been left out overnight unrefrigerated for 3 nights in a row, which \nis not a good thing.\n  I immediately thought, I have to find somebody who works here. I have \nto tell someone that the pudding is bad so that they don't have to deal \nwith any other customers eating rotten pudding. I found the nearest \nemployee of the restaurant. I said to her in a sort of hushed tone of \nvoice: Hey, the pudding is bad. You need to do something about it. You \nneed to replace it. It is rancid. It is spoiled rotten. Please do \nsomething about it.\n  She looked at me with a sort of blank stare. She couldn't have been \nolder than maybe 17 years old, and she just said: I am not on salad. \nThen she walked away. My response to that was, I am not suggesting that \nyou are on salad.\n  I all of a sudden wondered whether I had stumbled across some rift \namong the employees of this particular fast food establishment. Maybe \nshe didn't like the implication that she was one of the salad bar \nattendants. Maybe that was a bad thing. I don't know. All I know is \nthat it was kind of strange because she worked for the same employer \nwho ran the salad bar. I would have thought she would have cared about \nthat. Instead, she said: I am not on salad, shrugged her shoulders, and \nwalked away.\n  I wonder if that is sometimes what we have too much of here in \nWashington: I am not on salad. I am not on ObamaCare. I am not on \nexcessive regulation. I am not on dealing with a law that is going to \nresult in a lot of Americans losing their jobs, having their hours cut, \ntheir wages cut, or losing access to their health care benefits.\n  Well, our problems are acute. Our problems are, in fact, chronic. We \nhave to do more than shrug our shoulders. What we need right now is \nmore shoulder-squaring than shoulder-shrugging. We have to have people \nwho will follow the admonition of Ronald Reagan, who declared more than \n30 years ago that it is morning in America again. As it is now morning \nin Washington again, it is an appropriate time of day for us to bring \nthis up. To paraphrase the words of Ronald Reagan, as spoken in his \nspeech at the Republican National Convention in July 1980, and to apply \nthose same words today, let me just say as follows:\n\n       Our problems are both acute and chronic, yet all we hear \n     from those in positions of leadership are the same tired \n     proposals for more government tinkering, more meddling and \n     more control, all of which led us to this state in the first \n     place. Can anyone look at the record of this administration \n     and say: Well done? Can anyone compare the state of our \n     economy when this administration took office with where we \n     are today and say: Keep up the good work? Can anyone look at \n     our reduced stand in the world today and say: Let's have more \n     of this?\n       We must have the clarity of vision to see the difference \n     between what is essential and what is merely desirable, and \n     then the courage to use this insight to bring our government \n     back under control and make it acceptable to the people. It \n     has long been said that freedom is the condition in which the \n     government fears the people and tyranny is the condition in \n     which the people fear the government.\n\n  Throughout the duration of our history as a republic, we have enjoyed \nliberty, we have enjoyed freedom, and we have had a notable absence of \ntyranny. Sure, there have been excesses from time to time. We have kept \nthose under control because the government has always been in good \nhands--in the hands of its people. When the people weigh in from time \nto time and decide they have had too much of something, it ends up \nhaving a benefit for everyone. Everyone benefits when the people speak \nand are heard. Everyone benefits when the people's elected \nrepresentatives are willing to square their shoulders and stand up to a \nchallenge rather than shrug their shoulders and walk away saying, as it \nwere, I am not on salad.\n  Today, we are all on ObamaCare. We are all on it in the sense we \ncan't walk away from it. We are all on it in the sense that we have no \nchoice but to confront the many challenges facing our people. There is \nnot widespread agreement as to what we can or should or must or might \ndo.\n  In the absence of consensus, and understanding the widespread \ndisruption to our economy this will create once it is fully \nimplemented, some have suggested that a good compromise position might \nbe to delay its impact. And the best way to fully delay it is to defund \nit--defund it for at least 1 year. The President himself has \nacknowledged the law is not ready to be implemented as written. The \nAmerican people are reluctant to confront the many economic challenges \nthis law presents.\n\n[[Page S6799]]\n\nIt is, therefore, appropriate that we do this, and it is appropriate \nthe House of Representatives passed a continuing resolution to keep \ngovernment funded while defunding ObamaCare.\n  It is for that position we have been speaking, and it is for that \nposition that we continue to insist that as we approach the cloture \nvote this week, that I and Senator Cruz and a few others will be voting \nno on cloture on the bill because we support the House-passed \ncontinuing resolution--H.J. Res. 59. We support that, and because we \nsupport it, we cannot support a process that would enable Senator Reid, \nthe Senate majority leader, to strip out, to gut the most important \nprovision within that resolution--the ObamaCare defunding legislation--\nby a simple majority vote without allowing any other votes on any other \namendments, without allowing for an open amendment process, without \never allowing Members of this body to have an up-or-down vote on the \nlegislation as a whole, as it was enacted, as is.\n  That is what we are fighting for. Is this difficult? Yes, absolutely \nit is. Do we have consensus within our own political party? Of course \nwe don't. That is one of the reasons we are standing here today, to \npersuade our colleagues and to persuade more of the American people to \njoin in with us. No one Senator can do this alone. Not one of us, \ncertainly by means of our persuasive abilities, will be able to do \nthis. But with the American people, we can do a lot of things.\n  It wasn't very long ago, it wasn't even 2 weeks ago when people were \nstill saying it would not be possible to pass a continuing resolution \nsuch as H.J. Res. 59--one that keeps government funded while defunding \nObamaCare. Yet when the people weighed in strongly in support of this \nmeasure, it became possible. I hope and I expect the same can be true \nin the Senate.\n  So I would ask Senator Cruz: What is the best way the American \npeople, in confronting this challenge and others similar to it, but in \nparticular this challenge confronting ObamaCare, can square their \nshoulders and avoid the kind of shoulder shrugging that has resulted in \nso much expansion of government almost as if by default?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from Utah for that very fine question, \nand I wish to thank the American people for doing exactly what Senator \nLee just asked--for over 1.6 million Americans signing a national \npetition to defund ObamaCare.\n  You want to know why the House of Representatives voted \noverwhelmingly on Friday to defund ObamaCare? The answer is simple: \nBecause the American people rose and demanded it. At the end of the \nday, the House of Representatives is the people's House. I salute the \nHouse conservatives who fought and fought hard to get this done. I \nsalute the House leadership. I salute Speaker Boehner for listening to \nthe people.\n  It is not surprising the House of Representatives would do that \nfirst. For one thing, the House is designed to be the people's House. \nIn our constitutional structure, the House has a different role than \nthe Senate. The House of Representatives is up for election every 2 \nyears like clockwork. In the House, you run, you get elected, you may \nget a little bit of a breather, enjoy Thanksgiving and Christmas with \nyour family, and then you promptly turn around and start getting ready \nfor the next election 2 years hence. Given that, the House is, by its \nnature, more responsive to the people because the risks are higher in \nthe House to not being so. The House has shown over and over, when the \nelected representatives stop listening to the American people, the \nAmerican people are very good, to use an old phrase, at throwing the \nbums out.\n  The Senate, on the other hand, is similar to a battleship. It turns \nslowly. Part of that is by constitutional design. Part of that was the \nwisdom of the Framers. In any given 2-year cycle only one-third of this \nbody is up for election. It is one of the things that is interesting. \nIf you look at those Republicans who have publicly said they intend to \nvote for cloture, they intend to vote to give Harry Reid the power to \nfund ObamaCare with 51 Democratic votes, they intend to give Harry Reid \nthe power to gut the Republican continuing resolution, most of those \nRepublicans who have said that are not up for election in 2014.\n  It is amazing how it can focus the mind if you have to actually stand \nbefore the citizens. I suppose some of the Republicans who are up in \n2016 and 2018 might think: There will be time. There will be time. The \nvoters will forget. The only way to move the battleship of the Senate \nis for the American people to make it politically more risky to do the \nwrong thing than it is to do the right thing.\n\n  When we were reading Bastiat's ``The Law,'' he talked about how do \nyou prevent plunder. You make it more risky to engage in plunder than \nin hard work. The same is true of politics. You make it more risky not \nto listen to the voices of the people. How do you do that? The only way \nthat has ever worked is a tidal wave of outpouring. It is what we saw \nwith drones, it is what we saw with guns, and it is what we saw with \nSyria. But here it has to be bigger. It has to be bigger than any of \nthose three. Why? Because the resistance is more settled in. The \nDemocratic side of the aisle, the party loyalty is deeply entrenched.\n  I hope by the end of this week we see some brave Democrats who show \nthe courage James Hoffa of the Teamsters showed. We haven't yet. I hope \nthat changes. I hope by the end of this week we see a lot more \nRepublicans, even Republicans who are not up in 2014 but who may have \nsome chance by the next election cycle the voters will have forgotten. \nI am not convinced of that, but it is easy for politicians to convince \nthemselves of that. I hope we see Republicans saying: Listen, this is a \nconscience vote. This is a vote to do the right thing.\n  I have to say that in my time in the Senate this is the first time I \nhave seen Republican leadership actively whipping the Republican \nconference to support Harry Reid and give him the power to enact his \nagenda. I have never seen that before. I am quite confident it is not \nwhat Texans expect of me. I am quite confident, when each Republican \ngoes back to his or her home State, it is not what their constituents \nexpect of them.\n  I am also quite confident, if and when we return home and stand in \nfront of our constituents and are asked: Senator, why did you vote yes \non cloture to give Harry Reid the power to fund ObamaCare, to gut the \nHouse continuing resolution, I am quite confident if the answer was: \nOur party leadership asked me to do that; I am expected to be a good \nsoldier, to salute and to march into battle--you know what, none of us \nwere elected by party leadership. That is true on the Democratic and \nRepublican side.\n  Listen, if we see Democratic Senators showing courage on this issue \nto break, I have no doubt the Democratic leadership will be very \nunhappy with them. I don't want to sugarcoat what the reaction would \nbe. On the Republican side, none of us were elected by our party \nleadership. We have a different boss. Our boss is the American people. \nOur boss consists of the constituents who elected us. I am going to \nsubmit, if you strip away all the procedural mumbo jumbo, all the smoke \nand mirrors, our constituents would be horrified to know the games we \nplay, to know this is all set up to be a giant kabuki dance--theater--\nwhere a lot of Republicans vote to give Harry Reid the authority to gut \nthe House continuing resolution to fund ObamaCare and they go home and \ntell their constituents: Hey, I was voting in support of the House. \nBoy, with support like that, it is akin to saying you are supporting \nsomeone by handing a gun to someone who will shoot you.\n  We don't have to speculate. It is not hypothetical that maybe, kind \nof, sort of, possibly if you vote for cloture ObamaCare will be funded \nand the House of Representatives' continuing resolution will be gutted. \nWe know that because Harry Reid has announced it. So any Republican who \ncasts a vote for cloture is saying: Yes, I want Harry Reid to have the \npower to do that, and then I will vote against it once it no longer \nmatters, once it is a free symbolic vote. I don't think those kind of \ngames are consistent with the obligation we owe to our constituents.\n  I made reference to the IRS employees union asking to be exempted \nfrom ObamaCare, and the union sent a letter where they asked their \nmembers please send. I want to read that letter. This is\n\n[[Page S6800]]\n\nprepared, presumably, by the union bosses at the IRS employees union.\n\n       Dear Leader Reid and Leader Pelosi:\n\n  Interestingly enough, this letter is directed to the Democratic \nleaders.\n\n       When you and the President sought our support, you pledged \n     that if we liked the health plans we have now, we could keep \n     them. Sadly, that promise is under threat.\n\n  By the way, who is saying this? The IRS employees union, the people \nin charge of enforcing ObamaCare on us, the American people.\n\n       Right now, unless you under the Obama administration enact \n     an equitable fix, the ACA will shatter not only our hard-\n     earned health benefits, but destroy the foundation of the 40-\n     hour workweek that is the backbone of the American middle \n     class.\n\n  I think this letter I am reading may not be the IRS employees union; \nit may be, in fact, the Teamsters letter. I am going to set that aside \nand see if we can get the actual IRS union. It is a great letter. I may \nread it again in the course of this discussion. But I don't think that \nis the IRS letter since it is signed by James Hoffa. I am pretty \nconfident that was not the IRS employees union.\n  Instead, let me read another note from a constituent. But don't trust \nme; don't trust any politician on what is happening on ObamaCare; trust \nthe people.\n  A constituent from Spring, TX, wrote on April 12, 2013:\n\n       My late husband worked for the same company for over 40 \n     years. Because of ObamaCare, this year that company decided \n     it would no longer offer supplemental insurance to Medicare. \n     The program I was forced into has increased my monthly \n     premium by almost $100. Not only that, but the prescription \n     plan has increased the drug plan--a generic one at that--by \n     30 percent.\n\n  Ridiculous. This body--Democrats and Republicans--needs to listen to \nthe people. Together, we must make DC listen.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Would the Senator from Texas yield for a question without \nyielding the floor?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield to my friend from Florida for a \nquestion without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. RUBIO. My first question is, What did the Senator do last night?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from Florida for that question. I had a \ndelightful night. I had a chance to read Bastiat, Rand, and read some \ntweets. There are few things more enjoyable than reading tweets. And I \nhope that the Senator and I and Senator Lee and many other Senators who \nparticipated in this--I hope we have had some positive impact on moving \nthis debate forward and making clear to the American people both the \ntrain wreck, the nightmare that is ObamaCare, in the words of James \nHoffa, the president of the Teamsters, but also that right now too many \nmembers of this body are not listening to the American people, and the \nonly remedy for that is this week the American people demanding that we \nmake DC listen.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Would the Senator from Texas yield for a followup question \nwithout yielding the floor?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for another question without yielding \nthe floor.\n  Mr. RUBIO. First an observation. It is interesting how much times \nhave changed around here. If a decade ago you were to tell someone you \nwere tweeting on the Senate floor, that would not be a positive thing. \nPeople would think that meant something else.\n  The world has changed a lot, and I think the Senator highlighted \nearlier in some of the speeches given here what a positive development \nthat has been. It wasn't so long ago that in order to be able to do \nsomething in politics, to make a difference, to mobilize people to take \naction, you needed the benefits of the formal organizations that \nexisted. You needed groups or the establishment--or whatever term \npeople want to use--to get things done. But one thing that has really \ncompletely changed American politics is that anybody can become a \npolitical activist now. Because of access to social media, because of \naccess to Facebook and Twitter and Vine and Instagram and all these \nother programs, anyone can now take action and speak out. Anyone can \nnow connect with like-minded people halfway across the country or \nhalfway around the world and begin a cause.\n  In many respects, that is what I think you see happening in this \ncountry now. There is a lot of talk about how Washington has changed, \nhow there are things happening now that didn't used to happen before. I \nam convinced that one of the reasons is because people now have access \nto things that are happening in real time and they have the ability to \nspeak out on these things in real time.\n  It used to be that you had to turn on the TV at 6:00 in the evening \nor 6:30 to watch the evening national news. Not anymore. News is \nreported on a minute-by-minute basis. Even as I speak now, there is \nsomeone out there covering it, there are people out there saying \nsomething about it. By and large, it has been a positive development \nbecause it has empowered individual Americans from all walks of life \nnot just to be aware of what is happening in this Capitol but to engage \nin it, to speak out, and to be heard. At the end of the day, this \nRepublic depends on that--on an informed citizenry who is also able to \nspeak out on the issues of the day and communicate with the people who \nwork for them.\n  Let me tell you what I hear from the people I work for in the State \nof Florida. I hear tremendous concern about the future. We focus a lot \naround here on specific issues, and we should. The national debt is a \ncrisis. Our Tax Code is broken. Our regulations are out of control. We \nare talking about ObamaCare right now, which has been hugely \ndetrimental to the American economy and to the aspirations of \nindividual Americans. But overriding all of this is the central concern \nthat I find increasingly on the minds of people. Let me describe it.\n  I know that as a country we are divided on a lot of issues. Look at \nthe polls. Look at the elections. I know the country is divided on a \nlot of important issues. That is why this body and Congress are \nstruggling to find consensus on many of the major issues we confront.\n  But let me tell you what I believe is still the unifying principle \nthat holds our Nation and our people together. That unifying principle \nis the belief that anyone who is willing to work hard and sacrifice \nshould be able to get ahead, the idea that if you are willing to work \nas hard as you can and make sacrifices, you should be rewarded for that \nwith a better life.\n  By the way, when we talk about a better life, it is not a guarantee \nthat you will ever be a millionaire or a billionaire, but it generally \nmeans the ability to find a job that is fulfilling, helps you feel like \nyou are making a difference in the world, a job that allows you to do \nsomething you love for a living, and a job that pays you enough money \nto do things like buy a house, provide a stable environment for your \nfamily, and save so your kids can go to college and so that you can \nretire with dignity and security.\n  As a people, we are unified in the belief that it is unfair that \npeople who are willing to work hard and sacrifice, as the vast majority \nof Americans are--it is unfair when people who are willing to do that \ncannot get ahead, when those people are held back. We have been told \nour whole lives that if you work hard, if you sacrifice, if you go to \nschool and graduate, if you do all these things, you will get ahead, \nthat this is that kind of country.\n\n  But now people are starting to wonder if that is still true. Across \nthis country increasingly people are starting to wonder, that which we \nknow as the American dream, is that still alive? They want to believe \nit still is. They believe in America, but they are starting to wonder \nif that formula I have outlined--hard work and sacrifice lead to a \nbetter life--if that formula still works. Why are they wondering that? \nIt is not hard to understand. They are working hard. They are working \nharder than they ever have. Look at median incomes in America. Look at \nthe people who feel as if their lives have stagnated. They are working \nhard. They are sacrificing. Not only are they not getting ahead, \nsometimes they feel as if they are falling behind.\n  Put yourself in the place of someone who is 56, 57, 58 years old and \nworked their whole life at some company or industry. Suddenly, they are \nlaid off and they can't find anyone to hire them. They were getting \nready for retirement. Now they don't know when that is ever going to \nhappen.\n  Put yourself in the place of a student. You graduated high school. \nWhile\n\n[[Page S6801]]\n\nyour friends were out playing around, you were studying so you could \nget good grades and get into a good school. You did that. You went to \ncollege. While your friends were out partying, you studied. You \ngraduated with a 3.5, 4.0. You went to grad school and graduated from \nthere as well. You did everything that was asked of you. Then you \ngraduated, and you couldn't find a job in your career field. And here \nis what is worse: You owe $30,000 or more in student loans.\n  By the way, that is an issue I know. I know Senator Lee has \nconfronted that as well. I had $100,000 in student loans when I \ngraduated. I grant you, it was a wise investment in my education, but \nit was an anchor around my neck for many, many years. My parents were \nnever able to save enough money to provide for our education, so I had \nto do a combination of grants, work study, and student loans. When I \ncame to the Senate, I still had those loans. There were months when my \nloan payments were higher than our mortgage.\n  So you look at these things and you understand what people around the \ncountry are facing.\n  Think about the small businesses. You used to work for someone. You \nwere an employee, and then one day you decided: I can do this job \nbetter than my boss can, so I am going to quit this job and I am going \nto risk it. I am going to take every penny I have access to, I am going \nto max out my credit card, I am going to take out my life savings, and \nI am going to open a small business because I believe in my idea. And I \nwill guarantee that for most people who did that, those first years \nwere tough. This idea that you open a business and tomorrow you are on \nFacebook is usually not the case. Usually you struggle those first few \nyears. Oftentimes, people fail in business two or three times before \nthey finally succeed.\n  Interestingly enough, as part of this process one of the most \nrewarding things I have been able to do is travel the country and meet \nand interact with very successful people in business and in life. It is \namazing how many people you meet who--when you ask them how they got \nstarted and how they achieved, they usually focus on all the times they \nfailed before they achieved. They take pride in the struggle because it \nmeans that they earned it, that they earned what they have. They take \npride in that.\n  But put yourself in the position of someone who went through all \nthat, someone who started this business by taking out a second mortgage \non their home and literally came upon one Friday when they didn't know \nhow they were going to make payroll or stay open but somehow they \npersevered and made it through, and now that business is open and \nfunctioning and yet it is struggling. And they are wondering--after all \nthese years of hard work and sacrifice, they feel as though they are \nslipping backward instead of moving ahead.\n  There is a growing sentiment in this country about these things. Let \nme tell you why that is so dangerous. What I just described to you is \nwhat we have come to know as the American Dream. There is this idea \namong the minds of some that the American dream is a material thing, \nthat the American dream is about how much money can you make so you can \nown more things. That may be an element of it for some people, but the \nAmerican dream is largely about being able to earn for yourself a \nbetter life.\n  You can only understand the American dream by viewing it from a \nglobal perspective. For those of us who were born and raised in this \ncountry, who have lived here our whole life, who don't know anything \nelse, sometimes it is easy to take what I am about to tell you for \ngranted. In most countries around the world, for almost all of human \nhistory and even today, it doesn't really matter how hard you are \nwilling to work and how much you are willing to sacrifice. If you don't \ncome from the right family, if you are not well connected, you don't \nget into the right schools and then you don't get into the right jobs.\n  Put yourself in that position for a moment. Imagine now that you have \nbig hopes, big dreams, and big talent, and your hope is to do something \nwith it. By the way, it doesn't have to mean making a lot of money. \nMaybe you want to serve in philanthropy. Maybe you want to make a \ndifference setting up a foundation. Maybe you are an artist or a \nmusician. Whatever it may be, imagine now being trapped with all that \ntalent and unable to put it into use. You would say that is unfair, and \nI would tell you that was the human condition up until 200 years ago \neverywhere in the world, and it is still the human condition in many \nparts of the globe today. The American dream is that here that is not \ntrue. Here, we believe that is wrong. Here, we believe that is unfair. \nHere, we believe all Americans--Democrats, Republicans, Liberals, \nConservatives, everyone--we all believe it is unfair and it is wrong \nthat someone should be prevented from achieving a better life because \nof where they come from, whom they come from, or where they started out \nin life. We believe that is unfair. We believe that is wrong. That is \nthe American dream. That is us--the notion that you should be able to \nachieve whatever you were meant to be, to be able to fully utilize your \ntalents in whatever way you find meaningful, the ability to have a \ncareer instead of a job, all these sorts of things.\n  That is what we are on the verge of losing, in the minds of many \nAmericans, and that is supremely dangerous to the country. Why? Because \nI personally do not believe there can be an America as we know it \nwithout the American dream. Without the American dream, America is just \nanother big powerful country, but it is no longer an exceptional one. \nThat is what is at stake in all these debates we are conducting in this \nbody.\n  What are the impediments? What is creating these problems we are \nfacing? There may be more, but I have identified three that I hope we \nwill focus on more.\n  The first, by the way, is societal breakdown. It is real. This idea \nthat somehow you can separate the social well-being of your people from \ntheir moral well-being is absurd. The social well-being from the \neconomic well-being--the idea that you can separate those is absurd. If \nyou are born into a broken family, the statistics tell us that the \nchances that you are going to struggle significantly increase. The \ndestruction of the family structure in America, the decline of it, is a \nleading contributor to poverty and educational underperformance.\n  The question for policymakers here in Washington is what can we do \nabout that? Can we pass laws that will make people better parents? Can \nwe pass government programs that will make families better? The answer \nis usually not. But I can tell you what we can start doing. We can \nstart recognizing this is a real factor. This is not about moralizing. \nThis is not about imposing our religious views or values on anyone. \nThis is a free country. You have the right to believe in anything you \nwant or believe in nothing at all. But you better believe this: It \ndoesn't matter how many diplomas you have on the wall. If you don't \nhave the values of hard work and sacrifice and respect and perseverance \nand self-discipline, if you don't have those values you are going to \nstruggle to succeed, and no one is born with those values; no one. \nThose values have to be taught and they have to be reinforced.\n  One of the things that made America exceptional, one of the things \nthat allowed the American dream to happen is that in this country we \nhad strong families and strong institutions in our society that helped \nthose families instill those values in children. Today there are \nmillions of children growing up in this country who are not being \ntaught these values because of societal breakdown. We refuse to \nconfront it at our own peril. We better recognize it and start acting \non it as a nation because I am telling you, children who are born into \nbroken families, living in substandard housing, in dangerous \nneighborhoods, with no access to health care and with difficulty \naccessing good schools, these kids have five strikes against them. They \nare going to struggle to make it unless someone addresses that, and we \nare losing an entire generation of talent because of it. We better \naddress it in a way that is good for the country and also good for \nthose families.\n  The second issue, I would tell you, that is contributing to this is \nwe have a significant skills gap in America. What that means is 21st \ncentury jobs\n\n[[Page S6802]]\n\nrequire more skills than jobs ever have. Here is a graphic example. Go \nto the grocery store. I was there Saturday. There used to be 12 \ncheckout lines. That meant 12 cashiers, right? Twelve cashier jobs. Now \nthere are eight checkout lines and the other four are these machines \nwhere you run the card over the scan. That means those four or five \ncashier jobs are gone, right? Yes, but those jobs have been replaced by \nthe jobs of the people who installed those machines, the jobs of the \npeople who built those machines, the jobs of the people who maintain \nthose machines. A graphic example of the 21st century. The job has been \nreplaced by a new job, but the new job--to be a cashier you have to be \ntrained on the site. My mom was a cashier. But to build, fix, and \nmaintain those machines you have to have a higher level of skills you \nhave to learn in school somewhere. Too many people don't have those \nskills. We have to fix that. For the life of me I don't understand why \nwe stigmatize career education in America. There are kids who don't \nwant to go to Harvard or Yale. They don't want to go for a 6-year \ndegree or a 7-year degree program. They want to fix airplane engines. \nThey want to be electricians and plumbers. Those are good-paying jobs. \nWe need those people. We should be teaching kids to do that while they \nare still in high school so they can graduate with a diploma in this \nhand and a certificate that makes them job ready in the other. We \nshould do that.\n  Beyond that, our students today, many of them are nontraditional \nstudents. They are not just 18- or 19-year-olds who just graduated from \nhigh school. There, for example, a single mom is working as a \nreceptionist at a dental clinic somewhere and she is the first one to \nget laid off every time things go wrong. How can she improve her life? \nBy becoming an ultrasound tech or becoming any of these other \nparaprofessions you find in medicine. But to do that she has to be able \ngo to school. How is she going to do that if she has to work full time \nand raise her kids? We have to answer that. Whether it is online \nprograms or flexibility in study or programs that give you credit for \nlife experience and work experience, we have to answer that.\n  We have to also address workers who in the middle of their lives have \nlost their job, a job that is never coming back. They need to be \nretrained. By the way, the traditional college route will still be the \nticket for upward mobility for millions of Americans but better figure \nout how to pay for it because right now you have kids graduating with \n$30,000 and $40,000 around their neck and that is going to prevent them \nfrom starting a family, buying a house, and moving ahead. We had better \nfigure out why it is that every time more aid is made available to \nthese students it gets gobbled up by these tuition increases. We better \naddress that problem and we better address the skills gap.\n  Here is the third, and it goes right to the heart of what Senator \nCruz from Texas is dealing with here. The free enterprise system is the \nsingle great eradicator of poverty in all of human history. Free \nenterprise, American-style free enterprise, has eradicated more poverty \nthan all the government programs in the world combined. You want to \nwage a real war on poverty? Encourage free enterprise. Why? Because \nfree enterprise is an economic system that rewards people for hard \nwork, sacrifice, and merit. Free enterprise does not ask what did your \nparents do for a living? Who do you know? Where do you summer? Who do \nyou hang out with over the summer? What clubs do you belong to? Free \nenterprise doesn't ask that. Free enterprise wants to know what is your \nidea? Is there a market for it? Are you willing to work hard and \nsacrifice and persevere? If you are, there is no guarantee, but if you \nare, you have a real opportunity to make it. You want to know proof \nthat that works? I have 200-some-odd years of American history to show \nyou. It works.\n  In fact, it works so well that other countries are trying to copy it \nin their own version. Why are there millions of people in China today \nthat just a generation ago lived in deep poverty and now are consumers \nin the middle class? Why? Is it because they headed even more in the \ndirection of communism or because they opened their economy to free \nenterprise principles? The same is true in Brazil, Mexico, India, all \nover the world. What are the countries that are finding increased \nprosperity and growth in the middle class doing? They are inching \ntoward free enterprise, not away from it.\n  Does that mean there is no role for government? No, of course there \nis a role for government. There is an important role for government. It \nprovides for our national security. It is hard to grow your economy \nwhen you are under attack. It provides for internal security. You know, \nit is hard for people to invest in an economy if they don't know there \nis a court system that is going to enforce property rights, if they \nbelieve crimes will go unpunished.\n\n  We believe in a safety net. Free enterprise doesn't work without a \nreal safety net--not as a way of life. You cannot live your whole life \non welfare and food stamps and disability unless you are truly \ndisabled. That is what the real safety net is there for. It is there to \nhelp people who cannot help themselves and it is there to help people \nwho have fallen to stand back up and try again. We believe in a safety \nnet--not as a way of life but as a backstop to make people feel the \nconfidence that they can invest in the future.\n  What else should government be doing? As I have talked about--\nnational security, infrastructure, the roads and bridges we build in \nthis country. It is not a jobs program but it does create the backbone \nfor the economy to function. The problem is the most important thing \ngovernment should do in all of our policymaking decisions is we must \nask ourselves, before you do anything--you pass a law, you create a new \nprogram--ask yourself: Will this foster the free enterprise system or \nwill it undermine it?\n  To answer that question, you have to first recognize how the free \nenterprise system works. What creates prosperity and opportunity? Here \nis what creates it. When someone invents something new, a new product, \nidea, or service, when someone starts a new business or when someone \ngrows an existing business, that is what creates opportunity and \nmiddle-class prosperity in the free enterprise system, that is what \nmakes upward mobility possible, that is what allows people to climb out \nof where they started in life and improve it and leave their kids even \nbetter off--when people innovate, when they invest by starting a new \nbusiness or expanding an existing one.\n  As policymakers, every time we make a decision around here, if you \nwant to help the middle class, the people who are trying to make it, \nmake America the best place in the world to innovate, to start a new \nbusiness or to expand an existing business.\n  Do you want to know what is wrong in America today with our economy? \nLook no farther than a series of government policies--by the way, \npursued by both political parties, although my opinion is I have not \nseen anything like the last 6 years--but a series of policies that have \nundermined the free enterprise system, policies that make it harder, \nnot easier, to start a business, to expand an existing business, and to \ninnovate.\n  Chief among them right now before us is what the Senator from Texas \nhas been talking about all night--ObamaCare. That is why we are \npassionate about this. If you watch the news a little bit, you would \nthink this is all because it is President Obama's idea and the \nRepublicans are against it because it is his idea and that is what is \nhappening here. That is absurd. I certainly have an ideological \nobjection to the expansion of government. But my passionate objection, \nat least why I am on the floor here today and why Senator Cruz is on \nthe floor all night, it is not because of ideology or theory, it is the \nreality that this law is going to hurt real people. It is going to hurt \nreal people. I have met those people. I have talked to those people. If \nyou have been to a Walgreen's lately you know those people, too.\n  Why? Because Walgreen's has announced that because of ObamaCare it \nhas to get rid of its insurance program that its employees are \ngenerally happy with. That is why they are still working there, right? \nNow they get thrown into the great unknown.\n  Here is the problem with that. Imagine if you are chronically ill or \nimagine if you have children and you have this preexisting relationship \nwith a doctor.\n\n[[Page S6803]]\n\nThey know your history. You can call them when you need them. They are \nresponsive. That is why you are going there all these years. Now you \nget thrown on this new insurance program and the doctor is not on the \nplan anymore. In fact, what we are hearing from these new exchanges \nthat are being set up is one of the ways we are going to lower costs is \nlimit our networks: less doctors, less hospitals. That is how we are \ngoing to save some money and make these things affordable. That is what \nwe are going to put people into? So all of a sudden these doctors you \nhave been going to these years, you cannot go to them anymore? That is \nwrong. That is hurting real people.\n  How about this for an example. Imagine now these small businesses I \nhave met. I know the Senator talked about this, Senator Cruz. I met a \nrestaurant owner--we had a small business meeting here a couple of \nmonths ago--from Louisiana. He testified. He has great ideas. He has \ncalculated that there is a market for him to open a new restaurant. He \nowns a chain. He wants to open one more. He is not going to because of \nObamaCare, because the costs create uncertainty about the future for \nhim, because he is worried about triggering mandates he cannot \ncalculate for.\n  You may say he is a business owner, he already has X number of \nrestaurants, why does he need anymore? Some people would actually say \nthat. It is not him we are going to worry about. He would be the first \nto tell you I am going to be OK. Who is not going to be OK? If you open \nthat new restaurant, he was going to hire 20 or 30 new people. There \nare 20 or 30 people in Louisiana right now who could have had a job, a \njob that could have helped them to provide for their family, a job that \ncould have helped them to pay for their school. Those jobs are not \ngoing to be created. That is just one example. There are multiple \nexamples.\n  How about this one? How about if you are a part-time worker now. The \nbackbone of our economy can never be part-time work, but there is \nalways a place for part-time work. I worked part time before. I think \nthe Senator has talked about when he had to work part time before. \nOthers have. There is a place for that in our economy. Primarily it \nhelps young people and retirees. For young people, it helps them to \nwork their way through school. Imagine, now, if you want to work your \nway through school because you don't want to owe $50,000 in student \nloans and you are in central Florida and you work for Sea World and \nright now maybe you are working 32 hours a week part time and using the \nrest of the time to go to school. But here comes ObamaCare so now Sea \nWorld has announced instead of 32 hours we are going to move you to 28 \nhours. That is real money. That is real money. That is hurting real \npeople.\n  Here is one that doesn't get a lot of attention. Medicare Advantage \nis a great choice program. It is not perfect. There are ways to improve \nit, but it is a program on Medicare that basically allows patients on \nMedicare to sign up in a managed care system that manages their care \nbut for that, it adds additional benefits to their package. My mom is a \nMedicare Advantage patient. I can tell you the outcomes are generally \nbetter than for people who are in the fee-for-service system and the \nservices they offer are valuable.\n  In my mom's case she needs transportation to and from doctors' \nvisits. That is one of the services the Medicare Advantage Program \nprovides. ObamaCare takes money out of Advantage. You would think they \nare taking money out of Medicare Advantage to shore up the finances of \nMedicare because it is going bankrupt. No, they are taking the money \nout to fund ObamaCare.\n  So what is going to happen practically is that at some point here \nover the next few months, beneficiaries on Medicare Advantage are going \nto get letters in the mail and those are going to inform them of \nservices they were once receiving and are no longer receiving.\n  With all the uncertainty created by ObamaCare, is it making America \nthe easiest place, or an easier place, to start a business? No. Does \nObamaCare make it easier to grow an existing business? Absolutely not. \nDoes ObamaCare encourage innovation in the marketplace? Of course not. \nOn the contrary, it undermines innovation in medicine. It undermines \nadvances in medical technology that have added years and quality to the \nlives of millions of people.\n  This thing is a complete disaster, and now we are being asked to take \nthe taxpayer dollars and pour more money into this broken thing? Of \ncourse we are passionate about being against that. So I go out across \nthe State of Florida, and everywhere I go I have people who voted for \nthe President telling me this thing is hurting them.\n  This is not a partisan issue. There are Democrats who are hurt by \nthis. There are supporters of the President being hurt by this.\n  Earlier this evening--I lost track of when it was--Senator Cruz read \nletters from the Teamsters Union and from other unions across the \ncountry. We received news that the union representing IRS workers who \nare in charge of enforcing this law through the fines or the tax--or \nwhatever they decided to call it--want to be exempted from it. They \ndon't want it to apply to them.\n  By the way, all these exemptions that people are begging for--whether \nit is Members of Congress or IRS employees or unions--is shining a \nlight on this reality. Big government always benefits the people who \nhave access to power. That is true everywhere in the world. Why? I will \ntell you why. Big government always writes a lot of regulations, rules, \nand has a lot complexity.\n  So if you are a multibillion-dollar corporation, a powerful labor \nunion or a billionaire, you can come and hire the best lawyers in \nAmerica and they will help you figure out the loopholes in those laws. \nLet me tell you what else you can do: You can hire the best lobbyists \nin Washington to help you get those loopholes written in.\n  You may not be shocked to know this, but in politics, sometimes \nbusinesses use government regulations and laws to give them an edge \nover their competitors and to keep other people from coming into their \nindustry and competing against them. It happens because in big \ngovernment that is possible. Big government always helps the people who \nhave access to power because they are only ones who can afford to \nnavigate it. So if you are a major corporation or major labor union, \nyou can either deal with the impacts of ObamaCare or you can work to \nget an exemption or a waiver or what have you from it.\n  Who can't? I will tell you who can't. The person trying to start a \nbusiness out of the spare bedroom of their home. By the way, I met \nsomeone like this. They weren't at a Starbucks, they were at a Dunkin' \nDonuts. They were using the free wi-fi, and that was their business. \nThey were in the corner of the Dunkin' Donuts, and that is where they \nstarted their software business. Do you think they can comply with the \ncomplicated rules and regulations? They can't.\n  ObamaCare will force people either to go underground in their \noperations or not do it at all. It is not a question of why ObamaCare \nwill fail, it is an example of why big government fails, and it is not \nfair. It is not fair for people in this country who are willing to work \nhard and are willing to sacrifice. It is not fair that we are making it \nharder on them through government policies being pursued.\n  By the way, ObamaCare is not the only one. We have a broken Tax Code. \nIf I asked you: Please design for me a Tax Code that discourages people \nfrom investing money and growing their businesses, you would give me \nthe U.S. Tax Code today. We have to fix that.\n  Our regulations are completely out of control. There is no cost-\nbenefit analysis at all. These people write regulations here in \nWashington, and no one ever asks the question: How many jobs will this \ndestroy? How many jobs will not be created because of this? No one asks \nthose questions. They measure the theory behind what it might do, such \nas the environmental benefit and the societal benefit, but no one ever \ndoes the cost-benefit analysis. There is no employment impact statement \nattached to these laws. Think about the absurdity of that.\n  Here we are with a huge number of people dropping out of their search \nfor jobs, a huge amount of underemployment, a vast majority of the new \njobs being created are part-time jobs, and we are passing regulations \nthat make\n\n[[Page S6804]]\n\nit harder for people to create jobs and opportunities. It is crazy. The \nregulations are out of control.\n  We are going to deal with the debt. In about 6 or 7 days the debt \nlimit debate is going to come up. They want to raise it again. The \nPresident said: I am not negotiating on this. Let's just raise it \nagain. Never mind the fact that he stood on the floor of this Senate \nless than 10 years ago and said that raising the debt limit back then \nwas a failure of leadership.\n  Now things have changed because a $17 trillion debt is no longer \npressing in his mind, and that is problematic. Why? Is the debt just an \naccounting problem? That is how they talk about it on the news. They \ntalk about the debt as just an accounting problem. They say: They just \nspend more money than they take in, but if they only raised more taxes \non richer people, they would pay off the whole thing. That is not true, \nguys.\n  If we took every penny away from people who made over $1 million this \nyear, it doesn't even make a dent in this. Any politician who says: All \nwe have to do is raise taxes and the debt is under control is lying to \nyou--period.\n  The sooner we confront the debt, the better off we will be as a \npeople. The debt is growing because we have important government \nprograms that are structured in a way that is not sustainable. They \nspend a lot more money than they take in, and it only gets worse from \nhere.\n  Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security are important programs. My \nmom is on two of them. I would never do anything to hurt her benefits \nor people like her and that is why I am so passionate about reforming \nthem. Those programs are going bankrupt, and we are going to have to \ndeal with it. We cannot continue to spend $1 trillion more than we take \nin and not deal with it. The problem is the longer we wait to deal with \nit, the harder it is going to be to deal with it.\n\n  It is no different than medical conditions, right? Think about this \nfor a second: Is there any disease or medical condition that you know \nof that is easier to treat the later you catch it? Is there? Is there \nany medical condition that is easier to fix the longer you wait to deal \nwith it? Of course not. What are doctors always talking to us about? \nEarly detection.\n  It is the same with the debt. The longer we wait to address this \nissue, the harder and more disruptive it is going to be to solve it, \nand that is what is driving our debt. People want to focus on other \nthings such as foreign aid. They say: Cut foreign aid. That is less \nthan 1 percent of our budget. That is not what is driving our debt. It \nis not even defense spending.\n  Are there ways to save money in defense contracting, of course there \nis, but that is not the driver of the debt. The driver of our debt are \nthese unsustainable programs that if we want to save them, we must fix \nthem. The debt is not an accounting problem. Why? First of all, it is a \nmoral problem.\n  Never in the history of this country has a generation of Americans \nsaid to their kids: Guys, we are going to run up your tab and you \nfigure out how to pay for it later. We have never had that happen in \nthe history of the United States, but that is what they are doing. It \nis wrong. But it is more than that. This is not just about what taxes \nwill be 50 years from now on our kids, this is about the jobs that are \nbeing destroyed right now.\n  Let's go back to the simple equation of how jobs are created. Jobs \nare created when someone invents something or when someone starts a new \nbusiness or expands an existing business. People look at this debt and \nsay they are going to have to deal with that debt one day through a \ndebt crisis. They are going to have to raise taxes, make disruptive \nchanges in the government in the future. They are not encouraged about \ninvesting in the future now because they are fearful about the \nuncertainty provided by the debt. They are fearful.\n  So there are jobs right now that are not being created. Right now \nthere are jobs in America that do not exist and were not created. They \nwere going to be created but were not created because of the national \ndebt.\n  We are going to have a debate in a few days about it. The attitude \nfrom a lot of people around here is: Of course, we have to raise the \ndebt limit, and we should not do anything about it. I stood on the \nfloor of the Senate--my chair was back there in 2011--and I said: When \nare we finally going to deal with this thing? Well, 2\\1/2\\ years later \nand we are still not dealing with this thing.\n  This complaisance and lack of emergency about these issues is \npuzzling. You know what my fear is? My fear is that we fast forward 50 \nyears into the future and historians are going to write that the \ncountry was falling apart, they were destroying the free enterprise \nsystem, the American dream was crumbling, and these guys stood by and \ndid nothing.\n  That is what I feel is happening right now. It feels like the horror \nmovies where you scream at the screen: Don't go in that room. Don't do \nit. But they do it anyway. In some ways, everything we are facing with \nthe debt and ObamaCare is similar to a horror movie. We know how it \nends if we stay on this path. We know what happens in the horror movie \nif they open the door. The bad guy is on the other side.\n  It is the same thing with the issues we are facing. We know what \nhappens if we continue on the path we are on now--we decline as a \nnation. The sad part is that doesn't have to happen.\n  There is no reason the 21st century cannot also be an American \ncentury. There is no this reason the next generation of Americans \ncannot be the most prosperous people who ever lived, but it requires us \nto act. It requires us to reform our Tax Code, not as a way of raising \ntaxes but as a way of creating new taxpayers through economic growth. \nIt requires us to deal with regulations.\n  By the way--and I think the Senator from Texas would agree with \nthis--ObamaCare, as much as anything else, is a massive authorization \nto write a bunch of rules. It is not just a law, it is a bunch of \nregulations that are hurting job creation, discouraging investment, and \ndiscouraging people from starting a new business or expanding an \nexisting business. We have to fix that, and we have to deal with the \ndebt.\n  All of these issues have to be dealt with. None of them get easier to \nfix as time goes on. They all get harder and more disruptive.\n  I don't know how the Senator from Texas did this for 18 hours. I am \nalready tired.\n  I guess I will just speak personally. The one issue that makes me so \npassionate about all of this in its sum total--I often wonder what \nwould my life would have been like if America had never existed. What \nif in 1956 there wasn't a place my parents could go to where people \nlike them had a chance for a better life? I doubt very seriously \nwhether I would be standing on the floor of the Cuban Senate. There \nisn't one now.\n  I can't imagine what my life would be like if America never existed. \nIf God had not given my parents the opportunity to come to the one \nplace on Earth where people like them--born into poverty and little \nformal education--actually had a chance to build a better life.\n  I think about the millions of people out there trying to do what my \nparents and Senator Cruz's parents did--what so many of our parents \ndid, by the way. The great thing about this country is when you tell \nyour story, everybody has one just like it. We are all the descendants \nof go-getters.\n  Every single one of us is the descendant of someone who overcame \nextraordinary obstacles to claim their stake on the American dream. \nThey overcame discrimination or poverty. In many cases they overcame \nthis evil institution of slavery. This is who we are as a people. We \nare all the descendants of go-getters.\n  I think about how that has changed the world. There is literally no \ncorner of this planet that you cannot go to where you will not find \npeople who feel frustrated and trapped. I cannot tell you how many \ntimes I meet people from abroad who disagree with all sorts of things \nthat America does. Yet they have a begrudging admiration for it. You \nknow what that admiration is rooted in? That someone just like them who \ncame from where they come from, is doing extraordinary things. They are \ndoing things they never could have dreamt of in the Nation of their own \nbirth.\n  I think we should all ask ourselves: What would the world look like \nif\n\n[[Page S6805]]\n\nAmerica was not exceptional? What if America was another rich country \nin the world with a big military and some power, but it wasn't special? \nWhat would the world be like? The answer is: The world would be more \ndangerous, less free, and less prosperous. So when we debate the future \nof our economy--and in many ways we are debating the future of the \nworld.\n  If America declines, I want you to ask yourself this: Who replaces \nus? The United Nations replaces us? Really? Who replaces us? China? \nChina doesn't even care about the rights of their own people. Why would \nthey care about the rights of people anywhere else? Who replaces us? \nRussia? Who replaces us on the world stage?\n  If America declines, who will inspire people around the world to seek \nnot just freedom but economic opportunity? Who will stand as proof that \nit is a lie to tell people they can't achieve? Who will stand as an \nexample that that is not true if America declines?\n  The one thing that will lead quickest to America's decline is not \nsimply the debt or taxes or these unconstitutional violations we see on \na daily basis. The quickest way to decline is to undermine the American \ndream and lose our identity as the one place on Earth where anyone from \nanywhere can accomplish anything. That is the fast track to decline. \nThat is why we are so passionate about ObamaCare. It is a direct threat \nto the American dream.\n\n  The irony of it is that ObamaCare was sold as a way to help the \npeople who are trying to make it. How was it sold to people? Here is \nhow it was sold to people: If you are working class, if you are poor \nand you can't afford health insurance, the government is going to \nprovide you with health insurance. Tell me the truth. That is what a \nlot of people perceived this to be. If they don't have insurance now, \nthis is going to allow them to now have insurance--maybe for free, if \nnot at a very low cost. By the way, anyone who already had insurance, \nthis wasn't going to hurt them at all. That is how it was sold. That is \nhow it was sold to people: This is going to be cheap, easy-to-get \ninsurance for people who are struggling.\n  I understand why someone who is struggling to make it would look at \nit as something that is appealing. Guess what. That is not what it is. \nPeople who have existing health insurance right now, many of them are \ngoing to lose it. When they told us we could keep what we had, they \nwere not telling us the truth. People who were told this is going to \nprovide them access to cheap, quality health insurance, guess what. I \ncan't tell people what they are going to get because it doesn't exist \nyet. But theoretically, on October 1, people are going to have a chance \nto sign up for one of these exchanges and here is what I predict we \nwill find: less choices, a higher price than we anticipated, perhaps \nhigher than we can afford, and less choices in hospitals and doctors \nincluded in those exchanges. This is a disaster all the way around. By \nthe way, while these exchanges are being set up, people may ultimately \nbe getting a notice from their employer that they are going to reduce \ntheir hours or maybe even their job. So that is why this is a fight \nworth having.\n  It is interesting to see it--Senator Cruz has not had a chance to see \nit because he has been here--but it is interesting how the news covers \nall of this. Political reporters--and they have a job to do--always \ncover this through the political angle: Who is going to win? Who is \ngoing to lose? If this is a college football game, who is the winner \nand who is the loser on the scoreboard and all of that kind of thing? \nThey love to talk this up, and there is a place for that. People aren't \nshocked to know there are politics around here.\n  This issue is so much deeper than that, though. It really is. There \nis not a lot of attention being paid to that. I think we should, \nbecause it is having an impact on real people in a real and powerful \nway. All of this attention being paid, if we watch the news among the \npolitical classes, the process: When are they going to vote? Who is \ngoing to win the vote? Who is going to vote which way?\n  That is fine, guys. I understand that is part of this process and we \nall enjoy watching it from time to time, right? What they are missing \nis the why. Why is someone willing to stay up all night--two people, \nbasically, willing to stay up all night to speak about this? Why are \npeople willing to fight on this issue? Why are so many Americans \nagainst it? The why. No one is asking the why. The answer is because it \nis undermining the opportunity for upward mobility. That is why. We are \nnot fighting here against the President; we are fighting for people--\nfor people who voted for us and people who will never vote for us; for \npeople who voted for Mitt Romney and for people who voted for Barack \nObama--for real people; people who may never agree with us on any other \nissue, but they are going to be heard about ObamaCare. People who, as \nwe speak here, are about to wake up, get their kids ready to go to \nschool, put in 8 to 10 hours at work, come back home, try to make \ndinner while they make sure their kids are doing homework, put them to \nbed. By the time all that ends, they are exhausted, and they have to \nget up and do it all over the next day and the next day and again the \nnext week. The last thing these people need is another disruption in \ntheir life. The last thing these people need is to go to work tomorrow \nand be informed: I am sorry, but we are cutting 4 hours out of your \nwork week. I am sorry, but we are changing your insurance plan, so that \ndoctor you have been taking your asthmatic child to or that doctor you \nhave been going to for your pregnancy, you are not going to be able to \nsee them anymore because this new insurance plan does not include them. \nThat is the last thing people need, and that is what they are going to \nget. That is wrong and it is unfair.\n  I will close with this, and I alluded to it earlier. I hope we will \ndo everything we can to keep America special, to keep it the shining \ncity on the hill, as Reagan called it, because as I outlined earlier, I \nthink the future of the world depends on it, the kind of world our \nchildren will inherit depends on it.\n  I think it is important to remind us that America has faced difficult \ncircumstances before. In fact, every generation of America has faced \nsome challenge to what makes us exceptional and special--every single \none. They were different, but they were challenges. This country had a \nCivil War that deeply divided it. This country lived through a Great \nDepression. This country lived through two very painful world wars. \nThis country had to confront its history of segregation and \ndiscrimination and overcome that. It had a very controversial conflict \nin Vietnam that divided Americans against each other.\n  In the midst of all that, it had to wage a Cold War against the \nexpanse of communism. We forget, but there were many commentators in \nthe late 1970s and early 1980s who would ask Reagan, Why don't you \naccept the fact--not just Reagan, but anybody--we have to accept the \nfact that Soviet expansion is here to stay. That was a real threat. \nAgain, it is easy to forget that, but that was the way the world was \njust 25 years ago.\n  Every generation of America has had to face challenges and confront \nthem, and every generation has. Not only have they solved their \nproblems, every generation has left the next better off--every single \none. Now it is our turn.\n  We have a very important choice to make, and it is a pretty dramatic \none. We will either be the first generation of Americans to leave our \nchildren worse off or our children will be the most prosperous \nAmericans who have ever lived. It is one or the other. There is no \nmiddle ground, in my mind, on that. When we debate the future of this \nhealth care law and ObamaCare, we are debating that question.\n  I am reminded of the story of the Star-Spangled Banner and how it was \nwritten. I was reading it this morning. During the attack on the fort, \nit was hard to imagine that after that bombardment the United States \ncould survive. After that bombardment the notion was there is no way \nthey are going to make it through the night. But that next morning when \nthe Star-Spangled Banner--when that flag was hoisted, when it was \nraised, it was a signal to the British and the world that this idea of \nfreedom and liberty had survived. It is interesting how time and again \nthat idea has been tested, both in external and internal conflict. My \ncolleagues may not realize this, but when the Senate is in session, the \nflag is up. So, usually, when I am walking in early in the\n\n[[Page S6806]]\n\nmorning to the Capitol, there is no flag up at 5 in the morning because \nthere is nobody here. I didn't have my TV on this morning, but I looked \nover at the Capitol and I said, My goodness, the flag is still up; \nthese guys are still talking. I am glad they are, because what is at \nstake is the future of our country, economically in ways just as \ndramatic as those challenges we faced at the inception of the Republic. \nThis debate is not just about whether a program named after the \nPresident will stay in law; this debate is about a program that \nundermines the American dream, about the one thing that makes us \nspecial and different from the rest of the world, and if there is \nanything worth fighting for, I would think that is. If there is \nanything worth fighting for, I would think the American dream is worth \nfighting for. I think remaining exceptional is worth fighting for.\n\n  I think after its history of poverty eradication, the free enterprise \nsystem is worth fighting for. I think as someone who has directly \nbenefited from the free enterprise system, I personally have an \nobligation to fight for it. I hope we will all fight for it not just on \nthis issue but in the debate to come next week. This is what this is \nall about.\n  I will close by asking the Senator from Texas, as I highlight all of \nthese challenges we face, is this issue, at the end of the day, about \nus fighting on behalf of everyday people who have no voice in this \nprocess, who can't afford to hire a lobbyist to get them a waiver, who \ncan't afford to hire an accounting firm or a lawyer to handle all of \nthis complexity? At the end of the day the rich companies in America \nare going to figure this out. They may not like it, but they can deal \nwith it. They shouldn't have to, but they can. The people we are \nfighting for are the ones who cannot afford to navigate this.\n  I ask the Senator from Texas: Isn't this what this is all about?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for his \ninspired comments and for his question. He is absolutely right. This \nfight is about whether hard-working Americans get the same exemptions \nand the same benefit President Obama has given big corporations and \nMembers of Congress.\n  I wish to respond to the inspirational remarks of Senator Rubio by \nmaking five comments, the last two of which I think may well be likened \nto Senator Rubio who will be inspired to ask a question in response to \nit.\n  The first point is a very brief one, which is to simply thank the \nSenator from Florida for telling that story about the flag. I will \nconfess as we stand here a few minutes before 7 a.m., I am a little bit \ntired. Senator Lee is probably a little bit tired. I will tell my \ncolleagues, the image of the dust clearing, the smoke clearing, seeing \nthe Star-Spangled Banner waving under the rockets' red glare, that \nvision is inspiring and I appreciate it. It was very kind of the \nSenator to tell that story and it is very meaningful, so I thank him.\n  Secondly, Senator Rubio talked about how the political reporters have \nbeen focusing predominantly on the game, on the political process. He \nis right, I haven't seen any of the news coverage; we have been here on \nthe Senate floor so I don't know what the coverage is. But what he \nreports doesn't surprise me because that is the nature of political \nreporting in Washington. So I am going to make a request directly to \nthose reporters who are covering this proceeding--those reporters who \nare reporting this proceeding--to endeavor to have at least half of \nwhat they say be focused on the actual substance of this debate, on the \nfact that ObamaCare is a train wreck that is killing jobs, that is \nforcing more and more Americans to part-time work, that is driving up \ntheir health insurance premiums, that is causing more and more \nAmericans who are struggling to lose their health insurance. My real \nrequest would make all of the coverage to be on that, but I know that \nis too much to ask. But I am going to suggest if all of the coverage or \nmost of the coverage is on the political process, on this personality \nor that personality, or who is up or who is down, or how this impacts \nthe 2042 Presidential election, I am going to suggest two things. No. \n1, that is not doing the job you have stepped forward to serve and do. \nAll of us have a job. Those of us in this body elected to serve have a \njob to listen to the people and to fight for the men and women of \nAmerica, but those of you who serve in the media have a job to report \nto the men and women of America what is happening, and not just on the \npolitical game.\n  Secondly, I want to say, if you just report on the personalities and \npolitical gains, you are taking sides on this issue. Why is that? \nBecause those who want to keep ObamaCare funded, those who want, on \nFriday or Saturday when cloture comes up for a vote, for Members of \nthis body to vote for cloture, to give Harry Reid the ability to defund \nObamaCare with 51 partisan Democrat votes, they want all the coverage \nto be about the personality, about the politics--about anything, \nanything, anything other than the substance. So if you choose to cover \njust the personalities and the politics, you are doing exactly what \nsome partisans in this body would like, and that is, I am going to \nsuggest, not responsible reporting. I know each one wants to be a \nresponsible steward of informing the public, and it would strike me \nthat the debate we have had here impacts people's lives in a way that \nnobody gives a flip about the politicians involved.\n  A third observation about Senator Rubio's question, when he compared \nObamaCare to a horror film, I enjoyed that comparison. In fact, in my \nmind, I heard the music from ``The Shining''--not ``The Shining,'' from \n``Psycho'' in the shower scene. And it occurred to me that perhaps one \nof the great philosophical conundrums with which we must all wrestle is \nwhether ObamaCare is more like Jason or Freddy. That, indeed, is a \ndifficult question. You can put forth a powerful argument for Jason \nbecause ObamaCare is the biggest job killer in this country and when \nJason put on his hockey mask and swung that machete, there was carnage \nlike nothing else. On the other hand, we could make a powerful argument \nfor Freddy, because as James Hoffa, the president of the Teamsters \nsaid, ObamaCare is a nightmare. It is a nightmare for the men and women \nof America.\n  While the Senate slept, the men and women of America didn't get a \nrespite from the nightmare that is causing them to lose their jobs, \nnever getting hired, causing them to be forced to be reduced to 29 \nhours a week, driving up their health insurance premiums, and \njeopardizing their health care.\n  The only way they get a respite from that nightmare, the only way we \nstop--there was a movie ``Freddy Vs. Jason.'' I forget. They fought \neach other. I forget even what happened in that movie. But the only way \nwe stop Jason and/or Freddy is if the American people rise up in such \noverwhelming numbers that the Members of this Senate listen to the \npeople and we step forward and avert this train wreck, we step forward \nand avert this nightmare.\n  Those are three observations I wanted to make at the outset. Then I \nwant to make two more. I would note, Mr. President, as you know well, \nthe rules of the Senate are curious at times. While I am speaking, I am \nnot allowed to pose a question to another. I am allowed to answer \nquestions, but not to pose a question to another Senator. But there is \nno prohibition in my asking a rhetorical question to the body, which \nmay, in turn, prompt Senator Rubio to ask a question of his own and to \ncomment perhaps on the rhetorical question I might raise.\n  The rhetorical question I would raise to the body--and I have two I \nwant to ask--but I want to start the body thinking about Senator \nRubio's family story. And listen, I am inspired by Senator Rubio's \nstory every time I hear it. I am inspired. Part of it is because his \nfamily, like mine--we share many things in common. His parents, like my \nfather, fled Cuba. His father was a bartender. My dad washed dishes. \nHis mother, I believe, cleaned hotel rooms, if I remember correctly. My \nmother was a sales clerk at Foley's Department Store.\n  The question I would ask the Chamber is: What would have happened if \nwhen Senator Rubio's parents came from Cuba, when they arrived here, if \nObamaCare had been the law of the land? What would have happened to his \nfather and mother as they sought that job as a bartender, cleaning \nhotel rooms, if we had an economy with stagnant growth, where jobs were \nnot available, and they were not able to get\n\n[[Page S6807]]\n\nhired? What would have happened if they had been lucky enough to get \nthat job and their hours had been reduced forcibly to 29 hours a week \nagainst their wishes? What would have happened if they had faced the \neconomic calamity for working men and women--for those struggling--that \nis ObamaCare? I wonder--I have thought many times about what would have \nhappened to my parents. I know it would have been catastrophic in our \nfamily. But I wonder how it would have impacted the Rubio family if \nObamaCare had been the law when Senator Rubio's parents came to this \ncountry seeking the American dream. Would it have benefited them or \nwould it have harmed them?\n  (Mr. MANCHIN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. RUBIO. Will the Senator from Texas yield for a question without \nlosing the floor?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. RUBIO. I heard the rhetorical question the Senator posed to the \nbody, and it involved a direct question about how my family would have \nconfronted those challenges, so let me back up and talk about that for \na second because while it is my family--and I always refer to it--the \nreason why I got in politics and my view of the issues of the day are \nall framed through my upbringing, as all of ours are. You cannot escape \nwhere you come from or what you were raised around. It influences the \nway you view the world and the way you view issues, and the experience \nmy family had has influenced me.\n  I earlier talked about the student loans I once had. I paid them off \nlast year, by the way, with the proceeds of a book, which is available \nnow in paperback, if anyone is curious. But anyway, all joking aside, \nwhen I wrote that book, it required me to go back and learn a lot more \ndetail about my parents. Because like anybody else, when you grow up \nyou listen to your parents talk and you kind of repeat it to other \npeople, but when you are growing up and you are in a hurry, you do not \nalways have time to sit down and listen to the details. This actually \nforced me to go back and learn details about their lives.\n  What ended up happening is I ended up meeting and discovering two \npeople whom I never knew. I knew something about them. I had grown up \nwith them. But I knew my parents in their forties and fifties. I did \nnot know them in their twenties and thirties. Sometimes when you are \nyoung, you forget your parents used to be young too. Sometimes you \nforget that when they were your age, they had their own dreams and \ntheir own hopes and their own aspirations. And they certainly did.\n  It reminds me, as I learned about these stories, I learned that when \nthey came to this country, it was not an instant success. The immigrant \nexperience rarely is. You do not just get here and a week later you are \nrunning a very successful company or whatever. It does not work that \nway. My parents struggled. They were very discouraged those first few \nyears. My dad bounced from temporary job to temporary job. My mom was \nhurt in an accident making aluminum chairs at a factory. She cut her \nhand.\n  They struggled. Those first years were tough. But they persevered, \nand what ended up happening was my father found a job as a bar \nassistant, basically, on Miami Beach. Then eventually, through hard \nwork, he was promoted to bartender, and then one of the top bartenders \nat the hotel. It was not going to make him rich, but it made him \nstable.\n  By 1966, 10 years after they had arrived, they felt so confident in \nthe future they bought a home. Five years after that, they were so \nconfident that even though they were both over 40 years of age, they \nhad me and then my sister a year and a half after that.\n  The Senator asked the question rhetorically to the Chamber--and I am \ngoing to answer it--what would it have been like if a program such as \nthis would have been in place? But it is not just a program such as \nthis. It is not just ObamaCare. It is all the other things the \ngovernment is doing. To answer that question, I have to focus on why \nthey had opportunities to begin with.\n  Why was my dad able to raise our family working as a bartender at a \nhotel on Miami Beach, and then in Las Vegas, and then back in Miami? \nBecause someone who had access to money risked that money to open that \nhotel. That was not a government-run hotel. That hotel existed because \npeople who had access to money--I do not know if they borrowed it; I do \nnot if it was their own; I am not sure of the history behind it--but \nsomeone with access to money said: Instead of leaving it in the bank or \ninvesting it in another country, I am going to risk this money and open \nand operate this hotel. The result is the jobs my parents had existed.\n  But that is how you open a business. How does it continue? How does \nthat business survive? It survived because Americans--after they were \ndone paying their taxes and all their other bills--had enough money \nleft over in their pocket to get on an airplane and fly to Miami Beach \nor to Las Vegas and stay three or four nights at the hotel where my \nparents worked.\n\n  The answer to the Senator's question is, the reason why my parents \nwere able to own a home and provide us a stable environment in which we \ngrew up was because free enterprise works. Free enterprise works. It \nencouraged someone with access to money to open those hotels, and it \nleft enough money and prosperity in people's pockets after they paid \ntheir bills and their taxes so they could take a vacation and go to \nhotels where my parents worked. Without people in those hotels, there \nis no job for our parents. They were able to achieve for us what they \ndid because of free enterprise.\n  To answer the Senator's question about the impact of ObamaCare, \nanything that would undermine free enterprise would have undermined \nthose hopes and those dreams. And ObamaCare is undermining it.\n  I cannot say for certain what would have happened. But here is a \npossibility. ObamaCare could have encouraged the hotel they worked at \nto move employees from 40 hours to 28 hours, hire two bartenders part \ntime instead of one. That would not have been good. ObamaCare could \nhave led them to hire two cashiers at the Crown Hotel in Miami Beach \ninstead of one--two part-timers like my mom. That would not have been \ngood. Even beyond that, because ObamaCare is cutting people's hours all \nover the country, because ObamaCare is keeping people from getting \nhired all over the country, because ObamaCare is costing people their \njobs all over the country, I suspect the number of visitors to that \nhotel would have been diminished.\n  When you lose your job, when you get moved from full time to part \ntime, the next move you make is not to get on an airplane and go on \nvacation. The next move you make is to scramble to make up the \ndifference. That is called personal discretionary spending, and people \ndo not do that when they are uncertain about tomorrow. ObamaCare would \nhave made many Americans uncertain about tomorrow. It is going to make \nmany Americans uncertain about tomorrow. The bottom line is, it would \nhave directly and indirectly harmed my parents' aspirations for \nthemselves and our family.\n  Here is what is troublesome. There are millions of people in this \ncountry today trying to do what my parents did. If you want to find \nthem, walk out of this building and walk three blocks to the nearest \nhotel and you will meet them there. They clean the hotel rooms. They \nserve food at the restaurants. They cater the banquets, as did my dad \nor the gentleman or the lady standing behind that little portable bar \nserving drinks at the next function at which we speak. They are right \ndown the street.\n  They are in the halls of this building. You will meet them. They have \na little vest on. You will see them with a little cart, cleaning the \nbathrooms and the floors and providing an environment where we can \nwork. These are people who are working hard to achieve a better life \nfor themselves and oftentimes for their children. These are folks, many \nof whom have decided: I am going to sacrifice and work a job so my \nchildren can have a career.\n  I cannot tell you how many of the people who work in this building I \nhave talked to, such as the company that caters our lunches or are in \nthe cafeterias here. I cannot tell you how many of them have said to me \nthe reason why they are working these jobs is because they hope one day \ntheir children\n\n[[Page S6808]]\n\ncan do something such as stand on the floor of this Senate.\n  I say to Senator Cruz, that happens to be our story. That happens to \nbe the American story too. We forget that some of the greatest heroes \nin the American story are not the people who have been on the cover of \nmagazines. Some of the greatest heroes in the American story are not \npeople who have had movies made about them. Some of the greatest heroes \nin the American story are not the famous people who are on CNBC being \ninterviewed all the time about how successful they are. They are heroes \ntoo. But some of the greatest heroes in the American story are people \nyou will never learn about, about whom books will never be written, \nwhose stories will never be told. Some of the greatest heroes in the \nAmerican story are people who have worked hard at jobs--back-breaking \njobs, difficult jobs--so their children can have careers.\n  I want you to think about what that means. Think about reaching a \npoint in your life when you realize, you know what, for me, this is \nabout as far as I am going to be able to go--because of age, because of \ncircumstances--but now the purpose of my life will become making sure \nall the doors that were closed for me are open for my children. Imagine \nthat. Because that is what millions of people are living right now.\n  It is not that they are not talented, it is not that they are not \nsmart, except they are 45 or 40 or 46, and time is running out on them. \nBut what America is going to give them a chance to do is, it is going \nto give them a chance to open doors for their children that were closed \nfor them.\n  They are not going to be able to leave their children trust funds. \nThey are not going to be able to leave their children millions of \ndollars. They are not going to be able to leave their children a home \neven. But they are going to be able to allow their children to inherit \ntheir unfulfilled dreams and fulfill them.\n  There are millions of people in this country who are trying to do \nthat right now. There are people who work in this Capitol who are \ntrying to do that right now. There are people working within blocks of \nhere who are trying to do that right now. ObamaCare is going to make it \nharder for them to do that. It is ironic because ObamaCare was sold as \na plan to help people like that. Instead, because it undermines the \nfree enterprise system, it is hurting them.\n  Many of those people who are being hurt may not have realized it yet. \nI think the job of leadership is to explain the consequences to people. \nBut in the end, I feel as though we have an obligation to fight on \ntheir behalf. I feel as though we--especially those of us who are a \ngeneration removed from that experience--have a special obligation to \nfight for that.\n  The American story is not the story of people who have made it and \nthen say: Now everyone is on their own. The American story is the story \nof people who have succeeded and want others to succeed as well. That, \nby the way, is one of the fundamental differences between the view of \nbig government and the view of free enterprise. Big government believes \nthat the economy cannot really grow, and so what we need government to \ndo is divide it up among us. Right? The economy is a limited thing. \nThere is only so much money to go around, so we need the government to \nstep in and make sure the money is distributed fairly. That is what we \nare going to use taxes for. That is the view big government has.\n  What makes America different is we rejected that. We said that is not \ntrue. We believe in free enterprise, and free enterprise believes the \neconomy can always continue to grow bigger.\n  That means if you are successful you can stay successful, and other \npeople can become successful as well. What makes America special is \nthat free enterprise believes you do not have to make anybody worse off \nin order to make someone better off. That is different from the rest of \nthe world, and it works.\n  I remember growing up, especially when I lived in Las Vegas. There \nwere not a lot of--back then, especially, there were not a lot of \nfamily friendly things to do on the weekends. One of the things we used \nto do--my parents liked to do this--they would drive us through the \nnice neighborhoods with the nice houses. I remember Liberace's house \nwas in Las Vegas. It was one of the nice houses.\n  They would drive us through these neighborhoods and they would show \nus these houses. When we looked at these houses they would not say to \nus: Look at the people living in those houses, look at how much money \nthey are making. That is unfair. Right? They are making all that money, \nand that is why we are struggling. The reason why we live in a small \nhouse is because people like them live in big houses.\n  They did not teach that to us. On the contrary. Do you know what they \nused to say to us. Look at what these people accomplished through hard \nwork and sacrifice. That can be you if that is what you want. Look at \nwhat these people were able to do. That can be you.\n  That is the difference in some ways between us and the rest of the \nworld. We have never been a place of class envy and class warfare. We \nhave always pointed to these stories as an example of what you can do \nas well. We celebrate success in America. It inspires us because we \nknow it is not a zero sum game. We know that you can be successful and \nI can be successful. We know that you can have a successful business \nand I can have a successful business.\n  We know that in order for me to be more prosperous I do not have to \nmake anyone less prosperous. That is a big deal, because that is not \nthe way the world has functioned for most of its history. For most of \nits history, governments did not view it that way and peoples did not \nview it that way. They always viewed that there had to be a winner and \nthere had to be a loser. One of the things that made us really unique \nis that we never viewed it that way. In America we have viewed it as \nyou can be a winner and I can be a winner. We can both benefit from \neach other, because that is how free enterprise works.\n  In free enterprise you need your customers to be well off. You need \nyour customers to be doing well economically. You cannot afford to \nbankrupt people by raising your prices because then they cannot buy \nstuff from you. It is all interrelated. Last year during the campaign \nthere was this big debate about job creators, whether or not you \nrealize it. Every time you go shopping at a department store you are a \njob creator. Every time you order something on the Internet you are a \njob creator. Every time you spend money in our economy you are a job \ncreator.\n  Some people open a business. But every American is a job creator \nbecause in the free enterprise, the better off you are the better off \nwe are. And we can all be better off. That is not the direction we are \nheaded. That is one of the things that they are trying to influence in \nthis debate on ObamaCare. They are trying to argue that this is an \neffort to deny people something. Not true. This is an effort to protect \npeople from something, especially people that are vulnerable to this. I \nrepeat; I am telling you that I have talked to a lot of successful \npeople, people that are making a lot of money or have made a lot of \nmoney. They do not like ObamaCare but they are going to be fine with \nit. They are going to deal with it. They can afford to deal with it. \nThey do not like it. They are going to have to make decisions in \nbusiness that they do not want to make. But they are going to figure \nout how to deal with this one way or the other.\n  At the end of the day, they are going to be fine with whatever we do. \nThey are not going to be the ones who are going to be hurt by this. The \nones who are going to be hurt by this are the people who are trying to \nmake it, the people whose hours are going to be cut, whose jobs are \ngoing to be slashed, who are going to lose benefits that they are happy \nwith.\n  Sadly, because they are so busy with their lives, working and raising \ntheir kids, they may not realize why all of this is happening until it \nis too late. So the question the Senator posed to the body was a very \ninsightful one. It goes to the heart of what this debate is about: Who \nare we fighting for? What are we fighting about?\n  I fear that too many people that are covering this process think this \nis all about an effort to keep the President from accomplishing \nsomething that he feels strongly about. Not true. This is an effort to \nfight on behalf of people who are going to be hurt badly. This is\n\n[[Page S6809]]\n\nan effort to fight on behalf of people who do not have the influence or \nthe power to fight here for themselves. That is why we are here. This \nis an effort to fight on behalf of people who are trying to do what my \nparents did. This is an effort to fight on behalf of the people who are \ntrying to start a business out of the spare bedroom of their home--\nprobably in violation of the zoning code, but they are trying to do it.\n  This is an effort to fight on behalf of the people who are working \nevery single day to achieve their full potential. This is an effort to \nfight on behalf of people who are working hard at jobs that are hard to \nget up for in the morning to go do. But they are going to go do it, \nbecause the purpose of their life is to give their kids the chance to \ndo anything they want.\n  Do you how many people I know like that? You cannot walk 10 steps in \nmy neighborhood without running into people like that. The whole \npurpose of their life, the singular focus of their life, is to make \nsure that their kids have a chance to do all the things they never got \nthe chance to do. Do you know how many people there are like that \naround this country? They depend on the jobs that are being destroyed \nby ObamaCare. They depend on the opportunities that are not being \ncreated because of ObamaCare. That is wrong. I hope we will be \nsuccessful with this effort.\n  Now, people are going to focus on how the vote is going to go down. \nThis is not going end here, guys. We are not going to stop talking \nabout this no matter how the vote here ends up. We are going to \ncontinue to do everything we can to keep this from hurting the American \npeople because it undermines the essence of our Nation.\n\n  The reason why I am so passionate about this goes right to the heart \nof the question the Senator asked, because ObamaCare and big government \nin general make it harder, not easier for people that are trying to do \nwhat my parents did to achieve their dreams.\n  I think the question of Senator Cruz goes to the heart of what this \ndebate is all about. I would yield back to the Senator to encourage him \nto continue to highlight the impact that this law is having on real \npeople and their real lives, because I think it is going take some time \nto break through the narrative that this is all a big political fight, \nthat this is between the President and his opponents.\n  Whether this law was called ObamaCare or not, we would have to oppose \nit, because it is hurting real people who are trying to achieve the \nAmerican dream.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Florida for his answer on how the \nlaw would have impacted his family. I will say this: I have no doubt \nthat at every gathering in every hotel where Senator Rubio speaks, \nthere is not a bartender, there is not a waiter, there is not a \ndishwasher in the room who does not look over and think: I wonder if \nsome day my daughter, my son, could be in the Senate.\n  What an extraordinary statement. Do you know what. If we were in \nalmost any other country on earth you could not say that. In most \ncountries on earth, if you are not born into a family of power and \nprestige and influence, you have no chance whatsoever of serving in a \nposition of significant political leadership. Only in America. That is \nthe opportunity this country is. I have no doubt of the inspiration it \nserves every day when Senator Rubio shares his story.\n  I have no doubt also that Senator Rubio is right that if ObamaCare \nhad been the law when his parents came from Cuba, when they were \nimmigrants, when they were looking for jobs, when they wanted to \nsupport their family and eventually their young family when they had \nkids, that if they had not been able to get those jobs or if they had \nhad their hours forcibly reduced to 29 hours a week so they could not \nearn enough to provide for their children, to give them the food, to \ngive them the education, to give them the housing that they needed, it \ncould have had a dramatic impact.\n  If ObamaCare had been the law, it may very well have been the case \nthat Senator Marco Rubio would not be in the Senate right now, because \nit may have been that his parents would have struggled so much to make \nends meet that they would not have been able to provide for him as a \nyoung boy the way they did, to give him the opportunities they gave \nhim. He might not be here and our country would be far the poorer.\n  I know for me and my family, if my dad had not had that opportunity \nto get a job washing dishes for 50 cents an hour, if my mom had not \ngotten the opportunity to get her first jobs, there is a very good \npossibility I would not have had the chance to represent Texas.\n  When you cut off opportunity for those who are struggling to climb \nthe economic ladder, it impacts for decades. It does not just impact \nthem, but their children and their children's children. That leads to a \nsecond rhetorical question that I want to ask the Chamber, but it would \nnot surprise me if it prompts, in turn, a question from Senator Rubio.\n  That is, Senator Rubio and I both have the privilege of representing \nStates in which there is a tremendous Hispanic community. We both come \nfrom the Hispanic community, were raised in the Hispanic community. We \nboth have the great honor of representing a great many Hispanics, he in \nFlorida, me in Texas.\n  Some of the discussion of the Hispanic community focuses on his \nparents, like my father, who were young immigrants struggling, who may \nnot speak English and who are on the first or second rung of the \neconomic ladder. That describes a great many in the Hispanic community \nbut there are others who are not necessarily in that circumstance.\n  In the United States there are right now approximately 2.3 million \nHispanic small business owners. The Hispanic community is tremendously \nentrepreneurial. There are roughly 50 million Hispanics in the United \nStates. That means roughly 1 in 8 Hispanic households is a small \nbusiness owner. So the question I would pose, rhetorically, to the \nChamber, is, what is the impact of ObamaCare on the Hispanic community? \nWhat is the impact of the crippling impact on jobs, of the punitive \ntaxes, of the 20,000 pages of regulations? What is the impact on those \n2.3 million Hispanic small business owners? What is the impact on \neconomic growth and achieving the American dream? What is the impact on \nthe Hispanic community, because I am convinced there is no ideal that \nresonates more in the Hispanic community than the American dream, than \nthe idea that any one of us, regardless of who our mother or father is, \nregardless of where we come from, any one of us through hard work and \nperseverance, through the content of our character can achieve the \nAmerican dream.\n  The question I would pose: Has ObamaCare made it easier or harder to \nachieve the American dream? How has ObamaCare impacted the Hispanic \ncommunity?\n  Mr. RUBIO. Would the Senator from Texas yield?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I would yield for a question without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. RUBIO. The Senator asked actually a great question. We talk about \npeople who are trying to make it. We talk about the people who are \nworking hard to sacrifice and to leave their children and families \nbetter off.\n  A disproportionate number of people who are trying to do that find \nthemselves in minority communities. You asked about the Hispanic \ncommunity. I live in a Hispanic neighborhood even now. I live just \nblocks away from the famed Calle Ocho, 8th Street, in Miami.\n  If you have never been, I encourage you to come. The President \nvisited an establishment about 4 blocks from my house, I think back in \n2010 when he was in town campaigning for one of the candidates. \nLiterally, I mean literally, every business, one after another after \nanother is a small family-owned or family-operated business.\n  Every single one. It is the bakery, next to the dry cleaner, next to \nthe liquor store, next to the grocery store, next to the uniform shop \nthat sells uniforms next to the gas station, next to the banquet hall. \nIt goes on and on and on. I invite you to come down and see it. There \nis a Popeyes there, and you will find a McDonald's. But even those \nfranchises, by the way, are owned by families.\n  Literally, every business on 8th Street, on Calle Ocho, just blocks \naway\n\n[[Page S6810]]\n\nfrom my house, one after the other after the other, is a small \nbusiness. So are all of my neighbors.\n  I have a neighbor who runs an electronic alarm company and another \nneighbor who runs a pool-cleaning business. I am just speaking about my \nneighborhood. That is the story of the country.\n  Listen, there are very successful people, Americans of Hispanic \ndescent, who started out as a small business and now are a big business \nand have been very successful too of course. It is sort of like the \nrest of the population. It reflects the concerns of whatever challenges \nthey are facing.\n  But an enormous percentage of Americans of Hispanic descent also \nhappen to be people who are trying to accomplish the American dream. \nPerhaps the strongest burning desire you will find in minority \ncommunities in general--and in particular the one I know best, the \nHispanic community--is that burning desire to give their kids the \nchance to do everything they couldn't. Maybe by the time you got here \nyou were already into your late twenties or early thirties. Because you \ncould succeed, there are many stories of people who have come here at \nthat age and have accomplished extraordinary things. They started in \nsmall business, and before you knew it they were being publicly traded. \nThat is a great part of the American story. We celebrate that.\n  But there are also countless people who worked jobs their whole life. \nThat is what they end up doing. They worked those jobs so their kids \ncould have the opportunity to get ahead. That is a very prevalent story \nin the Hispanic community.\n  Interestingly enough, the Hispanic community is very diverse on a lot \nof different things. Obviously, we have a strong Cuban-American \npresence in South Florida, but we also have a significant presence from \nSouth America. My wife's family is from Colombia. We have a very \nvibrant Venezuelan community, by the way, coming to the United States \nto escape Big Government gone horrible.\n  They just posted--if you read this yesterday--posted military \nofficers at the toilet paper factory in Venezuela because they are not \nproducing enough toilet paper. They think it is some sort of \ncapitalist, imperialist plot to deny the people of Venezuela toilet \npaper. They have now stationed troops at the toilet paper factory.\n  This is a country where many of those who find themselves on the \nAmerican left love going down and extolling the virtues of Chavez, \nabout how great a country it was. They can't--well, let me not say on \nthe Senate floor what they cannot do anymore--but they are struggling \nto provide toilet paper for their people.\n  That is how Big Government works. If you want to see another \nsocialist paradise, go to Cuba. The infrastructure is struggling and \npeople are trying to get out of that economy. There are no political \nfreedoms in Cuba, but the economic freedoms are a disaster.\n  It is because Big Government does not work. Compare that to Chile, to \nPanama, to Colombia. Compare Colombia to Venezuela, two countries \nliving next together.\n  A decade ago Colombia was caught in a deep struggle with drug lords \nand drug cartels. They still have problems with the guerrillas and the \nFARC, things such as that, but Colombia has turned things around. Why? \nTwo things; one, real leadership at the political level; and, two, free \nenterprise. They embraced free enterprise.\n  We have a free-trade agreement with Colombia. There is prosperity in \nColombia. Compare that with next-door Venezuela, an energy-rich \ncountry, a country that is rich with oil, a country that has natural \nresources and advantages that Colombia doesn't have, Venezuela. They \ncan't even produce toilet paper because Big Government failed.\n  In fact, there has been a massive migration of experts in the oil \nindustry leaving Venezuela and moving to Colombia. Compare to Mexico. \nMexico still has some challenges, but Mexico has a vibrant middle \nclass. There is a real middle class in Mexico, and it is growing. Look \nat the moves the new President is making. They are not going to open \nthe oil industry there the way we would do it in the United States, but \nthey are going to make changes to the oil industry because they want to \ngrow and they want to create prosperity.\n  This holds great promise for our country. Stronger integration \nbetween Canada, the United States, and Mexico is very promising. We can \ncooperate on all sorts of things from energy to security issues. I \nthink that holds great promise. North American energy has the \nopportunity to displace energy coming from unstable parts of the world \nsuch as the Middle East.\n  But how is Mexico growing its economy? What is Mexico thinking in \norder to grow its economy and provide more prosperity for its people. \nThey are thinking about embracing more free enterprise.\n  Look at the countries in Latin America that are succeeding: Peru, \nChile, Panama, Mexico, Colombia. I hope I am not leaving anyone out. \nThese are countries that are moving ahead.\n  They have struggles and challenges, and it is not a clear upward \ntrajectory because there are challenges in the global economy, but they \nare moving ahead.\n  Look at the countries that are a disaster: Cuba, Venezuela, Bolivia, \nEcuador, and Nicaragua. What is the difference? What is the starkest \ndifference between these countries other than perhaps the individual \nlunacy of some of these individuals in this country. What is the \ndifference?\n  The difference is the countries that are failing and embarrassing \ntheir people are the countries that are embracing Big Government and \nsocialism. The countries that are providing middle-class opportunities \nand upward mobility are the countries that are embracing more and more \nfree enterprise.\n  When you ask about the Americans of Hispanic descent, these are the \ncountries they came from. They came here to get away from Big \nGovernment. Why is there a vibrant and growing Venezuelan community in \nMiami-Dade County where I live? Because Big Government is destroying \nVenezuela.\n  Why are there over 1 million Cuban exiles living in Miami, New \nJersey, and concentrated in different parts of the country, including a \nsizable community in Houston, TX? Because they came here to flee, not \njust Big Government, but the oppression that comes from very Big \nGovernment, socialism and Marxism.\n\n  Why do people cross the border from Mexico and come into the United \nStates in search of jobs and opportunities--because for a long time \nMexico didn't embrace free enterprise policies. It is now \nincreasingly--and what is happening in Mexico, a vibrant and growing \nmiddle class, a sense of upward mobility. Every country has challenges. \nThey have challenges in Mexico, but they are trying to turn it around \nand they are doing some good things to try to do that because they are \nembracing free enterprise.\n  The unique thing about it, Senator Cruz, is that Americans of \nHispanic descent, particularly those here in the first generation or \nthe second, have come here to get away from Big Government policies, \nbecause in countries that have Big Government, you are trapped. You are \ntrapped. In countries that have Big Government, the people that come \nfrom powerful families and powerful enclaves, they are the people who \nkeep winning.\n  In places where the government dominates the economy, as is \ndisproportionately the case, and the countries that immigrants come \nhere from, those are the places where the same people keep winning.\n  The biggest company 50 years ago is still the biggest company. The \nrichest family in the country is still the richest family. The \nPresident is the grandson and the son, over and over.\n  That is what Big Government does. It traps people in the \ncircumstances of their birth.\n  What happens if you are a talented, ambitious, and hard-working \nperson living in a country like that, frustrated and trapped? You try \nto get to the only country in the world where people like you even have \na chance, the United States.\n  We have millions of people living in this country of Hispanic descent \nthat experience that, that know what it is like to live in a place \nwhere you are trapped in circumstances of their birth. The reason why \nthey love America is because here they are not limited by that.\n  I have said oftentimes--and I think you would share this perception \nin the\n\n[[Page S6811]]\n\nstory of your father, Senator Cruz--it is true that immigrants impact \nAmerica. It is true they do. Immigrants impact America, they contribute \nto America, they change America.\n  But I promise you that America changes immigrants even more. You find \nthat in the Hispanic community, the impact that America has on \nimmigrants once it opens opportunities for them. Long before my parents \nbecame citizens, they were Americans in their heart. That is still \ntrue. You will still find that out there in the Hispanic communities. \nYou will still find people who understand how special this country is \nbecause of the opportunities it is giving them and their children. This \nis why I think they will and are starting to understand how damaging \nthis law may be.\n  If you watch Spanish-language television, they are running these \nadvertisements now, talking about sign up for ObamaCare, it is good for \nyou. They are making it sound like this is going to be cheap and free \ninsurance for people. When you are working hard 10, 12 hours a day and \nnot making a lot of money, maybe your employer doesn't provide health \ninsurance and along come these politicians telling you we are going to \ngive you health insurance cheap and free. It is enticing, but it is not \nwhat is going to happen. When people realize that, not only are they \ngoing to be upset, they are going to be livid.\n  When they go to work one day and they tell them: Guess what. You are \nnow a part-time worker, they are going to be livid. When they go to \nwork because they are working part-time because of where they go to \nschool and they lose hours, they are going to be livid.\n  When they go back to work one of these days, they may be working at \none of these places where they have health insurance, as over 70 \npercent of Americans do, and they are happy with it. All of a sudden \nthey found out: You know that health insurance you have, that is not \nour health insurance anymore. You have to go on this Web site and shop \nfor a new one.\n  If they go on the Web site today they can't shop for anything. It \nisn't set up yet. They are going to be livid.\n  When we talked about defending people who are trying to make it, \npeople who are working hard to persevere and move ahead, I think that \nis the epitome of what you will find in the Hispanic community in this \ncountry. That is the typical story of people who are here. They are \nworking hard to get ahead and they want their children to have a better \nlife than them.\n  There is only one economic system in the world where that is possible \nand that is the American free enterprise system. ObamaCare directly \nundermines it. If for no other reason we should repeal ObamaCare \nbecause it undermines the free enterprise system--the single greatest \neradicator of poverty in human history, the free enterprise system. It \nis the only system in human history that allows people to emerge from \npoverty and into a stable middle class and beyond, the free enterprise \nsystem. It is the only economic system in human history that rewards \nhard work, sacrifice, and merit, the American free enterprise system. \nObamaCare is undermining it.\n  As I yield back to the Senator, is it not the case that what we are \ndoing is not to stand against ObamaCare. We are fighting against the \nonly system in American history, American free enterprise, where upward \nmobility is possible for so many people.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Florida for his passion, for his \nheartfelt commitment to opportunity and understanding.\n  This is not about the rich and powerful. We are rich and powerful. \nThe rich and powerful are just fine with ObamaCare. Indeed, the rich \nand powerful are better than just fine with ObamaCare. The rich and \npowerful get special exemptions. The rich and powerful get treated \nbetter because they are buddies with the current administration. Big \nbusiness and giant corporations get exemptions from ObamaCare. Members \nof Congress get exemptions from ObamaCare.\n  Mark my words, if Congress doesn't act to defund ObamaCare to stop \nthis train wreck before the end of the President's administration, \nunions are going to end up getting an exemption from ObamaCare. It is \ngoing to be everyone who is a political friend of the administration, \nhas juice and has power, will get extensions.\n  The people who are left, you have nothing to worry about unless you \ndon't happen to have several high-paid Washington, DC, lobbyists on \nyour staff, unless you happen just to be a Hispanic entrepreneur, a \nsingle mom or a hard-working American trying to provide for his or her \nfamily, then maybe you will have something to worry about. But you are \nnot going to get the exemption because what the Senate has been saying \nto you is exemptions for everybody else but not for hard-working \nAmerican families.\n  I believe if it doesn't apply to everyone, it should apply to no one. \nThe Senate shouldn't be picking and choosing winners and losers and who \nare the favored political class.\n  The Senator from Florida talked about Cuba. Some, particularly in \nHollywood, like to lionize Cuba as this workers' paradise, but I would \nnote Cuba has socialized medicine. Majority leader Harry Reid has \nstated his intention that he believes ObamaCare will lead, inevitably, \nto socialized medicine, to single-payer, government-provided health \ncare. Some in Hollywood have lionized Cuba as this workers' paradise. \nYet I am reminded of a comment President Reagan said in the midst of \nthe Cold War.\n  The funny thing he said is if you go to the Berlin Wall and look at \nthe Berlin Wall, the machine guns all point in one direction.\n  The same thing is true about Cuba. People talk about, the workers' \nparadise. The funny thing about Cuba, the rafts all go in one \ndirection.\n  In the decade since Fidel Castro seized control and began brutally \noppressing the people of Cuba, destroying that once great Nation I am \nnot aware of a single instance since the day of that revolution of one \nperson getting on a raft in Florida and heading over to Cuba--ever. I \nam not aware of it ever happening. So if socialized medicine is this \noasis, if we are to believe the Michael Moores of the world in \nHollywood, one would expect Floridians to be jumping on rafts. You \nknow, that 90 miles, it crosses both ways. In fact, Floridians can \nprobably get a better boat than they can in Cuba, but nobody goes that \nway. They flee to freedom. They flee to America.\n\n  What gives freedom such vibrancy--you want to talk about what matters \nto the Hispanic community, you want to talk about what matters to the \nAfrican-American community, you want to talk about what matters to \nsingle moms? It is the opportunity to work. It is the opportunity to \nget a job. When we talk about what matters to young people, it is the \nopportunity to start a career and to move toward advancing to providing \nfor your family, to having the dignity and respect of working toward \nyour dreams, toward your passions, toward your desires. ObamaCare is \nstifling that, and that is a tragedy. It is a tragedy. And the only way \nit will stop is if this body begins to listen to the American people. \nTogether, we must make D.C. listen.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, would the distinguished Senator from \nTexas yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. How is the Senator doing?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Kansas. And I will tell the \nSenator, I am doing fabulous. I am inspired and I am motivated by the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I saw a black car down there in the parking lot with a \nTexas license plate, and I figured that was the Senator's. Didn't see \nhim in it. Everybody was wondering as they got up this morning, after \nlistening to the Senator last night, whether he would still be \nstanding, but here he is. I appreciate this.\n  I think the thing I appreciate the most--and the question will \nfollow, Mr. President--is how the Senator has conducted himself because \nthroughout the night he has had some folks at least making their point \nof view, which is obviously very different from his. Sometimes folks in \nthis body get a little critical--arrows and slings--and although not \nnecessary, those wounds heal. But in each and every case of a person \nwho has brought a different point of view, the Senator has very deftly \nand very skillfully, acting like a Senator, respected their point of \nview. Not once did I see him do anything else.\n\n[[Page S6812]]\n\n  I gave up about midnight, by the way, my wife about 11. She fell \nasleep. But I thank the Senator for that. I thank him for being truly \nsenatorial and basically doing what Senators do; that is, respect \neverybody's point of view.\n  I especially liked the comment of Bernie Sanders, whom I also like. \nYou wouldn't know it, but he does have quite a sense of humor. A \ndifferent point of view but very honest about it. So I thank the \nSenator for that.\n  If the Senator wants breakfast, if he is about ready to sit down, I \nwill be happy to buy him breakfast. But we will let that go.\n  The other thing I want to ask is how does the Senator feel coming \nhere as a new Senator and knowing how the Senate used to operate and \nknowing that in the Senate I came to, every Senator, on an important \nissue, had the opportunity to offer an amendment. It could be germane \nor it could not be germane. But for the last 5 years that has not been \nthe case. There have been a few exceptions when we have had what is \ncalled regular order. Folks back home don't know what regular order is, \nbut it is the way the Senate used to operate. It is the difference \nbetween the Senate and the House. It is the reason I left the House and \nran for the Senate, because I wanted to have that opportunity to be an \nindividual Senator.\n  Last year I made a reference to the farm bill, which has somewhat \nsomething to do with what the Senator is talking about because it \ninvolves the ability of America to feed not only us but a very troubled \nand hungry world. Of course, food helps your health, obviously, but you \nshow me a country that cannot feed itself and I will show you a country \nthat is in chaos. So we do farm bills. They are much maligned. Right \nnow not too many people even care about them, but they are terribly \nimportant. And farmers and ranchers now see no certainty out there \nbecause, like the health care law, at the end of this fiscal year the \nfarm bill is going to expire, and they wonder what on Earth we are \ndoing. We are in a perfect storm.\n  In the last farm bill--not this one, in the last farm bill--in \ntalking to the majority leader--whom I affectionately call Smoking Joe \nbecause he is a fan of boxing and Joe Frazier--I said: We can do this \nin 2\\1/2\\ days. And the chairperson of the committee, Senator Stabenow, \nalso obviously weighed in, but we did the farm bill in 2\\1/2\\ days. \nThat was a record.\n  The first amendment on the farm bill was the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky dealing with Pakistan and saying no more aid to Pakistan \nuntil they freed that doctor who was very helpful to our intelligence \ncommunity with regard to what happened with Osama bin Laden. What did \nthat have to do with the farm bill? Nothing.\n  Rand Paul came to me and said: Do you think we can get this \namendment?\n  I said: Yes. We have an open rule.\n  There were 73 amendments considered--73; this last farm bill, only \nabout 10, probably less than that. Senator Thune had very key \namendments, Senator Johanns had very key amendments, Senator Grassley \nhad key amendments, and I, the former chairman of the House agriculture \ncommittee, the former ranking member, had some key amendments. All of \nthe senior members on the agriculture committee, all of us who had \ncontributed to that process were locked out--sorry, it is over, no \namendments. What is that all about?\n  We have a one-person rules committee in this Senate. And if there is \nanything I am upset about, it is the lack of ability and the lack of \nopportunity for the Senator from Texas or Kentucky or Kansas or anybody \nelse in this body to offer an amendment.\n  So here we are--what is it--5 days away from the law that says: \nPrescribed by law, these exchanges and everything that has anything to \ndo with the unaffordable health care act is going to take place. And \nthe Senator has demonstrated time and time again, with every allegory \none can possibly come up with, how this is a train wreck.\n  Yesterday afternoon, when the Senator started--well, it was in the \nevening--I came to the floor and said: Look, isn't it worth the fight, \nisn't it worth the effort--and the Senator is making the effort, and I \nappreciate that so much--knowing this is the first, second, and third \nstep--skip to my Lou, my darlin'--going right into socialized medicine? \nAnd who says that? Well, let's start with the President; then the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius; then Nancy \nPelosi in the House; and then the distinguished majority leader here \nsaying: Yes, we want a single-payer system.\n  A single-payer system means national health care; it means socialized \nmedicine; it means, as the Senator has pointed out during all of this \nrather unique and incredible time he has taken before the Senate, the \ngovernment pays for it, which means we all pay for it and premiums go \nup and the insurance companies have a heck of a time and there will be \nexactly what the Senator has described in Cuba. I am hoping it won't be \nthat bad, but at least he has pointed it out.\n  So my question to the Senator is, after all of that rambling rose, \nwouldn't it be nice, wouldn't it be in the best interests of this body, \nwouldn't it be in the best interests of Americans to open this Senate, \ngo back to regular order, and at least have an opportunity to offer \namendments?\n  Some of the folks who were somewhat critical of the Senator said: \nWell, what are you going to offer?\n  There are about five amendments I would like to offer. I don't know \nwhat the Senator thinks the key amendments are that he would like to \noffer as a positive answer as opposed to shutting down the Affordable \nHealth Care Act with a lack of funding. We could only do that partially \nbecause a lot of it gets in with taxes, and that is the mandated funds \nwe allegedly can't touch. But would the Senator please list about two \nor three amendments he would like to offer.\n  I think I would like to see the medical device tax repealed, but, \nagain, that is one of those mandatory things we have to deal with in \nthe Finance Committee, of which I am a member. But let's get on the \npositive side of this and say: OK, if the Senator had the opportunity \nto offer amendments and everybody else had an opportunity to offer \namendments--and the Senator has spent a great deal of time here \novernight. What was it--2:40 in the afternoon? That is what they keep \nflashing on the news. Quite frankly, I was listening to Ray Price \nsinging ``For the Good Times,'' and I flipped over to FOX News, and \nthere you were again. I thought, my Lord, there he is, still standing \nand still talking.\n  So give me just about three amendments the Senator might offer. We \nshouldn't do more than three things because people forget about it \nafter three.\n  There is one other thing I want to mention. I got a lot of derision \nand a lot of criticism when this bill was first passed. I serve on the \nHELP Committee--Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. We spent a great \ndeal of time on this bill. I had three amendments to prevent rationing \nby the rationing board. Everybody says they are not rationing, but they \nare. So those decisions are not being made by the patient and doctor, \nthey are being made by appointed bodies or we can use the term \n``bureaucrats.'' That is usually a pejorative term. At any rate, I was \nupset, and I said: We are riding hell for leather into a box canyon, \nand there are a lot of cactuses in the world. We don't have to sit on \nevery one of them, but, by golly, we are. We are about to do that. And \nI had some other allegories we use in Dodge City, KS, and I had a few \nmarine stories to tell, and then I got derided even on national news: \nOh my gosh, here is this cowboy from Dodge City. I am not. I am an old \nnewspaper person.\n  At any rate, I am in here saying we are going into a box canyon only \nto find out four or five other people now have referred to it as a box \ncanyon. We are in it. Everybody understands what a box canyon is, and \nwe have to ride out. So when we are riding out, what are we going to \ndo, I would ask the Senator from Texas. Give me three amendments.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Kansas for his very fine question, \nand I will make a couple of general points about the Senator from \nKansas first, and then I will answer his important question.\n  I want to say that Senator Roberts is an old lion in the Senate. He \nwas here last night, he was here this morning supporting us, and that \nis a big\n\n[[Page S6813]]\n\ndeal. The Senator from Kansas is a respected leader of this body, a \ngraybeard, and, I would note, a very well-liked Senator.\n  One point I will make about Senator Roberts is that, in my humble \nopinion, I think he is one of the two funniest Senators in the \nRepublican conference. I would say Senator Roberts and Lindsey Graham \nboth have a fantastic sense of humor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I will be happy to yield for a question but not yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Well, the question is, some people are funny and some \npeople are humorous. I may be one of the most humorous, but Senator \nGraham is truly funny.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I will note on that question that I can provide no response \nother than to say, as they say in mathematics, QED. That point is \ngranted.\n  But I will note that for the Senator from Kansas, as a respected \nsenior Senator, to come and support this effort and even more \nimportantly for the Senator from Kansas to have the courage to disagree \nwith party leadership and express a willingness to vote against \ncloture--because doing so would allow the majority leader of the \nSenate, Harry Reid, to fund ObamaCare on a straight party-line vote \nwith no input from Republicans--takes courage.\n  I guarantee you, it is noticed that Senator Roberts is standing with \nus. It is noticed that Senator Sessions is standing with us. It is \nnoticed that Senator Enzi is standing with us. It is one thing for the \nyoung Turks, it is one thing for those who have been dubbed the ``wacko \nbirds'' to be willing to stand and fight, but when we see senior elder \nstatesmen of the Senate standing side by side, I would suggest we are \nstarting to see what I hope will happen this week, which is seeing \nRepublicans unify.\n  I would like to see all 46 Republicans vote together on cloture on \nFriday or Saturday, whenever that vote occurs. I would like to see all \nof us stand together and vote against cloture because we say we can't, \nin good conscience, with the commitments we have made to our \nconstituents, vote to allow the majority leader to fund ObamaCare on a \nstraight 51 partisan party-line vote. I would like to see that happen, \nand I would note that Senator Roberts' presence here at night and in \nthe morning is beneficial to making that happen. I hope it causes other \nrespected leaders in our party to give a second thought that perhaps \nthe division in the Republican conference is not benefiting the Nation \nor benefiting the Republican Party. Perhaps it is not serving the \ninterests of our constituents.\n  Before I answer the question directly, that point is an important \npoint to make--that the Senator's support is significant.\n  I also wish to acknowledge Senator Roberts' very kind compliment \nabout the way I have endeavored to conduct myself.\n  Senator Mike Lee has always conducted himself with respect for the \nviews of others, not speaking ill of any Member of this Senate--\nRepublican or Democrat. That is certainly what I have endeavored to do, \nand it is meaningful.\n  Senator Roberts comments that it is his judgment we have had some \nmodicum of success achieved. I would note that characterization is at \nleast mildly at odds with what one might think if one simply read the \nNew York Times. If one read the New York Times, one would expect that \nperhaps I am leaning over, biting my colleagues with bare fangs. So I \nappreciate the observation of the Senator from Kansas that, in his \njudgment, we have not conducted ourselves that way. The reason is \nsimple: The New York Times wants to spill gallons of ink on \npersonalities, on people, on politics, and on anything except the \nsubstance.\n  I would have been perfectly happy if not a single story coming out of \nthis ever mentioned my name. If every story just focused on: ObamaCare, \nis it working or not? Is it helping the American people or is it \nhurting? If every story simply said the Senate stayed in session all \nnight because ObamaCare is a train wreck; because ObamaCare is a \nnightmare--in the words of James Hoffa, the president of the Teamsters; \nbecause the American people are losing their jobs or being forced into \npart-time work or are facing skyrocketing health insurance premiums or \nare losing their health insurance, that is why the Senate was here. So \nI would be thrilled if all of the coverage focused on the substance \ninstead of the distraction that is the silliness that is the back and \nforth.\n  Senator Roberts posed a very important question, and it went to \nprocess. It went to how this proceeding is moving forward.\n  There used to be a time when this body was described as the world's \ngreatest deliberative body. I don't think anyone familiar with the \nmodern Senate would describe it as that, because this body doesn't work \nanymore. This body is no longer a deliberative body. This body is now \nan instrument of political power used to enforce the wishes of the \nDemocratic majority, both on the minority but more importantly on the \nAmerican people, disregarding the American people's views and the \nAmerican people's concerns.\n  So what are we told? In the Senate of days of old there were two \ncardinal principles that were the essence of what it meant to be in the \nSenate: one, the right to speak; and, two, the right to amend. For a \ncouple of centuries any Senator could offer any amendment on just about \nanything. That is what made this process work, open amendments.\n  Did that make a few people take votes they didn't necessarily want \nto? Yes. But if we are being honest with our constituents, that \nshouldn't trouble you. If you are telling your constituents what you \nbelieve and if you are voting your principles, there shouldn't be a \nvote you are afraid of. Votes are only problematic if you are trying to \ntell your constituents one thing and trying to do something else in \nWashington.\n  What is the process that is supposed to play out here on this \ncontinuing resolution and this continuing resolution to defund \nObamaCare--to fund all the Federal Government and defund ObamaCare?\n  We are told that, first, there is going to be a vote on cloture on \nthe bill to shut off debate. If 60 Senators vote to do so, if \nRepublicans cross the aisle and join Harry Reid and Senate Democrats in \nshutting off debate, we are told we will get one amendment--apparently \ndrafted by the majority leader Harry Reid--and that amendment will fund \nObamaCare in its entirety and will gut the House bill, will \ndeliberately do it. That is the stated intent. We are also told that \nother amendments will not be allowed.\n  In the course of this discussion we have discussed a number of other \namendments, all of which I think would be terrific. One amendment the \nSenator from Kansas mentioned would be an amendment to repeal the \nmedical device tax. I would note that is an amendment which we had a \nvote on in the budget process, and an overwhelming majority of Senators \nin this body voted for it. My recollection is nearly 80 Senators voted \nfor it. Yet it didn't pass into law because of the peculiarities of the \nbudget process. So that is an amendment presumably that, if it were \nallowed, would be adopted. I would suggest that is perhaps the reason \nwhy it won't be allowed: because it would be adopted.\n  Repealing the medical device tax would take one aspect of ObamaCare--\nthe punitive, crippling tax that is hammering the medical device \nindustry, that is driving medical device companies out of business or \nnear out of business, that is hammering jobs and that is restraining \ninnovation--that is restraining medical device innovation. We know with \ncertainty that if there is not innovation, if there is not research and \ndevelopment, if there is not investment in medical devices, there will \nbe new medical devices that aren't discovered. There will be people \nwhose pain is not alleviated, whose suffering is not alleviated, \nperhaps whose lives are not saved. So that would be one of them.\n  Another amendment I think we ought to have a vote on would be Senator \nVitter's amendment to revoke the exemption that President Obama, \ncontrary to law, unilaterally put in place for Members of Congress and \ntheir staff. Senator Vitter's amendment would subject every Member of \nCongress, every staff member, and the political appointees of the Obama \nadministration to the exchanges just as millions of Americans are going \nto be.\n\n[[Page S6814]]\n\n  Indeed, I supported an amendment that some Republican Senators have \ntalked about that would expand Senator Vitter's amendment to all \nFederal employees because our friends the Democrats frequently tell the \nAmerican people what a wonderful thing ObamaCare is: Look at this \ntremendous benefit we are bringing the American people. If it is so \nwonderful, then the majority leader and the Democratic Senators and the \ncongressional staff should be eager to get it if it is such a \ntremendous improvement. If it is so wonderful, President Obama--after \nall, his name is on the bill, ObamaCare in the popular vernacular--\nshould be eager to get--his political appointees who are forcing it on \nus should be eager to get it and the Federal employees should be eager \nto get it. We all know they are not.\n  We all know this exemption came after a closed-door meeting in the \nCapitol with the majority leader Harry Reid and the Democratic Senators \nwhere, according to press reports, they asked: Please let us out from \nunder this, because it will be so devastating, we don't want to lose \nour health care.\n  I understand that. Look, I would not be eager myself to be on the \nexchanges. I am certainly not eager for my staff to be on the \nexchanges. Many of them are very concerned about it. I may lose very \ngood staff over it. But I think there is a broader principle, which is \nthat different rules should not apply to Washington that apply to the \nAmerican people.\n  If we are willing to subject millions of Americans to the exchanges, \nif we are willing to let people lose their health insurance, as is \nhappening all over this country--take the UPS. UPS recently sent \nletters to 15,000 employees saying you are losing your spousal \ncoverage. Your husbands and wives who were covered are losing their \ncoverage.\n\n  President Obama promised: If you like your plan, you can keep it. \nThat has proven categorically wrong.\n  A great many of those husbands and wives who had health insurance may \nbe forced onto these new exchanges with no employer subsidy. That is a \nlousy place to be. It is exactly the lousy place to be that Members, \nSenators, and congressional staff are complaining, Don't put us in that \nbriar patch. But if Congress is going to put the American people in \nthat briar patch, then you had better believe we should be there with \nthem. And if we don't like it, the answer isn't exempt us, the answer \nis exempt the American people. If it is intolerable for us to endure, \nit should be intolerable for the American people.\n  Another amendment I think we ought to vote on is an amendment \nstripping the IRS of enforcement authority on ObamaCare. We have seen \nthe political abuses the IRS is capable of. I don't know anyone who is \neager to have the IRS have the world's largest database of our health \ncare information.\n  (Mr. DURBIN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. ROBERTS. On that point, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. There are six Federal agencies in the meta database that \nare involved in it. When I kept inquiring, when the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, asked the \nrepresentative from the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services--CMS, \nreferred to in the health provider community as ``It's a Mess''--and \nsaid, Who is the navigator? This is before we understood that it was \npretty much all community organizers. There are three basic \norganizations in Kansas, 1.5 million, and so they are out there \nknocking on doors.\n  The problem is we don't know what people are signing up for, or they \ndon't know and I don't know, and we have made all sorts of inquiries.\n  Finally I got the 16 pages that you have to fill out to be eligible \nto sign up and the 61 pages that you had to fill out then to be a \nmember of the exchange. That got a lot of news. So they reduced the \nnumber by simply reducing the font size from about 16-point or 12-point \ndown to 8-point. They said, Just read more carefully. I got to page 3.\n  I would not put down the information they wanted to know. There have \nbeen stories about scammers who are looking at these regulations or \nthese signup sheets--no matter how big they are--saying, Aha, if they \nhave to give their Social Security number, I can call them and say it \nis the law and you are going to have a lot of fraud and abuse. Maybe \nthe IRS can take a look at that.\n  One other thing about the IRS. The Finance Committee in a bipartisan \neffort--we haven't held many hearings, but we are getting closer and \ncloser to what happened with the IRS denying people First Amendment \nrights. I would give a lot of credit to Senator Hatch and Senator \nBaucus working in a bipartisan effort.\n  Along about November there is going to be quite a story. There is a \nV, and we have Lois Lerner here, and it goes up here to the Justice \nDepartment and it goes wider. We are getting a lot of communications. \nWe are not making a lot of hearings about it, not standing in front of \nthe mirrors. So we will get there.\n  But the Senator makes an excellent point about the IRS. With all the \nproblems they have had over this denial of First Amendment--not only to \nthe tea party groups, conservative groups, but pro-Israel groups and a \nwhole bunch of other groups, and they are still doing it.\n  Consequently, the Senator has made an excellent point. Why on Earth \nwould we want the IRS to be in charge of your health care, not to \nmention five other agencies, in a huge database? That information \nshould be between you and your doctor, and you should have to break \ndown the doggone doors in the dead of night in order to get that kind \nof information, as opposed to giving it to the Federal Government with \nall those different agencies with all sorts of opportunity for fraud, \nabuse, and virtually everything else.\n  I am sorry to get wound up on that, but the Senator made an excellent \npoint and I am trying to think of a question to make this legal.\n  Doesn't the Senator think this is a trail we don't want to go down?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Kansas for that excellent \nquestion. I would like to make two points in response, and I want to \ngive an opportunity to the Senators from Kentucky and Oklahoma who are \nboth waiting, I believe, to ask questions, so I want to move \nexpeditiously, allowing them to do so. Before that, it is important to \naddress the very good point the Senator from Kansas raised.\n  I would say as the first observation, there are at least three more \namendments that ought to be voted on in connection with the continuing \nresolution. One the Senator from Kansas suggested is an amendment \ndefunding these navigators, defunding this slush fund that is being \nused to basically fund liberal special interest groups in the States, \nmuch like the stimulus, yet another plan that is used to write checks \nto groups that are little more than political action groups. That would \nbe a vote we should have.\n  Another vote we should have is a vote to protect the privacy of our \ninformation. The IRS has created the largest database in history of our \npersonal health care information, and there has been report after \nreport that the protections and the privacy of cyber security are \npitifully, woefully inadequate; that there are identity thieves, that \nthere are unscrupulous characters getting ready to mine those \ndatabases.\n  The Senator from Kentucky, who shortly will ask a question, has been \na leader on privacy. The idea of the Federal Government collecting \npersonal information about all of our health care and then putting it \nin one place so, A, the Federal Government can have it; and, B, if it \nis poorly secured, anyone can break in and steal it. We ought to have \nan amendment to require real protections for our privacy before any of \nthis goes online.\n  Yet another amendment we ought to have is--the President has \nunilaterally delayed the employer mandate. We ought to have a delay of \nthe individual mandate. I note the House passed that and a substantial \nnumber of Democrats voted for it.\n  That went through 6 amendments and I am pretty sure we could come up \nwith more. I note that earlier in the evening I had an exchange with \nSenator Kaine from the State of Virginia who asked a question. I forget \nthe exact terms of it, but to paraphrase, he said: Can't we work \ntogether on improving ObamaCare, stopping it from being--he didn't say \nthis, but this is me saying it--to stop it from being this\n\n[[Page S6815]]\n\ntrain wreck, the nightmare, the disaster that it is? My answer was: \nAbsolutely. We should fix it, we should have amendments, and I listed \nsome of these we discussed now. The problem is, I suggested to the \nSenator from Virginia, you should address your concern to majority \nleader Harry Reid, because he is the one who is shutting down the \nprocess, saying the Senate is not going to operate with open amendment, \nwe are not going to have an opportunity to improve it.\n  Let me make a final point. In terms of the political theater that is \nWashington, why does this matter right now? There are lost Republicans \nwho would like votes on everything I said, and there is some virtue to \ngetting a vote. But to be honest, many Republicans are fighting to get \nthat vote in some context where it is purely symbolic. They are real \nhappy because every Republican can vote together and every Democrat can \nvote against it, and then it can become fodder for a campaign ad.\n  Let me suggest a far better approach is to have these amendments \nvoted on in a context where they can be passed into law. The continuing \nresolution is that context. Everyone understands that at one stage or \nanother. This is must-pass legislation. Everyone understands that we \nwill fund the Federal Government. We have to fund the Federal \nGovernment. Nobody wants a government shutdown.\n  We may get one if Harry Reid and President Obama force one, but \nnobody wants it. So voting on it now in the context of this continuing \nresolution is different from a symbolic vote, a political vote, because \nit actually could fix these problems. It is not simply Washington \nsymbolism. That is why I find it all the more striking that so many \nSenate Republicans are suggesting they may be willing to vote with \nmajority leader Harry Reid and with the Senate Democrats to cut off \ndebate, to allow one amendment drafted by the majority that would \ntotally fund ObamaCare that would gut the House bill and shut off every \nother amendment.\n  If this were any other context, my colleagues on the Republican side \nwould be up in arms. We would see the so-called old bulls of the Senate \nunited in saying the process is being abused, and we would get 46 \nRepublicans voting against cloture.\n  By the way, nobody, if there were any other context, would make the \nsilly arguments that voting for cloture is really supporting the bill. \nThe majority leader has indicated that once cloture is granted he is \ngoing to introduce an amendment to gut the bill and go the exact \nopposite way, allowing him to do so in a 51-vote partisan vote. That is \nnot supporting the bill; it is undermining the bill.\n  The stakes of this fight right now are whether this body is willing \nto listen to the American people--whether Democrats are willing, \nwhether Republicans are willing. I would say what has to happen to \nchange how this body operates is that we must make DC listen.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a procedural question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Last night at 10 o'clock I was privileged to be down here \nwith the Senator and we went over a lot of things. Something happened \nthis morning. I went home, I went to bed, I ate. I am back here now.\n  The Senator from Kentucky has been waiting 40 minutes. I am not going \nto use his time, but what I would like to do is this. Something \nhappened after I left last night, after a statement I made having to do \nwith Hillary health care. I want to share that with the Senator. But I \ndo not want to do it now on his time. Hopefully, if you are going to be \nhere at 9 o'clock I would like to get back in line and share what \nhappened last night after I left here. Is that all right?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I can tell him as I said \nat 2:30 in the afternoon yesterday that I intend to stand against \nObamaCare as long as I am able to stand. At this point I feel confident \nthat at 9 a.m., I will still be able to stand. There will come a point \nwhen that is no longer the case, but we have not yet reached that \npoint.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the Senator from Kentucky allowing me to \ncome in front of him.\n  Mr. PAUL. Will the Senator from Texas yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question of the Senator from \nKentucky without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. PAUL. There has been some discussion. The Senator from Kansas \nrecently put this question forward, how we would fix ObamaCare if we \nwere allowed to. I think there are two parts to that. The first part of \nthe question is, will we be allowed to offer any amendments to try to \nmake ObamaCare less bad, to try to fix ObamaCare? Will Republicans, \nwhich is virtually half of the country, be allowed to participate in \nthis process at all?\n  ObamaCare was passed with entirely Democratic votes, not one \nRepublican vote. It is a policy that has been very partisan. It is a \npolicy that now even supporters of ObamaCare are saying: My goodness, \nthis is going to really be a problem for the country. But the Senator \nis exactly right, we are getting ready to go through a process where \nthere are going to be no amendments on fixing ObamaCare. There will not \nbe one thing offered.\n  Former President Bill Clinton is saying there are problems with it, \nthe Teamsters, Warren Buffett, the 15,000 people at UPS who lost their \nspousal insurance are saying there is a problem with this. Are we going \nto be allowed to offer amendments?\n  It appears as if there will not be any amendments. It appears there \nis nothing forthcoming that there will be a need to debate. This is \nimportant for the American people because this is being portrayed as \nthe Republicans are obstructionists, that Republicans don't want to do \nthis, Republicans don't want to do this.\n\n  It is exactly the opposite. The President wants 100 percent of \nObamaCare as he wrote it, as the Democrats wrote it, with no Republican \ninput. So when we go around the country and people say why can't you \nguys get along, figure out some way of making our health care system \nbetter, it is because we are getting 100 percent of ObamaCare as \nwritten by the President and it is his way or the highway.\n  What he is talking about is really, even though they say the \nopposite, he wants to shut the Government down. They salivate at \nshutting the government down. Over the last 3 months as the Senator \nbrought this issue forward, who has been talking about shutting the \ngovernment down? Has the Senator been talking about it? No. Have I been \ntalking about it? No. We have been specifically saying we don't want to \ndo that. Who talks about shutting the government down, nonstop, every \nday? The Democrats, the President, and their liberal friends in the \nmedia.\n  As I get to my question, what I want to ask is about how we would fix \nit. I think Senator Roberts is right. The other side says they don't \nhave any answers, they are not willing to fix ObamaCare. The truth of \nthe matter is we have been talking about this for years now but we have \nbeen drowned out by the ObamaCare I want everything all the time, \neverything I want I am going to get. There are many fixes for our \nhealth care.\n  I am a physician and practiced for 20 years. I saw it every day. The \nNo. 1 complaint I got: Health insurance costs too much. So what did \nObamaCare do for health insurance costs? It drove them up. It did \nabsolutely nothing. Even they are admitting it. But you have to \nunderstand why health care costs went up. Health care costs went up \nbecause we are mandating what health insurance.\n  People say I would like to have my kids covered. Sure we can cover \nyour kids, but it is not going to be free. It is going to have a cost. \nSo everything the people say they want is not free. It elevates the \nprice of your health insurance. When you elevate the price of health \ninsurance, what happens? Poor people have more difficulty buying their \nhealth insurance.\n  What else did ObamaCare do that we did, that is exactly the opposite \nof what we should do. There is something called health savings accounts \nthat originated about 10 or 15 years ago. They were expanded gradually \nand they were the best thing to happen to health care probably in the \nlast 30 years. But what happened? We went the opposite way. ObamaCare \nis now narrowing the health savings account. Why are the health savings \naccounts important? Because you can save\n\n[[Page S6816]]\n\nmoney tax-free, you can carry it over from year to year, and then you \ncan buy higher deductibles. So contrary to what people think, it may be \ncounter-intuitive to some people, the way to fix health insurance is to \nhave higher deductibles, because what does that mean? Cheaper \ninsurance. You want cheaper and cheaper insurance. As you have higher \ndeductibles, you have cheaper insurance. When you have cheaper \ninsurance, you have all this extra money that you can use to pay for \nday-to-day health care. When you do that, what happens? You drive the \nprice of health care down. I know that is exactly right.\n  As you increase deductibles, as you get the consumer involved in \nhealth care, your prices go down. In my practice as an ophthalmologist, \nthere are two things that insurance did not cover at all and the prices \nwere reduced most dramatically in the two areas in which the health \ninsurance did not cover anything. If you want to buy contact lenses, \nmost of the time health insurance doesn't cover it. The price went down \nevery year. Lasik surgery to get rid of the need for glasses, much more \nexpensive but the price went down for 20 years because the consumer \npaid.\n  What would the consumer do--or the patient? The average patient calls \n4 doctors before they have Lasik surgery, so the thing is they drive \nprices down. People say I don't want to pay more out of pocket, I want \nto pay less. That is a natural impulse to want to pay less. You may pay \nless at the door, but you are paying more for premiums. Or if you are \nnot paying it and your employer is paying more for premiums, what ends \nup happening is there are fewer jobs.\n  I know the Senator from Texas is familiar with philosopher and \nparliamentarian and French writer Frederic Bastiat. Bastiat often talks \nabout the seen and the unseen. It is the consequences that are visible \nto the naked eye before you get started, but then there are the things \nyou didn't realize were going to happen, the unintended consequences. \nIt is like saying let's have government build the hospitals. Let's have \ngovernment hire the doctors. Let's have government build everything. We \nwould see all these bright, shiny things and we would not see where the \nmoney came from, where the money was not spent, where the economic \ngrowth could have occurred. What we have to think about when we think \nabout ObamaCare is we have to think about do you believe in freedom or \ncoercion? ObamaCare is riddled with mandatory, mandatory this, \nmandatory that, I think there are several mandates.\n  When you hear the word mandate that is not freedom, that is your \ngovernment telling you that you have to do something. It should be \nabout mandatory versus voluntary. We should have bills that originate \nhere that say you are free to do things. We have gone the opposite way. \nWe are taking away freedom and we are adding mandates. At its core, \nObamaCare is about freedom versus coercion and as you add in these \nlevels of coercion, not only do you lose your freedom, they cost money \nso it becomes more expensive.\n  We took a health care system where 85 percent of the people had \ninsurance and we made it more expensive for everybody. We made it more \nexpensive by mandating what goes into the insurance. For example, for a \n30-year old, or for a 32-year-old, it is illegal to buy a high \ndeductible policy. You will not hear this. ObamaCare has made it \nillegal to buy a high deductible policy. You can get it under age 30 \nbut not over 30. Why would you want that? Maybe you are a plumber in \nyour own business and you want to have a $5,000 deductible so up can \npay $1,000 a year in premiums or $2,000 a year in premiums. But how do \nyou ever get there? You never get there unless you allow freedom. You \nneed the freedom of the marketplace. Instead of limiting it, realize \nwhat you are getting. When you ask for ObamaCare you are getting \nObamaCare, you are getting mandates, but you are getting limited \nchoices. Freedom means choices. Mandates, coercion, means less choices.\n  The exchanges will be very few choices. I will be on the exchanges. I \nwill have to go to the exchange in Kentucky and buy my insurance. I am \nnot very happy about it. In fact I think if I have to do it I think \nJustice Roberts ought to have to do it. Justice Roberts loves ObamaCare \nso much I am for voting to have Justice Roberts trot on down to the \nObamaCare registry, the ObamaCare index, and get his insurance like the \nrest of us.\n  We talked about some amendments to include people, I think everybody, \nall Federal employees. If ObamaCare is so good, everybody ought to get \nit. The thing is we would be so fed up that we would rebel in this \ncountry. That is what I think the Senator from Texas has started, \nhopefully a rebellion against coercion, rebellion against mandates, a \nrebellion against everything that says that big government wants to \nshove something down your throat, they say take it or we will put \npeople in jail. People say we aren't going to put anybody in jail. The \nheck they won't. You will get fined first. If you don't pay your fines, \nyou will go to jail. They are telling you that you have to take their \nhealth insurance as they conceived of it, with absolutely no Republican \ninput. Not one Republican vote, and they are unwilling to have any \namendments.\n  What is this fight about? This fight is about whether or not we are \ngoing to have a society or a Congress where we can debate over how to \nfix things. ObamaCare is a disaster. Even its own authors are now \nsaying it is a train wreck waiting to happen. Even the President, who \nis in love with this ObamaCare, is saying it is going to be a problem. \nHe is delaying the individual mandate. He is delaying the individual \nmandate.\n\n  But realize on another level what some of our complaints are. Some of \nour complaints are that by making it mandatory, and by him doing it \nafter the fact, he is not obeying the law. This is pretty important.\n  We talk about the rule of law a lot of times around here, but what is \nimportant about the rule of law is that Congress passes legislation and \nthe President can sign it and execute it. ObamaCare was passed with \nonly Democratic votes. But here is the thing, he is now amending it \nafter the fact.\n  We saw one of the union officials coming out with a gleeful smile on \nhis face from the White House. Is he going to get a special deal that \nnobody else gets? Is the President going to come to your town or my \ntown in middle America and meet with me and give people in my town an \nexemption? No. He has been giving exemptions to his friends. This is \npatently un-American, and it is unconstitutional. We will fight this \nthrough the court cases, but it will take a year or so before we can \nget to the Supreme Court.\n  Can the President amend legislation? Can he write legislation without \nthe approval of Congress? That is what he is doing. His argument would \nbe: I am trying to fix the problems the legislation created. Yes, the \nlegislation was 2,000 pages and nobody read it, and then they created \n20,000 pages of regulations.\n  We have no idea who to call in many of the States. If you do know who \nto call and there has been an exchange set up, there are limited \nchoices. Where you might have had hundreds of choices, you will now \nhave two or three choices. Where you once had freedom, you are going to \nhave coercion. Where you once had the ability to buy cheaper insurance \nand pay your out-of-pocket expenses on a day-to-day basis yourself and \nbuy cheaper insurance, it will no longer exist because the government \nnow says they know what is best for you. They know what you should do. \nYour choices have gone out the window.\n  We talked about amendments. If we were allowed to have amendments and \nthe ability to try to fix ObamaCare, I would try to bring the price \ndown. The best way to bring the price down is not to tell people they \nhave to have a deductible or an HSA, but it is to expand their ability \nto choose an HSA. An HSA is a health savings account.\n  Before ObamaCare, you could put $5,000 a year in your HSA, and now it \nhas gone to $2,500 a year. If you have a child who is autistic or a \nchild with spinal bifida or a child with a severe learning disability, \nyou can spend $10,000 a year on their health care in trying to help \nthem adapt to life.\n  Right now what is happening is they are limiting that ability. Health \nsavings accounts should be unlimited. We should take them from $2,500, \nwhere the President has squashed them, and make them unlimited. If you \nget lucky\n\n[[Page S6817]]\n\nand don't get sick, your health savings account should be able to go \ninto your kid's education. Health savings accounts should not be for \njust the family but for every individual of the family. They should be \nenormous over time, and then you would buy cheaper insurance.\n  This is also the answer as to how you drive the price down. Here is \nsomething, as a physician, people would say to me: I went to the \nhospital and had heart surgery that cost $100,000. When I looked at my \nbill very closely, the mouthwash was $50, and I was infuriated. I would \nsay: Did you call? Did you try to negotiate with the hospital? They \nwould answer: No, my deductible is $50.\n  When you have a low deductible and you don't have to pay, you are not \nconnected to the product. Unless you are connected to the product, \nprices don't come down. This is a fundamental aspect of capitalism. \nThat is why when you go to Walmart or any retail store such as Hobby \nLobby, the prices are bid down because there is competition and you ask \nabout the price.\n  Think about it. If you went to Walmart and your copay was $10 every \ntime you went to Walmart, would you ever look at any prices after you \npaid $10? You can see what would happen to the entire retail world if \nwe had health insurance for buying goods. If you had a health insurance \ncopay of $100 to buy a car, the price of cars would go through the roof \nbecause you wouldn't care about the price. This is about having some \nsense.\n  The people who gave you ObamaCare are not bad people. They have big \nhearts but not necessarily big brains. They want to help people, but \nthey have not figured out that the unintended consequences of ObamaCare \nare that part-time workers will have less hours, and full-time workers, \nwho are on the margin, as far as their hours go, with a business that \nis struggling will lose their jobs.\n  If I have 51 employees, I may go back to 49 employees if I am \nstruggling. If I have 1,000 employees, and I provide health insurance \nfor them but my competitor decides to dump them on the government \nexchange, maybe I have to do that too so I can compete because maybe I \nhave to offer the lowest price. Maybe the end result of ObamaCare is \nthe people it was intended to help are precisely who it is going to \nhurt.\n  I think we have to think this through. We have to think as a society \nwhether we are for choice or against choice, whether we are for \nmandates or for volunteerism. I think it is very important that we look \nbeyond the immediacy of what we are trying to do, and, as I said, I \ndon't discount the motives of the people on the other side. I think \nthey want to help people, but I think they are going to hurt the people \nthey want to help.\n  As we look at this ObamaCare debate and this disaster, there is \nanother question you might ask: If ObamaCare is such a great thing, you \nwould think you could give it away--this is something that will be \nfree. And they are having trouble giving it away. So what have they \ndone? They are spending tens of millions of dollars to advertise to you \nthat it is such a great thing. If you can't sell somebody something \nthat is free, I think there is a problem. ObamaCare is free and they \ncan't sell it. They have enlisted the President now to sell it. They \nare going to barnstorm all across America selling something that is \nfree. They will have government agents on planes flying hither and yon, \nknocking on your door, saying: Please take this free health care. \nPlease sign up for free health care. If you cannot sell free health \ncare, there must be a problem with it.\n  We are spending tens of millions of dollars on TV, and millions more \nhaving people going door to door to convince people that it is a good \nidea. Ultimately we should try to help those who cannot help \nthemselves, but in order to figure out how you want to help the 15 \npercent who don't have health insurance, we should have looked at the \nproblem more carefully. Of the 15 percent who don't have health \ninsurance, one-third of them are young and healthy and make more than \n$50,000 a year. So one-third of the problem had nothing to do with not \nbeing--well, it did have something to do with not being able to afford \nit. It had to do with the health insurance costing too much. So we \nshould have tried to figure out how we lower health care costs, and if \nyou are a young, healthy person, we should have expanded health savings \naccounts. There are ways we could fix this.\n  What I would ask the Senator from Texas is: Does he see a way \nforward? Does he see that we can get the other side to come forward and \ntell the American people that, yes, we made some mistakes? We made some \nmistakes, and even our friends are telling us we made these mistakes \nand we want to work with you. Because I think the problem, the \nperception out there is that we don't want to work with them, but it is \ncompletely the opposite of the truth. The truth of the matter is, as I \nsee it, they won't work with us. They won't open the process and we \ncan't have a debate. We are having a debate, but where is the other \nside? Why can't we influence legislation? Why can't we be part of \ntrying to fix health care? I don't know if ObamaCare is fixable, but \nhealth care is fixable.\n  The main problem of health care is price. It costs too damn much. Can \nwe fix that? Could they come to the Senate floor and say: We are going \nto have amendments, we are going to have an open amendment process, and \nwe are going to try to fix ObamaCare?\n  Does the Senator see an opening where maybe the President would \ncompromise and come and say: Yes, I am willing to work with you in \norder to fix health care in this country?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his very fine \nquestion. The answer is absolutely yes, I believe there is an opening \nto do that. I believe we can address the train wreck and the nightmare \nthe American people are facing that is ObamaCare. We can address the \nvery real harms that are being visited upon Americans as a result.\n  I want to note that the Senator from Kentucky has been a clarion \nvoice for liberty. That is one of the many things I appreciate about my \nfriend Senator Rand Paul. I think my favorite phrase from his question \nis a phrase that occurred about midway through his question where he \nsaid something to the effect of: We need a rebellion against \noppression. I like that phrase. That is a particularly excellent turn \nof a phrase. I will confess that it reminded me of a movie series that \nwas in the theaters when the Senator from Kentucky and I were both \nkids--young adults--and that was the ``Star Wars'' franchise and the \ndiscussion of a rebellion against oppression. I think it captures a lot \nof what is going on here. We started this debate some 18 hours ago \ntalking about the divide between the Washington establishment that is \nnot listening to the American people, that is forcing its will on the \nAmerican people, and the people of this country.\n  I will confess that phrase of rebellion against oppression conjured \nup to me the Rebel Alliance fighting against the Empire--the Empire \nbeing the Washington, DC, establishment. Indeed, immediately upon \nhearing that phrase, I wondered if at some point we would see a tall \ngentleman in a mechanical breathing apparatus come forward and say in a \ndeep voice, ``Mike Lee, I am your father.''\n  This is a fight to restore freedom for the people. This is a fight to \nget the Washington establishment--the Empire--to listen to the people. \nAnd just like in the ``Star Wars'' movies, the Empire will strike back. \nBut at the end of the day, I think the Rebel Alliance--the people--will \nprevail.\n  The Senator from Kentucky asked: Can we actually make real progress \nin this? Yes, if the people do it. To be perfectly honest, the Senator \nfrom Kentucky can't get it done; I can't get it done; Senator Mike Lee \ncan't get it done. I don't think there is an elected official in this \nbody who can get it done. Only the American people can speak with a \nloud enough volume that it forces, No. 1, all 46 Republicans to unite, \nas we should be uniting, against cloture and say: No, not a single \nRepublican will vote to give Harry Reid and the Democrats the ability \nto force through a single amendment that guts the House continuing \nresolution, that funds ObamaCare, and has 51 partisan Democratic votes \nand shuts out all other amendments; and No. 2, if the people rise up in \nsufficient numbers.\n  I believe the Democrats have good faith. We will ultimately have no \nchoice but to do the same thing--listen\n\n[[Page S6818]]\n\nto the people. During this debate we have read and we have discussed \nthe letters from the roofers union, the letter from the Teamsters. Each \nof them used the same phrase: They ``could remain silent no more.'' \nBoth of those letters began by saying they were Democrats who supported \nthe President, who supported Democrats for the Senate, supported \nDemocrats for the House, who had campaigned and worked for them, yet \nthey ``could remain silent no longer'' because ObamaCare is hurting \nmillions of Americans. In the words of James Hoffa, president of the \nTeamsters, it is a nightmare.\n  If they can remain silent no longer, then I say to the Senator from \nKentucky, I do have faith that there will be Democratic Senators who \nwill feel the same pang of conscience to remain silent no longer but to \nactually speak up for the American people. But it will only happen when \nRepublicans are united. If Republicans are divided and throwing rocks \nat each other, we cannot expect Democrats to cross their leadership. \nThe Republicans have to unite first in order to get Democrats to come \ntogether and listen to the people. You want to know what this whole \nfight is about? Together we must make DC listen.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I have a followup question for the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question, but I will not yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. PAUL. One of the questions that should not only be asked of the \nSenator but should be asked of the President: Why doesn't the President \nvoluntarily take ObamaCare? It is his baby, and if he loves it so much, \nwhy doesn't the President take it? He could voluntarily go on the \nexchanges. I am sure they would welcome him down at the DC exchanges. \nIn fact, I think that ought to be a question they ought to ask him at \nthe press briefing today: Mr. President, are you willing to take \nObamaCare? If you don't want it, why are we stuck with it?\n\n  So if the President can't take it, if Chief Justice Roberts doesn't \nwant it--here is the thing. If we want to see a rebellion, we should \nask Federal employees to take ObamaCare--that is what my amendment \nsays--not just Congress. I am willing to take it. I don't want it. I \nabsolutely don't want it, and I have been frank about it. I am not a \nhypocrite. I didn't vote for it, I think the whole thing is a mess, and \nI don't want it. But the thing is, if I have to take it, I think the \nPresident ought to get it. He ought to get a full dose of his own \nmedicine.\n  I think Justice Roberts should get it. I think he contorted and \ntwisted and found new meaning in the Constitution that isn't there. So \nif he wants it so much, if he thinks it is justified, if he is going to \ntake that intellectual leap to justify ObamaCare, he ought to get it. \nThere are millions of Federal employees. They don't want it. Guess who \nthey vote for usually?\n  I think it is a partisan question. I think if we were to put it \nforward and say ObamaCare is such a wonderful program for everybody, \nlet's give it to the Federal employees, my guess is we wouldn't get a \nsingle vote from the opposition party, but we will not even get a \nchance because they don't want to talk about it: ObamaCare is good. We \nwant to shove it down the rest of America's throat, but we exempt \nourselves.\n  I have a constitutional amendment. I frankly think Congress should \nnever pass any law if they are exempted from it. I think there is an \nequal protection argument for how it would be unconstitutional for us \nto do so. Yet we have done it repeatedly.\n  But my question to the Senator from Texas is, What does he think? \nDoes the Senator from Texas think maybe we should ask the President to \ncome down today and sign up for ObamaCare? I think we should ask him \nthat today, every day, and henceforth: Mr. President, if it is such a \ngood idea, why don't you get it?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky and my \nanswer is, yes, yes, a thousand times yes. Indeed, if the Washington \npress corps would focus on the substance of this debate, on the issues \nthat matter to the American people, the reporters would ask the \nquestion at every news conference the President conducts and at every \nopportunity they have: Mr. President, are you willing to be subject to \nObamaCare, to be put on the exchange that millions of Americans are \nbeing forced to do? They would ask the majority leader of the Senate, \nand indeed every Democratic Senator who met with the President and who, \naccording to press reports, at whose behest Members of Congress were \nexempted.\n  If the press were doing the job of a watchdog press holding leaders \naccountable, actually speaking truth to power, they would ask every \nDemocratic Senator not once, not twice but over and over and over: Are \nyou willing to be put on the exchanges without an employer subsidy, \njust like millions of Americans who are losing their health insurance \nbecause of ObamaCare? If not, why?\n  As I have noted multiple times during the course of this debate, I \nvery much support what Senator Paul suggested about making every \nFederal employee subject to ObamaCare. Let me be clear. Doing that is a \nlousy thing to do to Federal employees. It is a lousy thing to do to \nMembers of Congress. It is a lousy thing to do to congressional staff. \nNone of them like it. As the Presiding Officer and I know well, it is \nhard to find an issue that causes more dismay, if not panic, among \ncongressional staff than the idea that they might be thrown into the \nexchanges with no employer subsidies, as will millions of Americans; \nironically enough, including, presumably, many of the staff who worked \non drafting ObamaCare, and it is why the American people are so fed up \nwith this. It is a manifestation good enough for thee but not for me.\n  Washington plays by separate rules. The rich and powerful, those who \nstroll through the corridors of power, they get exemptions, just not \nhard-working Americans. If you are at home and it happens to be the \ncase that you have two or three high-paid Washington lobbyists on your \npayroll, you may be in good shape. You might get an exemption. But if \nyou don't have the ability to walk into the West Wing, if you don't \nhave the ability to pull the levers of power, then what President \nObama, the majority leader, and the U.S. Senate are saying to you is \nyou are out of luck. We answer to the friends of this administration \nbut not to the American people. Listen, I think under no circumstances \nshould Members of Congress be treated better than what we are doing \nunder the law, forcing upon millions and millions of Americans.\n  I would note that during the course of this debate, I have been \nprivileged to receive support from a great many Senators but two in \nparticular I wish to mention right now: Senator Rubio and Senator Paul. \nI wish to mention them because on any measure of hipness or coolness, I \nwill readily concede I can't hold a candle to them. Indeed, I remember \nin the debate over drones, Senator Rubio began quoting from rap lyrics, \nand I will confess to being clueless enough that I didn't even know \nwhat he was referencing. I was sure it was something far too hip for me \nto know. Although I will note I did read Toby Keith lyrics, but that is \nprobably not quite the same genre, and I will note that Senator Paul \nhas a following of, as he describes it, folks in Birkenstocks and \nbeards and earrings, a different sort of cool that again I could not \nremotely hope to compete with. I am a lawyer from Texas.\n  But what I can try to do to keep up--because, after all, we all have \na little bit of competitiveness in wanting to keep up--I would like to \nprovide a little more detail about something I referenced earlier, \nwhich is the speech that Ashton Kutcher gave at the Teen Choice Awards. \nTo be honest, referring to the Senator from Florida and the Senator \nfrom Kentucky as cool, as terrific human beings, as both of them are, \nit is almost oxymoronic, because I think I will take it as a given that \nthere is no politician on the planet who would actually qualify as \ncool. Ashton Kutcher I don't know and I don't expect to ever meet. Yet \nat the Teen Choice Awards he gave a speech that I thought was \nremarkable. He was there to accept an award for playing Steve Jobs in \nthe movie ``Jobs,'' and he did much more than accept a trophy. He \ntalked about the importance of hard work.\n  His speech was so remarkable that I took the opportunity and tweeted \nout because, frankly, Ashton Kutcher can reach young people in a way \nthat I\n\n[[Page S6819]]\n\nnever can, that no Member of the Senate can, and I thought the message \nwas important and it is important because of a principle that is \nimperiled by ObamaCare. Let me read from the relevant portions of Mr. \nKutcher's speech. He said:\n\n       I believe that opportunity looks a lot like hard work. I \n     have never had a job in my life that I was better than. I was \n     always just lucky to have a job. Every job I had was a \n     stepping stone to my next job, and I never quit my job until \n     I had my next job. So opportunities look a lot like work.\n\n  He went on:\n\n       The sexiest thing in the entire world is being really smart \n     and being thoughtful, and being generous. Everything else \n     is--\n\n  And he used a mild expletive for manure.\n\n       It's just ``manure'' that people try to sell to you to make \n     you feel like less. So don't buy it. Be smart, be thoughtful, \n     and be generous.\n\n  Then he ended his speech by saying:\n\n       Everything around us that we call life was made up by \n     people that are no smarter than you. You can build your own \n     things. You can build your own life that other people can \n     live in. So build a life. Don't live one, build one. Find \n     your opportunities, and always be sexy.\n\n  I salute that message. I think it is a message that I hope every \nyoung person in America hears. But it is also a message that embodies \nwhat is imperiled by ObamaCare.\n  What Mr. Kutcher talked about ``I was always just lucky to have a \njob. I never had a job in my life that I was better than,'' it makes me \nthink about my father. When he came from Cuba, his first job was \nwashing dishes making 50 cents an hour. He was lucky to have that job. \nHe certainly was not better than that job. If he hadn't had that job--\nthe next sentence Mr. Kutcher said: ``And every job I had was a \nstepping stone to my next job.'' As we have discussed during this \ndebate, if he hadn't had that first job, he wouldn't have gotten his \nnext job as a cook. If he hadn't had that job, he wouldn't have gotten \nhis next job as a teaching assistant. If he hadn't had that job, he \nwouldn't have gotten his next job as a computer programmer at IBM. If \nhe hadn't had that job, he wouldn't have been able to start a small \nbusiness and work toward the American dream.\n  We want to talk about the tragedy of ObamaCare. It is the millions of \nyoung people, the millions of single moms, the millions of Hispanics, \nof African Americans who are struggling, who want to achieve the \nAmerican dream and who, because of ObamaCare, can't find a job. Because \nof ObamaCare small businesses are not hiring, they are not expanding. \nSmall businesses create two-thirds of all new jobs.\n  That first job washing dishes, if ObamaCare were the law in 1957, I \nthink there is a very good chance my father never would have gotten \nthat job washing dishes. If he had gotten the job, if ObamaCare were \nthe law, I think it is virtually certain his hours would have been \nforcibly reduced to 29 hours a week, and he couldn't have paid his way \nthrough college on 29 hours a week. So one of two things would have \nhappened. He either would have had to drop out of college or he would \nhave had to get a second job at 29 hours a week and juggle the balance \nbetween each of them.\n  That is what is so critical about this issue, is maintaining the \nopportunity for those struggling to achieve the American dream.\n  Secondly, I wish to share with my colleagues some more material. \nDuring the wee hours of the morning, we had the opportunity to consider \nsome excerpts from Ayn Rand. I want to point to some more excerpts from \nAyn Rand that I think are relevant to the battle before this body.\n  First, from ``Atlas Shrugged:''\n\n       We are on strike, we, the men of the mind. . . . We are on \n     strike against self-immolation. We are on strike against the \n     creed of unearned rewards and unrewarded duties. We are on \n     strike against the dogma that the pursuit of one's happiness \n     is evil. We are on strike against the doctrine that life is \n     guilt.\n\n  Another on the filibuster, on the effort of the American people to \nget Washington to listen to us, from ``The Fountainhead'':\n\n       Integrity is the ability to stand by an ideal.\n\n  Also from ``The Fountainhead'':\n\n       . . . no speech is ever considered, but only the speaker. \n     It's so much easier to pass judgment on a man than on an \n     idea.\n\n  That particular quote I think more than anything is addressed to our \nfriends in the media. I wish to read it again:\n\n       . . . no speech is ever considered, but only the speaker. \n     It's so much easier to pass judgment on a man than on an \n     idea.\n\n  I, like every Member in this body, am a flawed human being, a man of \nmany imperfections. If a reporter wants to write on those \nimperfections, there is no shortage of material. But as long as they \nare writing on those, they are not talking about the ideas. As long as \nthey are writing about the personality, they are not talking about the \nAmerican people who are suffering. As long as they are writing about \nthe personalities, and the back-and-forth, the game playing and the \ninsults and all of the nonsense, they are not talking about the \nmillions of Americans who are desperate for greater opportunity, \ndesperate for a job, desperate for work to provide for their families, \ndesperate to hold on to their health insurance. We read letter after \nletter after letter of real live people who are losing their health \ninsurance.\n  Another quote:\n\n       Fight for the value of your person. Fight for the virtue of \n     your pride. Fight for the essence of that which is man: For \n     his sovereign rational mind. Fight with the radiant certainty \n     and absolute rectitude of knowing that yours is the Morality \n     of Life and that yours is the battle for any achievement, any \n     value, and grandeur, any goodness, any joy that has ever \n     existed on this earth.\n\n  Another from ``The Fountainhead'':\n\n       Throughout the centuries there were men who took first \n     steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision. \n     Their goals differed, but they all had this in common: that \n     the step was first, the road new, the vision unborrowed, and \n     the response they received--hatred. The great creators--the \n     thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors--stood \n     alone against the men of their time. Every great new thought \n     was opposed. Every great new invention was denounced. The \n     first motor was considered foolish. The airplane was \n     considered impossible. The power loom was considered vicious. \n     Anesthesia was considered sinful. But the men of unborrowed \n     vision went ahead. They fought, they suffered, and they paid. \n     But they won.\n\n  Let me suggest that quote speaks directly to the millions of \nAmericans who are speaking up right now, who are saying Washington says \nwe can't stop ObamaCare. Washington says we have to accept this train \nwreck, this nightmare. There is nothing we can do. Yet the message, as \nRand says, is that if the American people stand together, if they \nbelieve in their vision, together we can make DC listen.\n  Indeed, also from ``Atlas Shrugged'' in terms of the divide we see in \nthis body, as Rand observed:\n\n       There are two sides to every issue: one side is right and \n     the other is wrong, but the middle is always evil. The man \n     who is wrong still retains some respect for truth, if only by \n     accepting the responsibility of choice. But the man in the \n     middle is the knave who blanks out the truth in order to \n     pretend that no choice or values exist, who is willing to sit \n     out the course of any battle, willing to cash in on the blood \n     of the innocent or to crawl on his belly to the guilty, who \n     dispenses justice by condemning both the robber and the \n     robbed to jail, who solves conflicts by ordering the thinker \n     and the fool to meet each other halfway.\n\n  (The Acting President pro tempore assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. President, I would suggest that comment speaks volumes to this \ndispute. As we observed during the middle of the debate, there are some \nMembers of the Democratic Conference--indeed, one we discussed: Senator \nSanders from Vermont--who openly embraces his ideas. Indeed, there was \na time when he ran for public office not as a Democrat but as a \nSocialist.\n  Mr. Sanders and I agree on very little when it comes to public \npolicy. But I will say this, I respect his fidelity to his principles. \nI respect the honesty with which he embraces them. And as I observed \nearlier in this proceeding, I would far rather a Senate with 10 Bernie \nSanders and 10 Mike Lees to a Senate where the views, the actual \ncommitments, are blurred by obfuscation.\n  When it comes to the Republican side of the aisle, there are some \nSenators who have been quite open in saying they do not think we can \ndefund ObamaCare. I will respect any Republican Senator who says: I am \nconvinced we cannot do this and, therefore, I am voting for cloture \nbecause we cannot do it, and so I am voting against it. I do not agree \nwith that. I think that is a defeatist philosophy. But it is an honest \nphilosophy.\n\n[[Page S6820]]\n\n  I would suggest it is far different for a Republican to say: I am \ngoing to vote for cloture, I am going to vote for Harry Reid and 51 \nDemocrats the ability to fund ObamaCare in its entirety with no \namendments, no changes whatsoever, but at the same time I am going to \ngo to my constituents and say: I fully, I enthusiastically support \ndefunding ObamaCare. Indeed, I am leading the fight. That is not being \nhonest with the American people.\n  If we are to listen to the people, part of listening to the people is \nbeing honest with the people. Part of listening to the people is \nembracing, quite candidly, the position we hold. If those Members of \nthis conference want to disagree with this strategy and say we agree \nwith Harry Reid, that ObamaCare should not be defunded on the \ncontinuing resolution, then let them say so openly, not cloaked in \nrobes of procedural deception and obscurity. Let them say so openly to \nthe American people. And let them make their case. That has the virtue \nof truth.\n  On ObamaCare, in ``Atlas Shrugged'' Ms. Rand wrote:\n\n       There's no way to rule an innocent man. The only power any \n     government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, \n     when there aren't enough criminals, one makes them. One \n     declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes \n     impossible for me to live without breaking laws. . . . But \n     just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed or \n     enforced nor objectively interpreted--and you create a nation \n     of law-breakers--and then you cash in on guilt. Now that's \n     the system, Mr. Reardon, that's the game, and once you \n     understand it, you'll be much easier to deal with.\n\n  That is a profound insight on the train wreck, on the nightmare that \nis ObamaCare.\n  One statement the Senator from Kentucky made that I would disagree \nwith slightly--the Senator from Kentucky said President Obama is \ncommitted 100 percent to ObamaCare, to making no changes, no \nalterations, to defending it as is, not to improving it. Actually, I do \nnot think that is accurate. I think what the President has done is far \nworse than that, actually, which is the President has opposed \nlegislative changes to fix the tremendous failures in ObamaCare that \nare hurting the American people, but the President has over and over \nunilaterally--abusing executive power--disregarded the law.\n  When the President decided unilaterally that the employer mandate \nthat was set to kick in on January 1 of next year would be delayed for \na year for big businesses, there is no basis in law for him to do so. \nThe statute says otherwise. But his decision was simply: L'etat c'est \nmoi. I am the state; therefore, this is delayed.\n  Likewise, when the President made the decision that the eligibility \nverification for subsidies, written into the statute, would not be \nenforced, that is contrary to law. The President does not have the \nauthority to disregard the statute. If he does not like it, he can come \nto Congress and ask for an amendment. But the statutes written in the \nlaw books are binding law, and he simply announced: No, they are not. I \nam not going to enforce it.\n  Of all the different unilateral changes, that may be the most \nconsequential. It is one of the least discussed, but it is \nconsequential because its effect is essentially to encourage liar \nloans. Whether you are eligible for subsidies or not, just say you are, \nand we are not going to check to find out.\n  Perhaps most egregious was the President's action exempting Members \nof Congress. The statute provides that Members of Congress shall be \nsubject to ObamaCare, shall be put on the exchanges without employee \nsubsidies, just like millions of Americans.\n  Mr. President, as you and I both know well, that had Members of \nCongress, that had congressional staff in a panic. So majority lead \nHarry Reid and Democratic Senators met with the President and, \naccording to the public press accounts, asked for an exemption, said: \nPlease exempt us--although the statute is clear. It was written that \nway, I would note, because of my friend, Senator Chuck Grassley, who \nadded that amendment on the principle that if we are going to put a \nburden on the American people, we should feel it, we should have skin \nin the game.\n  According to the press reports, the President said he would take care \nof the problem. Shortly thereafter, his administration did so and said: \nWe are going to disregard the law of the land. We are going to \ndisregard the statute.\n  Let me say, when the President of the United States begins picking \nand choosing which laws to follow and which laws not to follow, when \nthe President of the United States looks at this mess that is ObamaCare \nand begins pulling out the eraser and saying: I am going to erase this \npart of the statute, I am going to erase this part of the statute, and \nI am going to pick that it applies to these people, but I am going to \npick that it does not apply to these people, that is the height of \narbitrary enforcement. It is also contrary to his constitutional \nobligation. Article II of the Constitution obliges the President to \ntake care that the laws be faithfully executed. To deliberately, \nwillfully, and openly refuse to enforce the law is the antithesis of \ntaking care that the laws be faithfully executed. Indeed, it is taking \ncare to refuse to faithfully execute the laws of the United States.\n  That is the pattern we have seen. For any President to do so, \nDemocrat or Republican--and I can tell you this: If there were a \nRepublican President in office, and he were saying: I am going to \ndisregard the laws of the United States, I can promise you I would be \nright here on the floor of the Senate decrying that Republican \nPresident, just as loudly as decrying President Obama for disregarding \nthe law.\n  Look, I think ObamaCare is a disaster. I think it is a train wreck. I \nagree with James Hoffa, the president of the Teamsters: It is a \nnightmare. But I do not think the President can just say: I am going to \nrefuse to apply it to everyone. You have not heard me call on President \nObama granting a lawless exemption to everyone. He did not have \nauthority to grant an exemption to big business. He did not have \nauthority to grant an exemption to Members of Congress. He does not \nhave authority to grant an exemption to the American people. Only \nCongress does.\n  That is why Congress needs to act. That is why this body, why \nDemocrats in this body, why Republicans in this body, need to listen to \nthe American people. Together we must make DC listen.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Oklahoma for a \nquestion but not yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I mentioned a few minutes ago, when I was here last night \nsomething was said, and I went back and I got some phone calls because \npeople did not believe it. I say to my good friend Senator Cruz, I \nthink sometimes people like you who are living this issue 24 hours a \nday--literally 24 hours on this day--may assume people understand the \nsignificance of some things that they do not. Because I got these phone \ncalls last night when I was talking about--and I quoted our leader here \nin the Senate, Senator Harry Reid. A couple days ago on the PBS program \n``Nevada Week in Review,'' Senate majority leader Harry Reid was asked \nwhether his goal was to move ObamaCare to a single-payer system, and \nhis answer was: ``Yes, yes. Absolutely, yes.''\n  I know I said this last night. But a lot of people did not realize \nthat because there is--and if the Senator does not mind, I am going to \ntake a few minutes here to kind of set the question up because I think \nit is important.\n  As the Acting President pro tempore will remember, since he was in \nthe other body when I was elected many years ago to the House of \nRepresentatives--I recall at that time nobody thought the Republicans \nwould ever be a majority of anything, the House or the Senate. I know \nthat would have pleased the Acting President pro tempore. It is kind of \ninteresting because we became very good friends, and yet we are \nphilosophically apart from each other.\n  But I observed four things, and I did not think about this until this \nmorning and how this subject fits into this. At the time Republicans \nwere totally insignificant in the House of Representatives, so I spent \nmy time sitting on the floor, and I listened and I observed some \nthings, and I actually wrote a paper about this. I am going from memory \nnow, but I recall in this paper I said there are, in my opinion, four \nflawed premises on which Democrats' policies are based, and I listed \nthose four flawed premises. They were: The cold war is over. We no \nlonger need a strong military. Punishment is not a\n\n[[Page S6821]]\n\ndeterrent to crime. Deficit spending is not bad public policy. And then \nthe fourth one: that government can run our lives better than people \ncan. Well, I kind of went through that.\n  I remember so well that one time there was an amendment on the \nfloor--and I know those who were there at the time will recall this--\nthat we were going to take some of these closed bases, because of the \ncost of incarceration for prisoners, and we were going to take those \nand take the fences and turn them around to keep people in instead of \npeople out. Well, that made sense.\n  So I had an amendment on a bill, and it was a bill that I remember \nwas a big punishment bill that became very controversial at that time. \nBut I had that amendment to do that, and they defeated the amendment. \nThe reason they defeated it was they said: We cannot expect our prison \npopulation to live in such substandard housing. Then I remembered, wait \na minute. I was in the U.S. Army. I lived in that housing. I know a \nlittle bit about that. So that was kind of the punishment.\n  Then at the end of the Cold War--you know, so we do not need the \nmilitary--a lot of them were saying: We need to cut back. And we did. \nWe actually cut back, and Republicans and Democrats agreed at that \ntime. But now it has changed because what we are doing now--I call it \nthe Obama disarming of America. I can remember--and a lot of times when \nyou talk about people as being liberals or conservatives, you are not \nname-calling, you are saying: What is the involvement of government? A \nliberal believes the government should have a greater involvement in \nour lives. Conservatives believe the government has too much control \nand, therefore, we do not need to do that.\n  Anyway, I went to Afghanistan when the first budget 4\\1/2\\ years ago \ncame out.\n  I stood over there knowing I would get national attention, knowing \nthis would be the first step in what I call the disarming of America by \nObama. So I stood over there. I recall in that very first budget he did \naway with our only fifth-generation fighter, the F-22; he did away with \nour lift capacity, the C-17; he did away with our future combat system, \nwhich would have been the first advancement in ground capability in 50 \nyears; and he did away with the ground-based interceptor in Poland. By \nthe way, we are paying dearly for that now because we realize now, with \nIran having the capability they have and our intelligence saying they \nare going to have a delivery system by 2015, we need to have something \nto defend that coast. Then we went through, and, of course, if you \nextend the budget of the President, it took $487 million out of the \nmilitary.\n  So I just wanted to say that is true. This is after several years, \nway back when I was in the House of Representatives. Deficit spending, \nnot bad public policy--that is something we have heard quite often from \nsome of our more liberal friends on the other side.\n  But the fourth thing is that government can run our lives better than \npeople can. Now, I tell my friend from Texas, this goes all of the way \nback to the late eighties; this observation was made by me. That is \nexactly what we are looking at today--a recognition by some people that \nsomehow government can run this system better than people can.\n  So last night when I was honored to stand with my good friend from \nTexas--I recall having been here back during the Clinton \nadministration. We had a thing called Hillary health care. That goes \nright along with the same thing. So a lot of the phone calls I got last \nnight after being on the Floor with you were people saying: Well, I do \nnot even remember that. I did not know we tried that before.\n  The big point here is that they thought it was over, it was done. \nThey were going to have Hillary health care; as Senator Reid said, yes, \na single-payer system. This is what they want. That is what they wanted \nback in the early and middle nineties. So we had Hillary health care. \nThey thought it was over. They said: It is over; we are not going to \nwin this. Consequently, you know, a lot of people actually believed \nthat.\n  Last night I talked about after we finally had victory. It happened \nthat there was a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal by the AMA \nsaying that we embrace Hillary health care because they thought they \nwere going to lose it.\n  That is kind of where we are today. At that time they thought there \nwas no way in the world we were going to win this. They were going to \nbe able to defeat it because it was a done deal.\n  That is why I admire our good friend Senator Cruz for having the \ntenacity to stay in here and recognize that we went through this once \nbefore. If we did it once before, we can do it again.\n  The reason Hillary health care lost way back in the middle nineties \nwas that people realized it as socialized medicine. Again, you ask the \nquestion. It does not work anywhere else. It does not work in Sweden, \nGreat Britain. Why would it work here? And the answer? I know they will \nnever say it, but what they are thinking is, well, if I were running \nit, it would work. It is kind of a mentality that government can run \nour lives better than people can.\n  So I want to say one thing before I ask my question; that is, I have \nhad a great blessing in my life, which is getting to know a great \nAmerican whose name is Rafael Cruz. Rafael Cruz came to this country \nthe tough way. He recognized from his past experience what real freedom \nis.\n  I have some quotes here that I wrote down because I use these quite \noften. He said: ``Our lives are under attack. ObamaCare is going to \ndestroy the elderly by denying care, by even perhaps denying treatment \nto people who are in catastrophic circumstances.'' I hear people say \nall the time that this will never happen in America. It is happening in \nAmerica. It is happening in America, and our rights are being eroded \nmore and more every day.\n  In one of his speeches he gave not too long ago, he said:\n\n       I think the most ominous words I've heard was in the last \n     two State of the Union addresses, when our President said, \n     ``If Congress does not act, I will act unilaterally.''\n\n  Scarily reminiscent of how things were done in Cuba. A law that no \nRepublican voted for is now the law of the land; governing by decree, \nby Executive order, just like Cuba, the country he left behind.\n  This is Rafael Cruz, who happens to be the father of our own Senator \nTed Cruz. He is one who came over. He escaped the very overbearing \npower of government to come here for that reason.\n  So I look at that, and I remember one of the greatest speeches--I \nhave said this often. I know a lot of people do not agree with it. \nProbably the greatest speech I have heard in my life was ``A Rendezvous \nWith Destiny'' by Ronald Reagan. In his speech, he tells the story of \nsomeone who could have been Rafael Cruz, someone who was escaping from \nCommunist Castro Cuba to come to this country and risking his life.\n  In his speech ``Rendezvous With Destiny,'' Ronald Reagan said--this \nis way back when he was the Governor of California. He said: The boat \ncame up. It washed up on the shore in southern Florida. There was a \nwoman there, and he was telling the woman about the atrocities in \nCommunist Cuba.\n  When he was through, she said: Well, we do not know how fortunate we \nare in this country.\n  He said: No, we are the ones who are fortunate because we had a place \nto escape to.\n  Does that not tell the story? That was a government running \neverything. They escaped that and came to this country, risked their \nlives, and they are over here.\n  I know that my kids--Kay and I have 20 kids and grandkids. I was \nlistening last night when the Senator was reading a bedtime story to \nhis little kids. Ours are not little kids anymore, but my grandkids \nare. The Senator stopped and said: What kind of America, what kind of \nAmerica are these kids going to be inheriting? Why is it popular now? \nWhy would someone who believes government should have a larger role in \nour lives be reelected? What has happened to the American people and \nthe values we held for so many years so close to us?\n  Well, that is a hard thing to answer. But I know there are several of \nthem--people who have experienced that, leaving slavery to come to this \ncountry.\n  By the way, last night when I was reading the various things, I did \nnot have any statements from the people from Oklahoma, so I was reading \nfrom\n\n[[Page S6822]]\n\nLouie Gohmert, who represents the eastern part of Texas. He had a lot \nof anecdotal stories from people in East Texas--just like Oklahoma. We \nare not that far apart. But since that time, someone called last night \nand they said: You should use stories from Oklahoma.\n  K. Matheson said:\n\n       Stand with Senator Ted Cruz. Defund ObamaCare. A single-\n     payer health care system is nothing more than a socialized \n     system.\n\n  She is from Bethany, OK. I do not want to give her last name. She did \nnot want it given.\n  Sue said:\n\n       Thank you. What's to protect people from being victims of \n     identity theft with all of these so-called advisors having \n     access to people's financial and health care records? Why \n     aren't members of Congress, the White House and their staffs \n     included?\n\n  Well, they should be included. We have been talking about that. The \nSenator from Texas has been talking about that.\n  We had a tweet that came in this morning. It said:\n\n       What allows the executive branch to pick & choose who must \n     follow ObamaCare & what parts to enforce?\n\n  So we have got a lot of that stuff. But the thing I wanted to bring \nup last night--one of the things--is that something really good is \nhappening. We are talking about the bad things, but there is another \nopportunity. We have a great guy in Oklahoma by the name of Scott \nPruitt. He is our attorney general. In fact, I tell my friend Senator \nCruz that while he was running for attorney general, I flew him around. \nAviation is kind of my thing. I was flying him around the State. I got \nto know him quite well. He told me at that time that he saw this threat \ncoming. So what he has done is he has filed a lawsuit.\n  I am proud to say that Oklahoma and the attorney general, through the \ncourts, are leading the charge to dismantle ObamaCare and put an end to \nits onerous taxes. Just last month a judge overseeing the lawsuit ruled \nagainst a motion filed by the administration to dismiss the case, which \nmeans the case will proceed. Well, that was a major obstacle. No one \nthought he would be able to overcome this motion to dismiss. So it is \nstill out there.\n  The law is a train wreck. We know that. There have been several \nproposals to prevent further damage. We need to defund the law. We need \nto make sure no additional taxpayer money would be used.\n  If he is successful, that will affect some 34 States that are in the \nsame situation as Oklahoma. If he is successful, that is going to pull \nthe funding out of ObamaCare, and it could be that just one guy in the \nState of Oklahoma will be responsible for that. So this is happening.\n  Yes, there are all of the efforts that are taking place here, \nprimarily by my good friend from Texas, but we are in Oklahoma. We are \ninvolved in this too. We are hoping to be able to have that \nopportunity.\n  I want to mention one other thing because this came in. I am going to \nread this. It is a letter. It is not all that long, but I think it is \nreally revealing. It says:\n\n       I cannot tell you how distressed I am with regard to the \n     Affordable Health Care Act--\n\n  This came from Lynn in Oklahoma. This came in last night--\n\n       Obama-care. I am fearful for my kids, now 18 and 20. There \n     is the effect it is having right now--employers are not \n     allowing their workers to have full-time hours. They are \n     hiring more part-time workers to make up the difference for \n     the company so they won't be penalized for not providing \n     health insurance. Both of my kids are unable to get full-time \n     employment. For a year, my daughter was able to work 40-plus \n     hours a week. Then, with the implementation of the ACA, no \n     one can work over 29 hours a week. Instant pay cut. My son, \n     who just graduated from high school, finally found a job at a \n     restaurant, and they give him 4 hours a day. He is still \n     looking.\n       Additionally, I have adult friends whose hours are being \n     cut at UCO so they don't get penalized for not providing \n     health insurance to their part-time people, adults with \n     families getting their wages cut--\n\n  This is just a normal citizen out there. This is not a professional. \nThis is what people are thinking, at least in my State of Oklahoma and \nI think throughout the Nation.\n\n     --adults with families getting their wages cut so the \n     employer does not have to pay for health insurance. Did you \n     not think employers would not find a way out of this at the \n     expense of the American people? Is everyone in Washington so \n     blind or is it selfish?\n       My husband's employer now wants to penalize us if I choose \n     to stay on his health coverage rather than take the inferior \n     health care package at my employment.\n       Mr. Inhofe, I dedicated my life to raising my kids and \n     taking care of my family. I currently make $12.25 an hour. I \n     have a bachelor's degree. It would be senseless for me to pay \n     for health care on a salary when my husband's health care is \n     so much better, and I have been on it for the last 13 years.\n\n  Thirteen years. She would have to give that up.\n\n       He takes care of me as my husband. I should not be \n     penalized for wanting to work full time at this juncture of \n     my life. If his company pushes the issue, I feel as if I will \n     not be able to stay employed full time, which is a violation \n     of my basic human rights. Now that my kids are grown, I need \n     and want to work. At 52 it is highly unlikely that I am going \n     to make a wage that is going to allow me to pay for health \n     insurance. It is against my constitutional right to force me \n     to purchase health insurance I do not need. The law is \n     unconstitutional and un-American. Please tell me what we can \n     do. The American people deserve to be able to work full time \n     without being penalized.\n       I am tired of Washington and its dirty politics. Everyone \n     in Washington should be held to the same laws it passes for \n     the American people.\n\n  Amen.\n\n       Each one of you need to have the same health coverage \n     expenses that we have.\n       I feel as if our country is headed, at lightening speed, \n     for a major breakdown. What are you going to do to stop it \n     and how can I help? I am frightened for the future of my \n     children and the future of America. I am tired of DC \n     politics.\n\n  That was Lynn from Oklahoma City. This came in last night. I have \nseveral others that just came in overnight.\n  But I think the thing that people did not realize and that we were \nable to talk about last night was the fact that this has happened once \nbefore, and they came dangerously close to pulling it off back in the \nmiddle nineties.\n  You know, I have to say this. There is a brilliant strategy going on \nright now. I didn't realize it until yesterday. There are some pro-\nObamaCare people who are doing robocalls. I know the occupier of the \nchair knows what robocalls are, but a lot of people do not. These are \nautomated calls where they call and a voice comes on and it gives a \nmessage. People listen to that. Sometimes they believe it, sometimes \nthey do not. Most of the times they do.\n  So there are robocalls that are going on by the pro-Obama health care \npeople, going to the strongest opponents of ObamaCare and trying to \nmake people think they are supporting it. It is to confuse the \nelectorate. When you stop to think about it, that is pretty brilliant, \nand they did it.\n  All day yesterday there were calls going around my State of Oklahoma \nby someone. The message was something like this: This is Joe Smith. I \nam with the ABC tea party--these are not tea party people, but \nnonetheless that is how they identify themselves--your Senator Jim \nInhofe is supporting ObamaCare and you have to call his office. This is \nwhat his number is.\n  We started getting calls and people didn't even know there were 14 of \nus who joined together with Senator Cruz about 6 weeks ago. I was 1 of \nthe 14 and one of the strongest supporters of his cause. Yet they were \ntrying to make people believe something else just to confuse them. \nFrankly, it is dishonest, but it is brilliant.\n  When we are looking and we are seeing what happened, what is going on \ntoday, I do applaud my friend. I feel guilty, I have to say to my \nfriend, Senator Cruz, because I left him last night at 10 o'clock.\n  I went home, had dinner, and went to bed. I got up and he was still \ntalking. That is the depth of his feeling about this. I believe what we \nlearned, a lesson we can remember back in the middle of the 1990s, the \nlesson we learned there, when it was all over, we had lost, but we \ndidn't lose because the American people came to our aid. We were a \nminority at the time, but they came to our aid and we turned this whole \nthing around. That is exactly where we are today.\n  My question to my good friend, Senator Cruz, is I believe that \nhistory could repeat itself. Does the Senator?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his learned insight \nfor that very good question. The answer, in short, is yes. Yes, yes, \nabsolutely, I think to use the same phrasing majority leader Harry Reid \nused when asked\n\n[[Page S6823]]\n\nif he supported single-payer government socialized health care.\n  I wish to make three comments in response to Senator Inhofe's \nquestion and his thoughts that he has shared with this body. First is \nsimply a word of thanks to the Senator from Oklahoma. Senator Inhofe is \nan elder statesman of this body. He has served many years. He has \nearned the respect of his colleagues on the Republican side of the \naisle and on the Democratic side of the aisle.\n  From day one, when Senator Mike Lee began this fight, Senator Inhofe \nhas been with us on saying ObamaCare is such a train wreck, such a \nnightmare, such a disaster that we should defund it.\n  I observed earlier, it is one thing for the young Turks, the so-\ncalled wacko birds, to stand in this spot. It is another thing \naltogether to see elder statesmen, Senator Inhofe, Senator Pat Roberts, \nSenator Jeff Sessions, and Senator Mike Enzi, standing with us.\n  That is significant, particularly when the leadership of our party is \npublicly urging Republicans to go the other way. I am grateful for the \nfriendship. I am grateful for your steadfastness. I am grateful for the \nprincipled and courageous willingness of the Senator from Oklahoma to \nfight for the American people.\n  I will say it makes a real difference. If you trust what is written \nin the media, this battle is doomed. Indeed, I recall reading a day or \ntwo ago an article that purported to be an objective news story--not an \neditorial--by a reporter allegedly reporting on the news that began \nwith something like: The fight to defund ObamaCare, which is doomed to \nfail.\n  That was reported as a fact. There was no editorializing, apparently. \nThat is just an objective fact that it is doomed to fail.\n  I would say the momentum has been steadily with us. They said this \nfight was doomed to fail 2 months ago. We saw the American people \nunite, over 1.6 million Americans, signed a national petition saying \ndefund ObamaCare now because it is a train wreck, it is a disaster, and \nit is hurting Americans.\n  They said it was doomed to fail, the House of Representatives would \nnever pass a continuing resolution conditioned on defunding ObamaCare. \nIt wouldn't happen.\n  Then last Friday the House of Representatives did exactly that \nbecause courageous House conservatives stuck their neck out and because \nHouse leadership, in an action for which I commend them, listened to \nthe American people.\n  This week the press says it is doomed to fail that Republicans be \nunited. Yet I would note seeing elder statesman after elder statesman \ncome down and support us, it indicates the momentum that is with this \nmovement. Listen, this is not a movement by any 1, 2, 3 or 100 \nSenators. This is a movement from the American people.\n  Why are we seeing momentum move in favor of defunding ObamaCare? Why \nare we seeing momentum for Republicans in favor of voting against \ncloture so as to deny Harry Reid the ability to fund ObamaCare on a 51-\npartisan vote? Because the American people are rising up and their \nvoices are being heard. That is the first point I wished to make in \nresponse to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Before the Senator continues, would he yield for one \nfollowup question.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I yield to the Senator for a question but not the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It was interesting. I don't think I have ever been \nreferred to as the senior statesman, but I kind of like that. I \nwondered, when the Senator mentioned the four of us coming down--he put \nus in that category. We have been here for a while. There is one thing \nwe all four had in common. We all had a career in the real world first.\n  One of the problems we have that I have observed, I say: What do you \nwant to do?\n  The reply is: Oh, I want to be a Member of Congress.\n  So they leave the fraternity house and they move to Congress. They \nhave never been in the real world.\n  People ask me the question: what should I do if I want to get into \npolitics. I say go out for at least 15 years, live under this system, \nand learn how tough things are. In my case I spent over 20 years, did a \nlot of building and developing in the State of Texas where Senator Cruz \nis from. I have talked to his father, Raphael, several times about \nthis.\n  I remember there I was doing things that Americans are supposed to \ndo. I was making money, losing money, expanding the tax base.\n\n  Yet the obstacle I had all during those years was the Federal \nGovernment, and I was doing what Americans are supposed to be doing. I \nremember that is when I decided.\n  The last thing I did down in Texas, a pretty good-sized development, \nand I had to go to 25 governmental agencies to get a dock permit. I \nthought, wait a minute, they are supposed to be on our side. I decided \nI would run to come to Congress and try to save the free enterprise \nsystem.\n  That is what all four of us have in common. We may have been here for \na while, but we are here with a cause and here with experience.\n  How abusive government can be. I have not seen a time when the abuse \nis greater than it is today on what is happening to us, to think that \nwe have a policy by the President, as he has been able to sell the \nidea, get the votes, get it through, and it is socializing medicine. It \nis something that has failed year after year after year in every \ncountry where they have tried to do it.\n  Does my friend from Texas see anything different about the United \nStates of America, how socialized medicine would work here when it \nhasn't worked anywhere else?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I think the Senator from Oklahoma raises a very good \nquestion. The clear facts are everywhere in the world socialized \nmedicine has been implemented, it hasn't worked. It produces results \nconsistently. We can predict where socialized medicine leads. It leads \nto scarcity. It leads to waiting periods. It leads to poor quality \nhealth care. It leads to government rationing. It leads to government \nbureaucrats deciding what health care you can get and what health care \nI can get.\n  If you go in for a health treatment, a government bureaucrat may say, \nMr. Inhofe, you can get that treatment in 6 months or maybe a year. On \nthe other hand, perhaps your mom goes in for a treatment and the \ngovernment bureaucrat may say: Ma'am, I am afraid you don't get that \ntreatment. We have determined on our schedule we are not allowing it.\n  That is what happens with socialized medicine. If you want not to be \nable to pick your doctor, if you want a government bureaucrat making \nhealth care decisions for you instead of you and your doctor, then you \nshould welcome what Majority Leader Reid says is the inevitable result \nof ObamaCare. That is single-payer government socialized medicine. That \nis where this law is headed.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator yield one last time for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I yield to the Senator for a question without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I hope my wife will forgive me, because I know she is \nwatching, or I suspect she is watching because she has an equal \ninterest in this issue for a totally different reason.\n  Kay and I have been married--our 54th wedding anniversary is coming \nup. We have 20 kids and grandkids.\n  She went through an experience, and our whole family went through the \nexperience with her a short while ago, less than 1 year ago. She \ndiscovered she had a serious heart problem with the aortic valve. I \nhave to praise her for not telling me anything about it for 4 months. \nShe knew she was going to have to have this very serious operation. She \nis only 1 year younger than I am. She knew she was going to have the \noperation and she didn't want to say anything because she didn't want \nto worry me. She was writing things out about what things would go to \nwhat kids because she didn't think she was going to make it. She \nthought there was a good chance she wouldn't. We went through that \nexperience with her.\n  I will tell you what is funny. All our grandkids call us--my name is \nInhofe, so ``I'' is for Inhofe so they called us Mom I and Pop I. That \nis how they have referred to us. Since she had a valve put in her heart \nthat was from a cow, instead of calling her Mom I, they call her Moom \nI. She went through this very difficult procedure with the best medical \ncare in St. John's Medical Center in Tulsa, Dr. Robert Garrett, all the \nnurses, all the people all the way down.\n\n[[Page S6824]]\n\n  I was thinking, that is my first experience at my age, my senior age, \nof seeing this system work.\n  Where would she have been in Canada? I have talked to people and they \nsaid: No. At her age she would have waited in such a long line that she \nprobably would not have been able to make it.\n  It is serious things she is going through. I don't think I am the \nonly one who has had this experience, but that was a wakeup call. I \nwould hope and suggest to the Senator that other people speak up, even \nthough it is somewhat uncomfortable. I thank God we had the system that \nallowed Kay and me to be able to look forward to our next 54 years of \nmarriage.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for that excellent \nquestion, and I will make several points in response; first, is hearing \nthat story of your wife and her courage. It reminds me, I will confess, \nI knew there were many reasons why the Senator and I had become \nfriends, why I like and admire the Senator. I discovered yet another. \nIt sounds as if the Senator and I married very similar women.\n  If it is anything like our marriage, at least in my marriage, I \nmarried way, way, way above myself.\n  I will tell you a story that your story reminded me of, which is my \nwife Heidi was taking a car to the airport. The car was hit. It was hit \nby another car, T-boned. The driver was very upset. Heidi called 911, \nand an ambulance came and took the driver to the hospital. Heidi \nproceeded to call a cab and take the cab to the airport, got on a plane \nand flew to a business meeting she had in New Mexico.\n  At the end of the meeting she noticed: Gosh, I am kind of hurting. My \nhead hurts and my shoulder hurts. She went to the hospital that \nafternoon in New Mexico and discovered she had both a concussion and a \nbroken collarbone.\n  Much like Senator Inhofe relayed, Heidi did not share this news with \nher husband until that evening. She didn't call me when the accident \noccurred. She didn't call me even when she got the diagnosis. She \ncalled me and was describing her injuries to me. She said: Sweetheart, \nI wanted to let you know I had a car accident. I am all right, but I do \nhave a broken collarbone. I have a concussion.\n  Oh, my goodness. It is very disconcerting when your wife tells you \nthat. She was describing where it happened. As she described the street \nin Houston, I am thinking: Wait, if it happened in Houston, what are \nyou doing in New Mexico if you were in a car wreck in Houston?\n  She said: I got on a plane and flew, without going to the doctor, \nwith a broken collarbone and concussion and went to the business \nmeeting, completed the business meeting, before bothering to get \ntreated.\n  Let me say to anyone watching this, I do not commend my wonderful, \nlove of my life, wife's conduct to anyone who has had an accident. I \nwould suggest getting medical treatment immediately. I would strongly \nsuggest not following the path of the wife of the Senator from Oklahoma \nand my wife and not telling your husband.\n  I would strongly encourage, call your spouse and let them know. I \ncertainly urge, should that happen again to my wife: Sweetheart, please \nlet me know when it happens and not 12, 14 hours later.\n  But it is the virtue of marrying strong women who know what they want \nand are able to tackle the world. I, for one, am blessed and I have no \ndoubt that you feel deeply blessed with 20 kids and grandkids. You \nknow, the psalmist talks about my cup runneth over, bountiful \nblessings, and 20 kids and grandkids certainly qualifies as that.\n\n  Indeed, an additional point I wanted to make is I wanted to thank the \nSenator from Oklahoma for his very kind comments about my father. As \nthe Senator knows, my father has been my hero my whole life. I have \nadmired him for as long as I can remember.\n  I also want to note something particularly meaningful the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma did. Every week in the Senate there is a prayer \nbreakfast. It is a bipartisan prayer breakfast, which is nice. There \nare not a lot of bipartisan things we do here in the Senate. There are \na number of Senators who attend regularly, Republicans and Democrats, \nand they invite a different Senator each week to share his or her \ntestimony, share some thoughts. Some weeks ago I was invited to do so, \nand I felt honored to have the opportunity. I had attended the prayer \nbreakfast a number of times.\n  The way it typically works is another Senator is asked to introduce \nwhoever is speaking that day. So at this particular prayer breakfast \nSenator Inhofe was asked to introduce me. It is really quite \ninteresting to me. Almost anyone, when asked to introduce someone, \nwould do so fairly easily. Maybe they would print out a bio to pick a \nlittle biographical fact or two. Most treat introductions as fairly \nroutine efforts, but Senator Inhofe didn't treat it that way. He picked \nup the phone and he called my dad. He picked up the phone and he called \nmy college roommate. He picked up the phone and called one of my \ndearest friends here in Washington, for whom Heidi and I are the \nGodparents of their kids.\n  The Senator made these calls totally out of the blue and said: Hi, \nthis is Jim Inhofe. I have been asked to introduce Ted and I was \nwondering if you could share any particular stories, and they shared a \nfew mildly embarrassing stories. Actually, I give them all credit for \nfinding exactly the right balance of stories that were just \nembarrassing enough but not quite so scandalous that the blood drains \nfrom your face when they are told. I would say that showed a personal \nlevel of consideration that is unusual in this town and I appreciated \nthat.\n  I thanked the Senator then, but I wanted to take this opportunity to \nthank the Senator publicly for putting that degree of personal \nconsideration in trying to tell not just that I went to so-and-so \ncollege and did this and this--not just the empty biographical facts--\nbut in trying to put a little color on who this individual is.\n  The final point I will make is a point that goes to the substance of \nsome of the remarks the Senator from Oklahoma made in the process of \nasking his first question, which is he talked about the battle of \nHillaryCare. I think it is quite fitting to the battle we are having \nright now over defunding ObamaCare. When the battle over HillaryCare \nwas occurring--I remember it well--I was in law school. I wasn't \nserving in the Senate. If you remember the context at that time, when \nHillaryCare was playing out, all of the media said this is unstoppable. \nAll of the media said this is going to happen and there is nothing the \nhapless Republicans can do to stop it. Indeed, there were a number of \nRepublicans who came forth and said: We can't stop this, so we propose, \nwhat I derisively referred to at the time as--perhaps due to being a \nlaw student--HillaryCare light.\n  I remember watching that. During the course of that debate, I almost \nput my boot through the television set. I remember yelling at the TV \nset a sentiment that perhaps maybe more than a few people watching us \nfeel, where you feel you don't have a voice in the process. Certainly, \nas a law student I didn't have a voice in the process. But I remember \nyelling at the TV set: What on Earth do we believe? What are we doing? \nIf we are going to accede to marching down the road to socialized \nhealth care, what the heck are we doing? I remember saying: All right. \nTo heck with all of this. I am going to move to an island and fish all \nmy life. Heck, I'm Cuban. I like to fish. That would be a great life.\n  And Senator Inhofe will remember, because he was part of this effort. \nAt the time I was particularly focused on the Senator from my State of \nTexas, Senator Phil Gramm. Senator Gramm had been a hero of mine for a \nlong time. Indeed, I am particularly honored that the desk at which I \nsit used to be Senator Phil Gramm's desk. His name is written on the \nside drawer.\n  This is one of the curious traditions of the Senate; that Senators, \nwhen they leave the Senate, scrawl their signatures on the drawer of \nthe desk. You are actually encouraged to deface government property, \nand with some frequency. I hope the next individual fortunate to have \nthis desk appreciates it. I find it an inspiration to sit at the desk \nthat was Senator Phil Gramm's.\n  But I remember at the time, when it seemed the whole stampede in the \nRepublican conference back then was listening to the media, which was \nsaying:\n\n[[Page S6825]]\n\nYou can't win. You must accede to this. HillaryCare is unstoppable. I \nremember Phil Gramm walking out to a microphone and saying, in his \ninimitable drawl: This will pass over my cold, dead political body.\n  I have to tell you, when Phil Gramm said that, it was fairly lonely. \nHe didn't have a whole lot of allies when he marched out and did that. \nSenator Inhofe knows, because he was part of that fight and he bears \nthe scars from that fight. But because of that leadership and standing \nand fighting--it was very interesting that it ended up where we saw \nRepublicans looking all around, and Gramm was standing there and he \ndidn't get killed. They all essentially ran behind him saying: Yeah, \nyeah, what he said. But I am convinced if we hadn't had a handful of \nleaders back then who had the courage to not read the papers and \nbelieve all those who were saying: Oh, we have to concede, the papers \nsay they have already won, we are going to HillaryCare, if we hadn't \nhad a handful of leaders willing to buck the conventional wisdom and \nsaying we can win, when they are being told no you can't, ObamaCare \nwould have passed 19 years earlier and it would have been called \nHillaryCare instead. That is the power of leadership.\n  So everyone in this body who said 2 months ago and who are saying \nthis morning that we can't win this fight, I point out that history is \nreplete with example after example after example of those who stood up \nand listened to the American people and fought for the principles, for \nthe values the American people share, fought for the interests of the \nAmerican people, and who, with the support of the American people, won \nthose fights.\n  That is what we are fighting for. Listen, it is my hope that by the \nend of this process we will see all 46 Republicans unite in opposing \ncloture and saying: No, we are not going to allow Harry Reid and a bare \nmajority of Democrats on a partisan political vote to fund ObamaCare. \nIt is my hope over time, once that happens, we start to get one \nDemocrat after another, after another to come with us.\n  Now, will that happen now? Probably not. As long as Republicans are \npublicly divided, no Democrat is going to join us. But if we unite as \nRepublicans, and if particularly those Democrats running for reelection \nin red States where their citizens passionately oppose ObamaCare and \nthe damage it is doing to the economy, and the damage it is doing to \njobs, and the damage it is doing to all of the people who are being \nhurt--if they hear from more and more and more of their citizens, \n5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 50,000--that starts to change the count.\n\n  People have asked over and over: What is the end game? How can you \npossibly win? I can't win. There is no way I can win, nor can any \nelected official win. The only way we can win is with the American \npeople. That is it. When people ask: What is your end game, it is very \nsimple. I have faith in the American people. And ultimately I have \nfaith, or at least hope, in the 100 Members of the Senate.\n  I share the frustrations of Americans across this country that \npoliticians on both sides of the aisle don't listen to people, that \ninstead the political establishment in Washington protects itself, \nmaintains its power, entrenches its power and does things like exempt \nitself from ObamaCare while letting the American people suffer under \nthis train wreck of a disaster--this nightmare. But I also know at the \nend of the day, if enough people speak up, that every Member of this \nbody at some point is compelled to listen to the constituents he or she \nrepresents. It is why I am so encouraged by the outpouring we have seen \nover the last 19\\1/2\\ hours, with all of the people engaged, all of the \npeople tweeting the hashtag ``MakeDCListen.''\n  The citizen activists are transforming this debate. Listen, all of \nWashington wants to tell you, the citizen, it can't be done. You cannot \nwin. Your view will not be listened to. The disaster, the train wreck, \nthe nightmare--and I have used the word nightmare over and over. Let me \nbe clear, for those who are just tuning in, where nightmare comes from. \nNightmare is not my term. Nightmare is the language that James Hoffa, \npresident of the Teamsters, used to describe ObamaCare because it is \nhurting millions of Americans. So at some point I believe, I hope, \nRepublicans will unite and that Democratic Senators will start \nlistening to their people.\n  It is striking if we listen to the letter from Mr. Hoffa. With \npermission I want to share that letter again, because I think it is \npowerful, it is potent. It is something, frankly, I think every \nDemocrat in this body who is supporting ObamaCare, who is opposing \ndefunding ObamaCare, who is going to vote with the majority leader, \nshould be asked about by reporters. I think the President should be \nasked about this letter.\n  Let me just read it. These are not my words, these are the words of \nthe president of the Teamsters.\n\n       Dear Leader Reid and Leader Pelosi: When you and the \n     President sought our support for the Affordable Care Act (the \n     ACA), you pledged that if we liked the health plans we have \n     now, we could keep them. Sadly, that promise is under threat. \n     Right now, unless you and the Obama administration enact an \n     equitable fix, the ACA will shatter not only our hard-earned \n     health benefits, but destroy the foundation of the 40-hour \n     work week that is the backbone of the American middle class.\n\n  Now, that is not a Republican saying that. That is not a politician \nsaying that. That is the head of the Teamsters, who supported \nObamaCare. The letter continues:\n\n       Like millions of other Americans, our members are front-\n     line workers in the American economy. We have been strong \n     supporters of the notion that all Americans should have \n     access to quality affordable health care. We have also been \n     strong supporters of you.\n\n  I remind you, this letter is addressed to Senate majority leader \nHarry Reid and House minority leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\n       In campaign after campaign we have put boots on the ground, \n     gone door-to-door to get out the vote, run phone banks and \n     raised money to secure this vision.\n\n  So it is worth emphasizing the Teamsters are not fair-weather \nfriends. They have been active, aggressive, full-throated members of \nthe Democratic coalition and played a significant part in helping to \nelect this Democratic majority in the Senate and helping elect this \nPresident.\n\n       Now this vision has come back to haunt us.\n\n  What vision is that? The vision of electing Democrats as a majority \nin the Senate, electing the President. Why? Because ObamaCare is the \nlaw of the land and they are discovering it isn't working. What does \nMr. Hoffa say next?\n\n       Since the ACA was enacted, we have been bringing our deep \n     concerns to the Administration, seeking reasonable regulatory \n     interpretations to the statute that would help prevent the \n     destruction of non-profit health plans. As you both know \n     first- hand, our persuasive arguments have been disregarded \n     and met with a stone wall by the White House and the \n     pertinent agencies.\n\n  Now, let me stop at this point and make a comment. For all of you at \nhome who are not leaders of powerful unions and who have been major \nsupporters of the President of the United States, major supporters of \nthe Democratic majority in the Senate, my guess is you may not have the \nsame access to the west wing, to the Oval Office, to the office of the \nmajority leader of the Senate as James Hoffa, head of the teamsters \ndoes. Yet James Hoffa, head of the teamsters says in writing that he \nwas met with a stone wall by the White House and pertinent agencies.\n  Listen, if a major union--that in its own words had boots on the \nground, went door-to-door to get out the vote, ran phone banks and \nraised money to secure a democratic vision--was met with a stone wall, \nwhat do you think we the citizens will be met with? Do you think this \nadministration listens to a single mom working at a diner who is saying \nObamaCare is slamming her and making her life harder? Do you think this \nadministration listens to you even if the politically powerful are \nlamenting what is happening with them?\n  Mr. Hoffa continues:\n\n       This is especially stinging because other stakeholders have \n     repeatedly received successful interpretations for their \n     respective grievances. Most disconcerting of course is last \n     week's huge accommodation for the employer community--\n     extending the statutorily mandated ``December 31, 2013'' \n     deadline for the employer mandate and penalties.\n\n  Notably, two things are included there. One, Mr. Hoffa on behalf of \nthe Teamsters said that deadline for the employer mandate is \nstatutorily mandated; that the law requires it. What he is saying there \nis that the President is\n\n[[Page S6826]]\n\nignoring the law because it is statutorily mandated. No. 2, it is a \ngift for big business that is not being given to others.\n  Mr. Hoffa continues:\n\n       Time is running out: Congress wrote this law; we voted for \n     you. We have a problem; you need to fix it. The unintended \n     consequences of the ACA are severe. Perverse incentives are \n     already creating nightmare scenarios:\n       First, the law creates an incentive for employers to keep \n     employees' work hours below 30 hours a week. Numerous \n     employers have begun to cut workers' hours to avoid this \n     obligation, and many of them are doing so openly. The impact \n     is two-fold: Fewer hours means less pay while also losing our \n     current health benefits.\n\n  This is the president of the Teamsters saying ObamaCare is causing \nworkers to have their hours forcibly reduced. That means less pay, and \nthey are losing their current health insurance. Anytime the majority \nleader of the Senate goes on television and says that ObamaCare is \nworking terrifically, this letter stands in stark contrast to that \nassertion.\n\n       Second, millions of Americans are covered by non-profit \n     health insurance plans like the one in which most of our \n     Members participate. Those non-profit plans are governed \n     jointly by unions and companies under the Taft-Hartley Act. \n     Our health plans have been built over decades by working men \n     and women. Under the ACA as interpreted by the \n     administration, our employees will be treated differently and \n     not eligible for subsidies afforded other citizens. As such, \n     many employees will be relegated to second-class status and \n     shut out of the help the law offers to for-profit insurance \n     plans.\n\n       And finally, even though non-profit plans like ours won't \n     receive the same subsidies as for-profit plans, they'll be \n     taxed to pay for those subsidies. Taken together, these \n     restrictions will make non-profit plans like ours \n     unsustainable, and will undermine the health-care market of \n     viable alternatives to the big health insurance companies.\n\n  This next paragraph is critical:\n\n       On behalf of the millions of working men and women we \n     represent--\n\n  Let me note, that is not hundreds, that is not thousands, that is \nmillions of working men and women we represent:\n\n     --and the families they support--\n\n  So millions more\n\n     --we can no longer stand silent in the face of elements of \n     the Affordable Care Act that will destroy--\n\n  not weaken, not undermine, not slightly impair but destroy\n\n     --the very health and wellbeing of our members along with \n     millions of other hard-working Americans.\n       We believe that there are commonsense corrections that can \n     be made within the existing statute that will allow our \n     members to keep their current health plans and benefits just \n     as you and the President pledged. Unless changes are made, \n     however, that promise is hollow.\n       We continue to stand behind real health care reform, but \n     the law as it stands will hurt millions of Americans \n     including members of our respective unions.\n       We are looking to you to make sure these changes are made.\n       James P. Hoffa, General President, International \n     Brotherhood of Teamsters.\n\n  When you have the Teamsters coming out and saying this is hurting \nmillions of working men and women and their families, it begs the \nquestion: If Mr. Hoffa can no longer remain silent, if the Teamsters \ncan no longer remain silent, how long can the Democratic Members of the \nSenate remain silent?\n  I have no doubt Mr. Hoffa and the Teamsters received harsh criticism \nfor this letter, because politically this letter was inconvenient for \nthe party they have supported with time, blood, and treasure. Yet Mr. \nHoffa said: We can no longer remain silent because of the devastation \nbeing inflicted on the working men and women of America.\n  If that is true, I am hopeful that among the 54 Democrats in this \nbody we will see first one and then maybe two and then maybe three and \nthen maybe a dozen Democrats with the same courage that James Hoffa \nshows, the courage to say, Listen, I am willing to make a statement \nthat is contrary to the political leadership of the party I belong to \nand have fought for.\n  To any Democrats who are contemplating doing so, let me note that \nbucking your party's leadership inevitably provokes a reaction, \ninevitably provokes expressions--and often strong expressions--of \ndispleasure. But let me also encourage any Democrats, there are worse \nthings in life than a few harsh words being tossed your way. To be \nhonest, that pales compared to the suffering of the working men and \nwomen of this country who are losing their jobs, who are losing their \nhealth care, who are being forced into part-time work. Any politician \nwho whines ``Someone has said something mean about me'' has totally \nlost perspective compared to the hurt the American people are feeling. \nSo I am hopeful.\n  I want to appeal to the better angels of our Democratic Senators that \nthey show the same courage Mr. Hoffa showed to be willing to buck party \nleadership and speak out for the men and women who are your \nconstituents.\n  I make that same plea to the Republicans, that you show the courage \nto buck party leadership and stand up to the men and women who are your \nconstituents who are suffering under ObamaCare. Any Republican who \nvotes for cloture, who votes to give Harry Reid the ability to fund \nObamaCare on a 51-vote partisan vote is directly participating in and \nresponsible for funding ObamaCare.\n  If a Republican wants to say openly, I don't think we can defund \nObamaCare; I don't agree with this fight, so I am siding with Harry \nReid because on principle I think it is right, I don't agree with that, \nbut I respect that view. You are entitled to that view. You are \nentitled to articulate that view. But I will tell you this, I don't \nthink you are entitled to vote with Harry Reid and the Democrats, give \nHarry Reid and the Democrats the ability to fund ObamaCare, and then go \nto your constituents and say, I agree with defunding ObamaCare. You \ndon't get it both ways.\n  If we are going to listen to the people, we need to be honest with \nthe people and tell them what we are doing. That is what this fight is \nabout, whether Democratic Senators and Republican Senators will listen \nto the people. We need to make DC listen.\n  Mr. VITTER. Will the Senator yield for questions and comments without \nyielding the floor?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield to my friend from Louisiana for a \nquestion without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. VITTER. I appreciate the Senator's comments, and certainly his \ncorrect recitation about what the real impact of ObamaCare is across \nthe country, particularly for hard-working men and women. And the \nSenator is right. These descriptive phrases such as ``nightmare'' and \nanother one is ``train wreck,'' are not his words, they are not my \nwords. They are actually words from supporters of the law.\n\n  ``Nightmare,'' as the Senator pointed out, comes from the leader of \nthe Teamsters, a very powerful organization on the Democratic side \npolitically that strongly supported the law.\n  The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee that helped write the \nlaw called ObamaCare implementation a ``train wreck'' a few months ago. \nNot coincidentally, that was right before he announced he wasn't \nrunning for reelection.\n  I appreciate the notation of those descriptions from folks on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, from folks who helped pass ObamaCare. \nThis is clear proof that this is not ready for prime time, causing real \npain and dislocation to hard-working Americans: job loss, folks being \nmoved into part-time work, jobs not being created, folks losing the \nhealth care they have now which they enjoy.\n  But did the Senator know, I think the leader of the Teamsters, James \nHoffa, is even more upset today than he was when he wrote that letter \nbecause in the intervening time something else has happened, which is \nthat the administration bailed out Congress with a special exemption, \nwith a special subsidy, with a special rule, hasn't helped the working-\nclass Americans Mr. Hoffa represents through the Teamsters, but has \nbailed out Congress?\n  That is what I have an amendment on the CR about. It would be a \ngermane amendment. I will present it. Unfortunately, it seems clear \nthat the plan is for the majority leader to block out all amendments, \nincluding mine, except the ones he chooses that would take out the \ndefunding language from the House-passed bill.\n  Again, what I am talking about is a special bailout exemption subsidy \nfor Congress. This goes back to the original ObamaCare debate, and our \ndistinguished colleague Senator Grassley of Iowa proposed language \nwhich so many of us strongly supported that said every Member of \nCongress and all congressional staff would have to go to the\n\n[[Page S6827]]\n\nsame fallback plan under ObamaCare as there is for all Americans. First \nit was called the public option, then eventually the exchange.\n  Amazingly, happily--I was pleasantly surprised at the time, that \nlanguage got in the bill and was passed into law. That became a classic \ncase of what Nancy Pelosi said: We have to pass the bill to figure out \nwhat is in it. Because after that language got in the bill and passed \ninto law, then lots of folks around Capitol Hill read that provision \nand they said, Oh, you know what, they said, Wait a minute. We can't \nlive with this. We can't deal with this, because we are going to be in \nthe same fallback plan as there is for every other American with no \nspecial treatment. We can't deal with that.\n  Then, because of that, furious lobbying started on the Obama \nadministration, folks such as the distinguished majority leader talking \ndirectly to President Obama himself, saying, We need a bailout. We need \na special fix, a special rule just for us.\n  Sure enough, that lobbying yielded results. By many press reports, \nPresident Obama got personally involved to ensure that a special rule \nwas issued by his administration. The draft version of it was issued \nconveniently just after Congress left town for the August recess and \ngot away from the scene of the crime. That draft rule is completely \nimproper, completely illegal, because it goes beyond the statute and is \ninconsistent with the statute, but it is a special exemption for \nCongress. It essentially does two things:\n  First, even though the ObamaCare statute explicitly says that every \nMember of Congress, all congressional official staff have to go to the \nexchange, the rule basically negates that in a way and says, Well, we \ndon't know what ``official staff'' means, so we are going to leave it \nup to each individual Member to decide which of their staff is official \nand which is not, who has to go to the exchange and who doesn't.\n  The statute doesn't say that. The statute is very clear: All \ncongressional official staff have to go to the exchange. There is no \ndiscretion to individual Members.\n  Then the second thing that this special rule, this special exemption \ndoes is even more egregious. It says, Oh, and by the way, whoever does \ngo to the exchange, whatever Members and whatever congressional staff \ndo go to the exchange, they get a huge taxpayer-funded subsidy that \nfollows them there. That is not in the statute. That is nowhere in \nObamaCare. That is nowhere in that Grassley provision as passed into \nlaw. In fact, there are other sections of ObamaCare that make it \ncrystal clear that employees who go to the exchange lose their previous \nsubsidy from their large employer that they may have enjoyed \npreviously. That is clear in the law, completely inconsistent with this \nillegal rule made up out of thin air.\n  So Washington is getting a special exemption, a special bailout, a \nspecial subsidy completely unavailable to other Americans. That is not \nright, and that is why I have an amendment. I tried to present it last \nweek, was blocked out by the majority leader. I am here again on the \nCR. It is important, it is necessary we vote, and we should, before \nOctober 1, when this illegal rule will otherwise go into effect.\n  My amendment is simple. It negates that illegal rule. It says, Yes, \nevery Member of Congress, all congressional staff. And, oh, by the way, \nother Washington policymakers--the President, the Vice President, all \nof their political appointees--have to go to the exchange with no \nspecial treatment, no special exemption, no special subsidy unavailable \nto other Americans. So if you are a lower paid staff member and you \nqualify by your income for a subsidy available to every other American \nwho goes to the exchange at that income level, fine. That is certainly \navailable. That is equal treatment. That is Washington being treated \nlike the rest of America, but no special exemption or bailout or \nsubsidy, only those available to all other Americans going to the \nexchange.\n  We need a vote on this provision. It is directly relevant to the CR. \nIt is directly relevant to this debate.\n  This illegal Obama administration rule will go into effect October 1 \nunless we act. That is why I demanded a timely vote last week. \nUnfortunately, it was blocked out by the majority leader. After \nthreatening and bullying did not work, he claimed he had no objection \nto the vote. But still he did not let it happen.\n  Here we are in the CR debate and that is why we need that debate and \nthat vote now. What the problem is, and it is clearly the plan of the \nmajority leader, it is clear this upcoming cloture vote would block all \nthat out again. The majority leader would get his select amendments to \ntake out of the House bill the provision that defunds ObamaCare but \nnobody else would get any other amendment. I would not get a vote on my \namendment. There are plenty of other relevant and germane amendments. \nWe would not have votes on those. That is the plan being laid out for \nthis week and that is what voting yes on cloture on the bill will \nenable. So I cannot do that.\n  I commend the Senator from Texas for helping lead this fight, helping \npoint out the dangers and the tragedies of ObamaCare, particularly for \nworking men and women and also for supporting the broader effort to \nmake sure, however America is treated, Washington should be treated \nexactly the same. That should be the first rule of democracy.\n  The Founders talked about that basic principle, Federalist Paper No. \n57 by Madison. He specifically talks about this basic principle: \nWhatever is good for America needs to be good for Washington. Whatever \nis applied to those who are ruled needs to be applied equally in full \nforce and in the same way to those who make up the rules. That is what \nthis specific part of this debate is all about.\n  I again thank the Senator from Texas for his leadership on this and \nthe general issue. I ask, does he think, now that that special \nexemption has come out since the Hoffa letter, would he guess Mr. Hoffa \nis more or less upset now that Washington has been protected but the \nworking Americans Mr. Hoffa represents are still in the dire straits \ndescribed in that letter?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for that very good \nquestion. I thank him also for his support of this effort, his vocal \nsupport, his support from day one. I thank him for appearing with us \nlast night, appearing with us today, standing together to defund \nObamaCare, standing together to oppose cloture because it would empower \nHarry Reid and the Democrats to fund ObamaCare with a partisan 51-vote, \nparty-line vote. It would shut out amendments to address and ameliorate \nthe harms that are coming from ObamaCare that are hurting hard-working \nAmericans.\n  As to the question the Senator from Louisiana asked, I certainly do \nnot want to put words in Mr. Hoffa's mouth. He is quite capable of \nspeaking for himself. But I cannot imagine, given the language of his \nletter, that the exemption for Congress would be in any way different \nfrom the exemption for big business. They are both exemptions for \npolitical friends of the administration. According to the language of \nhis letter, he expressed dismay that they and other political friends \nof the administration did not get an exemption.\n  I will note part of that letter is asking: Give us a special \nexemption too. But that did not happen. But I will make a prediction. \nIf the Senate doesn't act now, doesn't defund ObamaCare, if it doesn't \nstand and stop this, before President Obama leaves the White House he \nwill grant an exemption to those union bosses. It is the trifecta of \nthe privileged classes being excepted. I understand politically it was \nan inopportune time to grant that now. It would be lawless, it would be \ncontrary to law to grant an exemption to the union bosses but it is \nalso contrary to law to grant an exemption to big business and Members \nof Congress and that hasn't slowed the President down. If he is willing \nto disregard the law for them, there is no reason to think he would not \nbe willing to disregard the law for his union boss friends except for \nthe fact right in the middle of the defund debate it is not rocket \nscience that that would not be ideal politics.\n  The courage of the Senator from Louisiana in introducing his \namendment--he has endured vilification that has been beyond the pale \nand I appreciate his courage standing for the basic principle that \nCongress should be bound by the same rules as everyone\n\n[[Page S6828]]\n\nelse. The American people, millions of Americans, should not be put \nonto exchanges subject to pain that Members of Congress are not. We \nshould not operate under the principle one rule for thee, a different \none for me.\n  For all of you who say this fight is not winnable, I would like to \nshare a letter talking about fighting and winning unwinnable fights, \nbecause none of us can win this fight but the American people can.\n  Fans of Rush Limbaugh know that every year he reads something that \nhis father wrote about the true story of the price paid by the signers \nof the Declaration of Independence. I think it is fitting to read this \nmorning. It is called ``The Americans Who Risked Everything.''\n  ``Our Lives, Our Fortunes, Our Sacred Honor''\n\n       It was a glorious morning. The sun was shining and the wind \n     was from the southeast. Up especially early, a tall bony, \n     redheaded young Virginian found time to buy a new \n     thermometer, for which he paid three pounds, fifteen \n     shillings. He also bought gloves for Martha, his wife, who \n     was ill at home.\n       Thomas Jefferson arrived early at the statehouse. The \n     temperature was 72.5 degrees and the horseflies weren't \n     nearly so bad at that hour. It was a lovely room, very large, \n     with gleaming white walls. The chairs were comfortable. \n     Facing the single door were two brass fireplaces, but they \n     would not be used today.\n       The moment the door was shut, and it was always kept \n     locked, the room became an oven. The tall windows were shut, \n     so that loud quarreling voices could not be heard by \n     passersby. Small openings atop the windows allowed a slight \n     stir of air, and also a large number of horseflies. Jefferson \n     records that ``the horseflies were dexterous in finding \n     necks, and the silk of stockings was nothing to them.'' All \n     discussing was punctuated by the slap of hands on necks.\n       On the wall at the back, facing the president's desk, was a \n     panoply--consisting of a drum, swords, and banners seized \n     from Fort Ticonderoga the previous year. Ethan Allen and \n     Benedict Arnold had captured the place, shouting that they \n     were taking it ``in the name of the Great Jehovah and the \n     Continental Congress!''\n       Now Congress got to work, promptly taking up an emergency \n     measure about which there was discussion but no dissension. \n     ``Resolved: That an application be made to the Committee of \n     Safety of Pennsylvania for a supply of flints for the troops \n     at New York.''\n       Then Congress transformed itself into a committee of the \n     whole. The Declaration of Independence was read aloud once \n     more, and debate resumed. Though Jefferson was the best \n     writer of all of them, he had been somewhat verbose. Congress \n     hacked the excess away. They did a good job, as a side-by-\n     side comparison of the rough draft and the final text shows. \n     They cut the phrase ``by a self-assumed power.'' ``Climb'' \n     was replaced by ``must read,'' then ``must'' was eliminated, \n     then the whole sentence, and soon the whole paragraph was \n     cut. Jefferson groaned as they continued what he later called \n     ``their depredations.'' ``Inherent and inalienable rights'' \n     came out ``certain unalienable rights,'' and to this day no \n     one knows who suggested the elegant change.\n       A total of 86 alterations were made. Almost 500 words were \n     eliminated, leaving 1,337. At last, after three days of \n     wrangling, the document was put to a vote. Here in this hall \n     Patrick Henry had once thundered: ``I am no longer a \n     Virginian, sir, but an American.'' But today the loud, \n     sometimes bitter argument stilled, and without fanfare the \n     vote was taken from north to south by colonies, as was the \n     custom. On July 4, 1776, the Declaration of Independence \n     was adopted.\n       There were no trumpets blown. No one stood on his chair and \n     cheered. The afternoon was waning and Congress had no thought \n     of delaying the full calendar of routine business on its \n     hands. For several hours they worked on many other problems \n     before adjourning for the day.\n       Much To Lose\n       What kind of men were the 56 signers who adopted the \n     Declaration of Independence and who, by their signing, \n     committed an act of treason against the crown? To each of \n     you, the names Franklin, Adams, Hancock and Jefferson are \n     almost as familiar as household words. Most of us, however, \n     know nothing of the other signers. Who were they? What \n     happened to them?\n       I imagine that many of you are somewhat surprised at the \n     names not there: George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, \n     Patrick Henry. All were elsewhere.\n       Ben Franklin was the only really old man. Eighteen were \n     under 40; three were in their 20s. Of the 56 almost half--\n     24--were judges and lawyers. Eleven were merchants, nine were \n     landowners and farmers, and the remaining 12 were doctors, \n     ministers, and politicians. With only a few exceptions, such \n     as Samuel Adams of Massachusetts, these were men of \n     substantial property. All but two had families. The vast \n     majority were men of education and standing in their \n     communities. They had economic security as few men had in the \n     18th Century. Each had more to lose from revolution than he \n     had to gain by it. John Hancock, one of the richest men in \n     America, already had a price of 500 pounds on his head. He \n     signed in enormous letters so that his Majesty could now read \n     his name without glasses and could now double the reward. Ben \n     Franklin wryly noted: ``Indeed we must all hang together, \n     otherwise we shall most assuredly hang separately.'' Fat \n     Benjamin Harrison of Virginia told tiny Elbridge Gerry of \n     Massachusetts: ``With me it will all be over in a minute, but \n     you, you will be dancing on air an hour after I am gone.''\n       These men knew what they risked. The penalty for treason \n     was death by hanging. And remember, a great British fleet was \n     already at anchor in New York Harbor.\n       They were sober men. There were no dreamy-eyed \n     intellectuals or draft card burners here. They were far from \n     hot-eyed fanatics yammering for an explosion. They simply \n     asked for the status quo. It was change they resisted. It was \n     equality with the mother country they desired. It was \n     taxation with representation they sought. They were all \n     conservatives, yet they rebelled. It was principle, not \n     property, that had brought these men to Philadelphia. Two of \n     them became presidents of the United States. Seven of them \n     became state governors. One died in office as vice president \n     of the United States. Several would go on to be U.S. \n     Senators. One, the richest man in America, in 1828 founded \n     the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. One, a delegate from \n     Philadelphia, was the only real poet, musician and \n     philosopher of the signers. (It was he, Francis Hopkinson not \n     Betsy Ross who designed the United States flag.)\n       Richard Henry Lee, a delegate from Virginia, had introduced \n     the resolution to adopt the Declaration of Independence in \n     June of 1776. He was prophetic in his concluding remarks: \n     ``Why then sir, why do we longer delay? Why still deliberate? \n     Let this happy day give birth to an American Republic. Let \n     her arise not to devastate and to conquer but to reestablish \n     the reign of peace and law. ``The eyes of Europe are fixed \n     upon us. She demands of us a living example of freedom that \n     may exhibit a contrast in the felicity of the citizen to the \n     ever-increasing tyranny which desolates her polluted shores. \n     She invites us to prepare an asylum where the unhappy may \n     find solace, and the persecuted repost.\n       ``If we are not this day wanting in our duty, the names of \n     the American Legislatures of 1776 will be placed by posterity \n     at the side of all of those whose memory has been and ever \n     will be dear to virtuous men and good citizens.''\n       Though the resolution was formally adopted July 4, it was \n     not until July 8 that two of the states authorized their \n     delegates to sign, and it was not until August 2 that the \n     signers met at Philadelphia to actually put their names to \n     the Declaration.\n       William Ellery, delegate from Rhode Island, was curious to \n     see the signers' faces as they committed this supreme act of \n     personal courage. He saw some men sign quickly, ``but in no \n     face was he able to discern real fear.'' Stephan Hopkins, \n     Ellery's colleague from Rhode Island, was a man past 60. As \n     he signed with a shaking pen, he declared: ``My hand \n     trembles, but my heart does not.''\n       ``Most Glorious Service''\n       Even before the list was published, the British marked down \n     every member of Congress suspected of having put his name to \n     treason. All of them became the objects of vicious manhunts. \n     Some were taken. Some, like Jefferson, had narrow escapes. \n     All who had property or families near British strongholds \n     suffered.\n\n  Francis Lewis, New York delegate saw his home plundered--and his \nestates in what is now Harlem--completely destroyed by British \nSoldiers. Mrs. Lewis was captured and treated with great brutality. \nThough she was later exchanged for two British prisoners through the \nefforts of Congress, she died from the effects of her abuse.\n\n       William Floyd, another New York delegate, was able to \n     escape with his wife and children across Long Island Sound to \n     Connecticut, where they lived as refugees without income for \n     seven years. When they came home they found a devastated \n     ruin.\n       Philips Livingstone had all his great holdings in New York \n     confiscated and his family driven out of their home. \n     Livingstone died in 1778 still working in Congress for the \n     cause.\n       Louis Morris, the fourth New York delegate, saw all his \n     timber, crops, and livestock taken. For seven years he was \n     barred from his home and family.\n       John Hart of Trenton, New Jersey, risked his life to return \n     home to see his dying wife. Hessian soldiers rode after him, \n     and he escaped in the woods. While his wife lay on her \n     deathbed, the soldiers ruined his farm and wrecked his \n     homestead. Hart, 65, slept in caves and woods as he was \n     hunted across the countryside. When at long last, emaciated \n     by hardship, he was able to sneak home, he found his wife had \n     already been buried, and his 13 children taken away. He never \n     saw them again. He died a broken man in 1779, without ever \n     finding his family.\n       Dr. John Witherspoon, signer, was president of the College \n     of New Jersey, later called Princeton. The British occupied \n     the town of Princeton, and billeted troops in the college. \n     They trampled and burned the finest college library in the \n     country.\n       Judge Richard Stockton, another New Jersey delegate signer, \n     had rushed back to his estate in an effort to evacuate his \n     wife and children. The family found refuge with friends, but \n     a Tory sympathizer betrayed\n\n[[Page S6829]]\n\n     them. Judge Stockton was pulled from bed in the night and \n     brutally beaten by the arresting soldiers. Thrown into a \n     common jail, he was deliberately starved. Congress finally \n     arranged for Stockton's parole, but his health was ruined. \n     The judge was released as an invalid, when he could no longer \n     harm the British cause. He returned home to find his estate \n     looted and did not live to see the triumph of the Revolution. \n     His family was forced to live off charity.\n       Robert Morris, merchant prince of Philadelphia, delegate \n     and signer, met Washington's appeals and pleas for money year \n     after year. He made and raised arms and provisions which made \n     it possible for Washington to cross the Delaware at Trenton. \n     In the process he lost 150 ships at sea, bleeding his own \n     fortune and credit almost dry.\n       George Clymer, Pennsylvania signer, escaped with his family \n     from their home, but their property was completely destroyed \n     by the British in the Germantown and Brandywine campaigns.\n       Dr. Benjamin Rush, also from Pennsylvania, was forced to \n     flee to Maryland. As a heroic surgeon with the army, Rush had \n     several narrow escapes.\n       John Martin, a Tory in his views previous to the debate, \n     lived in a strongly loyalist area of Pennsylvania. When he \n     came out for independence, most of his neighbors and even \n     some of his relatives ostracized him. He was a sensitive and \n     troubled man, and many believed this action killed him. When \n     he died in 1777, his last words to his tormentors were: \n     ``Tell them that they will live to see the hour when they \n     shall acknowledge it [the signing] to have been the most \n     glorious service that I have ever rendered to my country.''\n       William Ellery, Rhode Island delegate, saw his property and \n     home burned to the ground.\n       Thomas Lynch, Jr., South Carolina delegate, had his health \n     broken from privation and exposures while serving as a \n     company commander in the military. His doctors ordered him to \n     seek a cure in the West Indies and on the voyage, he and his \n     young bride were drowned at sea.\n       Edward Rutledge, Arthur Middleton, and Thomas Heyward, Jr., \n     the other three South Carolina signers, were taken by the \n     British in the siege of Charleston. They were carried as \n     prisoners of war to St. Augustine, Florida, where they were \n     singled out for indignities. They were exchanged at the end \n     of the war, the British in the meantime having completely \n     devastated their large landholdings and estates.\n       Thomas Nelson, signer of Virginia, was at the front in \n     command of the Virginia military forces. With British General \n     Charles Cornwallis in Yorktown, fire from 70 heavy American \n     guns began to destroy Yorktown piece by piece. Lord \n     Cornwallis and his staff moved their headquarters into \n     Nelson's palatial home. While American cannonballs were \n     making a shambles of the town, the house of Governor Nelson \n     remained untouched. Nelson turned in rage to the American \n     gunners and asked, ``Why do you spare my home?'' They \n     replied, ``Sir, out of respect to you.'' Nelson cried, ``Give \n     me the cannon!'' and fired on his magnificent home himself, \n     smashing it to bits. But Nelson's sacrifice was not quite \n     over. He had raised $2 million for the Revolutionary cause by \n     pledging his own estates. When the loans came due, a newer \n     peacetime Congress refused to honor them, and Nelson's \n     property was forfeited. He was never reimbursed. He died, \n     impoverished, a few years later at the age of 50.\n       Lives, Fortunes, Honor\n       Of those 56 who signed the Declaration of Independence, \n     nine died of wounds or hardships during the war. Five were \n     captured and imprisoned, in each case with brutal treatment. \n     Several lost wives, sons or entire families. One lost his 13 \n     children. Two wives were brutally treated. All were at one \n     time or another the victims of manhunts and driven from their \n     homes. Twelve signers had their homes completely burned. \n     Seventeen lost everything they owned. Yet not one defected or \n     went back on his pledged word. Their honor, and the nation \n     they sacrificed so much to create is still intact.\n       And, finally, there is the New Jersey signer, Abraham \n     Clark.\n       He gave two sons to the officer corps in the Revolutionary \n     Army. They were captured and sent to that infamous British \n     prison hulk afloat in New York Harbor known as the hell ship \n     Jersey, where 11,000 American captives were to die. The \n     younger Clarks were treated with a special brutality because \n     of their father. One was put in solitary and given no food. \n     With the end almost in sight, with the war almost won, no one \n     could have blamed Abraham Clark for acceding to the British \n     request when they offered him his sons' lives if he would \n     recant and come out for the King and Parliament. The utter \n     despair in this man's heart, the anguish in his very soul, \n     must reach out to each one of us down through 200 years with \n     his answer: ``No.''\n       The 56 signers of the Declaration Of Independence proved by \n     their every deed that they made no idle boast when they \n     composed the most magnificent curtain line in history. ``And \n     for the support of this Declaration with a firm reliance on \n     the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge to \n     each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.''\n       My friends, I know you have a copy of the Declaration of \n     Independence somewhere around the house--in an old history \n     book (newer ones may well omit it), an encyclopedia, or one \n     of those artificially aged ``parchments'' we all got in \n     school years ago. I suggest that each of you take the time \n     this month to read through the text of the Declaration, one \n     of the most noble and beautiful political documents in human \n     history.\n       There is no more profound sentence than this: ``We hold \n     these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created \n     equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain \n     unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and \n     the pursuit of Happiness . . . ''\n       These are far more than mere poetic words. The underlying \n     ideas that infuse every sentence of this treatise have \n     sustained this nation for more than two centuries. They were \n     forged in the crucible of great sacrifice. They are living \n     words that spring from and satisfy the deepest cries for \n     liberty in the human spirit. ``Sacred honor'' isn't a phrase \n     we use much these days, but every American life is touched by \n     the bounty of this, the Founders' legacy. It is freedom, \n     tested by blood, and watered with tears.\n\n  That is the story of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence. \nIt is the story of our shared legacy.\n  I will make this note to my friends on the Republican side of the \naisle and the Democratic side of the aisle, as Benjamin Franklin wryly \nnoted: Indeed, we must all hang together, otherwise we should most \nassuredly hang separately.\n  That is the message all of us should think about. Are we going to \nhang separately because we disregarded the will and the view of our \nconstituents and have given in to the Washington establishment or are \nwe going to stand together and say: Let's break the broken pattern of \nWashington, of empty showboats, of fixed procedures, and ignoring the \nwill of the people? Instead, let's come together--much like James \nHoffa, president of the Teamsters, has--and say: We will remain silent \nno longer. We cannot ignore the suffering of the millions of Americans \nwho have lost their jobs, cannot find jobs, have had their hours \nforcibly reduced to 29 hours a week, facing skyrocketing health \ninsurance premiums, and are losing or are at risk of losing their \nhealth insurance.\n  Our constituents, the American people, are hurting and suffering, and \nit is the role of Congress to answer their call. All of us must listen \nto the people. Together we must make DC listen.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Would the Senator from Texas yield for a question and a \ncomment without yielding the floor?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield to my friend from Florida for a \nquestion without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. RUBIO. First of all, that is a very inspirational letter that the \nSenator read, and it reminds us of our shared legacy as a nation. It \nalso makes me appreciate the freedoms we have in this country, and the \nopportunity to stand here today and have this vibrant debate. I am \nreminded that around the world people don't have this opportunity. I am \nreminded that around the world people are still losing not just their \nfreedom but their lives for the purposes of speaking out.\n  I will confess that I hope we can avoid the hanging part of the \nsituation the Senator have outlined, and I am sure we will because we \nare so blessed to live in this Republic.\n  I do something every week where I take letters from my constituents, \nread them in a video on the air, and then I answer them. I call it the \nconstituent mailbox. I have been doing that since I have gotten here. \nIt is important because it allows us to answer the real questions of \nreal people, and their comments.\n  They are not always nice letters, by the way, but we address those \ntoo because that is important. One of the benefits we have with the \nadvances in technology is that the people we serve and work for can now \nreach us directly and speak to us in real time as opposed to the days \ngone by where people had trouble accessing their elected officials.\n  So, with Senator Cruz's indulgence--as you have given me time but \nhave not yielded the floor--I would like to read a few e-mails I have \nreceived.\n  The first e-mail is from someone named Luis. He lives in Cutler Bay, \nFL, which is south Florida down where I live in Miami-Dade County.\n  Here is what he writes:\n\n       There are so many companies with a large number of part \n     time workers. The latest company Trader Joes in which I have \n     a family member will lose her part time health benefits \n     because of ObamaCare. She works as a substitute English \n     teacher in New Jersey and the job does not offer any health \n     benefits to part time substitute teachers. She has to be a \n     full time teacher in order to receive\n\n[[Page S6830]]\n\n     health benefits. She decided not to leave her job at Trader \n     Joes because they offered her health benefits as a part time \n     worker. Put yourselves as present grandparents and parents in \n     her own situation what a hard pill to swallow. What is she \n     supposed to do now?\n\n  This letter talks about a family member of hers who is a part-time \nteacher in New Jersey, but also works at a restaurant called Trader \nJoe's. The reason why she works there is for the health benefits that \nshe is offered, but now she is losing that. Unfortunately she is not \nalone.\n  This is an article from Bloomberg from September 19 of this year. It \nhighlights all these upheavals that are going on by private employers. \nUPS is dropping coverage for employed spouses; IBM is reworking its \nretiree benefits. Let me explain that one for a second. They are going \nto send their retirees to the private exchanges. They said the move was \nmade to help keep premiums low for the rest of their workers that are \nimpacted by ObamaCare.\n\n  Walgreens, the largest U.S. drugstore chain, has told 160,000 workers \nthat they must buy insurance through a private exchange rather than \ncontinuing to have it offered by the company, by Walgreens. They are \nnot alone. Stanford University researchers voiced concerns in a study \nlast week. They wrote that ``the rising premiums can drive workers from \nemployer plans to coverage under the health law, boosting costs for the \ngovernment by as much as $6.7 billion.''\n  There are other examples of businesses that are doing this. I talked \nabout Trader Joe's. That is a closely-held supermarket chain. I said a \nrestaurant. I apologize, it is a supermarket chain. It said it would \nend health benefits next year for part-time workers.\n  This is the real disruption in real lives. So one thing is to stand \nhere and have people debate about the theory of ObamaCare and what \ngreat things it might do for some people, according to the supporters \nof this law. Another thing is to put a human face on the story. We \nalready know, just from this e-mail alone, of one person in America, \nliving in New Jersey, a part-time teacher and a worker at Trader Joe's \nwho has lost her benefits and will now be thrown into this uncertain \nworld of exchanges, because of this law, because of ObamaCare.\n  Here is another e-mail. This one comes from Kissimmee, FL. That is in \ncentral Florida. My colleagues may know that as the home of Walt Disney \nWorld. This is from Patty. She writes:\n\n       As mentioned in your letter--\n\n  She is referring to a letter I sent to Secretary Sebelius--\n\n     urging her to visit Sea World to discuss the impact of \n     ObamaCare that will be enacted in the near future, I--\n\n  Patty, the writer of this letter--\n\n     am a part-time employee at Valencia College in Orlando.\n\n  Valencia is a community college. By the way, I am a big fan of \ncommunity colleges. They are the backbone of retraining, but also the \nonly access point available to many of our people. So if you are out \nthere trying to work to support your family--let's say you are a single \nparent trying to raise three kids and you have to work during the day--\ncommunity college is also one of the few places where you can get an \nadvanced degree and the skills you need for a better job. One of the \nbest ways to improve your pay and your economic security is to get an \neducation. Community colleges are an access point for people all over \nthe country. I am a huge fan of community colleges. We have great ones \nin Florida. She is a part-time employee of Valencia College in Orlando. \nShe continues:\n\n       My hours too have been cut from 29 hours to 25 hours to \n     avoid any negative impact of the Obamacare health care act. I \n     have numerous e-mails from my supervisor and human resources \n     stating that my hours are being cut specifically because of \n     this.\n       I have lost the hours that made it possible to live in a \n     severely reduced income and know that I will never get those \n     hours back as positions have been created by the extra hours, \n     so we have more people working and earning less. I am not \n     really asking anything; I'd just like you to know what this \n     government is doing to my ability to survive.\n\n  This is not an e-mail from a millionaire or a billionaire. This is \nnot an e-mail from someone who has made it and is making a ton of cash. \nThis is an e-mail from a part-time worker at a community college with \ndesperation that comes out in the e-mail: a part-time worker losing \nhours. Did we know what those hours mean, 4 hours a week of a pay cut \nto someone? She writes about it. She says: ``I would just like you to \nknow what this government is doing to my ability to survive.''\n  Do we want to know why a growing number of Americans are starting to \ndoubt whether the American dream is still alive? Read this e-mail.\n  Unfortunately, we are hearing stories about this all the time. Here \nis an article from CNBC published Monday, September 23, this week. It \nleads off with this line:\n\n       With open enrollment for Obamacare about to begin, small- \n     and medium-sized businesses are not hiring because of the \n     uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the new law, \n     the CEO of the Nation's fifth-largest staffing company said \n     on Monday.\n       Companies are really not interested in hiring full-time \n     people. ``That's really the issue with Obamacare,'' Express \n     Employment Professionals boss Bob Funk told CNBC's ``Squawk \n     Box'' on Monday.\n\n  By the way, Mr. Funk is the former chairman of the Kansas City \nFederal Reserve.\n  Now, someone--the former auto czar at Treasury, Mr. Steve Rattner--\ndisputes his assertions. He says:\n\n       I don't think with the approach of Obamacare you see in the \n     numbers people suddenly stopping hiring.\n\n  Mr. Funk argues--and he counters very persuasively--he says:\n\n       We're out there on Main Street and Obamacare is affecting \n     the job hiring picture. Whether it's in the numbers or not, \n     it is affecting small and medium-sized businesses. They're \n     not going to hire until they know what their costs are going \n     to be.\n       We don't know what the rules are going to be, but they \n     haven't written half of the rules . . . and it is affecting \n     businesses out there. That's why our industry is growing \n     quite rapidly.\n\n  So here we have a person tied to the government basically saying \nthese guys don't know what they are talking about; the numbers don't \nbear this out. And then we have someone who reminds them that he is on \nthe front lines. That is what Mr. Funk is doing. He is very clear. He \nsays, ``We are out there on Main Street and Obamacare is affecting the \njob hiring picture.''\n  Listen again to what Patty from Kissimmee says in her e-mail. This is \nwhat she says:\n\n       I have lost the hours that made it possible to live in a \n     severely reduced income and know that I will never get those \n     hours back as positions have been created by the extra hours.\n\n  Do my colleagues know what she is saying? She is saying what they \nhave done is reduced her hours and then just hired additional people to \nmake it up. They have created another part-time job to make up for it. \nThis is the impact of ObamaCare.\n  By the way, with all due respect to my colleagues, I will tell my \ncolleagues right now in case people are wondering, every single member \nof the Republican Conference here in the Senate is prepared to repeal \nObamaCare right now. The debate we are having in the party is about the \ntactics, the right way to do it. The one thing I would say, however, is \nwhat the last day has provided us, which is an extraordinary \nopportunity to tell these stories.\n  There is more. Here is an e-mail from Bill in Panama City, FL. That \nis in northwest Florida, a great place for spring break if you are in \ncollege and can afford to go. Maybe you lost your part-time job so now \nyou can't. Bill says:\n\n       This is just a note to let you know that you can include me \n     as another one of your constituents who has seen my health \n     care cost go up by over $200 a month. I also just learned \n     that my girlfriend, who works for a major corporation, is \n     losing her health care after she retires because of \n     Obamacare. I hope you will continue your fight to defund this \n     disastrous bill.\n\n  I wish, Bill, that--I obviously feel terrible for the situation you \nare facing and certainly for the situation your girlfriend is facing. \nUnfortunately, you are not alone.\n  Let me read something to my colleagues that Jim Angle from Fox News \npublished on the 24th of this month, I guess that was yesterday, right? \nHe tells the story of Andy and Amy Mangione of Louisville, KY, and of \ntheir two boys. He leads off by saying:\n\n       These are just the kind of people who should be helped by \n     ObamaCare, but they recently got a nasty surprise in the \n     mail.\n       ``When I saw the letter when I came home from work,'' Andy \n     said, describing the large red wording on the envelope from \n     his insurance carrier, (it said) ``your action required,\n\n[[Page S6831]]\n\n     benefit changes, act now.'' Of course I opened it \n     immediately.\n\n  Guess what that letter that was in the mail said? It had stunning \nnews. His insurance--the insurance for his family, his two boys, his \nwife and him--insurance they were buying on the individual \nmarketplace--was going to almost triple next year, from $333 a month to \n$965 a month. In the letter, the carrier made it clear that the \nincrease was in order to be compliant with the new health care law.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       This isn't a Cadillac plan, this isn't even a silver plan. \n     This is a high deductible plan where I'm assuming a lot of \n     risk for my health insurance for my family. And nothing has \n     changed, our boys are healthy--they're young--my wife is \n     healthy, I'm healthy. Nothing in our history has changed to \n     warrant a tripling of our premiums.\n\n  His wife adds:\n\n       Well, I'm the one that does the budget. Eventually, I've \n     got that coming down the pike that I gotta figure out what \n     we're gonna do, to afford a $1,000 a month premium.\n       The insurance carrier, Humana, declined to comment, but the \n     notice to the Mangiones carried this paragraph: If your \n     policy premium increased, you should know that this isn't \n     unique to Humana--premium increases generally will occur \n     industry-wide.\n       Increases aren't based on your individual claims or changes \n     in your health status.\n\n  It continued:\n\n       Many other factors go into your premium, including: ACA \n     compliance--\n\nwhich is ObamaCare--\n\n       Including the addition of new essential health benefits.\n\n  Robert Zirkelbach, who is the spokesman for American Health Insurance \nPlans, which represents insurers, explains that:\n\n       For people who currently choose to purchase a high-\n     deductible, low-premium policy that is more affordable for \n     them, they are now being required to add all of these new \n     benefits to their policy. That,\n\n  He says,\n\n     is going to add to the cost of their health insurance \n     premiums.\n\n  This is a real life story. It is not a letter from a millionaire or \nbillionaire, and this is not the story of a millionaire or billionaire; \nthis is the story of a husband and wife and two children who are buying \ninsurance as individuals from the individual marketplace who will now \nhave to cobble together another $700 a month and they have no idea how \nthey are going to do it. This is the real story of ObamaCare. Here it \nis. These are the people we are supposed to be helping. These are the \npeople who--when they passed this thing, they went around telling \npeople, We are going to help you get insurance. These are the people it \nis supposed to be helping, but look what it is doing. I wish that was \nthe only example, but I have an e-mail here from Florida that says \nthat, too. Here is another one from Barbara in Palm Coast, FL:\n\n       I am a master's level RN who up until last week held a good \n     job with good benefits. Due to the many new restrictions on \n     employers, I have been reduced to part-time without benefits \n     at age 64.\n\n  It is starting to sound like a broken record.\n\n       Many healthcare workers are being cut in hours due to \n     Obamacare. My company tried to offer me an insurance plan \n     that I could afford to purchase, but I received a letter \n     stating that it didn't meet the standards of the Affordable \n     Care Act, and so I had until January 1st to purchase more \n     costly insurance or have consequences.\n\n  She writes:\n\n       This is a terrible, despicable law--\n\n  And I agree--\n\n     that has damaged many more people than just myself.\n\n  Then she closes with this extremely powerful sentence. This is not \nfrom a millionaire or a billionaire, from the infamous 1-percenters \nthat we hear these protesters against. This is from a nurse in Florida, \nand here is what she finishes with:\n\n       I just want to live in a free country where I can work hard \n     and support myself. Repeal Obamacare.\n\n  Well, one may ask themselves: Is this really happening? People are \nlosing access to their coverage? Let me read something from a \nconservative, rightwing newspaper, ``The New York Times,'' dated \nSeptember 22, 2013:\n\n       Federal officials often say that health insurance will cost \n     consumers less than expected under President Obama's health \n     care law. But they rarely mention one big reason: Many \n     insurers are significantly limiting the choices of doctors \n     and hospitals available to consumers.\n\n  One more impact of ObamaCare.\n\n       . . . They have created smaller networks of doctors and \n     hospitals than are typically found in the commercial \n     insurance plans.\n\n  In a new study, the Health Research Institute of \nPricewaterhouseCoopers, the consulting company, says that ``insurers \npassed over major medical centers'' when selecting providers in \nCalifornia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee, among other \nstates.\n\n       In New Hampshire, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, a unit \n     of WellPoint, one of the Nation's largest insurers, has \n     touched off a furor by excluding 10 of the state's 26 \n     hospitals from the health plans that it will sell through the \n     insurance exchange.\n       Anthem is the only commercial carrier offering health plans \n     in the New Hampshire exchange.\n\n  What does this mean? Let me tell my colleagues what it means. \nObamaCare says if you can't find insurance, we are going to set up \nthese government exchanges. Theoretically, that is not a terrible idea. \nYou go online, you shop between different companies, they compete \nagainst each other, you find a price that works for you, you find \ncoverage that works for you, and that is where you are going to be \nrequired to go. That is where the people who got cut off from Walgreens \ninsurance plans have to go now. It is where a bunch of other people \nhave to go.\n  What are these companies doing? There are a couple of things \nhappening. First, in States such as New Hampshire, only one insurance \ncompany applies. There is no choice. There is no competition. The \nexchange is one company: Anthem.\n  No. 2, what are these companies doing in order to offer these plans? \nThey are basically narrowing the doctors and the hospitals that will \nsee you. One may say, at least I get to go to a hospital or a doctor. \nLet me tell my colleagues where the problem is. Remember what they said \nwhen this passed? If you have health insurance and you like it, if you \nhave a doctor and you are happy with that doctor, you can keep it? Not \nif you are on the exchange. If they are narrowing the number of people, \nthe number of doctors and providers, that means chances are that you \nwill no longer be able to keep going to the same doctor and the same \nhospital you were going to before.\n  So now let's work that out. Let's walk through this for a second. Put \nyourself in the position of this nurse who wrote to us. Let's say you \nare chronically ill. Let's say your child has asthma or some other \ncondition. Let's say you have four healthy kids but you have to take \nthem to the doctor at least once a year, right? You love the doctor you \ngo to. They know your family and your history. When you have a problem \nyou can call them on the phone at 2 in the morning and you get a call \nright back, avoiding emergency room visits, by the way; you can get \nyour doctor on the phone. Now you wake up and all of a sudden your \ncompany comes to you and says the insurance plan you are on right now, \nwe are not offering it anymore, go get it on the exchange.\n  So you go over to the exchange and you find two things: No. 1, it is \nmore expensive, and, No. 2, your doctor ain't on the plan. That is a \nbroken promise. That is specifically what they said this law would not \ndo, and that is what it is doing.\n  This is the real-life story of what is happening. You want to know \nwhy there is passion about this issue? You want to know why every \nRepublican Member of the Senate wants to repeal this thing? You want to \nknow why privately some Democrats wish it would go away? Because of \nthis. This is whom we are fighting for. This is not just a fight \nagainst a bad law. This is a fight on behalf of people across this \ncountry who are going to get hurt by this.\n  By the way, I have no idea--these people who have written me or \nothers who are suffering, I do not know whom they voted for in the last \nelection. It does not matter. I do not know if they ever voted for me \nin 2010. I do not know if they supported the law when it first came \nout. But I know they are being hurt by this, and I know they are being \nhurt by this in ways that will hurt all of us, that will hurt every \nsingle one of us.\n  I talked about it earlier this morning. I repeat it today: There is \nnothing more important than preserving, reclaiming, and restoring the \nAmerican dream. It is the essence of what makes us special as a \ncountry. It separates us from the world.\n\n[[Page S6832]]\n\n  What is the American dream? It is pretty straightforward. This is a \ncountry where if you work hard and you sacrifice, you should be able to \nget ahead and earn a better life for yourself and for your family. Does \nthis sound like the story of a law that is making it easier for people \nto get ahead? Does being moved from full-time to part-time work make it \neasier to get ahead? Of course not. Does losing a doctor whom you are \nhappy with make it easier for you to get ahead? Of course not. Does the \nfact that businesses are not hiring make it easier to get ahead because \nthey are afraid of ObamaCare? Does it make it easier to get ahead? Of \ncourse not. Does having your hours reduced from 29 to 26--or whatever \nthe figure was I read a moment ago--does that make it easier to get \nahead? Of course not.\n  If for no other reason, this law needs to be repealed because of the \nimpact it is having on the American dream. I will reiterate what I have \nsaid time and again on this floor and here as part of this process: You \nlose the American dream, you lose the country. What you have then--what \nyou have then--is just another rich and powerful country but no longer \nan exceptional one.\n  The American dream is at the cornerstone of what makes us different \nand special, and it is being threatened by this. That is why I feel so \npassionately that we must do everything we can--everything we can--to \ncall attention to what this is doing and try to change it.\n  I think if nothing else, Senator, the great service of these last--\nwhat is it now? 19 hours, as your tie continues to loosen--if nothing \nelse, I think people today across this country know more about this law \nand its impacts than they did 1 day ago. If nothing else, the people in \nthis country are now increasingly aware of all the implications of this \nlaw on their lives, on their dreams, on their hopes, and on their \nfamilies.\n  I believe this is just the beginning, and I hope we can prevent these \nharmful effects from happening. But it does not sound like it. It \nsounds like there are still people here who are willing to shut down \nthe government unless this thing is fully funded, unless we continue to \npour your hard-earned taxpayer dollars. The irony of it is, for Luis in \nCutler Bay, for Patty in Kissimmee, for Bill in Panama City, for \nBarbara in Palm Coast, FL, for all the people who were cited in these \narticles, for the Mangione family in Louisville, KY, guess whose money \nis paying for this disaster. Yours. Your taxpayer dollars are paying \nfor this catastrophe because of the stubbornness of saying: This is our \nlaw, and we are going to go through with it, no matter all these \nanecdotal things that are coming out.\n  By the way, the only way you can get relief from the negative impacts \nof this law is if you can afford to hire a lobbyist to come up here and \nget you a waiver. The only way you can avoid some of the disastrous \nimpacts of this law is if you can somehow figure out a way to influence \nthis administration to write the rules in a way that benefits you.\n  That is wrong. That is wrong. I hope we will do something about this. \nI think the last 19-some-odd hours have been a huge step in that \ndirection.\n  I guess my question to Senator Cruz would be: I am sure he is getting \nletters such as these from Texas and across the country given the \nevents of the last day. This is what this is all about, isn't it? This \nis not a fight just against a law; this is a fight on behalf of the \npeople who are being hurt by it in the most fundamental way possible. \nIt is hurting their hopes and dreams they have for themselves, for \ntheir families. It is undermining the American dream. Is that not what \nthis is all about?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the junior Senator from Florida, and I would note \nthat is precisely what this is about. This is a fight for the millions \nof men and women who are facing a stagnant economy, who are facing jobs \nthat are drying up or disappearing altogether, who are finding \nthemselves being forcibly put in part-time work, being forced to work \n29 hours a week or less, who are finding their health insurance \npremiums skyrocketing, and who are being threatened or facing already \ntheir health insurance being taken away. All of these are the very real \nconsequences of ObamaCare right now for millions of Americans.\n  Listen, there are people in this body who in good faith 3\\1/2\\ years \nago could have believed this was a good idea, it might work. I did not \nthink it at the time, but I understand that people in this body did.\n  At this point, with all the evidence, I would suggest that case can \nno longer be made, that the evidence is abundantly clear. It is why the \nunions are jumping ship. It is why Members of Congress have asked for \nan exemption. It is why it is now abundantly clear that this train \nwreck, this nightmare, is hurting Americans all over this country.\n  I will note a couple of things. First of all, I note that my \nassistant majority leader is on the floor, and I would make a request \nthat either--I do not know if the assistant majority leader is in a \nposition to speak for the majority leader or, if he is not, I would \nmake a request, if the majority leader is monitoring this proceeding, \nthat he come to the floor because I would like to promulgate a series \nof unanimous consent requests. I do not want to surprise the majority \nleader or the assistant majority leader, so I would like the \nopportunity to explain those requests before promulgating them, to give \nDemocratic Party leadership an opportunity to think about it, to spend \na little bit of time contemplating it, to make a decision whether they \nwould consent.\n\n  So I would make a request, unless the assistant majority leader is \nprepared to speak for the majority leader, that I would ask that the \nmajority leader, if he can--I know his schedule is certainly very \nbusy--but I would ask if he can come to the floor so I may lay out the \nunanimous consent requests that I would like to promulgate.\n  I would also note that for some time Senator Grassley from Iowa has \nbeen waiting, and he has requested time to raise a question. So if \nSenator Grassley at this point would like to ask a question----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a dialog with \nthe Senator from Texas without jeopardizing his control of the floor, \nif I could have consent for that purpose.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CRUZ. On the condition that it does not jeopardize in any way my \nfull control of the floor, I am amenable to that request.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, I do not come in the place of the majority leader. \nHe will speak for himself. We do not know what the Senator's unanimous \nconsent requests might be. If the Senator would articulate it, describe \nit, I am sure we will take it under consideration, as we do with any \nrequest from any Senator. But this comes as a surprise at this moment, \nas the Senator can understand.\n  I just wished to come to the floor and continue the dialog we started \nlast night. After listening to my friend and colleague Senator Rubio \ndescribe a situation, I wanted to ask the Senator from Texas, if I \ncould, a question about the situation he described.\n  Senator Rubio talked about the insurance exchanges and the insurance \nmarketplaces and the fact that some of the lowest cost health insurance \nplans that are being offered have limitations as to doctors and \nhospitals that a person can use under those low-cost plans.\n  I would ask the Senator from Texas--I talked to him last night about \nJudy, who is a housekeeper at a motel in southern Illinois. She is 62 \nyears of age. She has worked her entire life, has never had health \ninsurance one day in her life--not once--never had it offered by an \nemployer, never could afford it, and now will be able to have health \ninsurance for the first time in her life, and she qualifies under \nMedicaid in the State of Illinois. She will not pay for it. It is going \nto be coverage. In her case, even a limitation on doctors and hospitals \nis a dramatic improvement over no doctor, no hospital, and relying on \nemergency rooms for her diabetes.\n  So I would ask the Senator from Texas, try to put yourself in the \nshoes of this woman who has worked her entire life. If you are being \ntold you have a limitation on doctors and hospitals you can use, but \nyou have health insurance, isn't that a dramatic improvement over a \nlifetime of no health insurance?\n  That is what ObamaCare is going to offer to her for the first time in \nher life. To say that we should not give her that opportunity is akin \nto someone\n\n[[Page S6833]]\n\nsaying: If you can't fly first class, you can't get on the airplane. \nListen, a lot of people would be glad to sit back in economy if they \ncould just make the trip that the Senator and I can make because we are \nblessed with health insurance.\n  I would say to the Senator, as you condemn ObamaCare, I go back to \nthe question I asked you last night: Judy, 62 years old, a lifetime of \nwork, diabetes, first chance to get health insurance--do you want to \nabolish the ObamaCare program that will give Judy that first chance?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Illinois for that question, and I \nwould respond threefold.\n  No. 1, for Judy, as the Senator describes her circumstances, I would \ncertainly support health care reform that increases competition and \nincreases free market alternatives that lower the rate of health \ninsurance that is available to people by allowing interstate \ncompetition, creating a national marketplace. But, in my view, any \nhealth care reform should empower individuals and patients to make \nhealth care decisions in consultation with their physicians--not having \na government bureaucrat get in between them and their doctor.\n  If I may finish the remainder of my points, concomitantly, the \nSenator has told the story of Judy, and I do think we should have \nreforms to address her circumstance, but over the course of the last \nmany hours we have read scores, if not hundreds, of stories that are a \nsmall representation of the thousands or millions of people who are \nlosing or are in jeopardy of losing their health insurance right now. \nThey have to be balanced in this equation as well.\n  ObamaCare is causing people all over this country to lose their \nhealth insurance or be at risk of losing their health insurance, and I \nam sure if I were to promulgate the question to the Senator from \nIllinois: Do you want all of these people who are losing their health \ninsurance to lose their health insurance--all of the names I read--I am \nsure the Senator would say no. But to date, no one on the Democratic \nside of the aisle has proposed any way to fix that.\n  Let me make a second point, and then I am going to have a third \npoint. Then, if the Senator would care for another question, I am happy \nto do my best to respond.\n  The second point: The Senator from Illinois made a reference to Judy \nnot needing to be in first class but being content to be in coach. I \nthink that analogy is a powerful one, but what it highlights is the \nspecial exemption that has been put in place for Members of Congress. \nBecause President Obama has put an exemption in place for Members of \nCongress that says: Members of Congress will fly first class, to use \nthe Senator's airline analogy, but average Americans who are being \nforced onto exchanges, where their employers cannot subsidize their \npremiums, are not even flying coach. They are being put in the baggage \ndepartment.\n  I will say I agree with the intent and the spirit of Senator \nGrassley's amendment to ObamaCare that was adopted, that is part of the \nlaw that the President is disregarding, which is that if we are going \nto force millions of people to lose their health insurance, be forced \ninto these exchanges, then we should have skin in the game. Congress \nshould not be treated any better than the millions of Americans we are \nforcing onto the exchanges.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Let me make my third point, and then I am happy to yield at \nthat point for a question.\n  The third point is twice I have read in the course of this debate the \nletter from Mr. Hoffa, the head of the Teamsters.\n  I assume the Senator from Illinois has read that letter. In fact, I \nexpect the Senator from Illinois has had direct conversations with the \nauthor of that letter. I do not know that.\n  I would ask the Senator from Illinois, No. 1, has he read that \nletter; No. 2, does he think Mr. Hoffa is telling the truth; and No. 3, \nin particular, does he agree with the following paragraph?\n\n       On behalf of the millions of working men and women we \n     represent and the families they support, we can no longer \n     stand silent in the face of elements of the Affordable Care \n     Act that will destroy the very health and wellbeing of our \n     members along with millions of other hardworking Americans.\n\n  So my question is, does the Senator believe Mr. Hoffa is telling the \ntruth when he says that? If so, does the Democratic majority in this \nbody have any plans, any proposals, any amendments to fix that problem \nfor what Mr. Hoffa describes as ``millions of working men and women'' \nwhose health care will be--the word he uses--destroyed.\n  I am happy to hear the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Texas for this dialog. First \nclass health care. Let me tell you who has first-class health care. The \nSenator from Texas has first-class health care. The Senator from \nIllinois has first-class health care. You see, Members of Congress, \nMembers of the Senate and the House, under the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program, have the best health insurance in America. We fly \nfirst class. Our employer, the Federal Government, as it does for every \nother employee, pays 72 percent of the monthly premium. Some 150 \nmillion Americans have that benefit where an employer pays some share \nof it. Ours pays 72 percent. We are lucky. We are fortunate. So are our \nfamilies and so are our staff.\n  But what the Senator is saying in abolishing ObamaCare, you not only \nwant to fly first class, you do not want other people to get on the \nplane. Fifty million Americans have no health insurance. You want to \nabolish the opportunity through the marketplace for them to buy \naffordable health insurance for the first time in their lives for many \npeople. That is what it comes down to.\n  Don't say you want Members of Congress treated like everybody else if \nyou are currently under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. \nMay I ask Senator Cruz, are you currently--you and your family--covered \nby the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which includes a 72-\npercent employer contribution from the Federal Government for your \nfamily's health care protection?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I appreciate the Senator's question, but I will answer the \nSenator's question when the Senator first answers the three questions I \nasked him, none of which the Senator has chosen to answer, namely: Have \nyou read Mr. Hoffa's letter? Do you agree with that paragraph? Do you \nthink he is telling the truth? What, if anything, does the Democratic \nmajority purport to do about millions of working men and women whose \nhealth care, according to Mr. Hoffa, is being destroyed?\n  I would note that the Senator from Illinois made an allegation \nimpugning my motive, saying that I wanted 50 million people to be \ndenied health care. Let me be very clear. That statement is \ncategorically false. I want a competitive marketplace where health care \nis accessible, it is affordable, where it is purchased across States \nlines, where it is personal, where it is portable, and where people \nhave jobs so they can get health insurance. ObamaCare is what is \ndenying health insurance to millions of Americans. If you do not take \nmy word for it, I assume you do not contend that Mr. Hoffa is being \nless than truthful?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to respond to that. If this were a \ncourtroom--and you are an attorney, and I once practiced law myself--I \nwould say: Your Honor, the witness refused to answer the question about \nhis very own health insurance policy.\n  Now let me address the issue about Mr. Hoffa. I have been approached \nby many labor unions. Some of them have Taft-Hartley plans, some of \nthem have trust fund plans, some have multistate plans. They need \nprovisions made in the ObamaCare law to deal with their specific \ncircumstances.\n  Under the ordinary course of legislative and congressional business, \nover the last 3 years we would have addressed these anomalies in the \nObamaCare program. Sadly, we cannot get anyone to come to the table \nfrom the Senator's political party. Now 42 or 43 times the House \nRepublicans have voted to abolish ObamaCare. Not once have they \nproposed sitting down to work out any differences, work out any \nproblems within the law. I am prepared to do that. I have told the \nlabor unions, including Mr. Hoffa, the same. I know the administration \nfeels the same. But, unfortunately, those who are opposed to this plan \nwant it to descend into chaos. They want as much confusion,\n\n[[Page S6834]]\n\nas many problems as possible. They do not want to work to cover the 50 \nmillion uninsured in America.\n  What the Senator just described and said he could sign up for, \nfrankly, is ObamaCare. We are talking about a marketplace. Do you know \nhow many companies will be offering health insurance in the State of \nTexas under the ObamaCare plan? Let me make sure I get this correct. My \nunderstanding is that at least 54 plans are going to be offered in the \nState of Texas--54. There will be choice and a marketplace for the \nfirst time ever for many people who were stuck with one plan or who \ncould not get into any plan.\n  Let me ask you this question as we get back to this point. Does the \nSenator still believe we should abolish the provision in ObamaCare that \nsays you cannot discriminate against people with preexisting conditions \nwho apply for health insurance?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I will answer that question. Since I have not yielded the \nfloor, I would like to make a broader point after that and have a \ncolloquy. I will point out why, which is that we are operating under \nsome time constraints. So I want to do what the Senator asked of \ndetailing the unanimous consent requests that I want to promulgate so \nhe and the majority leader may consider them. I also want to be \nrespectful of Senator Grassley and Senator Sessions, who have been \nwaiting to speak. The Senator and I have engaged in multiple exchanges, \nboth now and earlier, and so I want to be respectful of the other \nSenators on the floor.\n  But let me answer the question. I believe we should repeal every word \nof ObamaCare. I think it has failed. I agree with James Hoffa that on \nbehalf of millions of working men and women and the families they \nsupport, that ``the Affordable Care Act will destroy the very health \nand well being of our members, along with millions of other hard-\nworking Americans.'' So I think we should repeal it. I think we should \ndefund it in the interim. This is not a fight over repealing, it is a \nfight over defunding it. Then I think we should adopt free market plans \nto lower prices, make health care more affordable, make it portable, \nand allow it to go with individuals.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Now will the Senator answer my question of whether his \nfamily is protected by the government-administered Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program--the best health insurance in America--where \nhis employer, the Federal Government, pays 72 percent of his monthly \npremium? Will the Senator from Texas for the record tell us--and those \nwho watch this debate--whether he is protected.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to tell the Senator. I am eligible for it. I am \nnot currently covered under it.\n  Let me note that the Senator from Illinois embraced the analogy and \nsaid: Yes, we in Congress have first-class health care. Under his \nanalogy, he wants to stick Judy in coach class. What Senator Grassley's \namendment was all about is, you know what, if you stick Judy in coach \nclass, guess what. Members of Congress are going back in coach class. \nThe Senator and I may disagree. I do not think Judy is in coach class, \nI think she is down in the baggage claim.\n\n  Regardless, in his hypothetical the Senator is conceding that the \ncongressional health care plan right now is better than Judy's under \nObamaCare, and he is saying that he supports a special exemption for \nMembers of Congress that Judy does not get.\n  I agree with Senator Grassley's amendment that we should not be \nforcing millions of Americans into coverage we are not willing to \nexperience. I recognize the passion of the Senator, but I would note \nthat I have not yielded the floor.\n  I would like to describe the unanimous consent requests that I would \nlike to promulgate. I would ask the assistant majority leader and the \nmajority leader to confer with my staff and simply let me know if these \nrequests would be amenable. I am not promulgating them at this time \nbecause I do not want to surprise leadership staff without giving you \ntime to consider them.\n  The first unanimous consent request that I would propose to \npromulgate is a request that we vitiate the cloture on the motion to \nproceed that is scheduled this afternoon and agree by unanimous consent \nto proceed to this bill. To my knowledge, I am not aware of any Senator \nin this body who opposes proceeding to this bill. I think all of us \nagree that we should proceed to this bill, we should keep the \ngovernment open. Some of us think we should keep the government open \nand defund ObamaCare, others think we should fund it, but to the best \nof my knowledge, no one disagrees. So if the majority is amenable, I \nwould propose vitiating the cloture motion and simply agreeing to the \nmotion to proceed. That would be the first unanimous consent request I \nwould promulgate if it is agreeable to the majority.\n  The second unanimous consent request that I would promulgate is, if \nit is agreeable to the majority, as I understand in the timing, all of \nthe delays are put in place. Cloture on the bill would be scheduled to \noccur on Saturday. In my view, in order to defeat cloture on the bill--\nyou know I want to defeat cloture on the bill. That is no secret. I \nthink the best chance to defeat cloture on the bill is for this bill to \nbe visible to the American people--highly visible. So accordingly, I \nwould be amenable to shortening the time for postcloture debate such \nthat that vote on cloture on the bill occurs on Friday afternoon rather \nthan Saturday. Why is that? Because I think that on a Friday afternoon, \na lot more American people are going to pay attention to what we are \ndoing than a vote on Saturday during football games and when people are \npaying attention to other things. That may or may not be amenable to \nthe majority, but if it is, we can shorten this time by a period \nbecause I think we have a better chance in prevailing in this fight if \nthat vote--I note the majority leader is here. I do not know if he \nheard the initial unanimous consent, which, if it is amenable to the \nmajority leader, we would negotiate the language with him and \npromulgate.\n  So the first one I offered, Mr. Leader--and I have not yielded the \nfloor, but I am describing during my time on the floor the unanimous \nconsent requests I would promulgate if the majority would be amenable. \nThe first would be to vitiate the cloture request and simply agree on \nthe motion to proceed because to my knowledge everyone in this body \nagrees we should proceed to this bill, although we have sharp \ndisagreements on what we should do.\n  The second unanimous consent request, if it is amenable to the \nmajority, that I would suggest--and I think the majority leader heard \nthis as he was walking in--is to agree to shorten the time of \npostcloture debate such that cloture on the bill would occur Friday \nafternoon rather than Saturday. The reason is--I am being very \ntransparent about my reasoning. I think it is better for this country \nif this vote is at a time that is visible for the whole country so that \nthe American people have a voice in it. I think sticking it in Saturday \nin the middle of football games disserves that objective.\n  Then the third request--if the majority leader would be amenable--I \nwould put forward is, as I understand it, under the rules of the \nSenate, in some 35 minutes, my time will be automatically cut off as \nthe new legislative day begins and it begins with a prayer. When I \nstarted this filibuster yesterday afternoon, I told the American people \nthat I intended to stand until I could stand no more. I will observe to \nthe majority leader that although I am weary, there is still at least \nstrength in my legs to stand a little longer. So the third thing I \nwould simply ask is if the majority would consent to allow me to speak \nuntil the conclusion of my remarks and then begin the next legislative \nday and have the prayer at the conclusion of those remarks. If the \nmajority says no, then my time will end at noon under the rules of the \nSenate. So it is entirely up to the majority whether to let me continue \nto speak. But given that I began by saying I will speak until I can \nstand no more, I believe I should at least ask if those consents are \namenable.\n  I would note that under the rules of the Senate, if the majority \nleader cares to ask a question, I can yield for a question in which he \nmight share his views or, if the majority leader wants to think about \nit, to discuss it with his staff, then I would note that the majority \nleader could simply convey to my staff if any or none of those \nunanimous\n\n[[Page S6835]]\n\nconsent requests are amenable. If none of them are, that is fine and we \nwill conclude at noon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, is there a consent?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I want to clarify. I have the floor. I have not yielded the \nfloor to anyone. Neither the majority leader nor any other Member has \nthe right of recognition right now. If the majority leader wishes, he \nmay ask me to yield for a question. I might yield for that limited \npurpose. But other than that, no one has the floor, if I understand the \nrules of this body correctly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CRUZ. So I make that note. If the majority would care to ask a \nquestion, I would be amenable to yielding for a question. If the \nmajority leader would not, that is certainly his prerogative, and I am \nhappy to continue talking about the issues this debate has focused the \ncountry on because they are issues of vital importance.\n  Mr. REID. I am without a question.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I would simply note to the majority leader \nthat if those unanimous consent requests are amenable, I would ask that \nhis staff convey that to my staff. If they are not, I would ask that \nhis staff convey that to my staff simply so we know which way to \nproceed. Regardless, I want to make sure before we wrap up because I \nassume now in 31 minutes we will be concluded. I want to yield to \nSenator Grassley in just a moment because I do not want to miss--I \napologize to Senator Grassley, but I do not want to miss the \nopportunity within the limited time to do something that is imperative \nthat I do, which is to thank the men and women who have endured this \nBataan Death March. I want to take a little bit of time to thank them \nby name.\n  I would like to start by thanking the Republican floor staff and \ncloakroom. I thank Laura Dove for her fairness, for her dealing with \ncrises and passion on all sides, and for her effectiveness in the job. \nThis is an interesting occurrence to occur so early in her job. I thank \nher for her service.\n  I wish to thank Robert Duncan, Patrick Kilcur, Chris Tuck, Megan \nMercer, Mary-Elizabeth Taylor, and Amanda Faulkner.\n  I wish to thank Democratic floor staff and cloakroom: Gary Myrick, \nTim Mitchell, Trish Engle, Meredith Mellody, Dan Tinsley, Tequia \nDelgado, Brad Watt, and Stephanie Paone. I wish to thank the clerks and \nParliamentarians. I wish to thank the Capitol Police, the Sergeant at \nArms, and the Secretary of Senate employees.\n  The Parliamentarians are Elizabeth MacDonough, Leigh Hildebrand, Mike \nBeaver; the Legislative Clerk, Kathie Alvarez; the Journal Clerk, Scott \nSanborn; the Bill Clerk, Mary Anne Clarkson; the Daily Digest, \nElizabeth Tratos; the Enrolling Clerk, Cassie Byrd; the chief reporter, \nJerry Linnell;  Congressional Record, Sylvia Oliver, Val Mihalache, Pam \nGarland, Desi Jura, Joel Breitner, Doreen Chendorain, Julie Bryan, \nPatrick Renzi, Mark Stewart, Wendy Caswell, Ann Riley, Patrice Boyd, \nMary Carpenter, Octavio Colominas; captioning, JoEllen Dicken, Jim \nHall, Sandy Schumm; Sergeant at Arms and Secretary of the Senate \nemployees; the Senate pages, many of whom I caused to miss school. I \nappreciate you all for enduring this, and all those who work in the \nCapitol complex.\n  I wish to thank my entire staff, many of whom have been here all \nnight.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a note of \nsincere gratitude to my staff, who worked tirelessly to help me prepare \nand sustain extended floor remarks. I especially appreciate their \nappearance in the Chamber throughout the night, which was a great \nsource of encouragement. I extend my appreciation to each of the \nfollowing individuals:\n\n       Chip Roy, Chief of Staff; Sean Rushton, Communications \n     Director; Amanda Carpenter, Speechwriter & Senior \n     Communications Advisor; Catherine Frazier, Press Secretary; \n     Josh Perry, Digital Director; Brooke Bacak, Legislative \n     Director; Jeff Murray, Deputy Legislative Director; Scott \n     Keller, Chief Counsel; John Ellis, Senior Counsel; Bernie \n     McNamee, Senior Domestic Policy Advisor and Counsel; Kenny \n     Stein, Legislative Counsel; Alec Aramanda, Legislative \n     Assistant; Max Pappas, Director of Outreach & Senior \n     Economist; Victoria Coates, Senior Advisor of National \n     Security.\n       Jeremy Hayes, Military Legislative Assistant; David \n     Milstein, Research Assistant; Dougie Simmons, Director of \n     Scheduling; Christine Shafer, Deputy Director of Scheduling; \n     Kimberly Henderson, Administrative Director; Dan Soto, IT \n     Director; Amy Herod, Scheduling Assistant & Assistant to the \n     Chief of Staff; Hunter Rome, Legislative Correspondent; \n     Samantha Leahy, Legislative Correspondent; Martin Martinez, \n     Legal Assistant; Melanie Schwartz, Legislative Correspondent; \n     Caitlin Thompson, Legislative Correspondent; Ben Murrey, \n     Legislative Correspondent; Brittany Baldwin, Press Assistant; \n     Nico Rios, Staff Assistant; John Landes, Staff Assistant.\n\n  I wish to thank Democratic Senators who have presided: Senator \nBaldwin, Senator Manchin, Senator Warren, Senator Donnelly, Senator \nKaine, Senator Murphy, Senator Schatz, Senator Baldwin again, Senator \nDonnelly, Senator Durbin, Senator Heitkamp, and Senator Markey.\n  I wish to thank the Republican Senators who have spoken in support of \nour efforts: Senator Sessions, Senator Rubio, Senator Paul, Senator \nInhofe, Senator Enzi, Senator Roberts, Senator Vitter, and very soon, \nSenator Grassley.\n  I wish to thank the House Members who have come over. Representative \nAmash, Representative Broun, Representative Hudson. I wish to make a \nspecial note of Representative Gohmert who was here the entire night \nenduring this.\n  I wish to make a point, particularly to the floor staff and to \neveryone: You all didn't choose this. I appreciate the hard work and \ndiligence going through the night. That is not part of your typical job \nresponsibility. I would not have imposed on your time and energy if I \ndid not believe this was an issue of vital importance to the American \npeople. I wish to thank you for your hard work, diligence, and \ncheerfulness through what has been a very long night.\n  I wish to thank, second to last, Senator Mike Lee. Senator Mike Lee \nbegan this fight. Senator Mike Lee has been here throughout the course \nof this battle. Senator Mike Lee has been always cheerful, always \nfocused, always ready to march into battle and always ready to focus on \nthe ultimate objective, which is serving the American people by \nstanding and fighting to stop the train wreck, the nightmare, the \ndisaster that is ObamaCare.\n  We wouldn't be here if it weren't for Senator Lee's principle, for \nhis courage, for his bravery under fire. I feel particularly honored to \nserve as his colleague and consider him a friend.\n  Last, I wish to thank the American people. I want to thank people all \nacross the country who watched on C-SPAN, tweeted, engaged, and have \nbeen involved in this process. This is ultimately about the American \npeople. What this whole fight is about is whether this body, the \nDemocratic Senators and the Republican Senators, will change the broken \nways of Washington and start listening to the people. That is what this \nfight is all about.\n  With those thank yous, I apologize, but I felt obliged to conclude \nbefore 12 o'clock when my time will be cut off by force. I will note at \nthis point Senator Grassley had wished to ask a question.\n  I am prepared to yield for a question if Senator Grassley wishes to \nask me a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend from Texas to yield to me, without losing \nhis right to the floor, for a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator so yield?\n  Mr. CRUZ. With the reservation that I do not lose the right to the \nfloor, I am pleased to engage in a colloquy with the majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, first, this is not a filibuster. This is \nan agreement that he and I made that he could talk.\n  Let me say this: We are going to have a vote about 1 o'clock today. \nAfter that is over, we will follow the rules of the Senate. My goal is \nto get this to the House of Representatives as quickly as possible.\n  I think a lot of this time has been--without talking about what has \ntranspired at this point--I would hope that we could collapse the time \ndramatically and move forward so the House of Representatives can get \nwhat we are going to send back to them.\n  There is a possibility they may not accept what we send them. They \nmay\n\n[[Page S6836]]\n\nwant to send us something back. If we use all this time under the rules \nas they now exist----\n  Mr. CRUZ. I have decided to not yield my right to the floor. I was \namenable to a colloquy. The majority leader is giving a speech.\n  Given that, as I understand, the majority leader is not going to \nconsent to extend the time, I have 24 minutes, I am going to reassert \nmy time on the floor since I have not yielded my time on the floor.\n  Mr. REID. If I could ask for a unanimous consent agreement with my \nfriend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRUZ. There is objection. I am sorry. I cannot be asked to \nconsent to an unnamed consent agreement.\n  Given that the majority leader, as I understand, is not going to \nconsent to extend my time, then let me say quite simply to the majority \nleader that I will yield time to him for a question when the majority \nleader is prepared to yield to the American people. But I am not \nprepared to yield prior to that because Senator Grassley, Senator \nSessions, and Senator Inhofe are waiting to speak. I believe they are \nendeavoring to listen to the American people. If the majority is going \nto cut off and muzzle us in another 24 minutes, then at this point I \ndon't feel it is appropriate to allow the majority leader to consume \nthat time.\n  I will note to any Senators who were here--if anyone would care, I \nknow a number of Senators are waiting to ask questions, I am prepared \nto yield to a question from any of them.\n  Mr. REID. I have a question I wish to ask my friend from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Texas yield for a \nquestion without losing the floor?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I yield for a question without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Between 12 and 1 o'clock, would my friend yield to Senator \nMcCain for 15 minutes of that time?\n  Mr. CRUZ. That question is asked, but it will not prove necessary, \nabsent the consent that I promulgated. I am assuming it would not be \nacceptable to the majority because my time will end at noon. There is \nnothing left to yield because, as I understand it under the Senate \nrules, when the new legislative day begins and the prayer begins, my \ntime yields.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, he has the right to speak from 12 o'clock \nto 1 o'clock. What I am asking the consent for is would he allow, \nduring that period of time, Senator McCain to speak for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CRUZ. It is my understanding my time expires at noon. Absent a \nconsent to extend it, I will honor the Senate rules and allow my time \nto expire at noon, so there is nothing to yield.\n  I will note Senator Sessions is standing.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I yield for a question without yielding the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Texas yield for a \nparliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Given the majority leader has cut off our time in 20 \nminutes, no, I am sorry, I do not. The majority leader was welcome to \ncome down any time in the last 20 hours and ask parliamentary inquiries \nor questions. I would note Senator Durbin did so, Senator Kaine did so, \nothers Senators did so.\n  At this point, our time is expiring and I wish to allow other \nRepublican Senators who appeared and asked to ask questions to have the \nopportunity to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. May I direct a question to my friend from Texas?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I yield for one more question without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. REID. The question is the Senator seems to not understand that he \nhas time, after the prayer is given at 12 o'clock, time until 1 \no'clock. During that period of time my question was, because the \nSenator still has the floor, would the Senator yield 15 minutes to John \nMcCain.\n  Mr. CRUZ. It is my intention, if the consent request that I asked is \nnot agreed to, to accept the end of this at noon under the Senate \nrules.\n  Mr. REID. I understand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Texas yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I yield for a question without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thought that a very gracious question of the author \nof unanimous consent, that we would vitiate the vote and 30 hours of \ndebate. The Senator asked very little in exchange for it, other than to \ncontinue to talk.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Let me briefly clarify, I asked nothing in exchange for \nthat. None of those were contingent on each other. Those were three \nindependent unanimous consent requests--which the majority leader \nwanted consent to any of those. It wasn't an offer of horse trade, it \nwas simply--I think all three of those make sense. I think any one of \nthe three of them makes sense. If he chooses to reject them all, that \nis his prerogative and that is fine. I was only suggesting we not waste \nthis body's time by doing so.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. To follow up on that then, it seems to me that what the \nSenator was saying would be an offer that most everyone here would be \npleased to receive and accept, unless they have some surreptitious \nmotive.\n  In addition, I think the Senator's continued request to be allowed to \ncontinue to speak is reasonable. I think the Senator has earned the \nright to ask that. The Senator has now spoken. The American people are \nwatching the fourth longest time any filibuster or floor time has been \nheld by a Senator. I think that is a perfectly reasonable request. It \nwill allow the Senator to continue to express the concerns that he has \nexpressed. I am somewhat taken aback that it wasn't agreed to.\n  Again, to make clear, it would seem to me little if any reason that \nthey would object to that, the majority would object to that.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend from Alabama.\n  I would note that unfortunately I am not surprised that none of the \nconsents were taken. I note the first two consents, one would think, \nwould be quite amenable. Yet, look, throughout this debate, the problem \nhas been the majority does not wish to listen to the American people \nand doesn't want a debate in front of the American people, particularly \nabout the merits of ObamaCare. They don't want to talk about how \nObamaCare is failing millions of Americans. They don't want to talk \nabout how millions of Americans are losing their jobs and how they are \nnot being hired. They don't want to talk about how millions of \nAmericans are facing being pushed into part-time work. They don't want \nto talk about how millions of Americans are either losing their health \ninsurance or are at risk of losing their health insurance.\n  This process is all about, sadly, the Democratic majority not \nlistening to the American people. The whole purpose of this filibuster \nwas to do everything we could to draw this issue to the attention of \nthe American people so the American people could be heard.\n  If the American people speak with sufficient volume, I continue to \nhave confidence that this body, that the Senators on both sides of the \naisle, will have no choice but to listen.\n  Given that we have 16 minutes remaining, I inadvertently omitted in \nmy thank yous the doorkeepers by accident.\n  The doorkeepers were: Tucker Eagleson, Dawn Gazunis, Elizabeth \nGarcia, Rocketa Gillis, Marc O'Connor, Laverne Allen, Daniel Benedix, \nCindy Kesler, Scott Muschette, Tony Goldsmith, Jim Jordan, Megan \nSheffield, David West, Denis Houlihan, and Bob Shelton.\n  Let me say for any of the floor staff or others, if I inadvertently \nomitted someone, please accept my apology. It was my intention to \nendeavor to thank anyone. If I have made an inadvertent omission, that \nis my fault and I take responsibility for it.\n  I wish to note also that an additional Member of Congress, \nCongressman Steve King, has joined us. I wish to thank Congressman King \nfor joining us.\n  I would note, as we are in the last 15 minutes, that if my friend and \ncolleague Senator Mike Lee wished to ask a question, I would be \nprepared to yield as we are wrapping up.\n\n[[Page S6837]]\n\n  Mr. LEE. Will the Senator from Texas yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I yield for a question without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. LEE. From day 1, there have been those in the Washington \nestablishment who have been working against this, and it was the \nAmerican people who stood up in strong support of us. It was the \nAmerican people who served as the heroes of this story who spoke \noverwhelmingly to the Congress and spoke overwhelmingly to the House of \nRepresentatives and convinced the House of Representatives to pass this \ngreat continuing resolution--one that keeps government funded and \nallows it to avoid a shutdown while defunding ObamaCare. That is what \nthis effort has been all about. It has been all about the people we are \ntrying to protect from this horrible law.\n  Across the country Americans stayed up with us overnight forging this \nargument, helping us distribute this argument, choosing to forego sleep \nand to show their support of this effort, and we greatly appreciate \nthat. I want to take a moment to reflect on how all of us who have been \nup all night feel right now--with dry eyes, with a certain amount of \ngrogginess, and yet ultimately this is an exhilarating moment. It is \nexhilarating because we are inspired by the American people who have \ninformed this message and who have expressed their views so well and so \nforcefully, and I am grateful to have been part of this effort.\n  I ask the Senator from Texas: As we come to the end of this uphill \nclimb we have experienced over the past 24 hours, give or take, we see \nthe cards are somewhat stacked against us. Today, although Washington \nmay appear to have the upper hand, in our hearts don't we know the \nAmerican people are with us, and don't we know the American people will \nhave the final word, and that as George Washington predicted a couple \nof centuries ago, this country will always remain in good hands--in the \nhands of its people?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend Senator Lee from Utah, and I think that \nis exactly right. At the end of the day it is the United States of \nAmerica--``we the people''--who are sovereign. Ultimately every Member \nof this body works for ``we the people.'' The reason there is such \nprofound frustration across this country, the reason this body is held \nin such abysmally low esteem is that for too long Washington has not \nlistened to the American people. Every survey of the American people, \nno matter what State, no matter whether you are talking Republicans, \nDemocrats, Independents or Libertarians, the answer is always the same: \nThe top priority for the American people is jobs and the economy.\n  The Presiding Officer and I both began serving 9 months ago as \nfreshmen in this body. I will tell you my greatest frustration in this \nbody during those 9 months is that we have spent virtually zero time \ntalking about jobs and the economy. We spent 6 weeks talking about guns \nand taking away people's Second Amendment rights. But when it comes to \njobs and the economy in this Senate, it doesn't even make the agenda.\n  We spend no time talking about fundamental tax reform. We spend no \ntime or virtually no time talking about regulatory reform. When it \ncomes to defunding ObamaCare, the single biggest thing we could do to \nrestore jobs in the economy, the Democratic majority is not interested \nin that conversation. Indeed, for the bulk of this conversation, with a \ncouple of exceptions, the Democratic majority chose not to engage in \nthe debate. Why? I would submit it is because on the merits, on the \nsubstance, the defense of ObamaCare is now indefensible.\n  There may have been some, even many, who 3\\1/2\\ years ago, when \nObamaCare was adopted, believed in good faith it was going to work. But \nat this point the facts are evident that it is not. At this point we \nhave seen small businesses all over this country who are losing the \nability to compete, who are not expanding, who are staying under 50 \nemployees, who are not hiring, and who are forcing employees to move to \npart-time work.\n  According to the Chamber of Commerce survey of small businesses, half \nof small businesses eligible for the employee mandate are either moving \nto part-time workers or forcing full-time workers to go part time. This \nis not a small problem. This is not a marginal problem. This is a \nproblem all over the country. We are talking to millions of small \nbusinesses. Another 24 percent, I believe is the number, are simply not \ngrowing, are staying under 50 employees, which means they are not \nhiring people.\n  So anyone in America right now who is struggling to find a job--and \nsmall businesses provide two-thirds of all new jobs--small businesses \nare crying out that ObamaCare is killing them. Unfortunately, the \nSenate is not hearing their cries. For the millions of Americans who \nare facing the threat of being forced into part-time work, \nunfortunately, the Senate is not hearing their cries. For the millions \nof Americans who are facing skyrocketing health insurance premiums and \nfacing the reality or the risk of losing their health insurance, the \nSenate is not hearing their cries.\n  The people who are facing this are not the wealthy, they are not the \npowerful, they are not, as the President likes to say, the millionaires \nand billionaires. They are the most vulnerable among us. They are young \npeople who are being absolutely decimated by ObamaCare. They are single \nmoms who are working in diners, struggling and suddenly finding their \nhours reduced to 29 hours a week. The problem is 29 hours a week is not \nenough to feed your kids. Single moms are crying out to the Senate to \nfix this train wreck, to fix this disaster. And for the struggling \nsingle moms, for young people, unfortunately, the Senate is closed for \nbusiness.\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, will the good Senator yield for a \nquestion without yielding the floor?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I am happy to yield for a question without yielding the \nfloor, although I would note we have all of 6\\1/2\\ minutes until the \ntime will expire.\n  Mr. RISCH. I will be brief. I want to talk briefly and ask a question \nabout the area the Senator was just talking about. My good friend \nSenator Rubio made reference to the story I am going to tell. My good \nfriends on the other side of the aisle are good about bringing out \npictures of people with sad faces. My only regret is I don't have a \npicture of somebody with a sad face, but I can assure you these people \nare greatly saddened by this.\n  We had a hearing in the Small Business Committee and we brought in \npeople from around the country, small businesses who are suffering \nunder this terrible burden. The Senator was not here in the middle of \nthe night when this abomination was shoved down the throat of the \nAmerican people on a straight party-line vote. I can assure him that we \nfought it tooth and nail, but now the American people are having to \nlive with this, and so it is good to be reminded again of what we have \nhere.\n  But this gentleman operated a business called Dot's Diner in \nLouisiana. He had, I forget whether it was six or seven diners, and \nthis man was living the all-American dream. He had quit a very good \njob, cashed in his retirement, borrowed money and he and his wife \nopened this diner. The diner did well because they worked hard. Like \nthe Senator did all night tonight, sometimes they worked that hard. \nThey opened more diners and were just about to open another one when \nthe Senate announced they were going to force ObamaCare on the American \npeople and on the small businesses of this country.\n\n  They immediately stopped their plans to open a new diner and then \nlooked at what ObamaCare was going to cost them. The cost of ObamaCare \nwas substantially higher than the profits they were making in the \nbusiness every year. So what they did, they went and got counsel and \nsaid: How can we get around ObamaCare? What they were told is, if you \nhave 49 employees, you are outside of ObamaCare. So given that, what \nthey did is they closed the diners and got down to 49 employees and \nthat is where they are.\n  Will the Senator tell me, because I would like to hear his thoughts \non that and whether he believes the American government that our \nFounding Fathers fought for and died for should be visiting this on the \nAmerican people, particularly on small businessmen who are the backbone \nof this economy?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Idaho for his question and for his \nsteadfast leadership and willingness to\n\n[[Page S6838]]\n\nstand and fight for the American people to stop this train wreck that \nis ObamaCare. And the answer to my friend's question is: Of course not. \nSmall businesses all over this country are getting hammered by \nObamaCare, and the real loses are not even to the small business \nowners. The real losers are the people, the teenaged kids who would get \nhired, the single moms who would get hired, the African Americans, the \nHispanics who are suddenly finding themselves without a job or are \nbeing forcibly reduced to 29 hours a week and denied the opportunity to \nget to that first rung of the economic ladder, which would then get \nthem to the second, the third, and the fourth.\n  Millions of Americans are hurting under ObamaCare. It is my plea to \nthis body, to the Democrats, that they listen to the unions that are \nasking on behalf of millions of Americans who are struggling to repeal \nObamaCare, that we not have a system where the rich and powerful or big \ncorporations and Members of Congress are treated to a different set of \nrules than hardworking Americans. President Obama has granted illegal \nexemptions to big businesses and Members of Congress. I don't think the \nAmerican people should be subject to harsher rules.\n  So my plea to this body is that we listen to the American people, \nbecause if we listen to our constituents, the answer is: Defund this \nbill that isn't working, that is hurting the American people, that is \nkilling jobs and forcing people into part-time work, that is driving up \nhealth insurance premiums and that is causing millions to lose or to \nfear they will lose their health insurance.\n  As the time is wrapping up, I will close by noting that at noon we \nwill have a prayer. I think it is fitting this debate conclude with \nprayer, because I would ask that everyone in this body ask for the \nLord's guidance on how we best listen to our constituents, listen to \nthe pleas for help that are coming from our constituents.\n  The final thing I will do is to make two unanimous consent requests I \nmentioned, and the majority leader may or may not agree to them. The \nfirst is:\n  I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote at 1 p.m. be vitiated \nand that at the conclusion of my remarks the motion to proceed to the \nresolution be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, my friend has had an \nopportunity to speak. I will speak for a longer time period in a few \nminutes about statements he has made in the last several hours. But he \nhas spoken.\n  At 1 p.m. the Senate will speak, and we will follow the rules of the \nSenate. I have said very clearly on a number of occasions that we \nshould be moving quickly to get this to the House as soon as we can.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, my second request is:\n  I ask unanimous consent that if a cloture motion is filed on the \nunderlying measure, that cloture vote occur during Friday's session of \nthe Senate, notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we are going to have a \ncloture vote at 1 o'clock and any consent agreements after that I will \nbe happy to listen to them. At this stage, I object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Well then, it appears I have the floor for another 90 \nseconds or so, and so I simply will note for the American people who \nhave been so engaged that this debate is in their hands. Ultimately, \nall 100 Senators--all 46 Republicans, all 54 Democrats--work for you. \nThe pleas from the American people--certainly those in Texas--are \ndeafening. The frustration that the United States Senate doesn't listen \nto the people is deafening. So I call on all 46 Republicans to unite, \nto stand together and to vote against cloture on the bill on Friday or \nSaturday; otherwise, if we vote with the majority leader and with the \nSenate Democrats, we will be voting to allow the majority leader to \nfund ObamaCare on a straight party-line vote of 51 partisan votes.\n  The American people will understand that. Voting to give that power \nto the majority leader, I would suggest, is not consistent with, I \nbelieve, the heartfelt commitment of all 46 members of this conference \nwho oppose ObamaCare. The only path, if we are to oppose ObamaCare, is \nto stand together and oppose cloture. I ask my friends on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle to listen to this plea.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Pursuant to the order of February 29, \n1960, the hour of 12 noon having arrived, the Senate having been in \ncontinuous session since convening yesterday, the Senate will suspend \nfor a prayer from the chaplain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/24/senate-section/article/S6838-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6838-S6881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 prayer\n\n  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:\n  Let us pray.\n  Eternal God, our refuge and strength, may the fact that this Chamber \nhas reverberated with a marathon of speaking help us to remember to \ndirect our thoughts and words toward Your throne in continuous prayer \nfor our Nation. You have challenged us to pray without ceasing, for the \nfervent prayers of the righteous avail much.\n  During this challenging season, give our Senators the wisdom to make \nfull and complete their commitment to serve the American people. Equip \nour lawmakers with the power to clearly discern right from wrong so \nthat integrity will govern their words and actions. Lord, make them \nthis day sentinels on the walls of freedom worthy of the power and \nresponsibility they exercise. Guide and sustain them in the great \nunfinished tasks of achieving peace, justice, and understanding among \nall people and nations.\n  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we all admire the Senator from Texas for his \nwanting to talk. With all due respect, I am not sure we learned \nanything new. He had talked about it before on a number of occasions--\nin fact, endlessly. It has been interesting to watch, but, for lack of \na better way of describing this, it has been a big waste of time.\n  The government is set to shut down in a matter of hours. In just a \nfew days the government will close. And it is a shame. We are standing \nhere having wasted perhaps 2 days--most of yesterday and a good part of \ntoday--when we could pass what we need to pass very quickly and send it \nback to the House of Representatives. They are waiting for us to act.\n  It seems that in recent years, rather than trying to get things done, \nwe have a mindset in some people's minds to delay and stall and try not \nto get anything done. I have talked about this before. I do believe \nthat what we have here with the so-called tea party is a new effort to \nstrike government however they can, to hurt government. Any day that \ngovernment is hurt is a good day for them. It is, as I said before, the \nnew anarchy.\n  We should get this matter back to the House of Representatives as \nsoon as we can. They may want to change something in this, and we \nbelieve that if they have to do that--I don't think they should, but if \nthey feel they have to, get it back to us. Each hour we waste is one \nless hour we will have an opportunity to look at this. Our rules are \ndifferent from the rules in the House. So this has been untoward, and I \nwould hope we don't have to waste more time prior to sending it to the \nHouse.\n  Under the Senate rules, there are lots of opportunities to waste \ntime, and that is what we do around here now--we waste time.\n  The Presiding Officer has been here longer than any other Senator, \nand he has seen how Senators have worked together over the years to get \nthings done, not to stop things from happening.\n  I haven't been here as long as the distinguished Presiding Officer, \nbut I have been here quite a while. I came to the Congress in 1982. I \nhave seen the work of Democrats and Republicans. I look back with such \npleasure that Senator Hatfield and Senator Danforth, an Episcopalian \nfrom Missouri--both Republicans--worked to get things done.\n  The late John Heinz was taken from us far too quickly in an \nunfortunate\n\n[[Page S6839]]\n\nplane accident, but he was a Republican Senator who worked to \naccomplish things for this country.\n  John Chafee. If he did now what he did for me in my reelection in \n1992, he would be booted out of the Republican Party. Do you know what \nhe did then? He was chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. I sat on his committee. He came to me and said: Harry, I \nwant you to get reelected, and I am going to help you get reelected. We \nwill do some hearings in Nevada, and you are going to wind up \nconducting those hearings. That is how we used to work together to get \nthings done. He liked the work I did on the committee. He was a \nRepublican, but he worked to get things done. He was a patriot. He was \na hero on the coldest war, the Korean war. Brady's book written about \nthe Korean war was mostly about John Chafee.\n  It is unfortunate that so much time is now spent wasted, not \naccomplishing anything. That is what this has been about--wasting time. \nThe American people know. They have been called upon by the junior \nSenator from Texas time and time again: the American people, the \nAmerican people. I will tell you something. The American people know \nthat every hour that he has spoken or speaks pushes us another hour \ncloser to a Republican government shutdown.\n  I have witnessed a government shutdown. The gross national product \nwas hammered by tens of billions of dollars quickly. We had a meeting \nthis morning, and Bob Rubin, former Secretary of Treasury, talked. He \nsaid: I was here, I know all about that shutdown. He said: But the \nworld had more confidence in the United States then than they do now.\n  With the government being hammered every angle by the anarchists, he \ndoesn't know how badly we would be hurt with another government \nshutdown. He thinks it would be worse than the first one.\n  If anyone has any doubt that there are Republicans rooting for a \nshutdown, they should just turn on the television. It is not all \nRepublicans, and we know that, but they can look at TV and see that \nthere are some working to almost singlehandedly force us into a \nshutdown because, remember, a bad day for government is a good day for \nthe tea party.\n  We could finish this bill within a matter of hours, but instead we \nfind ourselves being pushed closer and closer to another shutdown. I \nknow the majority of my Republican colleagues recognize this strategy \nfor the foolishness it is, and I am glad to see them speak up. Two \ndozen have spoken saying, among other things, that it is the dumbest \nidea he had ever heard. Another said they were being forced into a box \ncanyon and he could see no way out. One Senator said it was political \nsuicide. So I am glad to see them speak up for common sense. Actions \nspeak louder than words.\n  In just 50 minutes, it will be time for common sense to prevail. I \nstill have hope that we can avoid a government shutdown, but every hour \nwe waste on this floor diminishes the hope of that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that following Senator McConnell's \nremarks, the time until 1 p.m. be equally divided, with the two leaders \ncontrolling the time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I wish to start by acknowledging the \nwork of my colleague, the junior the Senator from Texas, who held the \nfloor for nearly a day speaking passionately about an issue that unites \nevery single Republican: ObamaCare is wrong for America and needs to be \nrepealed. The Senator from Texas has focused on the dangers of this \nlaw, explaining once again why we are all on this side of the aisle \ncommitted to overturning it. Later this week every Republican will \nunite to vote against any amendment to add funding for ObamaCare.\n  This afternoon I would like to call on my colleagues across the aisle \nto once again listen to their constituents and actually join us in this \neffort. I would like to ask Senators to take their minds back to \nChristmas Eve 2009. Some of us remember it very, very well. In the \nearly hours of the morning, the majority leader rammed through a \nmassive 2,700-page takeover of the U.S. health care system against the \nwill of the American people, against the principles of open and \naccountable government, and, I would argue, against their better \njudgment because the people who voted for this bill didn't have to \nlisten to all the speeches I was giving back then to realize it would \nnever, ever do what the President said it would. But they in the end \nobeyed the orders of the Washington Democratic leadership anyway, and \nnow our friends on the other side are seeing the results of their \nvotes.\n  ObamaCare is just as bad as many of us said it would be, and it is \nabout to get a lot worse. This train is picking up speed, and there is \na bridge out ahead. It is sort of like one of those Wile E. Coyote \ncartoons, except this isn't funny because these are people's lives we \nare talking about. We are talking about the college graduate who is \nfaced with a choice between exorbitant premiums and government tax \npenalties. We are talking about the working mom forced to scrape by \nwith less hours and smaller paychecks. We are talking about the small \nbusinesses that are unable to grow and hire more Americans. And that is \nnot even getting into the concerns about glitches that could expose \npersonal information to fraud or about Americans losing the health care \nthey like and want to keep.\n  Even the administration is having a terrible time spinning this law. \nJust look at the cherry-picked report they released today. About the \nbest they could claim was that some premiums would be lower than \nprojected. Let me say that again: Some premiums would be lower than \nprojected. Note that I didn't say ``lower'' but ``lower than \nprojected.'' Basically, this law is a complete mess.\n  So Washington Democrats may have been able to brush the American \npeople off back in 2009--just brushed them off--but they have no choice \nbut to deal with reality now. We have seen how this has worked out over \nthe last 4 years.\n  It is hard to blame them for looking back at their ObamaCare vote \nwith a lot of regret. But here is the good news. Later this week the \nSenate will take up the House-passed CR. If the House-passed CR passes, \nit will keep the government from shutting down without increasing \ngovernment spending by a penny and--and--defund ObamaCare.\n  So for all those Democrats who shanked it back in 2006, here is your \nopportunity for a mulligan. Here is your chance to finally get on the \nsame page with the American people because the American people \noverwhelmingly oppose this law, and you can't open a newspaper these \ndays without being struck by some new reason you should be opposed to \nit too.\n  Remember, it is more than just our constituents who are opposed to \nObamaCare. Small businesses are opposed. Even big labor bosses are \nsouring on it. All we need is five Democrats to show enough courage to \nstand against their party and with the American people on this vote. \nThat is enough to pass the bill--enough to keep the government open and \nto keep ObamaCare funding out of it--before this train collides with \nreality.\n  I urge my Democratic colleagues to join us, the members of my \nconference who are already united in our opposition to ObamaCare. \nDemocrats, on the other side of the aisle, can help us get this job \ndone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I came to the floor several times while \nSenator Cruz was speaking and addressed questions to him about his \nposition on ObamaCare. What I asked him about were specific provisions \nin ObamaCare and whether he thought he agreed with them. He made it \nvery clear at the end he doesn't want any part of ObamaCare. What he \nhas said is basically the provision in ObamaCare which says you cannot \ndiscriminate against a person or family offering health insurance if \nthey have a preexisting condition, that provision in ObamaCare Senator \nCruz and the tea party Republicans object to.\n  Is there one of us alive who doesn't have someone in their family \nwith a preexisting condition--asthma, diabetes, cancer survivors, high \nblood pressure, high cholesterol? Think of all those possibilities. It \ncould be your\n\n[[Page S6840]]\n\nchild who disqualifies your family from buying health insurance without \nthe protection of ObamaCare. Senator Cruz and Republicans would repeal \nthat protection.\n  There is also a provision in there that says you cannot limit how \nmuch a health insurance policy will pay. Why did we include that in the \nbill? Because tomorrow morning's diagnosis of someone you dearly love \ncould mean they are in for surgery or cancer therapy that could cost \nhundreds of thousands of dollars and you may not have the coverage if \nyour plan does not have the protection of ObamaCare. Senator Cruz and \nthe tea party Republicans would repeal that protection.\n  Senator Stabenow in the State of Michigan just held a press \nconference. She tells me that over 60 percent of health insurance \npolicies in America today do not offer maternity care, maternal \nbenefits for the baby and mother--over 60 percent. The ObamaCare \nprovision requires every policy in America to protect new moms and \ntheir babies, every policy. Senator Cruz and the tea party Republicans \nwould repeal that provision.\n  Let me tell you what else it includes. In ObamaCare we say if you \nhave a young son or daughter fresh out of college looking for a job and \nthey can't find one or only a part-time one or one that doesn't offer \nbenefits, you can keep your son and daughter on your family health \ninsurance plan up to age 26. That is peace of mind for a lot of \nparents. My wife and I have been through that, raising our kids. \nSenator Cruz and the tea party Republicans would abolish and repeal \nthat protection for family coverage.\n  I will also tell you that today, across America, they are announcing \nthe marketplace insurance plans under ObamaCare. In my State it has \nbeen announced that the rates for families for health insurance are 25 \npercent below--below--what was expected. What it means for many \nfamilies across Illinois and across America is, for the first time in \ntheir lives, there will be competition offering them health insurance \nfor their families. For the first time ever. Repeatedly I asked Senator \nCruz about a friend of mine, 62 years old, a hard-working lady in \nsouthern Illinois. She has worked her whole life. She is not lazy. She \nis trying everything she can. She never had health insurance 1 day in \nher life and she is 62. This gives her a chance for health insurance, \nand I have asked Senator Cruz, would you repeal that provision? He said \nyes.\n  That to me is what the debate comes down to, 50 million Americans \nwithout health insurance, others with health insurance that is not \nthere when you need it. These are people who are looking to us to make \nsure that the marketplace works for them and make sure that competition \nworks for them. That is what this is about. The sad reality is that \nSenator Cruz and the tea party Republicans would rather shut down the \nGovernment of the United States than to give these protections to \nAmerican families. That is what it comes down to.\n  I don't think all Republicans on that side of the aisle agree with \nSenator Cruz. I think that is why repeatedly he has been appealing to \nhis fellow Republicans to stick with him, but many of them, as Senator \nReid said earlier, understand this is not a good message for America. \nWe should not be threatening to shut down the government over an issue. \nWe should not be threatening when it is clear that they do not have the \nvotes on the floor to achieve that. Yet they are going to take us right \nto the brink. I think it is wrong. Whether they are going to default on \nAmerica's debt for the first time in history or shut down our \ngovernment, it is going to hurt America's economy. We need to create \njobs and build a strong economy. This kind of desperation scenario is \ngoing to hurt businesses and it is going to kill jobs. That is not good \nfor America's future.\n  Let's work together. There are ways to improve this bill, ObamaCare. \nI am willing to sit down at a table any day in the week to explore \nthose in a constructive, positive way. But simply threatening to shut \ndown the government unless ObamaCare comes to an end sadly does not \nspeak well of those who support it and it certainly doesn't address the \nserious issues we face in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we have had, I think, a national \ndiscussion and the American people have begun to focus on what is \nimminent and that is that the implementation of the ObamaCare \nlegislation is going to be a disaster. It is not prepared. As Senator \nBaucus, the chairman of the Finance Committee, said: It would be a \ntrain wreck. That is where we are headed. The Democratic majority has \nabsolutely refused to allow any serious negotiation, amendments, \nlegislative reform to fix the problems with the legislation. That is \nthe fundamental problem we have here.\n  Senator McConnell recalled how this bill was first passed by the \nSenate on Christmas Eve nearly three years ago--and it was against the \nwill of the majority of the American people. I remember Senator Scott \nBrown in Massachusetts ran against the health care to fill the vacant \nseat, Senator Kennedy's seat. He campaigned and said: Elect me in \nliberal Massachusetts and I am going to kill the health care bill. \nRepublicans hadn't been elected to the Senate in Massachusetts in \ndecades--and he won. He was prepared to kill the legislation, providing \nthat single vote that would deny them the 60 votes they had to have for \npassage. They were able to rush it through before he could take office \nand move it in that fashion. It had problems that could not have been \nfixed otherwise and they were able to do that.\n  I want to recall to the American people the power, the force that was \nused to pass this bill despite the consistent pleas of the American \npeople not to do it. I have not forgotten that. I don't think the \nAmerican people have.\n  What has happened now? The Senate refuses to discuss it. They do not \nwant to discuss it because they do not want to enter into a legislative \nprocess that you would think would be perfectly sensible. The bill was \npassed, what, in 2009? It is now about to hammer us and the negative \nimpacts are quite clear. It is about to hammer us and they refuse to \nbring it to the floor. So the House funded the U.S. Government. They \nsent a bill to the Senate that funds the U.S. Government except it does \nnot fund the ObamaCare part, requiring us to confront this issue once \nagain.\n  What does the majority say? What does the President say? They are \nsaying we will shut down the government. We will never pass anything \nthat allows us--that makes changes in this bill. We will not send back \na compromise. We will not agree to have hearings and discuss how to fix \nit and make it better. No. Absolutely. We are going to use the brute \npower of the majority party in the Senate to deny that process. I do \nnot think that is right.\n  Let me say it is not a little bitty matter. My friend here has the \ntoughest job in Washington, being majority leader of the Senate. I \nrespect Senator Reid. But recently in Nevada he was asked: Do you \nbelieve in a single payer for health care America? And the quote I saw \nwas: Yes, yes, absolutely yes.\n  Yesterday in the Budget Committee the ranking Republican on that \ncommittee--one of our esteemed Democratic colleagues when this matter \ncame up, said: ``I support single payer system.''\n  In the Budget Committee--earlier in the year Senator Sanders said \nthis bill is not going to work. The only thing that is going to work is \na single payer. Senator Sanders, as we know, is known, at least in the \npast, as a Socialist and has run as a Socialist. The leader in the \nHouse, Nancy Pelosi, has said she believed in a single payer. But \nPresident Obama, in 2003, clearly said he favored a single-payer health \ncare policy for America. What does that mean? Who is that payer? I \nasked Senator Cruz that. He said: Of course the payer is the U.S. \nGovernment. What they are proposing, what they desire, what they intend \nto impose on the American people--because they had a brief shining \nmoment, they had 60 Senators in this body and they rammed through a \nfundamental change in the health care policy of this country--and the \nAmerican people do not want it. Senator Cruz did not waste time. \nSenator Cruz raised this issue in a way I hope resonates throughout \nthis country, just how serious it is, the health care question facing \nour country. It is fundamentally the biggest change in government and \nthe size of government we have had in decades, I guess at least\n\n[[Page S6841]]\n\nsince Medicare; maybe bigger than Medicare. And they say it is paid \nfor. Don't worry, it is all paid for.\n  The American people know this cannot be so. How can you do all that \nand not cost money? We have a score from the Congressional Budget \nOffice over the life of this bill. They have gimmicked it up to make it \nlook as though there is an advantage in the short term, but it is not. \nOver the long term, the Government Accountability Office told us that \nit is going to add at least $6 trillion to the debt of the United \nStates over the next 75 years. That is close to how much our unstable \nSocial Security will add to the deficit of America. So we have Social \nSecurity, we have Medicare that is even a larger unfunded mandate than \nSocial Security over the next 75 years, and we are adding another $6 \ntrillion to it? And the American people do not want it.\n  This was a recent paper from the University of Chicago economist \nCasey Mulligan who found that by 2015, a little over a year from now, \nthe work disincentives in ObamaCare will have essentially erased all \ngains in labor productivity over the last decade.\n  We know this legislation is hammering the American economy. Do you \nnot listen to colleagues? I traveled my State in August. I had several \nmeetings with small businesses. It just pours out. Business are trying \nto keep their number of employees below 50 so they will not be \nimpacted. They are putting people on part time.\n  Let me say we have never seen this in America. It has never happened \nto us before in our history, in my knowledge, nothing close to it. We \nhave had marginal job gains since January, hampered fundamentally by a \nlot of things, but ObamaCare being one of them--clearly one of them. \nBut more dramatically, 77 percent of the jobs that were created in this \ncountry since January were part time, caused many ways by the ObamaCare \nmatter. Clearly, we have been told repeatedly that businesses are \nhiring people part time to avoid the mandates of this terrible, \ndisastrous legislation. So they have decided: In for a penny, in for a \npound, as James Carville said, I guess. We are going to stick and we \nare not going to allow it to come up for improvement, we are not going \nto allow it to come up for debate.\n  I know Republicans have all indicated they support a way to deal with \npreexisting illnesses in America. We can work on that. We can do a \ndeal, legislation so that young people can stay on parents' policies \nlonger. Those things are all possible. What about people not getting \njobs? What about people getting part-time jobs with no health \ninsurance? This is not a waste of time. Write it down: This is just the \nbeginning. As John Paul Jones said: We have just begun to fight.\n\n  We are not going to allow this country to socialize medicine. That is \nwhat the goal is, and we are not going to allow it. We are going to \nfight it, fight it, fight it, and we are going to demand that this \nlegislation come back so it can be improved and made to work. It is not \nworking now. It is a train wreck, and it is hampering this economy.\n  Allan Meltzer, the famed economist, testified yesterday at the Budget \nCommittee. Mr. Meltzer said he first testified before Congress in 1949. \nHe was so good and so clear. I think he is 91 years old. There is no \ndoubt that he is one of the most distinguished economists over the last \n50 years. He has written a number of books. He said 77 percent of \nworkers being hired part time is directly attributable to ObamaCare. He \nsaid it is bringing down employment rates. It is creating uncertainty \nin the economy, of which there is no doubt. I don't think anybody can \ndeny that.\n  People are losing jobs, and they are working at part-time jobs, and \nit is hammering the economy, creating uncertainty, lack of growth, and \nit is going to continue to do so, and rates have gone up.\n  We can improve the current system of health care. There is no doubt \nabout that. But I am telling you, we do not need to have a system of \nhealth care in America that is run by the U.S. Government. We do not \nneed to do that.\n  We can all disagree about the right procedures to move forward in \nthis body. Senator Cruz stood courageously in order to highlight this \nissue, and it has served a valuable national purpose. I thank him for \nit.\n  It is time for all of us to confront the reality that this is not \nworking. It is hurting America. It has to be fixed, and we are going to \ninsist on it as time goes by.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Arizona be given 15 minutes and that I have 5 minutes \nafter him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, not 15 minutes of our time, 15 minutes \nof their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority does not have 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. He can use whatever time he needs from us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, a point of information. I am in order \nafter the Senator from Arizona?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I won't take a lot of time here on the \nfloor. The floor has been well used over the last day or so.\n  I would like to make sure my colleagues--especially those who were \nnot here in 2009--understand that there are many of us who are opposed \nto ObamaCare, as it is called, or the Affordable Care Act. We mounted \nan opposition in 2009.\n  It is a matter of record that the Senate Finance Committee considered \nthe Affordable Care Act over several weeks and approved the bill on \nOctober 13, 2009. At that time members of the Finance Committee \nsubmitted 564 amendments, 135 amendments were considered, 79 rollcall \nvotes were taken, and 41 amendments were adopted.\n  Then the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \napproved the Affordable Care Act by a vote of 13 to 10. After a month-\nlong debate, 500 amendments were considered, and more than 160 \nRepublican amendments were accepted. Then it came to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  The Affordable Care Act was on the floor for 25 straight days, \nincluding weekends, between Thanksgiving and Christmas of 2009. There \nwere 506 amendments filed, 228 of which were Republican, 34 rollcall \nvotes were held. Most of the rollcall votes resulted in party-line \nvotes, including a motion which I had to commit the bill to the Finance \nCommittee for a rewrite.\n  The final passage of the bill--because of our insistence in \nexercising every reasonable parliamentary procedure we could--took \nplace on Christmas Eve of 2009, much to the discomfort of many of my \ncolleagues. We fought as hard as we could in a fair and honest manner, \nand we lost. One of the reasons we lost was because we were in the \nminority. In democracies the majority almost always governs and passes \nlegislation.\n  I was extremely proud of the effort that we on this side of the aisle \nmade to attempt to defeat what we thought was a measure that was not \ngood for America. I think it was an interesting and educational debate.\n  I see my friend from Illinois is here. On several occasions he and I \nhad debates on the floor of the Senate, in which, of course, I won \nevery one.\n  The fact is this legislation was hard fought and went through the \nlegislative process. I didn't like the end of it, but I am proud of the \neffort we made and, frankly, the other side of the aisle allowed that \ndebate to take place. We finally finished up on December 24, 2009, at \n7:05 a.m. So to somehow allege that many of us haven't fought hard \nenough does not comport with the actual action that took place on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  Many of those who are in opposition right now were not here at the \ntime and did not take part in that debate, and I respect that. But I \nwould like to remind them that the Record is very clear that this was \none of the most hard-fought and fair, in my view, debates that has \ntaken place on the floor of the Senate in the time I have been here.\n  Then I would remind my colleagues that in the 2012 election, \nObamaCare, as it is called--and I will be more polite, the ACA--was a \nmajor issue in the campaign. I campaigned all over America for 2 months \neverywhere I could,\n\n[[Page S6842]]\n\nand in every single campaign rally, I said: We have to repeal and \nreplace ObamaCare. Well, the people spoke. They spoke, much to my \ndismay, but they spoke and reelected the President of United States.\n  That doesn't mean that we give up our efforts to try to replace and \nrepair ObamaCare, but it does mean that elections have consequences and \nthose elections were clear in a significant majority. The majority of \nthe American people supported the President of the United States and \nrenewed his stewardship of this country.\n  I don't like it. It was not something that I wanted the outcome to \nbe, but I think all of us should respect the outcome of elections which \nreflects the will of the people.\n  We just went through a long many-hour--I can't call it a filibuster \nbecause a filibuster is intended to delay passage of legislation. There \nwas no doubt that there was a time certain that time on the floor would \nhave to expire. So I guess the kindest depiction I can say is that \nthere was an extended oratory that took place for many hours on the \nfloor of the Senate, which is the right of any Senator to do. I respect \nthat right, and obviously the longevity of the discussion was something \nthat was certainly admirable. But during the course of that discussion \nconducted by my friend from Texas, he said:\n\n       If you go back to the 1940s, Nazi Germany. Look, we saw in \n     Britain, Neville Chamberlain, who told the British people, \n     ``Accept the Nazis. Yes, they'll dominate the continent of \n     Europe, but that's not our problem. Let's appease them. Why? \n     Because it can't be done. We cannot possibly stand against \n     them.''\n\n  Then he went on to say:\n\n       I suspect those same pundits who say it can't be done, if \n     it had been in the 1940s we would have been listening to them \n     . . . and they would have been saying, ``You cannot defeat \n     the Germans.''\n\n  I resoundingly reject that allegation. That allegation, in my view, \ndoes a great disservice for those brave Americans and those who stood \nup and said: What is happening in Europe cannot stand. When the ship \nwas turned back and the passengers on that ship were sent directly to \nthe gas chambers, when Czechoslovakia fell and the slaughter continued, \nthere were many who raised their voices. Then there were those who went \nto war because of the barbaric and great threat to civilization and \neverything we stand for. Amongst them were my father and grandfather.\n  I do not agree with that comparison. I think it is wrong, and I think \nit is a disservice to those who stood and shouted at the top of their \nlungs that we cannot appease and that we must act and we did act. It is \na disservice to those who did act.\n  I spoke to Senator Cruz about my dissatisfaction about his use of \nthis language, and he said he only intended it to be applied to pundits \nand not to Members of the Senate. I find that a difference without a \ndistinction. I find that something that I think I had to respond to.\n  I do not begrudge Senator Cruz or any other Senator who wants to come \nand talk as long as they want or as long as they can, depending on the \nrules of the Senate, but I do disagree strongly to allege that there \nare people today who are like those prior to World War II who didn't \nstand and oppose the atrocities that were taking place in Europe.\n  I have an open and honest disagreement with the process of not \nagreeing to move forward with legislation, which I agree with, that was \npassed through the House of Representatives. Comparing that to those \nwho were the appeasers, as Senator Cruz described them, is an \ninappropriate place for debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 15 minutes remaining for the \nmajority and no time remains for the minority.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Senator Schumer is going to come to the floor shortly. As \nsoon as he arrives, I will yield to him. I would like to respond to \nSenator McCain's remarks. Senator McCain's father, grandfather, and \nson--I am sure there are other family members as well--have made an \nextraordinary contribution to this country, and I know he has a great \ndeal of pride in that. I am proud to count him as a friend and fellow \ncolleague in the Senate. We have debated at least to a draw on several \noccasions, and I respect him very much even when we disagree. We \nstarted in Congress with Senator Reid and Senator McCain and I together \nin the House in 1982. I hope his statement is taken for face value. We \nrespect very much all of those who have stood and fought for America, \nand though we may have many differences politically on the floor on \nissues, we will never question those who have risked and given their \nlives in defense of this great Nation.\n\n  At the risk of taking more time than I should, at the conclusion of \nthis debate, we will have an important vote on the floor of the Senate. \nIt is a vote on cloture on the motion to proceed. Basically, what it \nsays is this: Shall we proceed to consider the bill that was sent to us \nby the House of Representatives?\n  The bill sent to us by the House is not one I agree with. I hope we \ncan change it. But I certainly believe it would be a serious mistake \nfor us not to give the 60 votes necessary to proceed to debate on this \nbill. That would literally bring us to a point where the government \nfaces a shutdown. I don't want that to occur. Whatever one may have as \na position on the Affordable Care Act or any other provision, I hope we \nhave a resounding, positive, bipartisan vote to proceed to the debate.\n  Thirty hours after that, we will vote on the motion to proceed and \nthen we will talk about bringing this bill to a close. Senator Reid has \nmade it clear that he wants to move this through as quickly as possible \nin an orderly fashion so everyone has a chance to state their positions \non the important issues that are before us.\n  What I feel about it is very basic. First, we have a responsibility \nto fund this government. One of my assignments is chairman of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee. It is an awesome assignment. \nAlmost 60 percent of all of the domestic discretionary spending of the \nU.S. Government goes through this one subcommittee. It funds our \nDepartment of Defense and our intelligence agencies. Any failure or any \nreduction or delay we have in bringing this matter forward can \njeopardize their important activities securing the safety of our \nNation.\n  I see my colleague Senator Schumer has returned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Madam President. I thank my colleague from \nIllinois for his courtesy and I thank the Senator from Arizona for his \noutstanding remarks, as usual.\n  For 21 hours, we have heard the Senator from Texas hold forth. What \nhas he accomplished? He has alienated many of his own colleagues. He \nhas taken 21 hours unnecessarily, although he is entitled to speak when \nhe wants, because the vote would have occurred whether he said 10,000 \nwords, 1 word or no words. So as Leader Reid said, this was not a \nfilibuster. But, most of all, he has shown the American people what he \nis willing to do.\n  We all know the Senator from Texas has very strong views about \nObamaCare. Fair enough. That is why we have a Senate. There is a time \nand a place to debate them. But he, in his view that he is right and \neveryone else is wrong, is willing not only to hold forth on the Senate \nfloor in a meaningless exercise, but, more important, urge his \ncolleagues to hold the American people hostage until everyone agrees \nwith his view. He wants to hold the cancer patient hostage who will not \nget NIH treatments if the government shuts down. He wants to throw the \nconstruction worker out of work who is doing a job that is federally \nfunded and will not be funded if the government shuts down. He wants to \ntell the recipient of Social Security that they may not get their \nchecks if there aren't enough people at the centers to send those \nchecks and make sure they get to the right place because he wants to \nshut down the government.\n  The Senator from Texas has passionate views. Fair enough. But when \nthe Senator from Texas thinks he is so right that he can trample on the \nrights not only of his own colleagues who are in a bit of a tizzy about \nwhat he has\n\n[[Page S6843]]\n\ndone, but, far more important, on the needs of the American people, \nsomething is wrong.\n  In this country, we have always eschewed ideologues--people who are \nso sure they are right they don't listen to anyone else, they don't \ncare about anyone else, and they don't care about the damage they cause \nas they pursue their goal. That seems to be what the Senator from Texas \nis doing. I was appalled last night when he tried to make the analogy \nto World War II and Hitler. As somebody who lost brothers in the \nHolocaust, to compare the two was absurd. I know my colleague from \nArizona mentioned that as well.\n  I was also surprised he used the book ``Green Eggs and Ham'' as he \nread to his daughters, because anyone who knows that book knows the \nmoral of that book is to try something before you condemn it. You might \nactually like it. The main character in ``Green Eggs and Ham'' resisted \neating green eggs and ham. Maybe if he were a Senator, he would speak \non the floor for 21 hours. But then when he tasted green eggs and ham, \nhe actually liked them. Maybe as the President's health care bill goes \ninto effect, Senator Cruz may actually find that he and his \nconstituents actually like it.\n  So the bottom line is very simple. There is a time and a place, as \nthe Scriptures say. We will certainly debate ObamaCare in the 2014 \nelections. I would note we did in the 2012 elections and not a single \nDemocrat who voted for ObamaCare in this Senate lost. Every single \nperson who was up for office had voted for ObamaCare and was not \ndefeated, even though that issue was used against them over and over \nagain. If we want to have that debate again in 2014, fine, we welcome \nit. By the way, we welcome it in 2016 as well. If the Senator from \nTexas wants to have a debate on the floor of the Senate about \nObamaCare, fine. But don't hold--not just this body because his \nexercise was meaningless--don't hold the American people hostage simply \nbecause he is so sure he is right and everyone else is wrong.\n  Don't hold the Social Security recipient hostage. Don't hold the road \nworker hostage. Don't hold the person who depends on inspectors who \ninspect our food or patrol our borders hostage. Debate ObamaCare all \nyou want, but please don't threaten to shut down the government because \nyou can't get your way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I would ask if it is in order for me to \nask unanimous consent to yield back the remainder of our time and start \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would take consent.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that be the case.\n  I renew my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 195, H.J. Res. 59, a joint resolution \n     making continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2014, and \n     for other purposes.\n             Harry Reid, Barbara A.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to H.J.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and \nsworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we now start 30 hours. I would hope we can \nyield back the vast majority of that time. I have no problem with \nSenators being allowed to speak under what the rules are postcloture. \nBut I would hope we can expedite this. We have a lot to do. We should \nget there as quickly as we can.\n  As I have indicated before, every hour that we delay is an hour \ncloser to shutting down the government. There were all kinds of \narticles written today about the disaster of that. Closing the \ngovernment will hurt our gross domestic product by tens of billions of \ndollars just like that.\n  This is leading up to the real battle we have of raising the debt \nceiling; that is, to have the government pay its bills which we have \nalready incurred. So I hope everyone would keep that in mind. Again, as \nI said at some length earlier, we have wasted enough time of the \nAmerican people the last few months. Let's start moving forward and get \nthings done rather than just stalling, stalling. Everything is a big \nslow walk. We have to get past that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I certainly do not think we have been \nwasting time. We have been talking about an issue that is on the minds \nof every American as we are careening toward implementation of the \nObamaCare health care plan.\n  We have heard from Senator Cruz and others, and you will be hearing \nfrom all of us on the Republican side of the aisle as to why we object \nto Obamacare and why we are working so hard to open the door to repeal, \nto replace, to correct the inequities that exist in this particular \nlegislation. We have had discussions about this in our caucus. We are \nall prepared to come and to speak.\n  I give Senator Cruz credit for being first through the door. He chose \nto use all of the 30 hours. That is his right as a Senator. He brought \nto the attention of the American people the very issue which we are \ndebating. I think he made some very persuasive arguments. I wish to \naddress some of those in a minute.\n  He also said we need to start listening to the people. Listening to \nthe people is what all of us in the Republican Party are doing. We have \nheard their concerns. The majority leader of the House famously said of \nObamacare: ``After it is passed we will learn what is in it.'' It was \npassed without any Republican support. We have now seen what is in it \nand how it is being fully rolled out.\n  I take seriously the majority leader's point about moving this \nlegislation along, so we can get this back to the House instead of \nsending it back Monday, the day our government runs out of money at \nmidnight, and we can give the two chambers the opportunity to go back \nand forth and debate. I think that is important.\n  So I will shorten my remarks in that regard. While I was not here \nwhen Congress passed the health care law and I was not here when this \nlaw was written in the backrooms restructuring one-sixth of our entire \neconomy, I was\n\n[[Page S6844]]\n\nwatching what was happening with dismay. I was watching the world's \nbest health care system--people from all over the world come here for \ntheir health care provisions if they have any kind of a crisis--I was \nwatching that being wrapped into one gigantic piece of legislation that \ntried to take one-sixth of our entire economy and structure it into a \nlaw which, as we are finding now, just simply is not working.\n  I have testimonials from people. I have been all over the State of \nIndiana. During my campaign year of 2010, this was the biggest issue. \nThis was the issue. I visited with providers and hospitals and patients \nand those receiving benefits in our health care system.\n  I can guarantee you I would not be here today if the people of \nIndiana thought Obamacare was a good idea, that this was in their best \ninterests going forward. I have continued to travel across the State, \nmeeting with people, health care providers, and citizens on the street. \nTheir messages have poured in by the hundreds every day during the last \nfew weeks on this issue that we are debating right now.\n  I recently have spent the weeks back in Indiana talking to people \nabout this. So it is very important that we not just simply rush this \nthrough or waste time--wasting time is certainly not the case. I take a \nbackseat to no one in terms of my desire to replace this bill with \nsomething far more sensible. I have offered a number of proposals, \nwhich I think would be more sound, sensible, cost-effective, quality, \neffective health care proposals that many others have also put forward. \nTo simply say there is nothing we can change, there is nothing we can \naddress is to deny the very conclusions of many of our colleagues who \noriginally voted for this legislation or who are still supporting this \nbill, the so-called train wreck coming down the line. We have to fix \nthis. We have to make adjustments. We have to modify this law. Yet, \nwhen we get the opportunity where we have the opportunity to do that, \nthe door is slammed shut. It is all or nothing, my way or the highway \nas someone said.\n  That is the story that came from the White House.\n  What I wish to share--and I know my colleague from Oklahoma is going \nto go into more detail--is how even as we have worked through this \nissue and had a difference of opinion in terms of how to best achieve \nthis, the goal is to replace Obamacare. The reality we have to live up \nto and recognize is a hard truth: Republicans are a minority here in \nthe Senate. We are united, every one of us, 46--46 is short of 51, and \nit takes 51 in order to make a change.\n  We have seen no evidence whatsoever that any Democrat is willing to \ncross the aisle and join with us in trying to bring some constructive \nchanges to this law. We are going to need at least five of them to \ncross that aisle and join us in a vote if we are going to make a \ndifference, if we are going to have an opportunity to do what all 46 of \nus would like to do and what I think the majority of the American \npeople would like to do.\n  I can't speak for people in States outside of my State. Although I \nread the news, I think the stories are the same. I can speak for the \npeople of Indiana. A sound majority of, Hoosiers see this bill as a \ndisaster--a disaster for their economy, a disaster for their medical \nfuture. It is not working.\n  We read about it every day. The exchanges have not been put in place. \nThere are exemptions and waivers that are shamelessly given by the \nWhite House to people who get their ear, leaving others in the lurch. \nThere are promises that have been broken repeatedly what this law will \ndo, what it will provide, how it won't hurt, and how there will be no \nnegative impact. The broken promises are too long to recite. I am \nkeeping a collection of them. It is pages of promises of what this law \nwould do. ``Fabulous'' was one of the words. None of those promises \nhave been kept.\n  That is why we are here fighting hard to address this issue, but we \ncan't do it when we are a minority. We can't achieve it. It is a hard \ntruth. It is a reality. Without five people crossing the aisle, \nRepublicans are not going to be able to go forward. In the meantime, a \ngovernment shutdown is on the verge of occuring.\n  I wish to talk about shutting down the government. It hasn't been \ntalked about here. We haven't looked at what the end result of a \nshutdown will be.\n  As we determine, as we work through, as we decide how to move forward \ntactically to achieve what we want to achieve, keep in mind that the \nPresident of the United States has not said: Gee, Americans, I am \nsorry, that Affordable Care Act was a big mistake. Give me a pen, let \nme sign this bill that repeals this, and let's start over. We will work \ntogether, and we will do it in a bipartisan manner this time.\n  I haven't heard that coming out of the White House, and I don't \nexpect to hear that coming out of the White House. I have heard exactly \nthe opposite. And I haven't heard that message from our friends across \nthe aisle instead we have heard exactly the opposite.\n  The reality is that we have to determine how we would go forward. \nSome of us would like to take a vote. We would like to put Members on \nrecord as to whether they support funding Obamacare. We would like that \nrecord to be put forth to the American people, and in the next election \nthey can decide whom they want to send back to Congress. Do they want \nto send somebody back here who supports ObamaCare or do they want to \nsend somebody back here who opposes ObamaCare?\n  The reality is that we are not going to go for a year with a \ngovernment shutdown. I wish to speak a little bit about the \nconsequences of a shutdown, and I think we need to weigh some of this \ninformation in terms of what we do so that we understand the reality \nthat exists, the hard truth that exists.\n  No. 1, shutting down the government will not stop ObamaCare. It will \nnot stop ObamaCare. The Congressional Research Service, at the request \nof Senator Coburn, who will be speaking next, has given us a \nnonpartisan report that simply says the majority of the funding for \nObamaCare is not under our control. It is mandatory. It is automatic. \nThe 13 or 14 taxes in this bill don't get stopped, so the American \npeople keep getting taxed for this law, and significantly more than \nhalf of it--I think Senator Coburn will be able to go into more detail \non this--we can't even affect.\n  So, No. 1, whatever we do here will not stop ObamaCare from moving \nforward, which is why some of us have tried to look at, OK, what is the \nnext step, what is the next alternative? We don't have the votes to \ndefeat it. We would need 13 Democrats to come across the aisle to \nsupport a sure veto by the President should 5 of our friends decide to \nsupport us in this effort. The reality is that we will need 13 \nDemocrats to override a Presidential veto, and I don't think we are \ngoing to get those. In fact, I am sure we won't.\n  What does a government shutdown mean? Let's discuss this.\n  I attended a deployment ceremony about a month ago in Indiana where \nwe sent some of our brave men and women to Afghanistan. If we shut down \nthe government, their spouses at home will not get a paycheck. Trying \nto hold down the home, maybe raising two or three children, paying the \nbills, with a husband over in Afghanistan in harm's way, putting his \nlife on the line for our defense--they don't get paid. That is a \nconsequence of a shutdown.\n  Veterans lining up for the benefits they deserve and the care they \nneed when they come home from the battlefield are going to be standing \nin a long line waiting for their applications to be processed.\n  People waiting for Social Security checks and Medicare checks and \nMedicare reimbursements--even though those will be coming, as we have \nlearned from past shutdowns, the staff won't be there to process them \non a timely basis.\n  We have a major naval facility in Indiana. Six thousand people work \nat Crane. They are doing cutting-edge work on electronic warfare and \nprevention of IED casualties. They are the go-to place for commanders \nwho need something tomorrow. We have engineers and contractors down \nthere with Ph.D.s and master's degrees from Purdue University, Rose-\nHulman, and a number of schools around the country. I have heard from \nthe Chief of Naval Operations, Marine Corps, Army, Air Force--this is \nthe go-to place for our armed services to fulfill a commander's request \non how to save the lives of the\n\n[[Page S6845]]\n\npeople they are commanding, and they have an incredible record down at \nCrane of finding solutions--usually through electronic warfare \ninitiatives--solutions to problems that are saving American lives. \nThese workers will be furloughed. Those people won't be able to work. \nWhen the commander calls in and says ``I need this next week. My guys \nare dying. I need a way to stop it,'' he will be told ``Sorry, the \ngovernment is shut down.''\n  Our defense contractors who work in those areas talked to me about \nhow critically important it is to have this capacity to save American \nlives, to help us as we address conflicts around the world and provide \na defense for the American people. Those people will not be paid; they \nwill not be at work.\n  There are some major drug manufacturers and medical device companies \nin Indiana. They have products waiting to be approved by the FDA, \nlifesaving products, improving-health products. Those will not be \nprocessed if we shut down.\n  I could go on and on.\n  I wish to add one more. The last time we had a shutdown we had 10,000 \nMedicare applicants. We hear about 10,000 baby boomers every day. In \nthe last shutdown the number was far less than this, but today, because \n10,000 Americans are retiring every day--those applicants in our past \nshutdown were all turned away. So people who have been paying into \nMedicare, people who have been waiting to enroll when they turn 65--it \nwill all be put on a hold.\n  A government shutdown suspends the hiring of local law enforcement \nand border security officials. We had a great debate, a long debate, a \ncontentious debate, and an important debate about how we need to \ntighten our border and get more agents on the border to deal with our \nimmigration problem. That will all be suspended.\n  Before we rush to judgment on how we ought to go forward, I would \nsuggest that we think about this. I would suggest that we think about \nthe fact that whatever we do here doesn't stop Obamacare \nimplementation. Whatever decision we make has consequences. We do need \nto fund this government, and we know we are not going to shut down this \ngovernment for the next 3 years and 4 months until we get a new \nPresident, so something has to give.\n  I didn't sleep through Senator Cruz's 30-hour discussion. First, I \ncommend him for bringing the issue up here and his passion about it. \nThis isn't a question of whether we are for or against, this is a \nquestion of tactics, how we can best achieve our goal. I paid \nattention. I wasn't here because obviously he was going to hold the \nfloor for the full 30-hour time. This is why I am speaking now instead \nof yesterday or last evening. All I could have done last evening was \nask a question. I tuned in. I didn't hear everything. I did get some \nsleep last night, but I listened to a fair part of what he said.\n  One of the things that caught my attention was when Senator Rand Paul \nasked what I thought was a very pertinent question relative to what is \nthe end game here. At some point--we are not going to shut the \ngovernment down forever. Somebody, something has to give.\n  He asked: Senator Cruz, would you be willing to consider some \ncompromise?\n  That got my attention because I have offered a compromise. If the \nrepeal failed and we couldn't get the Democrats to come across the \naisle, couldn't get the President to change his mind, which I didn't \nthink we could, maybe there some options or things we could accomplish.\n  I joined with the Congressman from southern Indiana, Todd Young, and \nintroduced the same bill that passed the House of Representatives in a \nbipartisan vote. I introduced it here in the Senate. The Senate \nminority leader liked it. It calls for a 1-year delay in the individual \nmandate.\n  The President has already said he is going to give employers a 1-year \ndelay. If he is going to give employers a 1-year delay to work out the \nmessy details of all of this and to try to come to a better \nresolution--acknowledging a failure of the bill and a failure of the \nadministration to get this put into place how is it fair to impose it \non individuals when he is giving employers a break?\n  A lot of people are getting kicked off their employer's insurance \nbecause of the definition of a full-time worker. That is another issue \nwhere amendments have been offered on a bipartisan basis, but we will \nnot be able to discuss it.\n  This 1-year delay for individuals will give us an opportunity to vet \nand work through these important issues. This compromise is the next \nbest thing because we can't achieve the best thing, which would be \ndefunding.\n  If it turns out that we can't fund Obamacare, at some point we are \ngoing to have to look at some type of compromise. I think, Senator Paul \nasked a legitimate question. Shouldn't we be looking at some type of \ncompromise that keeps this issue alive, gives us a chance to continue \nto debate this law and other attempts to change, modify, reform, \nrepeal, replace, whatever, and ultimately put it in front of the \nAmerican people in 2014 and say: Where do you want to go with this?\n  Well, people say we did this in 2012. In 2012 much of Obamacare had \nnot been implemented. People didn't understand what was in it. There is \nstill great confusion about this law, but we are learning more every \nday. By 2014--now that this is being implemented, we are learning a \nlot. What we have learned we don't like. It is even worse than we \nthought, worse than our worst nightmares.\n  The American people will have a chance to decide at the poll whether \nthey want to continue going forward with ObamaCare or whether they want \nsomething different.\n  I think the result will speak for itself. Maybe that is the reason \nwhy they want to rush this thing through, they didn't want to face that \npossibility. But at least that is the possibility of something that may \ngain bipartisan support, and may put us on a path to addressing this \nissue.\n  If we are not willing to come up with some alternative for which we \ncan get bipartisan support in order to keep this government going so we \ncan pay those spouses whose husbands or wives are in the line of duty \noverseas serving this country, how can we tell them they are not going \nto get paid? You have to stay on duty, you can't come home and take \nanother job, you can't take off your uniform. They are overseas putting \ntheir lives on the line.\n  As ambassador to Germany, I spent time at Landstuhl, the hospital in \nGermany that cares for all the wounded and critically wounded troops, \njust hours after an IED has taken off their legs or their arms. In \nvisiting those soldiers, I can't help but think how we tell them they \nare not going to get their pay because Washington says that if a goal \nis not achieved now, that is it. The government is shut down.\n  So I am just asking my colleagues, before we make a decision on this \nnow, to consider those spouses at home raising kids while their husband \nor wife is on the front line of duty. Better think about those veterans \ncoming home who need help, who have brain injuries or wounds that need \nto be addressed. You need to think about those people turning 65 and \nretiring and who want to apply now for Medicare because their company \nhas dropped them. You need to think about those individuals out there \nwho will be mandated while employers get a break. You need to think \nabout all the consequences here before we rush to some kind of false \njudgment that a shutdown isn't going to really affect us. It is. The \nPresident is not going to take the microphone and say: Folks, I am so \nsorry. I am so sorry I brought this health care law forward. This thing \nisn't working. I am hearing it, too, I am hearing it back home. So, \nyes, let's reopen the government and repeal and replace the health care \nlaw. I wish he would, but we know he won't say that.\n  I am asking my colleagues to weigh all these things before we come to \na final conclusion on this and let us not be lured into the seduction \nof saying this vote will determine whether or not we will ever be able \nto deal with this Obamacare issue. And this is not even a substantive \nvote. It is not even a vote on the issue itself. It is simply a vote on \nmoving forward to debate. It is nearly impossible to explain our \nprocedural motions around here But this isn't an up-or-down vote on \nObamaCare, this is a procedural vote.\n  I know Senator Cruz would like to turn it into ``the vote'' in order \nto prevent something else from happening. I personally think that is a \ntactic that won't work, but we share the same\n\n[[Page S6846]]\n\ngoal. I am not criticizing Senator Cruz. He has energized people, he \nhas brought this issue forward, and I support that. But let's think \nabout the end game and let's think about what may or may not be \naccomplished by our decisions and let's make sure we weigh the \nconsequences of our next action and its impact on the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I also rise to speak on the continuing \nresolution. We are coming up on the 150th anniversary of the most \nfamous speech ever given in America, the Gettysburg Address, delivered \nby Abraham Lincoln in Gettysburg, PA, in November of 1863. In that \naddress, President Abraham Lincoln, the founder of the modern \nRepublican Party, talked about the meaning of the battle and stated \nthat all Americans should resolve that ``government of the people, by \nthe people and for the people shall not perish from the earth.''\n  That is what we are debating today. Should the American government be \ndefunded and shut down? Should our government perish? The answer to \nthis question is easy and obvious: Of course not. Of course not.\n  If a shutdown threat to the American government were external, \nbecause of an act perpetrated by an enemy or anthrax put in the mail \nand sent to us, the American people would rally with every ounce of \ntheir energy to battle against a government shutdown. That is what is \nso amazing. There is a proposal on the table by a faction of Congress \nthemselves to shut the government down. Not an external enemy but a \nproposal by Members of Congress, a faction in both Houses, to shut the \ngovernment down.\n  Last night on the floor of the Senate, I presided and then I took to \nmy feet and asked the Senator from Texas a basic question: Will you \nvote against the funding and continuation of government if you do not \nget your wish on the defunding of ObamaCare? And his answer was very \nsimple: Yes. Yes. In his view, and in the view of others who support \nthis position, after 237 years of our national life, if you do not get \nyour way on one issue that is important to you, it is acceptable to \nshut down the American government.\n  Needless to say--and the Senator from Indiana did a good job of \nsaying it--the consequences of shutdown are severe. The 26 days of \nshutdown in 1995 and 1996 cost taxpayers $1.4 billion by the estimate \nof the Congressional Budget Office.\n  As Senator Coats mentioned, our Active-duty military are required to \nstay on duty, but they do not get paid. Their paychecks get delayed and \nthen we have to come back and try to figure out a way to pay them late. \nThey and their families don't deserve that treatment.\n  Many civilians working in our military, army nurses, for example, \nmight get furloughed and not paid, as well as cyber security \nprofessionals, aviation mechanics, and I mentioned army nurses.\n  We won't take new applications for Medicare as people become eligible \nfor Medicare. In 1996, 10,000 seniors a day who were becoming eligible \nfor Medicare were turned away every day during the government shutdown. \nThere will be 2.4 million Federal workers who won't get paid in a \ngovernment shutdown, hurting their families. Many of those get \nfurloughed, so whether it is meat inspectors or cancer researchers or \nfolks who are negotiating trade deals to improve the economy, they will \nnot be able to do the work the Nation needs them to do.\n  And private businesses, such as the Newport News Shipyard, the \nmanufacturers of the most sophisticated manufactured items on Earth \nfind that their contracts are put in question and their employees are, \ntherefore, put at risk.\n  A shutdown is a huge blow to our economy and jobs. Make no mistake, \nthese economic consequences of a shutdown are negative. Yesterday the \nBudget Committee held a hearing. We had both majority and minority \nwitnesses--economists. I asked each of them: Would a government \nshutdown under current circumstances hurt the economy? They all \nanswered: Yes. I asked them: Is even the threat of a shutdown harmful \nto the economy? They all answered: Yes.\n\n  And furthermore, the economic consequences of a shutdown are even \nmagnified by the economic consequences of a potential default on \nAmerica's debt. Some are threatening default on America's debt if we \ndon't defund ObamaCare. This is also economically irresponsible--not \npaying our bills for the first time in 237 years as a Nation. America \npaid its bills when Washington was burning during the War of 1812. \nAmerica paid its bills during the Civil War. The entire world knows \nthey can bank on the full faith and credit of the United States. Our \nConstitution says that the validity of public debt of the United States \nshall not be questioned.\n  Those who threaten to repudiate our fiscal obligations or to shut \ndown our government are engaging in economically destructive behavior.\n  It is painfully obvious we should not shut down government, that we \nshould not default on our fiscal obligations. So why are we even having \na discussion about shutdown and default? What has brought us to a place \nwhere these unthinkable actions are being discussed and even promoted \nby some in both Houses of Congress? Simple. Some Members of both Houses \nare opposed to the Affordable Care Act. They are committed to repealing \nit or defunding it at all cost, even accepting a government shutdown or \ndefault on the debt of this Nation.\n  What do we say to those who hold that view? First, to be plain, I \noppose those who want to defund or repeal the Affordable Care Act, \nbecause repealing or defunding it would mean millions of Americans who \nwill be able to access affordable care through health insurance \nexchanges would lose that ability. It will mean that nearly 7 million \nyoung adults would lose coverage they have been able to gain through \ntheir family's insurance policies. It would mean seniors would be \nstripped of Medicare coverage for certain preventive care, and also \nMedicare coverage to reduce prescription drug costs. It would mean \nsmall businesses will lose tax credits they can access if they insure \ntheir employees. And this is a personal one to me--I have experienced \nthis in my family--that people with a health history will once again be \nfree to be turned away by insurance companies because they have a \npreexisting health condition. Consumers who are getting rebates from \ninsurance companies who overcharge them will stop getting rebate \nchecks. In the States that have decided to embrace the Medicaid \nexpansion of the Affordable Care Act, an estimated 5 million people who \nare now on the verge of being insured will have that protection taken \naway from them.\n  So for all those reasons I oppose repeal.\n  Last year, I told my voters in Virginia that I opposed efforts to \nrepeal the Affordable Care Act, and I had an opponent who pledged to \nrepeal the Affordable Care Act. The voters heard both of those \npositions and they rejected repeal and they embraced to keeping it in \nplace and improving it.\n  Last year, the President of the United States campaigned on \ncontinuing the Affordable Care Act and being open to improvements. He \ncampaigned against someone who said it should be repealed or defunded, \nand the American public, by a large majority, said we don't want \nrepeal, we want to continue forward and to reform and improve.\n  The American public does not want repeal. The American public does \nnot want defunding. The American public does not want default. The \nAmerican public does not want shutdown. They are open to reform and \nimprovement.\n  Let me be clear: We should be open to reforming and improving the \nAffordable Care Act or any other part of our health care delivery \nsystem or any other thing we do as government. We need to be open to \nreform and improvement.\n  The Senator from Indiana was wrong in one particular thing. Many in \nthis Chamber, including Democrats, have already voted for ACA reforms \nas part of the budget we passed in March. But the minority party has \nstopped us from putting that budget into a conference now for more than \n6 months. There is a significant group of people in this body who would \nlove to talk about reform and improvements but who reject shutdown and \ndefault.\n  This gets to the nub of the issue. Last night I asked the Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S6847]]\n\nTexas about reforms he was interested in, and he laid a number of them \nout on the floor. He had some I liked and some I thought were good. I \nasked the Senator: Have you prepared any legislation to make these \nreforms? And he answered: I don't currently have a reform proposal but \nI am going to work with my staff to come up with some reform ideas.\n  This gets to the nub of the issue. There is a right way to approach \nhealth reform. Though I disagree with it, there is also a right way to \napproach a repeal of the Affordable Care Act or defunding the \nAffordable Care Act. Here is what you do: If you have a better idea, \nintroduce a health reform bill with your own ideas and try to convince \nyour legislative colleagues that you have a better answer or \nparticipate in debate about the budget or about an appropriations bill \nand make your argument about the appropriate level of funding for the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  The Senator from Texas and every legislator has the ability to raise \nwhatever reforms or whatever funding or defunding ideas they want in \nthese ways. Make your case, argue your position, try to convince your \ncolleagues, and then accept the outcome. But do not threaten to shut \ndown the government of the United States if you don't get your way, if \nyou are not able to convince your colleagues that you have a better \nanswer. Do not threaten to default on America's fiscal obligations if \nyou don't get your way, if you can't convince your colleagues that you \nhave a better answer.\n  There is absolutely no reason to jam your plan to overturn a law \npassed by Congress, signed by the President, and affirmed by the \nSupreme Court, into the very gears of the American government. Do not \nlet your opinion on one issue threaten not only government operations \nbut the economy of the United States.\n  In other words, let's talk about reform. Let's talk about \nimprovements. Let's do it the right way, not the wrong way. Let's \nseparate those discussions out from all the threats of shutdown or \ndefault. If we are willing to do that, I think we will be able to get \nsomewhere.\n  To conclude, I want to go back to where I started. I ask my Senate \ncolleagues, avoid all the brinkmanship and promptly approve a \ncontinuing resolution to fund the continuation of American government. \nStrip away the separate issues that should be debated and considered \nseparately, and let the House vote on the simple question of whether \nthey believe that American government, after 237 years, shall continue. \nWe have come far, we have achieved so much, and we have much work still \nto do.\n  Government by, of, and for the people is not perfect and it will \nnever be perfect. But I am resolved--and I hope all my colleagues are \nresolved--that government by, of, and for the people shall not perish--\nnot for 1 year, not for 1 month, not for 1 week, not for 1 day, not for \n1 hour, not for 1 minute. Government shall not perish on this Earth.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have spent a lot of time in the last few \nweeks and listening last night to the Senator from Texas make a big \npoint that Members of Congress in his opinion were not listening to the \nAmerican people. I have a lot of experience listening. As a physician \nthat is what I got paid to do.\n  I think the motives of Senator Cruz and some of his allies in the \nSenate are pure. Their tactics are tremendously erroneous, in my \nopinion, but I want to draw a picture for you in a minute about this \nidea of listening and what it means.\n  Even though I disagree with their tactics, I admire their spirit and \ntheir vigor. Having delivered 4,000 babies, I have had a lot of \nsleepless nights. I have gone 2 or 3 days with 2 or 3 hours of sleep \nover that period of time to care for people.\n  But I would make this point: As a physician, the first thing you are \ntaught in medical school is to listen to your patient and they will you \nwhat is wrong with them. So we do have to spend time listening to our \nconstituencies.\n  But doctors don't just listen to the patient. They observe the \npatient, they examine the patient, they do tests on the patient, and \nthen can combine all that listening with all the other data they have \ncollected, and then they make a decision about giving advice to that \npatient. They give what is called informed consent.\n  That is the big story that hasn't been told to the thousands and \nthousands of people from Oklahoma who have called my office. They \nhaven't been given informed consent. They have been sold a bill of \ngoods. When I have young interns and young staff in my office taking \nsignificant calls from people who have been misled, there is no way you \nare going to talk them out of a position that outside interest groups \nand a small number of people inside the Senate have planted. So I want \nto spend a few minutes addressing this. Then I want to go back to the \npatient for a minute, because in my broad experience of treating \neverything from newborn babies to grandmas to broken bones to gall \nbladders to you name it, I have gained a little bit of experience on \nhow you judge inputs of information.\n  What we have had outlined--and I want those people who call my office \nto listen to this. What we have had outlined is a group of people who \nsaid somebody has a terribly swollen knee, and if you don't fix it they \nare not going to be able to walk, and that we have got to fix it right \nnow. Nothing else matters. We have to fix it right now. Except they \nhave a staph infection in their knee, a methicillin-resistant staph \ninfection in that knee. But because we don't listen to all the facts \nand we didn't do all the studies, they don't recognize that that staph \ninfection has already infected the heart valve.\n  The knee is what is red and hot and what they are complaining about, \nbut the good physician will do the tests, the studies, the listening, \nand the exam and find out what the real problem is. The staph infection \nin the knee came from the staph infection in the heart. If you don't go \nafter treating the heart of the problem, it doesn't matter if you cure \nthe knee; the patient is going to be dead.\n  That is what we have had put upon us by some of my colleagues. They \nhave been misdirected in terms of what the real problems are.\n  I would say nobody fought harder against the Affordable Care Act as a \npracticing physician than I did. I was still practicing, being a \nSenator at that time. I was still delivering babies on the weekends in \nOklahoma.\n  Senator McCain said it was a fair process. It wasn't a fair process. \nThe one bill that actually would have solved our health care problems \nnever got a vote on the floor of the Senate. It is called the Patient's \nChoice Act. The majority leader wouldn't allow a vote on that \namendment. It was a complete substitute. It actually fixed the real \nproblems, and did so without putting the government between you and \nyour doctor. But let me go back.\n  What Senator Reid, the majority leader, has said is right. What is \nthe Affordable Care Act about? It is about ultimately getting to a \nsingle-payer system where the government controls all of health care. \nSo Senator Cruz and Senator Lee aren't wrong about worrying about it, \naren't wrong about wanting to change it. But we have a whole lot bigger \nproblems than the Affordable Care Act. It is just one of them.\n  I want to spend a little bit of time talking about what this debate \nhas taken our attention away from. The real problem in our country \nright now is that we are bankrupt. Our total unfunded obligations of \nthe Federal Government are $124 trillion. The entire net worth of the \nentire country is only $94 trillion. We are $30 trillion in the hole \nand growing that hole. What that means is we are leaving a legacy of \npauperism and debtor's prison to our children and our grandchildren.\n\n  So while we have had this big debate, nobody is focused on the fact \nthat Washington is still lying about the numbers up here, including the \nbill that came across from the House. I am going to spend a little bit \nof time going through that so we can refocus on the infected heart \ninstead of looking at the infected knee.\n  I am very glad they have raised the issue. The problem is we are \ndouble-minded and double-speaking when we\n\n[[Page S6848]]\n\ntalk about the numbers. Let me show this for a minute.\n  Congress, the President, the House, and the Senate voted for the \nBudget Control Act. We made a promise. We said we recognize we have \nsome problems. The first thing we can do is we can start addressing \nsome of those problems through discretionary spending. You had all of \nthese claims that we made all these savings, over $2 trillion. Well, \nhere are the real numbers. The real numbers are, in 2011, the base \ndiscretionary spending was $1.062 trillion. By the time you add up the \nemergency spending, the troops, spending for the war, we spent $1.221 \ntrillion. In 2012, as we worked this Budget Control Act through, the \nbase spending was $1.043 trillion. Real spending, when you add in \neverything else that was spent through emergencies and everything else, \nwe spent $1.198 trillion. This is the discretionary spending. In 2013 \nthrough the Budget Control Act, the base according to that was $988 \nbillion. With all the extra things we allowed, emergency spending, war \nspending, et cetera, we spent $1.145 trillion.\n  According to the CBO, reading what the law is and the promise to the \nAmerican people, this next year it is supposed to be $967 billion. If \nyou add what is expected in war and discretionary spending through \nemergencies, it is to be $1.114 trillion.\n  So what have we done? By forcing a discussion about the wasteful \nspending, we have set us on a path to slowly actually cut actual \ndiscretionary spending, something we are going to have to do if we are \nnot going to have our kids in debtor's prison.\n  What is the bill we have coming over here? The bill we have coming \nover here is $985 billion. So it is $18 billion bigger than what we \npromised you just last year. Besides that, it is even $18 billion \nhigher because we have got fake pay-fors in there, so it is actually \n$18 billion higher than that and something we call CHIMPS, where we \nassume something that we have assumed the year before but didn't count \nit the year before and will count it again this year. It is the type of \naccounting that anybody in a publicly-held company in this country \nwould go to jail for. They would be convicted and go to jail. But what \nwe agreed to in the Budget Control Act is 2014 would be the last year \nof discretionary cuts; then every year after that it would rise by 2.5 \npercent, i.e., the estimated rate of inflation, and that we could \nchange the mix and we could get there. But we are not doing that.\n  Just to show, the spending is still going to rise. The discretionary \nspending is still going to rise. Here it is in terms of baseline and \nactual, and you can see we are not cutting spending anymore after this \nyear. It is going up.\n  Which begs the question: What are we doing with this continuing \nresolution? We are breaking our word that we gave you last year and the \nyear before. We can't help ourselves. We are addicted.\n  You can say--as Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader in the other party, \nhas said--there is not anything else left to cut in discretionary \nspending. Of course, that belies the fact that the Government \nAccountability Office has listed 165 different sets of duplicative \nspending, wasteful duplicative spending--that is $250 billion a year--\nthat if the Congress would do its job you could save half of that. So \ninstead of doing this, we can be doing this.\n  What does that mean? That means your children have a brighter future. \nThat means we don't waste money. We clean up the fraud and corruption \nin the Federal Government. That is what it means.\n  There are points of order that can be raised against this bill and I \nam hopeful we will do it because we violate the Budget Control Act. If \n60 Senators want to say we don't care what we promised you before, we \nhave to spend more money, then they will vote. They have to have 60-\nplus votes to waive that budget point of order. I predict they probably \nwill because we cannot help ourselves. I will not, but we are going to \nspend more money than what we just last year promised the American \npeople we would do.\n  Of course, that doesn't address any of the real problems that are \nfacing our country, which are the mandatory programs. I want to give \njust a short flavor of some of the programs. I will just take green \nbuildings, for example.\n  I ask unanimous consent to use an oversized chart on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. If you just look at this, nobody in their right mind \nwould create this. But of course Congress is not in its right mind. We \nwould not have a $750 billion deficit if we were in our right mind. \nHere it is for all the green building programs in the country.\n  We have in this different departments that are running a multitude of \nprograms that all do the same. A cogent person would say if it is good \nto have green building programs, why don't we have one? Why don't we \ncreate a czar of green building programs, put him in charge, and let's \nhave one set of grants, one set of incentives and one bureaucracy that \nruns it. But we have not done that.\n  Let me just go through, for a moment, this series of duplications \nthat the Government Accountability Office has outlined and just see if \nyou think we are doing our job. See if you think we are doing the \noversight we should be doing.\n  Here is the first group. We have 15 unmanned aerial aircraft \nprograms, of which we are going to spend $37 billion over the next 5 \nyears. Why do we have 15? Maybe we need one for each branch of the \nservice and they could subcontract what they deliver to Homeland \nSecurity if we need those for homeland security or for the intelligence \nagencies. Why do we have 15?\n  We have 18 different food programs running through 23 agencies at $26 \nbillion a year. We have 21 homeless programs, 7 different agencies, 2.9 \nbillion. We have transportation services for transportation of \ndisadvantaged persons, 80 different programs in 8 different agencies \nspending $2 billion a year. Job training and employment, we have 47 job \ntraining programs for the nondisabled. We have 6 veteran job training \nprograms and we have over 50 job training programs for the disabled, \nspending $18 billion for the nondisabled and a total of $21 billion \ncombined.\n  What we did as the oversight in the State of Oklahoma was to look at \nthat. What GAO says on this particular one is all of these programs \noverlap one another except for three. They all do the same thing, \nexcept there is no metrics on any of them to see if they are actually \ngiving somebody a family-stabilizing, long-term job or the skills for a \nlong-term job.\n  We have 82 different teacher quality programs run by 10 different \nagencies not at the Department of Education that we are spending $4 \nbillion a year on. Food safety, military and veterans health, economic \ndevelopment, 80 different programs, $6.5 billion a year.\n  I can go on. I will not. I will not bore you. There are two other \npages, 165 sets of different duplication, over $250 billion, and here \nis what Congress has done. We have addressed 8 percent of it. There \nhave been hearings. That doesn't mean we have had an answer for it. We \nhave addressed 8 percent of them.\n  When we look at the activity of Congress, of doing real oversight to \nsolve the problems, to truly eliminate duplication, to truly eliminate \nfraud, to truly eliminate waste, most Members of Congress are not \ninterested in doing that. They do not get the glory, but it is our \noath, it is our responsibility to do that. Yet we fail to do it.\n  I heard the Senator from Virginia mention the debt limit. I am going \nto say again something I said in 2009. We do not have an income problem \nin this government, we have a spending problem. Do you realize the \naverage American spends one-quarter of their life working to fund the \nFederal Government. Think about that for a minute. You are going to \nspend one-quarter of your life working to fund it, if you count the \nunfunded liabilities that we have and count the 25 percent of GDP where \nwe are on spending today, you are going to spend one-quarter of your \nlife funding that.\n  If I remember correctly, and if I read the Constitution correctly, \nthis little book, what our Founders talked about was limited \ngovernment, not a government that consumes 25 percent of your labor to \nrun it, not a government that ignores the 10th Amendment or ignores the \nenumerated powers.\n  I introduced the Enumerated Powers Act. It is a simple act. It has 37 \ncosponsors. What it says is, before you introduce a bill on the floor \nof the Senate, you have to reference the area of the Constitution that \ngives you the authority to legislate in that area. Sad to\n\n[[Page S6849]]\n\nsay, I could not get any of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle to join on that one very simple bill that would help bring us \nback to what our Founders thought about a limited government and our \nresponsibility. Our Government is limited only to the extent to which \nit can borrow right now.\n  We have tons of structural deficits in our economy today. We have a \njob deficit in terms of creating jobs. We have a skills deficit in \nterms of matching the skills to the jobs that are available. We have a \ndemand deficit because of the overbearing overreach of the Federal \nGovernment and the regulation that is imposed upon the citizenry. We \nhave a deficit of watching out for those who cannot watch out for \nthemselves.\n  We have programs that are supposed to do it, but when you go back and \nread our Founders' vision and read the Federalist Papers and read what \nthis most wonderful government that was ever created was designed to \ndo, first and foremost it was designed to be limited because our \nFounders knew that when it became 25 percent of your labor, your \nliberty was diminished, your freedom was diminished. Of course, that \nultimately is what the fight is over, the Affordable Care Act--what \nwill it ultimately cost and how much freedom will you have when we give \nyou something that some need, what will you give up when you receive \nthat.\n\n  I will end with just the following. I think there are four questions \nthe American people ought to be asking Members of Congress right now. \nThere are four critical questions. I think too often we fail in \nanswering these questions. Here they are.\n  Are you leading in such a way as to restore confidence in ourselves, \nour Government, and our institutions? Are you trying to unite us or are \nyou trying to divide us?\n  I already described we are bankrupt. How do we get out of it? The \nonly way we get out of it is working, coming together with real \nleadership that draws us together, that says, hey, folks, no finger-\npointing here, there are lots of mistakes made. How do we solve these \nproblems and how do we do it together without making somebody else look \nbad? How do we restore confidence we know we need?\n  I wish to tell a story. I did townhall meetings in August, and I went \nto Miami, OK. There is a wonderful plant there that grows mushrooms and \nvegetables. It is a big operation. The owner of the plant, Virgil \nJurgensmeyer, came to my townhall meeting. He is probably my age, maybe \na little older. He said: Tom, I am spending $60 or $70 thousand a month \nbuying from my competitors right now to fill my orders. I could create \na couple of hundred jobs with my own. It is not a big city. But I don't \nhave the confidence in the future of the country right now to invest $5 \nmillion and go to the bank to borrow that to create those jobs because \nI don't think we have it together as a country anymore.\n  He is not partisan. I don't know what his political leanings are. But \nwhat I do know is he has lost confidence. That has happened all across \nour country right now because we do not have leadership that does \nanything except point out what is wrong with the other side.\n  What we need is leadership that brings us together, that compromises, \nthat works to identify and solve the problems.\n  The second question I think ought to be asked is: Are you more \ninterested in the short-term political game as a legislator than you \nare the long-term problems of this country? I am a term-limited \nSenator. I set my term limit when I first ran. I have a little over 3 \nyears to go. I will never run for another office the rest of my life. I \nwould like to think that most of my thought has been about long term \nsince I have been in the Senate, not short term--of actually solving \nproblems, the long-term problems, not the short-term problems.\n  I talked about our structural deficit. We have to get after it. We \nhave to get after it now. If you look at the political dynamic, right \nnow is the only time between now and the next Presidential election \nthat it will be positive for Republicans and Democrats to join hands \ntogether to solve the problems of Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, \nand our structural deficit. We have less than 3\\1/2\\ months to come to \nan agreement to do that because the political dynamics will never allow \nthat to happen until after the next Presidential election because \neverybody will be pointing fingers.\n  Wouldn't it be nice if we had the leadership that saw Republicans and \nDemocrats come together, compromise, fix these problems? Even if you \nlose your election, fix the problem for the country, fix the problem \nfor the children, fix the problem for our grandchildren.\n  But the selfishness of careerism drives us to do what is politically \nexpedient and what is popular rather than what is right.\n  The third question: Are you willing to look at this institution of \ngovernment and ensure that we are not wasting, duplicating or being \ndefrauded in the programs that we authorize through a congressional \ncontinuing resolution? The answer to that question is we are being \ndefrauded every day. We have waste every day that we are not working \non, and we have duplication like crazy from the GAO that we are not \neven attempting to fix. I have to take my hat off to the President. If \nwe look at his budget, he took more of the GAO recommendations that \nthey made and put them into his budget than we have even considered in \nboth the House and the Senate. At least he is listening to someone. \nThey actually acted on them in his budget for the fiscal year 2014.\n  The question on this third question is: Do you have the political \ncourage to fix what is wrong and compromise on the solutions to fix \nwhat is wrong? The GAO has told us what is wrong. Yet we fail to \naddress it.\n  Then, finally, and maybe this is more of an Oklahoma thing--I hope \nnot--but do you actually believe what the Constitution says about a \nlimited role for Federal Government? Do we vote to ensure that the 10th \nAmendment that our Founders added is brought up-to-date and is \nrevered? Unfortunately, that is hardly ever a concern in the Senate.\n\n  I have been here over 9 years. We don't worry about the enumerated \npowers. We want to fix those, and in our good desire to fix things, we \ntrample the Constitution. So now we are $17 trillion in debt. We have \n$124 trillion in unfunded liabilities, and that is growing every day.\n  So the one thing this debate we have had the last few days in the \nSenate has caused us to not focus on is the very thing that is the real \nproblem facing this country, which is ineffective leadership. It is \nfixing the wrong problem. It is the heart, not the knee. It is the \nheart that is infected, and we have to address fixing the heart before \nwe can ever hope to cure the knee.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his patience, and I thank the \nSenator from Missouri for his patience. We don't have one problem in \nfront of this Nation we can't fix. If we restored confidence, we would \nbe growing at 4 percent a year right now. If people had the hope that \nwe were going to do what is right, not what is expedient, and in the \nbest long-term interests for all of us--not me as a Republican and not \njust Democrats--and we had that kind of leadership, we could get out of \nour funk, we could get out of our debt, and we would be the America we \nhad when I was growing up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we find ourselves in yet another ``Alice \nin Wonderland'' moment here in the Senate. We are again on the brink of \na government shutdown for no reason other than the House Republicans' \nabsolute obsession with repealing the Affordable Care Act. Their \nstrategy isn't anything new. They are running the same old plays out of \nthe same old playbook that they have used for 3 years. None of these \nattempts have worked, but failure is no deterrent if all you care about \nis scoring political points with your political base.\n  The House has voted 42 times to repeal or defund the Affordable Care \nAct. You would think after the first 41, they might get a sense that it \nis just a waste of time. But, no, the House is at it again, risking the \nwidespread economic damage that a government shutdown would cause just \nso they can indulge their political obsession yet one more time. I sort \nof half-facetiously said last weekend that the good news is that the \nobsessive-compulsive disorder is covered under ObamaCare--just in case \nthese House Republicans might care to use it.\n  Defunding the Affordable Care Act would deprive Americans of all of \nthe\n\n[[Page S6850]]\n\nlaw's benefits, such as historic consumer protections, affordable \ncoverage, and cheaper prescription drugs, just to mention a few.\n  Work on the insurance marketplace, which will be open for business, \nas we know, next Tuesday, would stop. As a result, individuals and \nsmall businesses would no longer be able to enroll in affordable \ncomprehensive health insurance through the marketplace, nor would they \nreceive possible tax credits to help them with their premium payments.\n  In addition, the planned expansion for Medicaid would be canceled. \nSeven million Americans who are projected to enroll in the marketplaces \nnext year and 9 million through expanded Medicaid would lose their \ncoverage.\n  Over the next decade, the number of uninsured would rise by at least \n25 million Americans. As if 25 million more uninsured was not bad \nenough, this bill from the House would cancel all of the hard-earned, \nlong-awaited consumer protections that are in the law to protect every \nAmerican with insurance, such as coverage for preexisting conditions \nand coverage of young people on their parents' policies to age 26.\n  So we would kind of go back to the bad old days when insurance \ncompanies were in the driver's seat and telling you what kind of health \ninsurance you were entitled to and when and charging you outrageous \nprices for it. Instead of protecting all Americans against arbitrary \nlimits on coverage, repeal of the Affordable Care Act would take us \nback to the days when insurance companies could terminate your coverage \njust when you are the sickest. This would hurt families like Danny and \nLisa Grasshoff from Texas who were unable to find coverage that would \npay for their son's hemophilia treatment until the Affordable Care Act \nbanned lifetime limits. More than 105 million Americans are currently \nprotected by this provision, more than 105 million who are protected \nunder the Affordable Care Act.\n  Instead of allowing young people to start a new job or new business \nor go off to school and stay on their parents' policy until they are \nage 26--which they can do now under the Affordable Care Act--repeal \nwould make them fend for themselves in a chaotic insurance place that \noffers too little coverage for too much money. More than 3 million \nyoung Americans are currently covered and are taking advantage of this \nprotection. They would lose it under the House bill.\n  All 105 million Americans protected from a ban on lifetime limits \nwould lose it under the House bill.\n  Now, instead of protecting 130 million nonelderly Americans who have \npreexisting conditions--such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart \ndisease--denial of coverage repeal would put the insurance companies \nback in the driver's seat. They would be picking and choosing whom they \nwant to cover. There are 130 million Americans who are covered under \nthat ban on preexisting conditions.\n  Instead of helping all Americans prevent illness or disease by \nproviding preventive services, such as colonoscopies, repeal would \nallow insurers to charge expensive copays. Sometimes they can pay as \nmuch as $300 for these essential services.\n  I just talked to a friend of mine who recently went in for his annual \ncheckup. He got an annual checkup and advice on how he should handle \nhis health care, and there were no copays and no deductibles under the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  Repeal under the House bill would deprive States and localities of \nvital funding to combat chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and \nheart disease. Thanks to health reform, the Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund is saving lives and cutting costs by supporting such \nprograms.\n  Cutting off funding would immediately stop States' work in building \nthe health insurance marketplaces. I just mentioned that it will start \nnext Tuesday. These will be transparent, easy to understand, one-stop \nshops so individuals and small businesses can purchase affordable \ncoverage. It starts next Tuesday. These marketplaces have been endorsed \nby experts all across the political spectrum because for the first time \nthey will create a real marketplace for health insurance. Individuals \nand small businesses have the same purchasing power and choice that \nonly big companies enjoyed before. Again, this will have a direct \npocketbook impact.\n\n  Premium rates are coming in from marketplaces across the country, and \nthey are much lower than projected. In fact, my home State of Iowa \nreleased rates last week that independent experts say are some of the \nlowest in the country--in the marketplace. Well, the House bill would \ntake that away. It would stop that. Why would we want to do something \nlike that when we are providing a really good deal for consumers?\n  Most importantly, these exchanges are a centerpiece of a system that \nwill bring coverage, as I said earlier, to more than 25 million \nAmericans who otherwise would be uninsured and living with the \noppressive fever of being one illness away from bankruptcy or not \nknowing if they can afford a doctor's visit for their child. Why would \nanyone want to stop this? Why would anyone tell States: Stop what you \nare doing to serve your citizens. That is exactly what the House bill \ndoes.\n  If we pass that House bill, Congress will turn its back on America's \nseniors, tossing out hard-won improvements in Medicare benefits. It \nwould take us back to the days when Medicare prescription drug coverage \nhad a giant gap. We all know that as the doughnut hole. It is in the \nmiddle, exposing millions of seniors to the full cost of drugs just \nwhen they need the most assistance. Now, health reform closes that \ndoughnut hole step by step until 2020 when it all disappears.\n  I just received this from Iowa. The Affordable Care Act in Iowa is \nalready helping seniors on Medicare. Seniors on Medicare saved $76 \nmillion on prescription drugs because of the Affordable Care Act in \nIowa--just in Iowa, $76 million. If we adopt the House bill, it takes \nthat away. It reopens that doughnut. There are 6.6 million seniors all \nacross the country who have already saved more than $7 billion in \ndiscounts on drugs purchased in the doughnut hole. Repealing this would \nincrease senior drug prices by $5,000 a person over the next 10 years. \nWhy would we want to do that?\n  The House bill will roll back the unprecedented investments we make \nin Medicare fraud prevention. This is another little-known aspect of \nwhat we put into the Affordable Care Act. We increased criminal \npenalties, we launched innovative new technologies to detect and pursue \nfraudulent activities, and we put more cops on the beat to preserve \nMedicare funds for beneficiaries--not the quacks and the fraud \nmanipulators. Taxpayers of this country saved $8 for each $1 we put \ninto that program. If you put $1 into it, we are saving $8. Why would \nwe want to repeal that? But the House bill would repeal it.\n  It would hurt seniors' access to health care in rural areas. I come \nfrom a rural State. The Presiding Officer comes from a very rural \nState. We put Affordable Care Act incentive payments paid to rural \nprimary care providers in the Affordable Care Act. The House bill would \ntake that away.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we put provisions in the Affordable Care Act \nfor seniors to get preventive care and wellness visits with no copays \nand no deductibles. In 2012 more than 34 million American seniors got \nfree preventive services in Medicare.\n  CBO tells us that the improvements we put in the Affordable Care Act \nto the Medicare payment policy coordination and efficiency will extend \nthe life of the Medicare trust fund by another decade.\n  Republicans are always saying: Well, Medicare is going to go broke. \nOK. In the Affordable Care Act we did things that the experts say will \nextend the life of the Medicare trust fund by another decade, and they \nwant to repeal that. It just doesn't make sense.\n  Finally, we come to the most inexplicable part of this debate. \nRepublicans have played the Washington stage politically for all it is \nworth. We saw an example of that last night when one of our colleagues \non the other side kept the Senate in all night long. I think the \nSenator from Texas started off yesterday at around 2 or something like \nthat--please excuse me if I didn't pay a lot of attention to it--he \nstarted at 2 in the afternoon, and it went on all night. He kept the \nSenate here and went on this morning until about noontime, I guess.\n\n[[Page S6851]]\n\n  I respect every Senator's right to come to the floor and speak \nunhindered, just as I am doing now. Pretty soon another Senator will \nspeak unhindered, and that is one of the beauties of the Senate. I \nthink we also have a responsibility to be at least a little cognizant--\njust a little bit--of how we are burdening others.\n\n  So, yes, a Senator spent all night here. I wonder if that Senator \never stopped to consider how much it cost the taxpayers to keep this \nplace lit, to keep the clerks and the people here; all the police, all \nthe safety people here and around outside, just to keep this place \nrunning, so one person could speak all night. I wonder if he ever \nconsidered that.\n  As I say, I don't deny anybody's right to speak. But I have to wonder \nabout responsibility, being responsible to the body and to the public \nat large.\n  Imagine my surprise when that same Senator who kept people here all \nnight--who kept the lights lit and cost the taxpayers I don't know how \nmany hundreds of thousands of dollars, at least--voted for the very \nbill he was talking against. It was a 100-to-0 vote today. Some things \nare hard to grasp around this place. I am sure the public out there \nwatching this will say, Wait a minute, he spoke all night against this \nbill and against the Affordable Care Act, against ObamaCare, and a few \nother things too, but then turned around and voted for cloture on the \nmotion to proceed. As I said, some things are pretty hard to understand \naround this place. I guess one has to define it in terms of pure \npolitics, sometimes just pure politics.\n  Again, here is where he talked about the most inexplicable part. My \nfriends on the other side are making great and solemn speeches about \nthe debt and the deficit, warning us, bringing us within hours of a \ngovernment shutdown, all in the name, they say, of fiscal discipline. \nBut as a condition for agreeing to fund the government, what do they \ndemand? The repeal of the best deficit-reducing measures we have ever \nhad. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office confirms that the \nAffordable Care Act reduces the deficit by more than $100 billion in \nthe next 10 years, and over $1 trillion in the next 10 years.\n  So, again, let me see if I get this straight. The Republicans propose \nto reduce the deficit by increasing the deficit. Well, again, as I say, \nsome things are kind of hard to understand around here.\n  I think it is time to stop the silly games. We had our debate. We \nworked hard on the Affordable Care Act. This debate is not about \ndeficit reduction, it is not about the Nation's fiscal health, it is \nabout tearing down health reform at any cost. Tear it down, get rid of \nit, go back to the way it was when powerful health insurance companies \nhad control to raise your rates whenever they wanted to, to not give \npeople health coverage if they had a preexisting condition, to deny \npeople coverage when they got sick, cut them off right at that point, \ndeny them benefits, and making insanely big profits doing so.\n  Those are the old days. It seems to me my friends in the Republican \nParty want to go back to those days, but we don't. The vast majority of \nthe American people say, No, we want to move forward with a health care \nsystem that covers everyone and doesn't leave anyone out.\n  Again, as I said, my friend's obsession with repealing this health \ncare bill is not based on budget or something. Sometimes I wonder what \nit is based on. If someone were to ask me, Senator Harkin, do you think \nthe Affordable Care Act is the end-all and be-all, that it is \nabsolutely perfect, I would have to refer to what I said when we first \npassed the bill, and it came under my committee, the HELP Committee. I \nsaid I like it as I would like a starter home. We might have to add \nsome rooms, we have to add a door here or there or change some of the \ndesigns of this or that, but it was like a starter home, to be filled \nin over months and years ahead, change with changing conditions and \ncircumstances, and as we learned more, as we went ahead, that maybe \nthings would have to be changed in the Affordable Care Act. But the \nfoundation was solid. It has a solid foundation, and a solid structure \nof making sure that we had a health care marketplace to cover all, that \nit wasn't controlled by a few; that everybody, no matter how poor, \nwould get health insurance and those who are the poorest would get a \ngovernment subsidy to buy into that insurance.\n  We wanted to make sure we had good preventive programs, wellness \nprograms, to keep people healthy and out of the hospital in the first \nplace, to change from what I have always said we had in America: We did \nnot have a health care system, we had a sick care system. If you get \nsick, you get care, but in America we have never had much of anything \nto keep us healthy in the first place. As I have said many times, in \nAmerica it is hard to be healthy and easy to be unhealthy. We need to \nchange that around. We need to make it easier to be healthy and harder \nto be unhealthy.\n  The Affordable Care Act takes steps in that direction, providing free \nmammograms, cervical cancer screenings, colonoscopies, by providing \nwellness checkups for people every year, by putting in place community \ntransformation grants where communities could begin to think of how \nthey can structure communities to promote wellness, good activities, \nand better diets.\n  So, yes, it is like a starter home. Do I think some things will have \nto change in the Affordable Care Act in the future? I am sure that is \ntrue. But that doesn't mean tearing down the structure and digging out \nthe foundation and throwing it all away and going back to where we were \nbefore--to square one. The answer is to move ahead. Let's open these \nmarketplaces. Let's get people signed up. If things need to be fixed \nand changed in the future, that is our job here. It is our job to fix \nthese things and make sure our laws are correctly interpreted and \nbenefit people.\n  It is as though some people have the idea that all we have to do is \npass the law and sit back and everything will take care of itself. That \nis not true. No law is like that. We need to implement them. But we \nneed to do it with good will and in a spirit of compromise and in a \nspirit of--not everyone knows all the answers, but in a spirit that \nwhat we are attempting to do with the Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare, \nif you will, is to move us in a direction where people will be \nhealthier, where people will have affordable, quality coverage that \ncan't be taken away because they get sick, or be denied because they \nhave a preexisting condition; kids can stay on their parents' policies \nfor a decent length of time after they get through school, and all of \nthe things I spoke about. These are good, solid foundations for a good \nhealth care system in America.\n  I think my friends on the other side who want to repeal this are \nsimply on the wrong side of this debate. I am always reminded of what \nWilliam Buckley once said. He was sort of the father of the modern \nconservative movement in America. He once said the role of a \nconservative is to ``stand athwart history yelling, Stop!''\n  Knowing the late Mr. Buckley, I am sure he probably had a smile on \nhis face when he said it.\n  It seems as though that is what some people are saying: We just want \nto stop all of this.\n  I have said many times since we first started the Affordable Care Act \ndebates here several years ago, and since we first started working on \nthis, if people have a better idea, come forward and let's take a look \nat it and see what we come up with, but I haven't seen that yet.\n  I want to close by referring to a couple of letters I got from \nIowans. They make it clear what this is all about.\n  Angela from Edgewood writes that she has ``a family history of cancer \nand now I have been able to have the screenings that I need.'' She asks \nme how she can volunteer to spread the word to others. Well, I just \ndid.\n  John from Des Moines says that ``because of the ACA--the Affordable \nCare Act--I have been able to start my own business, I have been able \nto purchase coverage and am looking forward to the exchanges.''\n  So the choice is to go forward, to work together to make whatever \nneeded improvements need to be made, to come together as a united \nAmerican people and to create a reformed health care system that works \nnot just for the healthy and wealthy but for all Americans. That is \nwhat this battle is about. That is what this is all about. That is\n\n[[Page S6852]]\n\nwhy we don't need to shut the government down. Let's act responsibly. \nLet's pass a short-term continuing resolution without defunding the \nAffordable Care Act or all of this other nonsense dealing with the debt \nceiling increase, and then let's get down to the hard work of working \ntogether to make sure we fund the government next year as we bring this \nsession of Congress to a close later in November or December. \nHopefully, in the next couple of days the Senate will act and we will \nlet the House know we are not going to defund the Affordable Care Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I have had the chance to listen for almost \na better part of an hour to my two neighbors, Senator Harkin and \nSenator Coburn, one from Oklahoma and one from Iowa, both of whom, as \nmany of us know, have totally different views of why we are here and \nwhat is going to happen based on what we do in the next few days and \nthe days that follow after that.\n  First of all, why are we here? The new spending year starts a week \nfrom yesterday. It starts next Tuesday. Has the Senate passed a single \nappropriations bill? No. Why are we doing this again? Why are we so \ncommitted over the last 5 or 6 years to management by crisis?\n  I think in the last 6 or 7 years now, the appropriations process has \nnot worked one time. It wasn't too many years before that when we \npassed all of the appropriations bills for the year that ended \nSeptember 30 and began October 1 in July--all of them, individually. \nThat is how the government worked and was supposed to work. Here we are \na week away, and why are we here? Why does everything have to ride from \ncrisis to crisis? That is why people are frustrated, people are upset.\n  Senator Harkin, my good friend, we are both frustrated and upset. We \nwould like to see this process work. The Appropriations Committee would \nlike to see the process work. Why do we go from standing on one edge of \nthe cliff, and the next time people pay any attention, we are on the \nedge of another cliff again? We need to work together to make this \nprocess work.\n  There has been, as Senator Coburn pointed out, some significant \ndisagreement on where the current debate could take us. One side \nbelieves that at some point--one side of the debate believes that at \nsome point the President of the United States would sign a bill that \neliminated the health care plan that he now calls ObamaCare, so I am \ngoing to call it that too, as he has, and Senator Harkin has alternated \nusing that term. I don't believe the President would sign that bill. I \ndo believe he is President and I do believe he has to sign a bill for \nthe bill to happen, and so we have to at some point decide what can we \ndo to make this process understood in a better way by the American \npeople.\n  Senator Harkin referred to this as a starter home. I don't know \nexactly where this goes, but I do know that the majority leader said \nover the last few days, Well, what this really is is a single-payer \nsystem. I am not for that. As far as I know, nobody on my side of the \naisle and many people on the other side of the aisle aren't for that, \nbut that is where the Senate majority leader says this goes. I don't \nwant to go there.\n  So what can we do to make the health care system work better? I wish \nto talk about that a little later too because there have been plenty of \nideas about what could make this better. Apparently, when it comes to \nnot moving forward with the Affordable Care Act, the administration \nbelieves it can decide what not to move forward on, but the Congress \ncan't. It can decide what to essentially repeal. Part of this act was \ncalled the CLASS Act, long-term health care provisions that about a \nyear and a half or 2 years ago, the Secretary of HHS said what I said, \nbut in the committee, when this bill came up, when I was on the House \nCommerce Committee that dealt with this, essentially saying this long-\nterm plan won't work. ``Oh, no, it will work and it will provide lots \nof money.'' Secretary Sebelius--even though it is the law--said, about \na year and a half ago, this will not work, so we are not even going to \ntry to do it.\n\n  The President said recently--or I guess the Secretary said recently--\nthat the small business plans that were supposed to be available on \nJanuary 1, 2014, will not be available. The President said: We are not \ngoing to have any penalties for the business requirement in 2014, but \nwe are still going to have the individual requirement.\n  Interestingly, the President also said: In normal circumstances, I \nwould go to the Congress and say change the law, but these are not \nnormal circumstances. I do not believe there is a Presidential \nprerogative to decide whether you are in normal circumstances or not. \nIf the law needs to be changed, let's change the law. If parts of it \nneed to be repealed, let's repeal it. If parts of it need to be \npostponed, let's postpone it.\n  Here we are, only 6 days from the beginning of a new spending year. \nWe are also 6 days from what will be a critically important moment for \na lot of families--a lot of individuals, employers, people who are \ngoing to be looking at these exchanges, and they do not seem to be \nready.\n  It had been hoped that there would be available information out there \nso that for weeks we could have sort of what is called the dry run, \nwhere people could see if this works, where they could compare plans. \nThat is just not there, and we know it is not there.\n  In Missouri, where I live, people have been concerned from the very \nfirst about what they saw as a flawed law. In fact, our State was the \nfirst State in the country to actually vote on whether we wanted to be \npart of this. Overwhelmingly, Missouri voters said no, and that was \nwhen it was more popular in any polling than it is right now. People \nhave looked at this and they do not want to go there.\n  Missourians, in August of 2010, had a vote on the ballot, and 71 \npercent said we should not participate--71 percent--and that was, \nagain, when the law was more popular than it is now. That was the first \ntime people had a chance to vote on this.\n  In November of 2012, Missouri voters voted again. This time the \ndirection to the legislature and all State agencies and the Governor \nwas: Do not establish a State exchange unless the legislature agrees. \nThere was some disagreement as to whether the Governor could do that on \nhis own. Missouri voters said: We do not want you to do that on your \nown. So in our State, as in a majority of the States, it has not \nhappened. The implementation will is not there because people do not \nbelieve this plan will work.\n  The elements of this that improve what happens in a competitive \nmarketplace could still be there in other changes we could make. This \nis incredibly unpopular around the country. People are frustrated by \nit. People are looking for ways to end moving into the Affordable Care \nAct; that it simply will not work. Senator Coburn explained earlier why \nthey would not work. Charles Krauthammer, one of the leading \nconservative commentators in the country today, said about one of the \nplans this week: It will not work. The President's health care plan is \nfalling under its own weight. When something such as that is happening \nin politics, you do not rush in to stop it from happening. If you do \nnot think the law should be implemented anyway, let people see that \nthis will not work, and we are seeing that.\n  I am for defunding the plan. I am for starting over again. I believe \nmost Americans would like to see us start over again and take the best \nhealth care system in the world and make it work better.\n  Anybody who was defending our system as perfect got into a trap they \nshould not have gotten into because it was not perfect. It was largely \nan accident of a couple of decisions made in the 1940s, where health \ncare and health insurance became way too dependent on where people \nworked, where people did not have the ownership they needed in health \ncare, and where we did not have the competition that we needed to buy \nacross State lines, to shop for a better product, to do all those \nthings.\n  But this is a plan where, again, the law is the law, unless it \napplies to the administration, apparently. The Congressional Research \nService--no partisan organization--recently found that the \nadministration has missed 41 of 82 deadlines.\n  If you are a batter in professional baseball, that is a pretty good \naverage, .500. It is not very good if you are trying to figure out how \nto implement the law. They missed 41 of 82 deadlines.\n\n[[Page S6853]]\n\n  The employer mandate requirement, the White House has said, is \nunworkable now and announced its delay. How in the world we could \ndefend saying that employers do not have to meet their requirement but \nindividuals have to pay a penalty if they do not have insurance--how \ncan any of my friends defend that? We ought to, at the very least, \npostpone the individual mandate for as long as we postpone the employer \nmandate. If individuals are paying a penalty and employers that the law \nsays are supposed to offer insurance are not offering insurance and \nthey are not paying a penalty, there is something wrong with a \ngovernment that decides that is the appropriate way to do this.\n  Despite the employer mandate delay announcement, we still see \nbusinesses beginning to react because they know or they believe this is \neventually likely to start. Businesses, big and small, are trying to \nlook at: If somebody does not have to have insurance if they do not \nwork more than 30 hours, maybe we should have more employees who work \nless than 30 hours because our competitor might decide that companies \nthat have always provided insurance and assistance for families and \nspouses decide the law now does not say we have to do that, so we are \nnot going to do that any longer.\n  The law initially anticipated 3 million people who currently had \ninsurance would lose that insurance. It is going to be a lot higher \nthan that. The same people who were saying 3 million are today saying \nsomewhere between 8 and 15 million, and that number is going to go up. \nAll we have to do is calculate what has just been announced in the last \nfew days to know that is going to go up.\n  The Cleveland Clinic hosted President Obama in July 2009, during the \nheight of trying to convince Americans this was going to work. He \ntalked about how the Cleveland Clinic was an example of cutting-edge \ntechnology. But what they recently cut in cutting-edge health \ndelivery--what they recently cut--were 44,000 employees, and they said \nit was because of the President's health care plan. The same \norganization the President went to, to talk about how that organization \nruns and why we should have his health care plan, announced they are \nterminating 44,000 employees because of the health care plan.\n\n  This is a plan where people who were for it--and I was not for it, I \nhave not been for it, I just simply do not believe it will work--people \nwho were for it overpromised, and now they are underdelivering.\n  That famous statement made over and over again: If you like your \nhealth care plan, you can keep it--nobody believes that anymore. In \nfact, ask the employees at General Electric or IBM or UPS or Walgreens \nor Home Depot or thousands of smaller businesses than those: What about \nkeeping the health care plan you like--the day that commitment was \nmade? Those plans are not there anymore. It was one of the main selling \npoints of this plan: If you like your health care, you can keep it. It \njust turned out not to be true at all.\n  Not only has this not made health care more affordable, but family \npremiums have gone up by more than $2,500 since this became the law--\neven though it was the law and we are moving toward it, not \nimplementing it.\n  Nearly three in four small businesses say they plan to cut hours or \nlet employees go because of the President's health care plan. People \nwho have more than 50 employees are doing everything they can not to \nhave more than 50 employees because that is one of the criteria where \nthey are penalized under this law.\n  Meanwhile, in April of 2013, the administration said it would delay a \nprovision that allowed employees to pick their own plans in States that \nhave the Federal exchange--States such as ours. It is not going to \nhappen. Another delay.\n  In July of 2013, the administration delayed enforcement of the \nemployer mandate for a year. In July, the administration announced it \nwould significantly scale back the requirements for new State-based \ninsurance marketplaces to verify income. When you scale back the \nrequirements to verify income, you are also scaling back the burden \nthat people have to provide information in order to get assistance.\n  I assume that means more people will get taxpayer assistance. But it \nalso means the cost of that assistance is going to be higher, for many \nreasons. That is one of them. Another one is that people are going to \nbe on the exchange that everybody anticipated would still be getting \nworkplace-based health care.\n  In August of 2013, the Department of HHS--Health and Human Services--\ndelayed the signing agreements with insurance companies that was \nsupposed to have specific amounts available in August. I wrote a letter \nat the time that said: It is very important that you meet this deadline \nbecause people need to begin to think about the decision you want them \nto make beginning October 1.\n  The Department of Labor delayed a limit on out-of-pocket spending for \nbeneficiaries from 2014 to 2015. Again, apparently, if you want to \ndelay the law, if you want to decide that you are not going to enforce \nthe law, that is OK. But for those of us who say: Let's have a \npermanent delay, let's not fund this and now go back and start with a \nprocess where the House passes a bill, the Senate passes a bill, the \ntwo bodies come together and talk about the differences--that never \nhappened with this law.\n  My friend from Iowa said: It is a starter home. But there is no \nremodeling process to start up for the starter home, and we are seeing \nwhat happens there. Unfortunately, there are too many examples of this.\n  Americans deserve commonsense health care solutions, where doctors \nand patients are in charge, not government bureaucrats, not people at \nthe IRS.\n  When you have a health care bill that adds thousands of new IRS \nworkers and does not add a single new doctor or nurse, you probably \nmissed the boat in what you are trying to do with health care.\n  There are lots of better ideas out there: More individual ownership, \nfair tax treatment. The tax treatment we have had for decades now, \nwhere you do not pay income tax on a benefit you get at work, but if \nyou get insurance on your own, you do that with dollars you have paid \ntaxes on--now one way or the other, make that equal. Either say nobody \ngets a tax benefit for the money that is used to buy insurance or \neverybody gets the tax benefit. Let people shop across State lines. Let \npeople find what they need that meets the needs of their family.\n  You are going to have more single, young adults without insurance. \nWhy are you going to have more? Not because of the provision that \nallows people to stay on their family's policy--that actually added \npeople to the insurance roles--but because of the provision that says \nthat the most expensive people you insure cannot be charged more than \nthree times that of the least expensive people you insure. Young, \nhealthy people are going to look at insurance rates higher than rates \nthey have ever seen on the individual market before, and it will make a \ndifference.\n  There is plenty that can be done here. My colleagues on the other \nside face an important decision this week. They can stand with what is \nnow the overwhelming majority of Americans who have rejected the \ndirection we are headed and say: Let's defund this. Let's start over \nagain. The one thing we have in front of us that would allow us to \nstart over is the House bill that we just voted to move forward on that \nwould defund ObamaCare and let us start over again or my friends on the \nother side can decide that the President and Senator Reid are right, \nthat Senator Reid's idea that this leads us to a single-payer system is \nwhere we want to go, that the President's idea that he can change this \nlaw however he wants to and the Congress is not involved is right.\n  I will strongly urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting \nagainst any attempts by the majority leader to restore funding for this \nflawed law and to work with all of us, working together, as we work to \nreplace it.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S6854]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Kentucky and I be allowed to participate in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would say to my friend from Kentucky, \nI have had over 50 hospital town hall meetings in our State over the \nlast year and a half. The Senator and I have done a couple of these \ntogether. As a health care professional yourself, looking at it from a \nhospital and health care provider's point of view--which the Senator \nand I both had, either he in his profession or me by being in these \nhospitals a lot the last couple of years, and have learned a good bit--\nwhat does the Senator think is the most devastating impact of ObamaCare \non the provider world?\n  Mr. PAUL. I talk to a lot of doctors. I have been in town halls with \nthe Senator at the different hospitals. The hospitals are concerned \nthat if everybody goes on Medicaid they will go out of business. Many \nhospitals' bottom line is driven by--they can take care of the poor \nthrough Medicaid, but they rely on private insurance to make a profit. \nHospitals in most communities have to make a profit to stay in \nbusiness. So the rural hospitals, particularly in small areas, some of \nthem have already gone bankrupt in Kentucky. But they are very \nconcerned about people being shifted from private insurance to public \nassistance.\n  The President said, though, that it will be free, but it has a cost. \nWe all pay for it through higher taxes. The other way we pay for it is \nwe have to ration care or ration what we pay for care, so we have to \nlimit what we pay hospitals.\n  Hospitals are already being forced to see less. They have been for a \nwhile. But even more so now. It is the same with doctors. How do \ndoctors respond? Doctors, some respond by saying: I am maybe only going \nto see a couple of Medicaid patients or no Medicaid patient. Then when \neverybody is on Medicaid or the vast majority is on Medicaid, they are \ngoing to be waiting in to see a doctor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Speaking of Medicaid, I remember reading that our \nGovernor got teared up when he announced that he had decided to accept \nthe additional Medicaid mandate, which the Supreme Court actually had \nsaid was optional. I remember having a teared-up feeling too, but for a \ndifferent reason. I gather what will happen in our State is there are \ngoing to be between 3- and 400,000 new people with free health care \ncards rushing toward the emergency rooms. What I have heard in a number \nof my town hall meetings is they cannot handle the Medicaid load that \nthey have now, not to mention all of those new people who are headed \ntheir way, coupled with the $750 billion in health care provider cuts \nover the next 10 years to help provide a subsidy for people who are not \nold.\n  I mean, it is coming out of Medicare. It can provide subsidies for \npeople who are not old. What is the Senator's take on where this all \nheads?\n  Mr. PAUL. When you look at the big picture of this, when we say: \nWell, we want to provide health insurance for everybody, which I think \nis a noble cause, you look at what we have. The government already \nprovides Medicare for everybody over 65. But Medicare is $35 to $40 \ntrillion short.\n  Why? It is nobody's fault really. We are living longer and a lot of \npeople are retiring. So we have a big baby boomer generation. But \nMedicare is $35 trillion short. So we are instituting a brand new \nentitlement. It is very big, the biggest we have had in 50 years. But \nwe are going to pay for it by shifting money from Medicare that is \nalready $35 trillion short. That alone should give people pause.\n  The other thing that I think should give people pause is we cannot \nget people to sign up for this free program. The President is going to \nspend tens of millions of dollars on TV promoting it, hiring people to \ncome knock on your door to sign up for something that is free.\n  You know something is disorganized when people will not take \nsomething that is free.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. This bill was also sold, as we both recall, as doing \nsomething about health care costs. I was just noticing here that HHS's \nown actuaries revised their projections just last week to say that \nObamaCare will actually increase health care costs by $621 billion out \nacross the economy. Is there any way, I would say to my colleague, Dr. \nRand Paul, how this could possibly hold down costs?\n  Mr. PAUL. No. In fact, I think there were problems in health care. \nBut as a physician for 20 years, what I heard most was about the cost \nof health care. People came to me and said it is so expensive. Or if \nthey are a small business owner they said: Our insurance costs too \nmuch. That was their main complaint. This does nothing to control \ncosts. In fact, Obama does the opposite. ObamaCare is a collection of \nmandates. I was talking earlier. It is the difference between freedom \nand coercion. We will coerce insurance companies and customers to buy \nonly certain kinds of insurance. People say: It is good. My kids will \nbe covered when they are in college and when they get out of college. \nThat is good. But it is not free. It is going to cost you more money. \nSo if you are the working class or the working poor, you are struggling \nto buy insurance, it is going to cost you more.\n  We always hear he is for the middle class. The middle class are going \nto pay more for their insurance. They already had insurance, and they \nare going to pay more across the board. So really there are a host of \nproblems and this bill does nothing to control costs.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. One of our constituents--I was going to mention here a \nletter--the Senator probably got it from the same constituent I did--to \nunderscore how the rising cost is impacting people outside the health \ncare provider world, regular people in business. This from a follow \nconstituent of ours who writes:\n\n       My father began his Kentucky Fried Chicken business with \n     the colonel himself, and with the colonel's family. We \n     proudly served Colonel Sander's original recipe for 40 years. \n     It saddens me, however well intentioned, that this law will \n     undermine my ability to provide employment. It will deplete \n     resources that could otherwise be used to grow my business.\n\n  The Senator and I both have heard from a lot of Kentucky business \npeople indicating, as this KFC franchisee underscores, the impact of \nthis on the private sector.\n  Mr. PAUL. I met with a group today. I have here today 68,000 American \nsenior citizens who signed a petition from Conservative 50-plus \nAlliance, saying they want to delay it, dismantle it, defund it, do \nanything, just try to slow down this monstrosity.\n  We have also heard from folks who work for UPS, one of our biggest \nemployers in Louisville and Kentucky. Some 15,000 spouses are losing \ntheir insurance coverage from UPS that they had chosen. It was great \ncoverage. UPS is a great company. Great benefits. But they are forced \nto cut back because of ObamaCare.\n  We hear from individuals throughout the State. We have received \nthousands and thousands of letters. One couple I met recently was \nactually profiled on Fox News, the Anionic family, where they said: We \nhave to buy our insurance. We are self-employed, we do consulting work, \nwe were paying $300 a month, and we are going to $900 a month. This is \nexactly the opposite. One of the real things that we had that was \nworking in our health care that should be expanded, if we were in \ncharge of talking about this, is health savings accounts. People could \nsave for things that were not covered by their insurance, straightening \nyour kid's teeth, cosmetic, elective kind of surgery, your deductible, \nmeeting a lot of things for your tax-free account.\n  We had made it bigger and bigger over time. ObamaCare makes it \nsmaller. If you have got a kid with autism or spina bifida, or special \nneeds, you need to save that money tax free so you can help your child \nwith all of extra stuff you need to do for your child.\n  The President has narrowed that. Also health savings accounts helped \nto bid prices down. Because when you have a higher deductible, you call \nup the doctor and you say: How much will that be? Or you ask the \npharmacist: How much does that cost? That simple question, of asking \nhow much something costs is concern on the part of the consumer and \ndrives prices down. But we have gotten rid of that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The other thing that is clearly happening here is that\n\n[[Page S6855]]\n\nall indications are, we have a record number of part-time employees in \nour country now. Employers are downsizing in order to try to get below \nthe 50-employee threshold. Of course, even as they do that, they are \nnot necessarily unaffected by the rising costs of health insurance \npremiums. But we are looking around at some way to try to prevent the \nworst case scenario here, all of this disruption in our economy is \nactually the reason we have so many part-time workers; is it not?\n  Mr. PAUL. Yes. The thing is, there was a French philosopher by the \nname of Bastiat. He talked about the seen and the unseen. You may be \nable to--I am sure the President is going to show us the person who \ngets insurance. That is the ``seen.'' That will be the good effect of \nthis. The unseen will be the person who does not get the job. But you \ndo not know their name because they never got the job--the person that \nwas going to be the 51st employee or the 52nd employee or the part-time \nworker that had 34 hours going to 29 hours. That is the unseen.\n  I do not question the motives of the President or the other side. I \nthink they want to help people, but they did not think this thing \nthrough. So even their side now is scratching their head. The author of \nthe bill is calling it a train wreck. The Teamsters said, ``We did not \nknow we are going to have to pay all of those taxes on our health \ninsurance. Warren Buffet, former President Clinton, all of these people \nare questioning. This is really going to hurt some of the people you \ntried to help.\n  That is one of my concerns. I know there has been a lot of talk about \nprocedure around here. So we ought to have the ability to amend this to \nmake it less bad--that is the way I like to describe it--and make this \nbill less bad for the American people. There has been a lot of dialogue \non our side but there has not been much on theirs. Are they willing to \ntalk about fixing ObamaCare and making it less bad for the American \npeople.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator was not here yet, but is the Senator fully \naware of how this bill passed in the first place? Not a single member \nof our party in either the House or Senate voted for it. They brought \nus into session the day after Thanksgiving in 2009 and we were not \nallowed to leave for a month. We were here 7 days a week for a month. \nAnd we managed to eke it out. They had 60 Democrats, there were 40 \nRepublicans. They eked it out with not a vote to spare on Christmas \nEve, as a result of things like the Cornhusker Kickback, a special deal \nfor Nebraska, the Louisiana Purchase, a special deal for Louisiana, the \nGator Aid, a special deal for Florida, all while the President, the \nVice President, and former President Clinton were up here telling me: \nBelieve me. They are going to love it by the fall.\n  Here we are 4 years later. It is more unpopular today--I would say to \nmy friend from Kentucky--than it was on the day it was passed. Is it \nnot reasonable to conclude that is because of what it does?\n  Mr. PAUL. Absolutely. It is the content. But it is because there has \nbeen no input. ObamaCare is 100 percent the President's bill, 100 \npercent the work of the Democrats, with no input from our side. I think \npeople actually do--when you go home, they do want to establish \ndialogue. They do want us to work together a little bit. There has been \nno working together on ObamaCare. It is theirs. The President got it \nexactly wrong the other day. It is hard to inform the people this way.\n  He said: Republicans want 100 percent of what they want or they are \ngoing to shut down government. I think it is the opposite. He wants 100 \npercent of what he wants. He doesn't want any compromise. We have a \nbill before us. There is a discussion about ObamaCare. Why not? Nearly \n80 percent of us voted and said the medical devices tax is going to be \na disaster for innovation in the medical industry. It is a bad piece of \nthis bill. We should repeal it.\n  Why not have a vote on that? To my understanding there will be no \nvote on any amendments to make ObamaCare any better.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The President himself seems to be kind of conceding \nthat some things aren't working out well. He decided to delay the \nemployer mandate for a year. Apparently, he has been meeting with some \nof his union allies to figure out what he can try to do for them.\n  I believe the 100 percent view of the Republicans is that if we are \ngoing to have a delay for business, why not have a delay for everybody? \nObviously, we would like to defund the law entirely. There is a math \nproblem on that in the Senate. There are 54 Democrats and 46 \nRepublicans. But couldn't we all agree on delaying this train wreck? \nThe train wreck, by the way, was what the Democratic chairman of the \nFinance Committee in the Senate, one of the authors of the bill, called \nit.\n  Mr. PAUL. I think there is also something important about how we \nchange ObamaCare. If a law has problems and we incorrectly pass the law \nthat has the least blemishes, it should come back and we should re-\ndebate and fix it or try to make it less bad. I think it is the best \nway to put it.\n  The thing is that it is illegal, it is unconstitutional, and it is \nunprecedented to do this on his own.\n  To my mind, win or lose this week, this is an important philosophical \nbattle, bigger than ObamaCare. It is as big and as broad as the country \nis. That is whether or not the Congress writes the law and the \nPresident executes the law.\n  If the President gets to vote, write, and execute, that is a type of \ntyranny. Montesquieu talked about the separation of powers. He said \nwhen the legislative power becomes the executive power, that is a type \nof executive tyranny.\n  We have to do something that says to the President--and that is why I \nthink this needs to be pursued all the way to the Supreme Court--\nrebukes the President and says you are not a king. You are the \nPresident, and the legislation comes from Congress, not from you.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We have another example of this that affects our \nState. The President, even when he had a 40-seat majority in the House \nand 60 votes in the Senate, couldn't get cap and trade through the \nCongress.\n  Yet last Friday he has announced he is going to do it anyway. All \nindications are there won't be another coal-fired generation plant \nbuilt ever.\n  It is a perfect example of what the Senator is talking about, a kind \nof executive arrogance, that if I can't get what I want through \nCongress, I will just do it on my own and see you in court, or whatever \nlimited options we have left.\n  If he really believes he has the power to delay ObamaCare, why not \ndelay it for everyone, not just businesses.\n  Mr. PAUL. I think that is what people see as unseemly. They see: \nWell, gosh, if there are problems, is it right for him to just give \nexemptions to his friends?\n  You see a line of people going to the White House that were big \ncontributors of his. It is as if you can buy access to good law.\n  The President changed the law only for people who gave him money. Can \nhe give out grants and loans to people who are his contributors? I \nthink this is what sort of belies this tale when he says: I am for the \nmiddle class.\n  Well, I don't see the middle class. I don't see my neighbors or any \nof my friends getting any special deals at the White House. In fact, I \nsee them bearing the brunt of people who do get special deals.\n  I don't like, if you have really good health insurance, placing a tax \non you, a special tax. Many of the unions will get that. I will stand \nhere and fight tooth and nail not to have a special tax on the unions.\n  Some might be surprised by that. It is not for me a union-nonunion \nthing. It is about is it good for America, is it good for Americans.\n  Some executives have good insurance, too. Should we have a special \ntax on something that is good? It doesn't seem like the right thing to \ndo.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Here at some point, regardless of differences of \nopinion that we have had on our side over procedure, what is likely to \nhappen here at some point is we are going to have a 51-vote vote on \ndefunding ObamaCare, something we have not been able to achieve here in \nthe last 4 years. Four Democrats, who had second thoughts, who had an \nopportunity to take a look at the carnage of the last 4 years, could \nactually pass a bill that defunds ObamaCare.\n  I remember, I say to my friend and colleague, standing at this very \nchair, 4 years ago, looking at the other side\n\n[[Page S6856]]\n\nand saying if only one of you, only one, would come with us, this bill \nwouldn't pass.\n  I also said, however, if none of you do, every single one of you is \nresponsible for its passage. Had any Democrat on the other side, any \none of them, said this is a bridge too far, I am not going to do it, it \nwouldn't have passed.\n  Consequently, every single one of them is responsible for its \npassage, but they have a second chance now, an opportunity for a do-\nover. At some point here this week they will have a chance to cast a \nreal vote on an up-or-down basis. I have watched this for 4 years, and \nI don't think we ought to go forward.\n  It will be interesting to see if party loyalty will be so great that \nnone of these folks will be able to bring themselves to admit that they \nmade a mistake 4 years ago.\n  Mr. PAUL. I think one of the disappointing things about the debate \nboth then and now is that we are talking about something all Americans \nwant. They want affordable health care. They want most people to have \ninsurance. They want everybody to have insurance if we can do it.\n  But we have made it a partisan battle--not we--but Congress and the \ndeliberative process has become very partisan, when in reality there \nare probably things on which we could agree, even the problems with \nObamaCare.\n  I think half of the other side half agrees that there are problems \nand they ought to be fixed.\n  Because of some kind of stubbornness that we are getting 100 percent \nof what we want or we are willing to risk shutting down the government, \nthat is what we get from the other side. It is their way or the \nhighway. They want all of ObamaCare or they want the government to shut \ndown.\n  I think in reality there are a lot of good things that we could \nactually come together and work on because ObamaCare never addressed \nprice. Eighty-five percent of the public had insurance and their price \nis going up. We do need to get together and talk about how to try to \nbring cheaper health care to people in our country.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The tragedy of this, correct me if I am wrong, but we \npassed a 2,700 page bill on a totally partisan basis. We have about \n20,000 pages of regulations now issued.\n  I used them in a speech recently. They were 7 feet tall. We had to \nput them on a dolly to get it out on the podium.\n  I would ask my friend and colleague from Kentucky, didn't I read the \nother day, that even after we do all of the 2,700 page bill, the 20,000 \npages of regulations, there still may be 25 or 30 million people \nuninsured?\n  Mr. PAUL. Yes. I don't think it has actually fixed the problem. I \nthink we were at 45, so I don't think it fixed half the problem.\n  The other interesting thing is of the people who didn't have health \ninsurance, a third of the people without health insurance were young, \nhealthy, and actually made more than $50,000 a year. They weren't \ngetting health insurance because it was too expensive.\n  What did we do to help them? We made health care more expensive.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think this law has no chance of working. I don't \nbelieve that, even if we are unable to defund it here in the next few \ndays, that we are necessarily stuck with it. I have been here a while, \nand you have been a long-time observer through your father's career and \nyour own. I think it is pretty safe to conclude that things that can't \nwork don't stick and don't last. We are, after all, a representative \ndemocracy. People complain, discuss, and tell us how they feel.\n  I don't think this law can possibly stand. It is pretty hard to \npredict exactly the day upon which it ends, but it is cracking.\n  We have Jimmy Hoffa, the President of the Teamsters, saying you are \ndestroying the 40-hour work week, and their Cadillac health care plan. \nDon't you think ObamaCare can't possibly work?\n  Mr. PAUL. No. I think once the bill has come due at the State level, \nyou are going to have a real uproar on your hands because there is a \nprinting press in Washington that runs 24 hours a day printing money. \nIn the State capitals they don't have a printing press, they are \nlimited--at least to a certain extent--on their borrowing.\n  When the Medicaid bills come due in Kentucky, our State and other \nStates, I think there will be another war on the question of ObamaCare. \nThe question then will be do we throw out the Governor who increased \nour Medicaid by 50 percent and bankrupted our State in the process?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my colleague from Kentucky for the opportunity \nto exchange some views here about the impact of this on our State and \nour country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I came to the floor to urge my colleagues to do everything \nwe can to ensure that ObamaCare is delayed, guaranteeing the least-\nharmful pass forward for patients, providers, and taxpayers.\n  We all have stories from our home States that highlight what many of \nus have said was going to happen when the Federal Government began its \ntakeover of the Nation's health care system.\n  Because of ObamaCare, a constituent of mine in Arizona who owns a \nnumber of restaurants is eliminating the entry-level job of busboy \nbecause he can no longer afford to employ busboys and pay the new \nhealth care expenses for his other employees. Eliminating a restaurant-\nwide position is a decision that he had to make because of ObamaCare.\n  Another Arizonan, Michael Monti, who runs a historic restaurant in \nTempe, was recently featured on the local news because he is being \nforced to decide about whether to offer health insurance to his \nemployees working more than 30 hours a week or paying the penalty from \nthe Federal Government. Again, it is likely that employees will be laid \noff or not hired.\n  He doesn't want to cut back his employees' hours. That doesn't help \nhis business. I am sure it doesn't help his employees. Like other \nbusiness owners, he doesn't have any other option.\n  Sadly, these stories are not isolated incidents. Companies like \nTrader Joe's and Home Depot have recently announced they will end \nhealth benefits for part-time workers next year, and those employees \nwill be directed to the new insurance marketplaces.\n  SeaWorld announced that it will be cutting back employees' hours as \nwell. UPS will no longer cover the health insurance for some 15,000 \nemployees' spouses.\n  Just when we need a full bore, full-time economy, America is becoming \na part-time economy. These are the effects of ObamaCare.\n  I believe that it is helpful to have this debate come sharply into \nfocus as it has been over the past 24 hours. Like many of my \ncolleagues, I have opposed ObamaCare from the beginning. I think every \nRepublican in the House and in the Senate has done so.\n  I voted to do away with this legislation more than 30 times. Earlier \nthis month I introduced S. 1490, a bill that would delay by 1 year all \nof the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that are supposed to take \neffect on January 1, 2014, or later.\n  I believe we all know the President has already decided to delay the \nemployer mandate. Doesn't it make sense to delay the rest as well? How \ncan you tell individuals there is still a mandate for you to buy \ninsurance but to tell employers you are going to get a year break.\n  As lawmakers, we have a responsibility to our constituents. We have \nto do everything we can to make sure that this train wreck of a law \ndoesn't continue to wreak havoc. As we continue to discuss the need to \ndelay this onerous law, I hope that Senators will join me in devoting \nthe same time and energy to fix the fiscal problems facing this \ncountry.\n  In this debate we are told we have two choices. We have a continuing \nresolution with a price tag of about $986 billion--about $20 billion \nmore than the law allows--or we risk a government shutdown. It is \ndisingenuous to tell our constituents that these are the only two \nchoices, a shutdown or a CR that busts our budget limits.\n  The majority leader is going to amend the CR to get what he wants. \nShouldn't other Members be afforded the opportunity to offer amendments \nas well? Wasn't this the promise the majority leader made to the Senate \nwhen we made changes in January?\n  The Senate should be given the opportunity to vote on a continuing \nresolution that respects the Budget Control\n\n[[Page S6857]]\n\nAct and funds the government at the $967 billion level for next \nyear. Passing a bill above that limit--above the limit set by law--will \ncause a second round of sequester cuts in January. Why would we do \nthis? Lurching from fiscal crisis to fiscal crisis is no way to run a \ncountry.\n\n  You can say what you want about it, but the Budget Control Act has \nprovided us at least some meaningful cuts in spending we wouldn't make \notherwise. Last week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nreported our debt is on track to total 100 percent of our Nation's \noutput in 25 years. Interest on the national debt will consume 14 \npercent of our annual budget in 10 years' time, up from 6 percent \ntoday.\n  Those projections demand we take a harder look at our spending and, \nat the very least, we should be allowed to vote on a fiscally \nresponsible continuing resolution that meets the $967 billion budget \nthreshold.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after I \nfinish speaking, the Senator from Maryland Senator Mikulski would have \nthe floor for 15 minutes, and then Senator Alexander from Tennessee be \nyielded the floor for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today, as I often do, with a quote. \nIt comes from a conservative leader speaking out about a new health \ncare law. He said:\n\n       We are against forcing all citizens, regardless of need, \n     into a compulsory government program.\n\n  He went on to call the pending legislation ``socialism.'' He went on, \nsaying:\n\n       Our natural, unalienable rights are now considered to be a \n     dispensation of government, and freedom has never been so \n     fragile, so close to slipping from our grasps as it is at \n     this moment.\n\n  Those are frightening words. When were they spoken? Not spoken in \n2010 or 2011. Not spoken in 2012 or 2013. Rather, these words were \nspoken in 1964. And who do you suppose spoke them? Ronald Reagan. \nPresident Reagan was speaking out against Medicare, which became law \nthe following year.\n  Now fast forward 20 years and things were quite different. President \nReagan said in 1984:\n\n       Millions of Americans depend on the Medicare program to \n     help meet their health care costs. We must ensure the long-\n     term solvency of the Medicare program, and I'm confident we \n     can find the right solutions in a bipartisan manner.\n\n  What do you suppose happened in that 20-year period to change \nPresident Reagan's mind? The hysterics ended, people gave the new \nprogram room to breathe, and it worked. Medicare gave America's seniors \naccess to health care they had never had before.\n  The same pattern emerges when we look farther back into history. \nConsider Social Security. In 1935, one Senator said Social Security \nwould ``go a long way toward destroying American initiative and \ncourage.'' Another Member of Congress said, ``The lash of the dictator \nwill be felt.''\n  These are criticisms of landmark legislation, monumental laws that \nare now vital to the very health and welfare of our Nation. While \ncriticized in their conception, Social Security and Medicare are now \nconsidered the most successful large-scale Federal programs in our \nNation's history.\n  I am confident history will treat the Affordable Care Act in a \nsimilar fashion. I am confident the complaints of those who have gone \nso far as to call the Affordable Care Act ``a crime against democracy'' \nor a ``centralized health dictatorship'' will soon be drowned out by \nthe voices of the American people whose lives are better off. Why? \nBecause of the Affordable Care Act.\n  Already the ACA has done more than any other laws of the past century \nto expand health coverage. In the past 3 years, the ACA has provided 71 \nmillion Americans free preventive services. More than 6 million seniors \nhave received discounts on vital prescription drugs. More than 3 \nmillion young people have peace of mind in knowing they are allowed to \nstay on their parents' health plans until they turn 26.\n  I am especially proud of the fact that now no child--no child--can \never be denied health coverage because of a preexisting health \ncondition. All that, and the full benefits of the law have not yet \ntaken effect.\n  The Affordable Care Act is not a perfect law, but neither were Social \nSecurity or Medicare when they passed Congress. Adjustments may need to \nbe made to improve the ACA, as well to make it stronger, make it \nbetter. It would be easier to make improvements if everyone on Capitol \nHill participated. But we are not getting that chance from half of the \nCongress. Instead, opponents are making every effort to destroy the \nAffordable Care Act, fighting to take away its many benefits from \nAmerica's families and businesses.\n  Last week, the House passed a continuing resolution to pay for the \ngovernment for the remainder of the year. But that bill before us today \nincluded amendments to end all funding and to eliminate the Affordable \nCare Act. I want to be very clear here: We are not going to let that \nhappen. We are not going to go back to the status quo. We are not going \nback to a broken system where more than 50 million Americans lack \nhealth insurance. We are not going back to a system that allows the \ncosts of medical care to overwhelm a family and force them into \nbankruptcy. We are not going back to a system that allows the simple \nlack of insurance to contribute to the death of thousands of Americans \neach year. We are not going back or returning to the status quo. No, we \nare not going to do that.\n  Rather, we are full steam ahead on implementing the Affordable Care \nAct. In 6 days, the health exchanges--or marketplaces--will open for \nbusiness and the Affordable Care Act kicks in. What does that mean? For \nthe majority of Americans, nothing. Really. Despite all the scare \ntactics, despite all the rhetoric, nothing will change for the millions \nof Americans who already get health insurance from their employers, \nfrom Medicare, Medicaid, or from the Veterans' Administration.\n  But for those almost 50 million Americans who don't have health \ninsurance, they will now have access to affordable care and peace of \nmind. Thanks to Federal tax credits and subsidies, for the first time \nmillions of working-class families will pay less than $100 a month for \nhealth insurance. And for the most vulnerable among us, they will \nreceive care through an expanded Medicaid.\n  No one--no one--can be denied health insurance any more. That is \nunless some in the House have their way. Their intention--fully spelled \nout in the continuing resolution before us--is to undermine and defund \nAmerica's health care law. For years, we have been trying to solve the \nproblem of rising health care costs. For years, we have been trying to \nhelp working families gain access to comprehensive coverage that \ndoesn't make them go bankrupt or deplete their household budgets. Past \nPresidents, Congresses, and other policymakers have tried to fix this \nproblem time and again. And we sit here today with a solution--the \nAffordable Care Act. For the first time, every American will be \nguaranteed health coverage. It will no longer be legal for health \ninsurers to deny someone coverage for a preexisting condition, such as \nbreast cancer or pregnancy. Before the ACA, being pregnant was a \npreexisting condition, if you can believe that. That is what the health \ninsurance industry thought. That is wrong. And with the passage of this \nact, that is no longer the case. Pregnancy is no longer a preexisting \ncondition. But the House wants to stop this and continue limiting \nconsumer protections and access to affordable care.\n\n  The ACA also provides free preventive service, such as wellness \nvisits and mammograms. Since the law passed, 71 million Americans have \nreceived preventive benefits such as these for free.\n  But the House wants to take this away.\n  Under the ACA, insurers can no longer impose lifetime or annual \nlimits on care. This means more than 105 million Americans no longer \nhave a cap or a limit on their coverage. No longer can insurance \ncompanies say: No, no, no. No more.\n  But the House wants to take this away too.\n  Approximately 3.1 million young adults have gained coverage through \nan ACA provision that allows them to stay on their parents' health \ninsurance plan until the age of 26.\n\n[[Page S6858]]\n\n  We have all heard so many comments about this provision from so many \nconstituents in our States. But no, the House wants to take that away \nas well.\n  I am concerned about the effects of the House continuing resolution \nnot only on health care reform but also on seniors in Medicare. Leader \nReid and I wrote a letter last week to Health and Human Services \nSecretary Kathleen Sebelius and asked her what impact the House CR \nwould have on the operation of Medicare. Specifically, we asked how the \nCR would affect the beneficiaries' access to care. Last Friday we \nreceived a response, and it confirmed our fears. The House bill would \nhave much broader and more harmful implications for the Medicare \nProgram and for seniors.\n  In her letter, Secretary Sebelius said the CR would ``severely impact \nthe Medicare program.'' She goes on to note the House CR would \neliminate funding for Medicare prescription drug coverage, forcing \nseniors to pay more for their prescriptions.\n  The Secretary also said the House CR would disrupt payments to \ndoctors and cut off annual wellness visits, forcing seniors to pay out \nof pocket for preventive services.\n  In addition, Medicare beneficiaries may be forced to drop their \nMedicare Advantage plans and enroll in traditional fee-for-service. It \nis clear the House CR would have dire consequences for the more than 46 \nmillion Americans who rely on Medicare every day.\n  In her letter, Secretary Sebelius also stressed the severe impact the \nHouse CR would have on children and working families and the most \nvulnerable among us.\n  The ACA expanded Medicaid, allowing States to cover low-income adults \nfor the first time. The House CR would end this coverage, sending this \nvulnerable population back to the emergency room for treatment and \nputting hospitals on the hook for providing care. The ACA also expanded \naccess for services to people with disabilities and other long-term \ncare needs. The CR would put an immediate stop to these programs and \nsend people with disabilities back to the nursing home.\n  The Affordable Care Act also extended the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram for 2 additional years. The House CR, you guessed it, reverts \nback to prior law, ending vital funding for this program at the end of \nthis month. The House CR would also leave 6 million children without \naccess to coverage--no doctor appointments, no prescriptions, no cast \nto heal the occasional broken arm.\n  For 3 years, a group of Republicans in the House has wasted taxpayer \nmoney, time, and resources trying to stop the act, over and over again. \nThey have tried to repeal this law 40 times. They even took their \nargument all the way to the Supreme Court. Of course, we all know what \nthe Supreme Court said. The Supreme Court said the Affordable Care Act \nis the law of the land. The Supreme Court upheld it. It is the law.\n  People fear what they do not know. I understand that. But let's all \ntake a deep breath. As one Republican Senator recently noted, it is \n``not rational'' to think the Senate will vote to repeal, delay, or \ndefund the ACA. You know what. He is right, it is not rational. We \nwon't go back to the status quo.\n  This is complex legislation, and I am open to strengthening the law \nto better serve the American people, just as this Congress did with \nSocial Security and Medicare. Wouldn't it be better if both parties \nworked together to improve the law, something that is here with us? It \nis not going to be repealed. Let's work to improve it. That is what the \nAmerican people expect of us. They do not want the government to shut \ndown. They do not want America to default on its debt over the ACA.\n  A recent poll by CNBC found the vast majority of Americans--59 \npercent--oppose defunding the Affordable Care Act at the cost of a \ngovernment shutdown or debt default. Almost 60 percent said no, don't \ndo that, that is not smart.\n  We all have a responsibility to lead. The Affordable Care Act is the \nlaw of the land. We all need to work together to make it work for \nfamilies and businesses who depend on it instead of using it as a \npolitical football.\n  Enough is enough. It is time for the hysterics to end. People need to \ngive the ACA room to breathe and a chance to succeed. If we do so, I am \nconfident America will be better for it and we will all be on the right \nside of history.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about ObamaCare.\n  When we passed the law, it was called the Affordable Care Act. And \nbefore he leaves the floor, I would like to compliment the Senator from \nMontana on the important and crucial role he played in passing the \nAffordable Care Act. It was through his excellent stewardship in the \nFinance Committee, where we could expand access to health care, \nmodernize the way we do it to go from volume medicine to value-based \nmedicine and to be able to expand our access in a way that also was \nfiscally prudent. He also led the way in expanding the children's \nhealth initiative.\n  I know later on he is planning in his life a new future for himself. \nI want him to know that while he is thinking about living a different \nlife, he really impacted the lives of many people. I thank him \npersonally in a heartfelt way for the way he has improved the lives of \npeople and particularly the lives of children and women in this \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The senior the Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I deeply thank and am humbled by the \nsenior Senator from Maryland. Coming from her, that is a high \ncompliment, and I deeply appreciate it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. So, Mr. President, here we are. We are having a \nnational debate on the Senate floor about whether we should provide \naccess to health care to all Americans and be able to do it in a way \nthat is fiscally prudent and modernizes the way we deliver health care \nto emphasize value health care over volume health care. And we are \nhaving this debate even though we passed the legislation in 2010. I \nthought that when you passed a bill and it was signed into law, it was \nthe law of the land but, no, here we go again. We are trying to take \nlegislation that was passed and undo it by defunding it. I don't know \nwhat we are doing here.\n  First there was an attempt to delegitimize President Obama. He has \nwon two elections. The American people said: We want Barack Obama to be \nour President. When he ran the second time, we passed the health care \ninitiative. That was another affirmation that there was public support \nfor that bill.\n  Now here we are, on the eve of the funding for fiscal year 2013 \nexpiring, and there is a manufactured crisis bringing the government to \nthe brink of a shutdown because a few in the other party are sore \nlosers. They lost the election. They lost the battle to get the votes \nwhen they had the opportunity to vote and amend and change the \nAffordable Care Act. So now here we are, and I think it is an \noutrageous use of the Senate's time, and we need to be able to move on \nwith the serious business of governing the country.\n  I worry about unemployment in our country. I worry about the fact \nthat our children are no longer achieving the best in the world. I \nworry about my small to midsized business having access to capital.\n  I know many here called this bill a job killer. Do you know what is a \njob killer? Our behavior in the Senate. This gridlock, deadlock, \nhammerlock on the Senate means we cannot do the business of the country \nin an orderly and predictable way. Therefore, when businesses need to \nplan what are going to be the rules of the game coming out of the U.S. \nGovernment, they are not going to know. So if they are planning what \nthey should do about their business--should they expand? What should \nthey do--they need certainty. As long as we play brinkmanship politics, \nwe cannot have certainty.\n  One thing is certain, though: We definitely should keep ObamaCare. I \nam happy to call it ObamaCare because I think Obama does care. But I \nthink all of us here who are Democrats certainly in the Senate and many \non the other side of the aisle also support the fact that we want to \nincrease universal access. So let's go to what the legislation meant.\n  When we passed the Affordable Care Act, No. 1, it provided access to \nhealth care for more people. When we passed\n\n[[Page S6859]]\n\nthat bill, 42 million Americans did not have access to health care. So \nthat means that here in the United States of America, if you needed a \ndoctor, that didn't mean you would have one. If you needed a \nprescription drug, it didn't mean you could afford to buy one. In many \ninstances, this was a hardship on many families.\n  Also what the Affordable Care Act did is it ended abuses of health \ninsurance companies. When we passed that legislation, people were \ndenied health care on the basis of a preexisting condition. That often \nmeant that for children in the United States of America, if they had \njuvenile diabetes, if they had cerebral palsy, their families couldn't \nget health care insurance because these children had preexisting \nconditions.\n  If you were a woman, it was even worse. Pregnancy was considered a \npreexisting condition, and in some instances where a woman had a \npremature birth and a C-section, she was denied health care because \nthat was considered a preexisting condition. In eight States, if \nsomeone was a victim of domestic violence, that was counted as a \npreexisting condition and they didn't have access to health care. Now, \nwhat is that?\n  So in the Affordable Health Care Act we changed that law, so we \ncreated the opportunities that the punitive practices of insurance \ncompanies would not be a barrier to being able to get health insurance.\n  Then there was this other issue of lifetime caps. That means that if \nyou had a condition and you hit a lifetime cap, then tough luck for \nyou. What happens if you have a child with hemophilia? That is a hard \nthing for that child to face the rest of his or her life, and for the \nfamily. Don't you think there should be no caps on a benefit? What \nhappens if you are struggling with cancer and you hit a cap? It doesn't \nmean your need for treatment ends; it just means your insurance company \nwon't pay for it. Well, we lifted the annual lifetime caps.\n  For us women, the double insult of paying more for health insurance \nsimply because we were women was repealed. In the Affordable Care Act, \nthere is no gender discrimination. We found in our hearings that women \npaid 2 to 10 times as much for their health insurance as men of the \nsame age and health status. We didn't think that was fair, and we \nchanged it.\n\n  We also improved health care for seniors. No. 1, we added new \nMedicare benefits, such as free cancer screenings. Early detection \nmeans better treatment and a better chance of surviving that dread \n``C'' word. It also provided an annual free checkup where someone could \ngo and could get an identification of those silent killers early on. So \nif you have high blood pressure, if you have high blood sugar and we \nfound those early, we could intervene before they either moved to a \ndeadly situation or worse. We know undetected high blood pressure could \nlead to a stroke or to death. So we helped get better health care and \nbetter value for our seniors.\n  Then there is the prescription drug benefit. The prescription drug \nbenefit--called Part D--had something in it called the doughnut hole. \nThe doughnut hole was hard to swallow because it meant that once a \nsenior's drug costs exceeded a certain amount, they went into not a \ndoughnut hole but a dark hole and they had to pay for the full cost \nuntil they reached a catastrophic threshold. For many people with \nchronic conditions--not only those dramatic things like cancer but a \nchronic condition like diabetes--they could reach that doughnut hole \npretty quickly. But that is exactly what enables you to manage your \nblood sugar--working with your doctor, following a program of diet and \nexercise, but you still need medication to help control that blood \nsugar. If you don't get that medication, you then could be headed for \nworse problems related to diabetic neuropathy, to vision loss, to the \nneed for dialysis. You need to be in a program that you can follow and \nthat you can afford. That is why closing the doughnut hole was so \nimportant. It saves lives, and it saves money.\n  I could go on to other examples about what is in the Affordable Care \nAct. There were many advances in terms of women, and there were many \nadvances in terms of children. But I want people to know--because I am \ngetting a lot of vitriolic tweets that somehow or another Maryland \nisn't being served. When I looked at the data from our own State's \nhealth commissioner, 48,000 young adults in Maryland were able to go on \ntheir parents' plans and have health insurance while they look for a \njob or finish their education. Also, 485,000 Marylanders on Medicare \nwere able to get that annual checkup, and 72,000 Marylanders were able \nto participate in eliminating the doughnut hole. That saved them on the \naverage $700 a year, for a total of $51 million that was pumped back \ninto the Maryland economy to do other things and create jobs for other \npeople.\n  So when they say they want to defund ObamaCare, what is it they then \nwant to replace it with? Do they want to go back to Big Insurance and \ntheir punitive practices of denying coverage for a child with a \npreexisting condition? Let them call the parent of a juvenile diabetic \nor a child with cerebral palsy. Do they want to defend the part where \nyoung people can't stay on their parents' plan until they are 26? Do \nthey want to make that phone call and say: We know you are working hard \nto find a job or finish your education. Oh no. Do they want to \neliminate the caps on benefits? Do they want to eliminate closing the \ndoughnut hole? No. They just say they want to eliminate it.\n  Well, I want to eliminate this from the CR, so let me tell you where \nI come in as the chair of the full committee. In a very short time, the \nmajority leader will offer an amendment to the CR sent over by the \nHouse. I want to get rid of this brinkmanship, slam-down, showdown \npolitics. The amendment we will be offering will strike the provision \nto defund ObamaCare. It will strike the provision that was put in on \nthe debt ceiling which means that the way they want to structure it--\nwhat the House sent over--is we pay China first and Americans at the \nend of the line.\n  I then want to set into motion working with our Democrats--it is not \nonly us Democrats--to have a CR.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I want to have an amendment to strike the defunding of \nObamaCare, strike the language on the debt limit, and move the date for \nthe next continuing resolution from December 15 to November 15 so that \nwe can get to a situation where we focus on completing our budget, \ngetting an omnibus, and eliminating sequester for 2 years.\n  I want to get rid of the theatrical politics and get into the real \nbusiness of running and helping govern America in a way that provides \njobs, economic opportunities, and ensures our national security.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The senior Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, will the Chair please let me know when \n15 minutes has expired. I have 20 minutes. I would like to know when 15 \nminutes has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, once after I made a speech my late \nfriend Alex Haley, the author of ``Roots,'' came up to me and said: \nLamar, may I make a suggestion.\n  I said: Of course.\n  He said: When you speak--instead of ``making a speech,'' would you \nsay, ``let me tell you a story,'' and someone might actually listen to \nwhat you have to say. So I do have a little speech on the new health \ncare law to make. But before I make a speech, let me tell a story that \nI think applies to the new health care law. It is a story about two \nfamous and patriotic Tennesseans who went to Texas.\n  The two men are Sam Houston and Davy Crockett. In the early part of \nthe 19th century, Sam Houston was the Governor of Tennessee. He \nresigned that position because of a problem with his marriage. He went \nto Arkansas, lived with Indians, and he went to Texas. Congressman Davy \nCrockett went for a different reason. He got crossways with President \nAndrew Jackson, who recruited a one-legged veteran of the War of 1812 \nto run against him and he lost his race for Congress in 1834. He later \nwent to the courthouse steps in Madison County,\n\n[[Page S6860]]\n\nTN, and said what every defeated candidate has always wanted to say to \nsuch voters. He said: I am going to Texas and you can go to hell and he \nwent to Texas. That is historic fact. I am not using bad words here.\n  So we had these two famous Tennesseans, patriotic, brave men, both of \nwhom went to Texas. They had the same goal in mind, the independence of \nTexas, but they had different tactics. Former Congressman Davy Crockett \nsaid: I think I will go to the Alamo. Some people said: Davy, if you go \nto the Alamo, you will get killed. He went to the Alamo anyway and he \ndid get killed, but we remember him for his bravery and we remember the \nAlamo.\n  Sam Houston took a different tack. He withdrew with his men to San \nJacinto. He was heavily criticized by some people in Texas at that time \nfor withdrawing. Some said it was a retreat, but he waited until the \nMexican General Santa Anna was in a siesta with his troops, he \nattacked, defeated his troops, and he won the war.\n  Today we celebrate both men. We think of them both as patriots, as \ngreat Americans, and we remember the Alamo. But we celebrate Texas \nIndependence Day on March 2, 1836, when Sam Houston won the war.\n  The moral of the story is that sometimes in a long battle, patience \nis a valuable tactic. That is why I am in Sam Houston's camp on this \none. I am not in the shut down the government crowd, I am in the take \nover the government crowd. Americans should elect more Republican \nSenators and then ultimately a Republican President and then I am going \nto delay, dismantle, and replace the new health care law which we call \nObamaCare with a law that actually reduces health care costs for \nAmericans.\n  My first reason for not shutting down the government is that it will \nnot work. The problem is even if we were to vote to shut down the \ngovernment, according to the way some people argue--and I understand \ntheir passion and I respect it--ObamaCare would just keep going like \nthe Energizer bunny. The reason Senator Coburn, the Senator from \nOklahoma, has pointed out is that 85 percent of the funding for \nObamaCare is mandatory spending. Mandatory spending is the type of \nspending that just keeps going. So money for the exchanges, money for \nthe subsidies, and the individual mandate would continue. What would we \nhave achieved? We would have shut down the government, but most of \nObamaCare would keep going. If that is not enough, the President has \nauthority in the law to declare some services essential. I assume, \nsince this is his signature issue and he is President for another 3 \nyears, that he would declare most of ObamaCare essential services.\n  So where would we be? As long as we have a Democratic majority in the \nSenate and President Obama in the White House, it takes 67 votes in the \nSenate to repeal ObamaCare and we have 46 on the Republican side. Every \none of us has voted against ObamaCare repeatedly. Every one of us would \ndo so again. Every one of us would vote to repeal it. But in my view, \nthe right tactic is not to shut down the government. It won't work, \nObamaCare would just keep going, and we would have shut down the \ngovernment.\n  What does that mean? What does a government shutdown mean? Not \neverything would shut down, but here are some of the things that would \nor could happen: The 3.4 million Active-Duty military who would have to \nreport to work--whether at Fort Campbell in Kentucky and Tennessee or \nin Afghanistan--would not be paid for their service as long as the \ngovernment is shut down. At home, their spouses could suddenly find the \nDepartment of Defense schools closed. What are they going to do for \nchildcare, or with a check arriving too late to pay the mortgage? \nSocial Security checks would continue to be paid, but the offices might \nbe closed. Same for more than 20 million of our veterans who receive \nbenefits; they might come late. Two million Americans fly everyday. \nThere would likely be fewer TSA agents, fewer air traffic controllers, \nleading to long lines at the airports in Nashville and New York and \nChicago. How do you think those 2 million people are going to feel \nabout that?\n  The national parks would close. Head Start might close and many of \nthe 110,000 people at our National Laboratories could be furloughed.\n  The last time the government shut down was nearly 20 years ago. Back \nthen, 200,000 people applied for passports and couldn't get them during \nthe shutdown. There are 200,000 Tennesseans going to college this fall \nwho want or are in the process of getting a new student loan and they \nmight not get it on time.\n  Your gun permit might not come through, neither might your FHA loan. \nThe last time we had a government shutdown, it cost the taxpayers $1.4 \nbillion extra dollars, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n  So I am in the Sam Houston camp on this issue in that I want to show \na little patience in trying to win the war. If we shut down the \ngovernment, ObamaCare keeps going, it costs the taxpayers a lot of \nmoney, and inconveniences a lot of Americans. Who do you suspect is \ngoing to get blamed for this? We will have suceeded in shifting the \nblame for passing ObamaCare from the Democrats, who did it unanimously, \nto the Republicans for shutting down the government. You would \nthink the Democratic National Committee might have come up with that \nidea, not the Republican National Committee. That might not be a good \npublic policy position, but it is a fact and people are observing it.\n\n  Then there are people who say to be a good conservative, you have to \nvote to shut down the government. I have been listening to these people \nwho define who is a good conservative and who is not a good \nconservative. It is a little bit like being in Sunday school and \nsomebody new comes into class and says: I am a better Christian than \nyou are and if you don't agree with me get out of the church.\n  You might say: Grandma is a Quaker and Uncle Sam is a Baptist and we \nall try pretty hard in our faith. It is not up to us to judge which one \nof us on the Republican side is a better conservative than another. \nEveryone who looks around knows among Republicans, most of us are \nconservatives, but we have different kinds. We have neoconservatives, \nwe have paleoconservatives, we have fiscal conservatives, we have \nsocial conservatives, we have cultural conservatives, we have Ross \nPerot conservatives--we have opened the door over the last 40 years to \nevery kind of conservative, and it has made our party bigger and more \nsuccessful because we have tolerated different points of view.\n  So I am not for shutting down the government for all those reasons. \nIt will not work. When the government has been shut down before the \nCongressmen could not buy their plane tickets back to Washington fast \nenough to open the government because the voters were absolutely \noutraged. It would shift the blame for ObamaCare, which ought to be the \nreferendum in 2014, to should you shut down the government or not shut \ndown the government? We should not be in this business of saying I am a \nbetter Christian than you are or I am a better Jew than you are or I am \na better conservative than you are. We ought to respect each other's \npoint of view.\n  Instead, what should we do? First, we ought to delay implementation \nof the new health care law. My colleague from Tennessee, Representative \nMarsha Blackburn whose conservative credentials I've never heard \nanybody question, and Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona wrote an \neditorial the other day--I ask unanimous consent for it be printed in \nthe Record following my remarks--saying the health care law must be \ndelayed.\n  There is good reason for that. It is coming too fast and the chairman \nof the Finance Committee said it is going to be a train wreck. The \nlogical thing to do is delay it for 1 year. The President has already \ndelayed many provisions of the health care law. The employer mandate \nhas been delayed for 1 year. The requirement that insurance companies \nreport to the IRS information about health insurance products has been \ndelayed for 1 year. The ability for small employers to provide \nemployees with multiple health insurance plan options in something we \ncall the small business SHOP exchange has been delayed for 1 year. The \nability for state Medicaid programs to send electronic notices to \nbeneficiaries, that is delayed for 1 year. The start of the Basic \nHealth Program, delayed for 1 year.\n\n[[Page S6861]]\n\n  Other provisions have been delayed for 1 year and there are \nregulations that the administration has simply not had time to issue. \nSo why not delay the entire law for 1 year? That would give the \nadministration time to at least get ready it would give the American \npeople a chance to have a referendum on the law in 2014. So that is the \nfirst thing we could do.\n  The second thing we could do is begin to dismantle the law. By that I \nmean we should repeal all of the job-killing, premium-hiking taxes, \nespecially the medical device tax. This is a particularly onerous tax \nthat is 2.3 percent on the revenues of those companies and it drives up \nthe cost of medical devices that tens of millions of Americans use. We \nshould also and repeal the mandates on individuals, families, and job \ncreators that drive up premiums. But that is not all we should do.\n  We have a responsibility to say what we would do as Republicans if \nthe voters were to trust us with the government. If they were to give \nus more Senators who would vote to delay, dismantle, and repeal \nObamaCare, what would we do with it? Or if in a couple of years they \nwere to give us a Republican President, what would we propose?\n  We can do a pretty good job of saying what we don't like in \nObamaCare. Three years ago, I was asked by Senator McConnell and \nSpeaker Boehner to lead off for the Republicans at the President's \nHealth Care Summit. I took the opportunity to outline for the President \nsome of the problems with his proposal that we saw at that time. It \nturned out that we were pretty prescient in what we were saying because \nmost of the problems we predicted have happened: increased premiums, \nmore spending, more taxes. We said a 2,700-page bill, more or less, \nprobably has a lot of surprises in it. The bill cut Medicare by one-\nhalf trillion dollars, not to make Medicare solvent, but to spend on a \nnew entitlement even though Medicare is going broke within several \nyears according to the Medicare trustees. If Medicare goes broke, \npeople will not be able to depend on it.\n  We said the new law would mean there will be about one-half trillion \ndollars of new taxes, and millions of Americans' premiums would go up. \nToday, the newspapers are filled with stories of rising premiums. So \nthat is what we said at the President's Health Care summit 3 years ago. \nNow we have an obligation to say what we would like to do instead.\n  I said to the President at that time: Mr. President, the \nPresident's--your proposed health care law is an historic mistake \nbecause it expands a health care delivery system that already costs too \nmuch instead of taking steps to reduce its costs. The law is a mistake \nbecause it attempts to be comprehensive, and it is too big a bite to \nchew, too much to swallow, and too much to digest at one time.\n  That is turning out to be right. That is why we have all these \ndelays. So we suggested why don't we go step-by-step to begin to reduce \nhealth care costs? We suggested at the President's health care summit \nworking with him in a bipartisan way to do that.\n  We can still do that. We can delay it. We can dismantle the parts of \nit I talked about. Then what do we do?\n  Step No. 1, make Medicare solvent so seniors can depend on it. \nSenator Corker and I have a proposal which will do that, offer seniors \nmore choices and at the same time reduce the Federal debt by nearly one \ntrillion dollars over the next 10 years. Medicare needs to be solvent \nbecause we have many Tennesseans who depend on it to pay their hospital \nbills, and it is going broke in a few years if we don't take steps to \ndo that.\n  No. 2, give Governors more flexibility with their state Medicaid \nprograms. Medicaid has gone from 8 percent of the State budget when I \nwas Governor in the 1980s to 26 percent today. It is soaking up money \nthat ought to go to higher education. Governors would like to keep \ntuitions from going higher, but they cannot and the main reason is \nFederal Medicaid mandates get in the way so we need to make Medicaid \nmore flexible.\n  I said when the health care debate was going on that every Senator \nwho votes for it ought to be sentenced to go home and serve as Governor \nfor 2 years to implement it. That may be one reason we have so many \nGovernors who are having a hard time balancing their budgets with all \nthese federal mandates.\n\n  No. 3, strengthen innovative workplace wellness programs. The \nadministration has a regulation that needs to be repealed that \nrestricts the ability of employers to say to employees: If you live a \nhealthy lifestyle, you can have lower insurance premiums.\n  No. 4, let small businesses pool their resources and offer a lower \ncost insurance plan for their employees.\n  No. 5, provide families the opportunity to purchase insurance across \nState lines.\n  No. 6, expand access to health savings accounts and catastrophic \nhealth insurance plans, which would give people an opportunity to buy \ncheaper insurance rather than more expensive insurance.\n  No. 7, incentivize the growth of private health insurance exchanges.\n  No. 8, make it easier for patients to compare prices and the \nqualities of doctors.\n  No. 9, incentivize States to reform junk medical malpractice \nlawsuits.\n  I have talked about one way to delay ObamaCare, two ways to dismantle \nit, and nine steps to move from expanding a health care delivery system \nthat already costs too much. By introducing more choice and competition \ninto our health care delivery system, we can acheive the goal of \nreducing costs for most Americans. That is a strategy, an agenda and a \nplan that will earn the confidence of enough independent voters in \nTennessee and other States across this country to elect more Republican \nSenators, or Democratic Senators who agree with us, and that will give \nus a chance to dismantle, delay, and repeal the health care law, which \nwas an historic mistake.\n  This is nothing new. We counted it up. Republicans mentioned 173 \ntimes in the health care debate our step-by-step plan to reduce health \ncare costs. We still stand ready to put it into place.\n  The best way to repeal Obamacare is not to shut down the government. \nThe best way to do it is to take over the government, elect some more \nSenators, and elect a President. Put it in a bill. That is our \nconstitutional system. We all admire the Constitution. We carry it in \nour pockets, and we talk about it. We have a constitutional system, and \nwe have to follow those rules if we want to make legislative changes.\n  I greatly respect the passion and the endurance of those Senators who \nargue that we should shut down the government if we don't get our way \nimmediately on the health care law. I respect that just as I remember \nthe Alamo and respect our great Tennessean Davy Crockett who went to \nTexas. But on this one, when it comes to tactics, I am in General Sam \nHouston's camp. I think we will have to show patience to win the war. \nIn the meantime, let's delay ObamaCare, let's dismantle it, and let's \nshow the American people that we have a better plan with better steps \nto replace what is in the law now with a step-by-step plan to reduce \nthe cost of Americans' health care. That is the plan I am voting for \ntoday and the rest of this week and the rest of this year and next \nyear, until we get the job done.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From The Tennessean, Sept. 24, 2013]\n\n           Tennessee Voices: Health Care Law Must Be Delayed\n\n        (By U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn and U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake)\n\n       As we approach the Oct. 1 deadline when the Affordable Care \n     Act begins to go into effect, it becomes more and more \n     evident that the president's health care law is not ready for \n     prime time.\n       Through our congressional oversight and the feedback we get \n     from businesses and families around the country on a daily \n     basis, we have seen just how frustrated people are with the \n     impact ACA is having on their lives. It has become very clear \n     that this law is unworkable. A recent CNN poll shows support \n     for the president's health care law waning, with only 39 \n     percent of Americans now in favor of it, down from 51 percent \n     in January.\n       With the Obama administration's decisions to delay several \n     parts of the health care law, including the employer mandate, \n     it is clear that even the White House now recognizes what the \n     rest of America already knows: ``Obamacare'' is a train \n     wreck.\n       Businesses small and large across our states have shared \n     stories about the burdens the Affordable Care Act is placing \n     on them. Couple that with the most recent jobs numbers from \n     the Bureau of Labor Statistics,\n\n[[Page S6862]]\n\n     and it is difficult not to conclude that the law is having a \n     dampening effect on the country's economy.\n       That is why we have introduced legislation that would delay \n     all ACA provisions and taxes for one year. H.R. 2809/S. 1490 \n     seek to postpone all provisions of the Affordable Care Act \n     taking effect on Jan. 1, 2014, or later by one year from the \n     date of enactment.\n       Delaying the law is a necessary step in our efforts to get \n     it off the books and replace it with real health care \n     solutions that work for American families and businesses. It \n     builds on efforts already taken by the House and Senate to \n     delay both the individual and employer mandates. In fairness \n     to American taxpayers, the best thing we can do right now is \n     to implement a one-year delay so we can continue to chip away \n     at this disastrous law.\n       Postponing ``Obamacare'' gives us the best chance to defund \n     it. If we delay the law, the administration will be unable to \n     collect new taxes, provide subsidies or expand Medicaid, all \n     things that put taxpayers further on the hook.\n       As Republicans continue to work to implement real health \n     care solutions for Americans, our legislation is the right \n     step to take. In fairness to taxpayers, our best option today \n     is to delay the law's implementation for one year and \n     continue to work to enact policies that put patients and \n     doctors in charge of health care and do not require trillions \n     of dollars of taxpayer money.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, when I was working in Indiana last \nmonth, there was one thing I heard everywhere I went: Congress should \nspend less time fighting and more time focusing on creating jobs.\n  We have made significant progress in Indiana since seeing \nunemployment rates north of 20 percent in some of the counties in our \nState just a few years ago, but there is a lot of work yet to be done. \nToo many Hoosiers are still looking jobs.\n  For all of the fighting here in Washington, back home in Indiana \neveryone is on the same page. They want good-paying jobs so they can \ntake care of their families, send their kids to college, and retire \nwith dignity. That is what Hoosiers want, and most think Congress can \ndo something to help in that regard, even if that something is simply \nthis: Don't make things worse.\n  What, instead, do many of my constituents think they are getting from \nthe legislative branch? George Smeltzer from Nineveh, IN, sent me an e-\nmail. He said:\n\n       Enough is enough already! Washington is like a bunch of \n     children playing at recess and all fighting for one toy. \n     Unfortunately, the toy is the American people. I've news for \n     you, most average Americans are not liberal lefts' or \n     conservative rights,' we are somewhere in the middle and we \n     are tired of being smashed around like ping pong balls in a \n     partisan game of ``politics.''\n\n  We are at a critical point in our ongoing economic recovery. In the \nnext week this Congress will decide whether to keep the Federal \nGovernment open and operating. In the weeks ahead this Congress will \ndecide whether to continue to pay the government's bills--our bills. We \ncan go one way, the responsible way, and show the American people we \nare capable of working with one another or we can continue to yell at \neach other to score political points, refuse to be realistic about the \nneed to find common ground, and shut down the government and stop \npaying our bills--the bills for which we are responsible. Clearly, I \nprefer the responsible way--the way that can add thousands of \nadditional jobs for the folks back home who want and need them.\n  When I first spoke on the Senate floor this spring, I discussed my \nstrong belief that government can help create the conditions necessary \nfor businesses to expand and hire more workers and for the American \nworkforce to be better ready to hit the ground and be moving on day \none. I am offering three straightforward, bipartisan, commonsense \nthings that we can do right now to help the economy.\n  We should pass the bipartisan AMERICA Works Act introduced by my \nfriend Senator Kay Hagan from North Carolina and supported by Senator \nDean Heller and me. We are training the next generation of employees to \nhave the skills that employers need.\n  We should finish our work on a 5-year bipartisan farm bill that the \nPresident can sign into law. American farmers deserve that certainty.\n  We should also cut redtape to encourage private investment in \ninfrastructure. I am working with Senators Portman and McCaskill on a \nbill that would cut redtape to improve the permitting process for big \ninfrastructure projects so we can help private industry create jobs in \nIndiana, Ohio, and across the country.\n  Fights to and possibly beyond the brink about whether to have the \ngovernment up and running and whether to pay the government's bills, \nour bills, in a timely fashion have a devastating effect on confidence \nand on our still-recovering economy. However, when we do the \nresponsible thing and actually do our jobs, we can help the economy and \nwe can help our constituents and maybe as a result give them reason to \nhave a little bit more confidence in this institution and in our \ncountry's government.\n  Sharon O'Brian of Crawfordsville, IN, told me in an email: I am sure \nmany Hoosiers feel as I do. There needs to be compromise between the \nparties in order to begin solving the many problems facing our country \ntoday.\n  Let's start solving, not creating, problems for our country. Let's \nhelp create jobs, let's get to work, and let's build America.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I want to begin with a story about two young \nmen, both 29, both married with a couple of kids, and both contracted \ncancer the same day--malignant melanoma, the kind of cancer that comes \nfrom a mole. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon in our society. One of \nthose young men had insurance. In fact, he had an insurance policy that \nprovided preventive care, and under that policy they provided a free \ncheckup. Indeed, his insurance covered his ability to go and have his \ncheckup in the evening so he didn't even have to take a day off from \nwork.\n  He went in, had a checkup, and the doctor found a mole on his back \nand said: This doesn't look so good. I think I should take it off.\n  A week later when he went back to have the stitches out, the doctor \nsaid: I think you should sit down. You have a pretty serious form of \ncancer.\n  The young man went to the hospital and had an operation which removed \na hunk of his back. He had stitches under his arm. The lymph nodes were \ntaken out, and fortunately they found that the cancer had not yet \nspread. He didn't have to have chemotherapy or radiation. He was OK.\n  The other young man didn't have insurance, so he didn't go to the \ndoctor and have a checkup. He had the mole on his neck, but he didn't \nreally notice it or pay much attention to it.\n  Six or 8 months later he noticed a lump in his neck. He still didn't \npay any attention to it. He didn't have insurance and didn't really \nwant to spend the money to go to the emergency room or go to the \ndoctor, so he didn't pay much attention to it and he let it go.\n  Six months later the lump was so large that he finally went to the \ndoctor, and they biopsied it and found that it was metastasized \nmalignant melanoma. He had chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, but a \nyear later he died.\n  That story means a lot to me because I am the first guy. Forty years \nago, when I was a staff member in this institution, I went and had that \ncheckup because I had insurance. They found the mole, they did the \nsurgery, and here I am today.\n  I have often thought about that and wondered, why me? Just luck--but \nalso because I had insurance. I can say with certainty that if I had \nnot had that insurance, I would not have gone to that checkup. If I had \nnot had the checkup when I did within months or perhaps a year and a \nhalf, I would have been gone.\n  I have a similar story about a daughter of a friend of mine, Dick \nGould up in Maine. Dick had a daughter named Cindy who was diagnosed \nwith severe asthma at the age of 3. All her life she battled it. She \nlived in a very rural part of Maine. She didn't have a lot of money and \ncould never afford insurance, but she fought the asthma as best she \ncould. She did the best she could, but she couldn't afford the \nexpensive treatments.\n  Finally, not long ago, at the age of 53, Cindy Gould died, leaving a \nhusband, children, and grandchildren, one of whom she hadn't ever met. \nWhy did she die? Because she didn't have insurance. She couldn't afford \nto go in and have the care she needed.\n\n[[Page S6863]]\n\n  Why are we having this discussion here in the Senate this week about \nhealth care? The answer is pretty clear. There are 50 million people in \nthis country who have no health insurance. The estimates are that \nbetween 20,000 and 30,000 of those people die each year--like Cindy \nGould--because of the lack of health insurance. Why doesn't that bother \nus? Why aren't we spending days and nights here talking about how to \nsolve this problem instead of how to dismantle the most significant \nhealth care program that has come to this country in years? Why?\n  I have a theory about that. It is because those deaths are invisible. \nThey happen one at a time in Greenville, ME; in Portland, ME; in San \nDiego, CA; and El Paso, TX, so nobody knows. It is not listed in the \nobituary: Died because of no health insurance.\n  I would submit that if those 25,000 people--which is a conservative \nestimate--in this country all died at the same time and in the same \nplace, we would be turning the world upside down to solve the problem. \nJust imagine that kind of loss in a small town in the Presiding \nOfficer's State each year--25,000 people a year.\n  On September 11, 2001, we had a tragedy in this country, and 3,000 \npeople died. It was a terrible day. What have we done as a result of \nthat day? We turned our society upside down, we protect ourselves at \nairports, and we spent money for screening and protection. We spend $70 \nbillion a year just on intelligence in order to protect ourselves from \nanother September 11. Yet, quietly and insidiously, every year over \n20,000 people die because they don't have insurance.\n  Another 700,000 families lose everything because of medical bills. We \nare the only country in the world where that happens. We are the only \ncountry in the industrialized world where people are prone to lose \neverything because they are swamped with medical bills. That is \nridiculous. Would we watch someone die in our front yard? Of course \nnot. We would call 911. We would call the doctor. We could do CPR. We \nwould do whatever we could to keep them alive. But we are quietly as a \nsociety watching over 20,000 people a year die, and we are arguing \nabout the details of how to solve this problem.\n\n  To me, it is a moral question. There is a lot of economics involved. \nThere are a lot of questions about costs and we will talk about that. \nBut, fundamentally, it is a moral question. The moral question is, Are \nwe going to stand by and watch people suffer and die because of \nideology and politics? No other country in the world has answered yes \nto that question, and that is the question that is before us.\n  So what is this thing called ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act? What \nis it? The first thing to say is what it is not. What it is not is a \ntremendous impact on American business. Ninety-six percent of the \nbusinesses in America have less than 50 employees. They are not \naffected by ObamaCare at all. In fact, they are probably benefited by \nit because whether or not they choose to buy health insurance, their \nemployees can get health insurance through the new health exchanges, \nand that is probably a benefit to those businesses. But 96 percent of \nthe businesses the law doesn't apply to. Ninety-eight percent of the \nlarger companies--200 employees and more--already provide health \ninsurance to their employees. So the law doesn't apply to them. Ninety-\nfour percent of the smaller firms, from 50 to 199, already provide \nhealth insurance to their employees.\n  So this idea that somehow ObamaCare is taking over the health care \nindustry in this country is nonsense. Eighty percent of the people are \nlargely unaffected by it. They are either the 50 percent who are \ncovered by their employers now or the 22 or 23 percent who are under \nMedicare now and 7 or 8 percent under Medicaid. But that leaves 15 \npercent uncovered, uninsured, unprotected, and that is between 45 \nmillion and 50 million people.\n  This is not a government takeover. There is no place in America one \ncan go and sign up for ObamaCare. If one goes onto an exchange, they \nget insurance from Anthem or Blue Cross or Health First or Aetna. One \ndoesn't get ObamaCare, one gets insurance coverage from private \ninsurance companies, just as we have done in this country for most of \nthe 20th and 21st centuries. It is not a government takeover.\n  Here is what it is: It is a mechanism to make it easier and cheaper \nfor those people who are uninsured to find a way to get insurance: to \ngo online to a health exchange, which is nothing but I suppose one \ncould call it the Amazon or e-Bay of health insurance where people can \nsee what their options are, make their choices. They get support from \nthe rest of us if they are within certain income levels, and it makes \nhealth insurance affordable.\n  It is based upon the free market principle of competition, and that \ngroup rates are better than individual rates, and the essence of the \nsystem is a marketplace where people can buy private health insurance.\n  It is also insurance reform. It repairs and improves and mandates \nsome improvements in the way health insurance works, to avoid some of \nthe real glaring problems that most people have identified with and \nmany people have run up against. One is a limitation that health \ninsurance companies have to spend 80 percent of the money they take in \non health care. In other words, there is a limit on profit and \noverhead. I think all of us feel that is reasonable. That is already \nhappening, and, in fact, some people are getting refund checks from \ntheir insurance companies because they were spending too much on \noverhead and profit.\n  Under the insurance reforms of the bill, women are treated equally \nfor the first time. There is an emphasis on preventive care.\n  I go back to my own story. Preventive care saved my life. It was a \nheck of a lot cheaper than the care that was provided to the fellow who \ndidn't have insurance because he didn't catch it in time. He ended up \nin the emergency room. He ended up having surgery, chemotherapy, and \nradiation, and ultimately futilely, but that treatment cost a lot more \nthan my treatment did because I was insured and had preventive care.\n  It also allows kids to stay on their parents' policies until they are \n26. This is a big deal, because it allows kids to take jobs and do \nthings and travel and work but not have to focus on whether they have \nhealth care. They can stay on their parents' policies until they are \n26. That is happening right now all across America.\n  There are no lifetime caps.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we are the only country in the world where \npeople get wiped out by health care costs. Nowhere else is that even \nremotely an issue the way it is here.\n  Finally, a person can't be denied health insurance because of \npreexisting conditions. That is crucial, because there are millions of \npeople across this country, through no fault of their own but because \nof the vagaries of health, who have problems they were born with or \nthat came on in their youth and under the old rules, they can't get \ninsurance. Now they can't be denied insurance. That is going to make a \nlot of difference to people in this country.\n  Because of that--and I watched Senator Cruz last night, and he talked \nabout this. If you are going to require insurance be issued to people \neven if they have preexisting conditions or some kind of illness, then \nyou also have to mandate that everybody buys it; otherwise, nobody \nwould buy it until they are in the ambulance on the way to the \nhospital. If a person didn't have to buy fire insurance before the \nfire, everybody would buy it when they saw the flames coming up from \ntheir house. I think Senator Cruz, the Senator from Texas, used that \nimage last night. To me, that makes common sense.\n  It also makes common sense because it is a matter of personal \nresponsibility. I always thought that was a conservative principle. I \nremember in the 1970s and 1980s it was a conservative principle that \npeople should take responsibility for themselves.\n  Right now in our society, if a person is sick, and if a person has no \ninsurance, they are treated. The hospital cannot turn you away. What \nthat means is we all pay. That person is in effect a free rider. They \nhave insurance; it is all the rest of us. I think it is a basic \nprinciple that they should take care of their own responsibility.\n  People act as though this is some kind of radical notion. We have \nhad--I don't know about the State of the Presiding Officer and other \nStates, but in\n\n[[Page S6864]]\n\nour State we have had mandatory automobile insurance for as long as I \ncan remember and nobody questions it, because it is a responsibility. \nYou need to be responsible for yourself. As I say, this was always a \nconservative principle until lately, and all of a sudden it isn't. It \nreminds me of the old line of Mort Sahl, the comedian back in the \n1950s, who said, ``If you maintain a consistent political opinion in \nthis country long enough, you will eventually be tried for treason.''\n  And here we are; what was once a conservative principle is now \nanathema. But I think it is all about personal responsibility and \nproviding for yourself.\n  I understand,--I have seen press releases that there are people going \naround the country telling young people not to sign up for coverage. I \nthink that is outrageous. It is unbelievable. And they are sentencing \nsome of those people to death or to severe injury because they are not \ngoing to have health insurance when they are going to need it.\n  All young people are immortal. I was when I went in for that checkup \nwhen I was 29 years old. They think they are. But to tell people not to \nget insurance when it is available, particularly when it is available \nat low cost, I think is something that should weigh on the conscience \nof whoever is funding and developing that campaign around the country.\n  So what is the Affordable Care Act? It is a mechanism to buy \ninsurance. No. 2, it is reform to the insurance industry in terms of \nwhat the requirements are; and No. 3, buried in it are pilot programs \nthat may turn out, in my view, to be the most important part of the \nproject, the most important part of the bill, because they encourage \nchanges in the way we deliver health care.\n  As I will mention in a minute, the real problem with health care is \ncost, and these pilot programs that are being used around the country, \nincluding in Maine, are already having some spectacular results. I \ntalked to two people from our two major Maine hospitals this morning. \nThey are seeing a 60-percent reduction in emergency room use and a 70-\npercent reduction in rehospitalization because of what is called the \nAccountable Care Organization Structure that they have put in place for \nMedicare patients in Maine.\n  They are seeing better care at substantially lower costs, and this is \nthe kind of pilot and innovative program that is also in the Affordable \nCare Act that nobody ever hears about or talks about that I think, as I \nmentioned, may turn out to be the most important part of the bill.\n  That is it: limits on insurance provisions, greater access to \ninsurance. I think we need to calm down around here about what this \nbill does.\n  It is not perfect. It is complicated. It does have some \nimplementation issues that I am worried about. I am worried about too \nmuch regulation. I am worried that they will overdo the regulations \nsomewhere in the government as they implement this, and I think that is \nsomething we need to pay close attention to. There are problems such as \nthe 30-hour workweek versus 40 hours. Those are the kinds of things I \nthink we need to pay attention to and we need to fix. There has never \nbeen a perfect piece of legislation, perhaps, other than those Ten \nCommandments on Mount Sinai, but we need to try to fix things and not \njust say, Oh, well, we are going to tear the whole thing apart and \nstart over. I am a little skeptical on the starting over part because I \nhaven't seen any inclination to do so.\n  As I mentioned, the larger health care problem is cost. We are now \nspending 18 percent of our gross domestic product on health care--by \nfar the highest number in the world. Japan is at about 11, and everyone \nelse is at 8 or 9 percent. We are spending twice as much per capita as \nanyone else in the industrialized world and our results aren't that \ngood, by all kinds of international standards, including infant \nmortality, longevity, customer satisfaction. We are in the 15, 17, 20, \n25th in the world, and we are paying twice as much.\n  There is also this cost problem is what is killing our budget. All of \nthe debt and deficit problem we are projecting in the Federal budget is \nbased upon health care costs: Medicare, Medicaid, and public employees. \nThat is where the deficit is. It is not in the national parks, it is \nnot in Head Start, it is not even in the Department of Defense. It is \nhealth care costs, and we need to talk about that and work on it and do \nsomething about it.\n  I think these pilot programs within the Affordable Care Act are \nshowing amazing promise just in the last couple of years that they have \nbeen in place.\n  A note on process, and then I will yield the floor. I have never \nknown of a time when the repeal of a particular piece of legislation \nhas been used, has been held hostage, in order to keep the government \nrunning. We have had arguments about budgetary matters at the ends of \nbudget periods, and there was a shutdown in the 1990s about spending \nand budgets, but I have never heard of a time when a group tried to use \na bill and say we are going to repeal this bill or we are going to shut \ndown the government.\n  In the 1950s and 1960s, the southerners were dead set against civil \nrights legislation. They filibustered and tried to stop it, but it \nultimately was passed in the 1960s, and was a proud moment for this \nbody and this institution. They never said: But we are going to shut \ndown the government if you fund it or enforce it. They had too much \nrespect for the institution. They had too much respect for the \nimportance of the continuity of government over and above any issue, no \nmatter how passionately they felt about it.\n  I hope this weekend we can let go of this idea that a minority of the \ngovernment can hold it hostage because of one particular piece of \nlegislation that they don't like.\n  This is an economic but it is also a moral issue. It is about trying \nto help people deal with the shadow of health care hanging over them. \nIt is not perfect, but it corrects some of the most glaring defects in \nthe private insurance system, and it provides an opportunity to \nmillions of Americans to escape the day-to-day shadow of a health care \ncatastrophe.\n  To those who want to fix it, I stand ready to help. To those who have \nideas and suggestions, I stand ready to listen. To those who want to \ndestroy it, however, I stand in your way. And to those for whom the \nshadow has finally been lifted, I stand at your side.\n  I thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The senior Senator from Texas \nis recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as we discuss our efforts to support an \neffort that started in the House to defund ObamaCare in this \nlegislation, I want to start by congratulating my colleague Senator \nCruz on his remarkable 21-hour performance. I promise I will not try to \nduplicate that, at least not right now. But I do admire his passion and \nhis energy, and I think probably more than anyone in recent memory, he \nhas done more to raise this issue to the American consciousness and \ninspired people by his passion.\n  I want to say that I share his determination to stop ObamaCare before \nit does any more damage to our country. The two of us represent 26 \nmillion people in the State of Texas, and we have heard countless \nstories of how the President's health care law is already hurting not \njust individuals and families and small businesses, but hurting the \neconomy.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from Maine saying the President's \nhealth care law is working pretty well. But I have to say, even though \nI disagree with him about ObamaCare actually working, it strikes me \nthat one point is irrefutable; that is, ObamaCare is hurting the \neconomy and hurting job creation. We have heard at least from some of \nthe major organized labor organizations in America--people like Richard \nTrumka, who said that ObamaCare is killing the 40-hour workweek. It is \nmaking full-time work into part-time work. That is one reason he and \nother labor organization leaders went to the White House recently and \nasked the President for a special opt-out or waiver.\n  I believe the only solution is to dismantle ObamaCare in its \nentirety. Some have said: After Senator Cruz got through speaking \ntoday, after his remarkable 21-hour performance, the debate is over. To \nthem I would say, the debate has only just begun. We will be here in \nthe Senate for the remainder of this week debating the effort to defund \nObamaCare.\n\n[[Page S6865]]\n\n  My friends across the aisle have repeatedly said that because \nRepublicans want to protect the American people from ObamaCare, we want \nto take health insurance away from millions of Americans. Nothing could \nbe farther from the truth.\n  Democrats argue that Republicans have not put forth any alternatives \nto ObamaCare. That is false. It is time to set the record straight.\n  When it comes to health care reform, Republicans have three main \nobjectives, all of which are filed under ObamaCare. One, we want to \nreduce costs. The President said this was one of his goals in \nObamaCare. He promised that the average family would see a reduction in \ntheir health care costs of $2,500. What are the facts? We have seen \nhealth care costs go up by an average of $2,400 for that same family. \nWe want to expand quality insurance coverage, and we want to improve \naccess to care.\n  The President has put most of the apples with his health care plan in \nthe same sack, which is Medicaid. In Medicaid in my State, only about \none doctor out of every three will see a new Medicaid patient because \nit only reimburses doctors about 50 percent or less of what they charge \nother patients. So they simply have had to refuse to see new Medicaid \npatients.\n  So we want to reduce costs, we want to expand quality coverage so \nthat you own your own insurance policy, and we want to improve access \nto care.\n  In order to achieve those objectives, we first have to remove \nObamaCare from the table. We know what the evidence has been in the \nyears since ObamaCare first passed in 2010.\n  ObamaCare is already causing employers to drop health coverage. So if \nyou like what you have, it turns out you cannot keep it. It is already \ncausing doctors to leave Medicare, for the same reason. As I mentioned, \nthey are leaving Medicaid. It is already causing insurance providers to \nreduce consumer choice. We saw a story in the New York Times just a \ncouple days ago about that. We know it is already causing businesses to \nlay off workers and turn full-time work into part-time work.\n  It is already causing medical device manufacturers to close existing \nfactories here in America and to move their businesses offshore because \nof the taxes that target that particular part of the health care \nindustry.\n  And it is already causing many physicians to consider early \nretirement, causing a restriction in access to coverage, because unless \nyou can find a doctor to accept you, you do not have effective access \nto coverage, even though you may have something called Medicaid or \nMedicare.\n  If and when the law is fully implemented, ObamaCare will drive up \nindividual insurance premiums, it will cause millions of Americans to \nlose their existing health care coverage, it will jeopardize medical \nprivacy rights by injecting the IRS into the implementation, it will \nfurther damage an already broken Medicaid program, and it will prompt \neven more doctors to stop treating Medicare patients.\n  The closer we get to full implementation of ObamaCare, the more we \nlearn about its myriad problems and its unintended consequences. For \nexample, the ObamaCare exchanges are supposed to open next Tuesday. But \nmost people still do not know how much money they will be paying for \ninsurance. Meanwhile, a front-page story in USA Today talks about a \nlittle noticed provision of ObamaCare which threatens to cost some \nfamilies thousands of dollars in health insurance and leave up to \n500,000 children without coverage.\n\n  For that matter, even if ObamaCare is fully implemented on schedule, \nthe Congressional Budget Office projects that about 31 million \nAmericans will still not have coverage. I thought ObamaCare was \ndesigned to make sure everybody had coverage. So it seems to me it has \nfailed again in its stated objective.\n  My friends across the aisle like to say that Republicans are opposed \nto expanding health insurance coverage. But, as I have just told you, \nwe are actually for replacing ObamaCare, which would provide people \nwith more access to affordable health care.\n  In reality, what we are opposed to is policies that reduce health \ncare choices and dramatically disrupt people's existing health care \ncoverage. We are opposed to policies that raise taxes by more than $1 \ntrillion on people like the medical device manufacturers that I \nmentioned a moment ago, which hurts innovation, which hurts people's \naccess to the best quality of health care. And, yes, we are opposed to \npolicies that kill full-time jobs in favor of part-time work. And we \nare opposed to policies that cause insurance premiums to go up rather \nthan down.\n  It is true, we are opposed to policies that put government \nbureaucrats between you and your doctor when it comes to deciding what \naccess to health care you and your family ought to have. And we are \nopposed to policies that cause physicians to refuse to see Medicare \npatients.\n  We are opposed to policies that weaken our health care safety net. \nAnd we are opposed to policies that massively expand the power of the \nInternal Revenue Service--that is currently racked in scandal--getting \ninvolved in implementing your health care plan.\n  So again, we are for reform that helps bring down the cost and \nimproves access to quality health care in a way that does not interfere \nbetween the doctor and the patient. The kinds of health care reforms \nthat we are for are those that deal with cost, coverage, and access.\n  For example, we support equalizing the tax treatment of health \ninsurance so that individuals and employers are put on the same \nfooting, unlike today. We support letting individuals and businesses \nform risk pools, particularly across State lines, to provide more \nchoices and more competition when it comes to keeping down health care \ncosts. And we support abolishing onerous mandates.\n  Why should you have to buy health coverage that includes coverage you \ndo not need or want? For example, if you are a young man, why should \nyou have to buy a mandatory health plan that has maternity coverage in \nit? It does not make a lot of sense.\n  And, yes, we support giving more Americans choices when it comes to \nhow to pay for their health insurance using pretax dollars--things like \ntax free health savings accounts.\n  We also believe that making price information more transparent will \ncreate the kind of discipline that comes with a market. For example, if \npeople know what their health care costs are going to be, and they see \nwhat their choices are, they know that the competition that comes \nthrough market discipline will improve not only the price--it will \nbring it down--but it will improve the quality of service.\n  Perhaps the best recent example of that is the Medicare prescription \ndrug plan, which has now come in 40 percent below projected cost, \nbecause now seniors have choices when it comes to their prescription \ndrugs, and those plans compete based on price and quality of service. \nThat is benefiting the consumer and providing a lower price.\n  And, yes, we do support tighter curbs on frivolous medical \nmalpractice lawsuits, which drive up the costs of medical liability \ninsurance and drive doctors out of business. In Texas, we have had a \nwonderful pilot program. And I tell you, we have seen doctors move to \nTexas because they want some predictability when it comes to their \nmedical liability exposure and the costs of their malpractice \ninsurance. That, in turn, provides people with better access to \ndoctors.\n  And, yes, we believe that you can use State high-risk pools to insure \npeople with preexisting conditions. In other words, the idea that you \nneed to embrace the behemoth called ObamaCare just in order to cover \npeople with preexisting conditions is simply false. You do not. We can \ndo it much cheaper and more effectively by supplementing the State \nhigh-risk pools so people with preexisting conditions can get access to \nhealth care.\n  We support States having a lot more flexibility to manage Medicaid--\nsomething that can only happen now based upon a special dispensation \nfrom the Federal Government.\n  If we are able to help people coordinate their health coverage, we \ncan do a better job of making sure that even people on Medicaid get \naccess to health care at a lower cost.\n  As I said, we support introducing competition into Medicare so that \npatients and physicians could work together to hold down costs, just as \nthey have done in the prescription drug program that I mentioned a \nmoment ago.\n\n[[Page S6866]]\n\n  So here is the bottom line: ObamaCare is not the only way to expand \naccess to quality health care. In fact, it may well be the worst way to \nexpand coverage because it raises costs and it reduces patient choices, \nand you have to depend on the tender mercies of the Federal Government \nwhen it intervenes between you and your doctor when it comes to your \nchoices.\n  By contrast, we believe that health care reforms such as those I have \noutlined just a moment ago would allow us to expand access to quality \nhealth care at a lower price without interfering with the doctor-\npatient relationship.\n  Mr. President, before I conclude--because I know there are other \ncolleagues who want to speak--I want to explain once again why I \nsupport moving ahead with this legislation that is now before us.\n  I note that 100 Senators just voted for cloture on the motion to \nproceed to the continuing resolution which contains the defunded \nprovision passed in the House. I am committed to defunding ObamaCare \nfor the reasons I said. But I also believe that we ought to avoid a \nGovernment shutdown. I believe that to deny cloture--unlike the vote we \njust had, 100 to 0--to vote against cloture on the very resolution we \nare for that came from the House that would defund ObamaCare is a \nlittle hard to explain.\n  It may well prompt the government shutdown, which I think benefits no \none, and it could possibly damage our economy, which as I said earlier \nis fragile indeed. Here is the ultimate irony. If we are to shut down \nthe government because we refuse to pass a continuing resolution to \nkeep the government operating, ObamaCare still gets funded. That is \nbecause it has mandatory spending, in other words automatic spending, \nthat even if the government shuts down, ObamaCare still, by and large, \ngets funded.\n  You do not have to take my word for it. Dr. Coburn, Senator Coburn, \nhas asked the Congressional Research Service for their authoritative \nopinion. They said even if the government were to shut down, ObamaCare \nwill continue to be funded. So I support whatever strategy is likely to \nhelp us defund and ultimately dismantle ObamaCare, but in my view, \nshutting down the government is not the best strategy, because it would \nnot work. According to the Congressional Research Service, ObamaCare \nwould continue to be funded.\n  To be clear: Republicans are united in our desire to defund \nObamaCare. The bill before us does exactly that. So if we proceed to \nthe bill, my hope is that five Democrats--maybe the five Democrats who \nvoted for ObamaCare in its first instance but have been listening to \ntheir constituents as I have, people such as Richard Trumka and \norganized labor who have said: The promises you made, this simply is \nnot performing as advertised. We need something to be done to \nObamaCare.\n  We have solutions that will address that. So if we can find five \nDemocrats to join us, perhaps those Senators who are running for \nreelection in States that Mitt Romney carried by double digits, the \nSenate would have voted to defund ObamaCare. It is that simple.\n  Plenty of our colleagues have acknowledged the harm ObamaCare is \ndoing to our health care system, and to our broader economy. Now they \nhave a chance to do something about it. Now they have a chance to \nactually vote with Republicans to stop this law before it is fully \nimplemented.\n  Four years after Senate Democrats voted to enact ObamaCare on a \nparty-line vote--no Republican voted for it, all Democrats voted for \nit--the consequences of ObamaCare are plain for all of us to see. By \nproceeding to the House bill, we are forcing each Member of this \nChamber to take a stand either for or against their constituents when \nit comes to a failed health care bill, one of the most unpopular laws \nin the history of the country.\n  I know where I stand on ObamaCare. I know where all of my Republican \ncolleagues stand. All of us stand united in our desire to protect the \nAmerican people from this failed public policy.\n  I would urge our colleagues across the aisle to think again, listen \nto their constituents, including people such as Richard Trumka and \norganized labor and help us save America from this failed public policy \ndisaster.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent that after my 5 or 6 minutes, the \nSenator from New Hampshire be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I would remind my colleagues, after hearing \nSenator Cornyn's speech and also the very articulate words of Senator \nKing talking about a personal story--that this is full of personal \nstories of people who get preventive care or they don't and the \ndifference that makes in people's lives, the quality of their lives and \ntheir life expectancy.\n  I remind my colleagues that in my State alone, about 1 million \nseniors have gotten preventive care and various kinds of tests, senior \ncitizens in Medicare, at no cost, with no copay and no deductible. \nAbout 1 million Ohio seniors have gotten that benefit from the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  About 100,000 Ohioans in their twenties have been able to join their \nparents' health plan until they are age 26 and get insurance. People in \ntheir twenties who do not have insurance otherwise have it through \nsomething called the medical loss ratio, which for every dollar of \npremium in health insurance you pay, 80 to 85 percent of that must go \ndirectly into patient care rather than profits and executive salaries \nand marketing. That has forced insurance companies to write refund \nchecks to tens of thousands of Ohioans.\n  A number of Ohioans have benefited in a whole host of other ways. So \nwe know this health care law already is working, we know it will \ncontinue to work. When I hear people in Washington, DC, who dress like \nthis, who all enjoy pretty darn good health insurance, paid by \ntaxpayers, then I see my legislature in Columbus, legislators also who \nhave health insurance, not even expanding Medicaid, not even allowing \npeople, children especially and seniors and disabled people, and often \npeople who have low-wage jobs--deny them health insurance, I think \nsomething is dreadfully wrong.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk for a moment about something else in \nhealth care. Ancient cultures have been using plant extracts and other \nmixtures with antimicrobial properties to aid in healing for more than \n2,000 years. We are probably most familiar as Americans with the \nScottish scientist--I believe Scottish--Alexander Fleming who developed \npenicillin, which became a very common drug used kind of from the 1940s \non.\n  Last week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called \nantimicrobial resistance ``one of our most serious health threats.''\n  Antibiotics and other antimicrobials have been, in essence, a victim \nof their own success. We used these drugs so widely for so long and \nsometimes not always wisely, and sometimes indiscriminately, that the \nmicrobes they are designed to kill have adapted to them, making the \ndrugs less effective or in some cases totally ineffective.\n  I stand before you today to remind you of the need for a \ncomprehensive strategy to address microbial resistance. Each year, \nabout 2 million Americans contract bacterial infections in hospitals, \nand 20,000 of these people die because the microbes causing their \ninfections are resistant to frequently used antibiotics.\n  One of the most commonly reported antimicrobial resistant infections \nis something called MRSA, an acronym for methicillin-resistant \nstaphylococcus aureus. MRSA is a strain of staph infection resistant to \npenicillin and other related antibiotics. Once thought to be contracted \nsolely in hospital settings by older patients, MRSA is now affecting \nyoung, healthy people in our schools and communities. Within the last \nfew years, we have heard far too many media reports of high school and \ncollege age students losing their lives to these infections.\n  The statistics continue to be troublesome. A recent study from the \nUniversity of Chicago revealed that more people are checking into \nhospitals with MRSA than those with HIV or influenza combined. We \ncannot ignore that.\n  Molly Brudnick of Shaker Heights, a Cleveland suburb, contracted MRSA \nafter back surgery. She should have been concentrating on recuperating \nfrom her surgery. Instead she spent 6 weeks on IV antibiotics in a \nnursing home. She had to complete 3 months of\n\n[[Page S6867]]\n\nrehabilitation, with nursing care to tend her wounds. Molly's story is \nfar too common in my State and the Presiding Officer's State of \nConnecticut and across the country.\n  It does not have to happen. As this epidemic--if you call it that--\ncontinues to spread, the financial costs and the loss of life will \ncontinue to rise. A 2012 study at Columbia found that each drug-\nresistant infection cost $15,000 more to treat than other infections \nwhich are not antimicrobial resistant. That is unacceptable. Curing \nMRSA is one piece of the puzzle in eradicating the superbugs that are \nresistant to antibiotics.\n  In response to this health crisis, I join the CDC in urging enhanced \nattention and resources devoted to antimicrobial resistance. In 2008, \nI, along with Senator Hatch, the senior Senator from Utah, introduced \nthe STAAR Act, Strategies to Address Antimicrobial Resistance Act. I \nthank Senator Hatch for his leadership as we begin to see the epidemic \nof antimicrobial resistance develop.\n  The STAAR Act is a multiple-pronged approach to revitalized efforts \nto combat superbugs and prevent outbreaks of MRSA and other drug-\nresistant infections. The STAAR Act established a government task force \nto direct efforts to combat microbial resistance. The bill provides for \nmore research on drug-resistant bacteria and explores strategies to \nensure the development of new anti-infective drugs.\n  It also ensures that antimicrobial drugs will be prescribed and used \njudiciously. We have made far too many advances in modern medicine to \nlose the fight against microbes. I look forward to working on measures \nto preserve our existing arsenal of antibiotic and other antimicrobial \ndrugs and to ensure that new drugs are developed which can effectively \nfight superbugs.\n  I plan to reintroduce the STAAR Act soon. I will work with my \ncolleagues to see it moved to passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about what is \nhappening in my home State of New Hampshire as a result of ObamaCare. \nWhen I ran for the Senate in 2010, one of the reasons I decided to do \nso is because when I saw ObamaCare had been passed, I worried about \nwhat was going to happen with this law.\n  We saw it could offer less competition, limit peoples' choices, limit \ntheir choices on who would be their physician, and also change their \ninsurance policies and raise costs in a health care system that costs \ntoo much to begin with.\n  Sadly, we are now seeing all of these fears come true with ObamaCare. \nUnfortunately, I have seen it firsthand in my home State of New \nHampshire. In fact, I have heard it from my constituents, whether it is \nat a townhall, whether it is visiting with a small business, whether it \nis listening to someone who is having their hours cut because their \nemployer is trying to meet a 29-hour requirement.\n  In fact, right now in New Hampshire there is only one insurer that \nwas approved to offer health policies on New Hampshire's ObamaCare \nexchange. In order to prevent premiums from skyrocketing--and by the \nway, people in New Hampshire will be paying higher than the national \naverage for premiums under ObamaCare. But to prevent them from \nskyrocketing even further, this lone New Hampshire insurer has been \nessentially forced to limit its network of providers to exclude 10 of \nour 26 hospitals.\n  What does that mean for the people of New Hampshire? Several of the \nhospitals have been excluded as a result of ObamaCare from this \nexchange and did not make the list for coverage. They are, for example \nConcord Hospital, which serves residents in and around our State \ncapital, and that is not one of the providers in the network; \nPortsmouth Regional Hospital in Portsmouth. The largest city on our \nseacoast, Portsmouth Regional Hospital serves the surrounding areas. \nNot in the network.\n  Other hospitals in New Hampshire that are not in this network: \nFrisbie Memorial Hospital in Rochester; Southern New Hampshire Medical \nCenter in Nashua, where I live; Monadnock Community Hospital in \nPeterborough; Valley Regional Hospital in Claremont; and Alice Peck Day \nHospital in Lebanon.\n  This problem is especially challenging for people in New Hampshire \nwho live in rural areas. It is particularly unfair to them. For \nexample, Upper Connecticut Valley Hospital in Colebrook did not make \nthe cut. What does that mean that Upper Connecticut Valley Hospital in \nColebrook did not make the cut? If you live in Colebrook or \nStewartstown or Columbia, and you need maternal care, you have to drive \nto Berlin. If you have to drive to Berlin from some of those areas, \nthis round trip can take you 3 hours.\n  What does that mean when you need maternal care? If you have to drive \nover an hour or an hour and a half to get to the hospital, I have to \ntell you, the north country in the winter can be some tough driving. \nOne thing I know about the residents of our north country, they are \nresilient, they are tough, they are wonderful people. But they should \nnot be put through this as a result of fewer choices under ObamaCare.\n  I have been making trips across New Hampshire directly talking to my \nconstituents, including to business owners. The message I have heard \nfrom them is very clear. In fact, it has been raised with me on almost \nevery stop that I made in New Hampshire in August where I had the \nchance to talk to people from throughout all our State.\n  This is not an issue that is being raised because I am a Republican \nor a Democrat or an Independent. It is universal concern and worry \nabout the impact of ObamaCare and the increasing costs that people are \nseeing in health care as a result of ObamaCare and fewer choices that \npeople in New Hampshire are going to have.\n  Here is some of the mail I have received from some of my constituents \nabout this law.\n  Dave in Manchester wrote me that he and his wife are in their \nforties. This is what he had to say:\n\n       Our premiums went from quarterly in May to monthly as of \n     June. No birthdays or changes in health. Our monthly bill \n     went from $497.39 for myself to $572.67, a jump of over 15 \n     percent. My wife had her bill go from $572.67 to $801.84, a \n     jump of over 40 percent.\n\n  Dave says he makes approximately $31,000 a year after taxes and that \nhealth care takes up half of it.\n  Caroline from Grafton wrote:\n\n       Our school district and surrounding ones are cutting back \n     paraprofessional jobs to 29 hours. Many of these people were \n     full time. Instead, they hired several part-time people to \n     cover the once full-time positions. This law of unintended \n     consequences is devastating for those whose hours and \n     benefits have been cut. Now they are no longer entitled to \n     benefits; many of these individuals have worked for 15 years \n     or more as full timers.\n\n  John from Middleton wrote:\n\n       I am 61 and retired. I buy my own health insurance \n     privately. Since the Affordable Care Act, I have had to \n     change my insurance carrier because they left the State. I \n     changed my coverage because it became too expensive, and I \n     have had three increases in my premiums.\n\n  Chris from Nashua wrote:\n\n       As a small business owner and self-insured, I am very \n     worried about my costs going up. My broker mentioned that we \n     may see a 200 percent increase in our monthly rate.\n\n  Nancy lives near a hospital that was left out of the exchange. Ten of \nour hospitals, which is a huge amount in our State of New Hampshire, \nalmost a third of our hospitals, have been left out of the exchange. \nNancy wrote:\n\n       I want to continue to have my medical care with the \n     doctors, nurses, therapists, et cetera, whom I know and trust \n     and with whom I have an established relationship. Again, what \n     do I do? This is what the Affordable Care Act did for me.\n\n  We have seen recently that the headlines of what is happening with \nthe impact of ObamaCare tell the story. In my home State of New \nHampshire today, from the Associated Press: ``Health overhaul premiums \nin NH above average.''\n  The National Telegraph: ``Decision to eliminate Nashua hospital from \nhealth exchanges causes confusion.''\n  The Union Leader: ``Companies look for new ways to pay fees coming \nfrom ObamaCare.''\n  Concord Monitor: ``Concord hospital not part of provider network for \nObamaCare exchange plan in New Hampshire.''\n  Nationally, the headlines are telling the story as well. A Politico \nrecent article: ``ObamaCare: One blow after another.''\n  USA Today: ``Family glitch in health law could be painful. It could \nleave up\n\n[[Page S6868]]\n\nto 500,000 children without coverage and cost some families thousands \nof dollars.''\n  Washington Post: ``One week away, ObamaCare's small business \ninsurance exchanges not all ready for launch.''\n  CNBC on Main Street: ``ObamaCare hurts hiring: Staffing.''\n  USA Today: ``Pew poll: Health care law faces difficult future.''\n  There are many more I can go through here. It has been one bad story \nafter another because of the reality of implementing this flawed law.\n  The private sector impact of ObamaCare: We all want our economy to do \nbetter than it is doing right now, to provide jobs and opportunity for \npeople in this country, to make sure everyone in this country can live \nthe American dream. Yet the Affordable Care Act is hurting job creation \nand job hiring in this country.\n  Increasingly, employers are cutting benefits and shifting the burden \nof health insurance coverage to their employees. We have seen in the \nrecent impact of this law that the Cleveland Clinic is probably the \nbest example. The President went to the Cleveland Clinic during his \ncampaign and cited it as a model in terms of how health care could be \ndelivered in pitching his health care law. Yet the Cleveland Clinic \nrecently announced, as one of Ohio's largest employers, that it would \ncut jobs and slash 5 to 6 percent of its budget to prepare for \nPresident Barack Obama's health reforms.\n  Walgreen's recently announced it is dropping health insurance \ncoverage for 160,000 workers and will instead give them payments to \npurchase insurance through private exchanges. Time Warner and IBM plan \nto move retirees from employer-administered health plans to private \nexchanges.\n  We have seen similar stories from companies like Home Depot and \nTrader Joe's. They are going to end coverage for part-time employees. \nUPS is dropping coverage for employees' spouses.\n  In terms of the impact on jobs, what I have heard from companies in \nNew Hampshire, from the smallest to the largest, is they want to do \nright by their employees. The rising cost of premiums and the questions \nthat have been raised by ObamaCare have put them in a position where \nthey can't do what they want to do for their employees and their health \ncare. In many instances they are forced, because of higher costs, to \nnot hire that next employee.\n  If you think about the structure of this law, that it applies to \nthose with 50 employees or more, some are not going to open that next \nbusiness, or that next restaurant, because they do not want to fall \nunder this law.\n  What kind of law would we pass here to deal with the issue of health \ncare that actually makes it more difficult to hire people, that \nactually thwarts the private sector's desire to expand businesses or if \nyou have one restaurant, to have a second restaurant; if you have one \nshop, to open up a second shop?\n  The flaws in this law are not only that it reduces choices for \nconsumers, but it is reducing the choices that people in this country \nhave for jobs, which is wrong.\n  I think the best critiques that we have seen of the law actually came \nfrom President Obama's supporters, and they are the Teamsters Union, \nthe United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, and Unite \nHere.\n\n  They recently wrote the President and said:\n\n       We can no longer stand silent in the face of elements of \n     the Affordable Care Act that will destroy the very health and \n     well-being of our Members, along with millions of other hard-\n     working Americans.\n\n  They have also expressed concerns that this law will destroy the 40-\nhour work week.\n  As Senator Cornyn from Texas said:\n\n       As Republicans, we are united in repealing this law. We are \n     united in wanting to defund this law and wanting to make sure \n     that we can replace this law with commonsense reforms that \n     drive down health costs, increase competition for insurance \n     companies, and give people more choice, while making sure \n     that we do not interfere with the doctor-patient \n     relationship. If you like your doctor, you can keep your \n     doctor, which we are now seeing is not true, unfortunately, \n     under ObamaCare.\n\n  I will do everything I can to make sure we repeal this law, to make \nsure that we can ensure that people have choice, that they can keep \ntheir doctor, and that health care is affordable for people in this \ncountry.\n  However, I do not support shutting down the government in order to \ndefund this law. While some of my colleagues have urged us to shut down \nthe government--and they haven't said it in this term, they have said \nthey don't want to shut down the government--but the reality is they \nhave asked us to vote against a bill that is coming over from the House \nthat will defund ObamaCare, but will continue the funding for the \ngovernment. If we were to vote as a block against ending debate on that \nbill, then the result could be to shut down the government.\n  While Americans are opposed to ObamaCare, what we have seen in a poll \nas recently as today is that 80 percent of Americans say threatening a \ngovernment shutdown during budget debates is not an acceptable way to \nnegotiate. I believe we should make sure that we repeal this law.\n  I join in what the senior Senator from Texas said, and I would hope \nthat my Democratic colleagues would listen to what their constituents \nare saying about the negative impacts of this law and that they would \njoin us, join Republicans, in ensuring that we do defund this law, that \nwe work together, that we make sure that, by the way, businesses aren't \ntreated better than individuals in where we are right now with the \nimplementation of this law.\n  One of the most absurd things that I don't even know how you can \nexplain to people is the President has made the decision that the \nemployer mandate is going to be delayed until 2015. With regard to \nindividuals, they have not been given a similar delay. How do we \njustify treating businesses better than individuals with a law that is \ngoing to force many people into a position where they are paying higher \npremiums? They may, unfortunately, lose the hospital they prefer to go \nto in my home State of New Hampshire, or the physician they have that \ntrust and relationship with.\n  I would ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, how is it \nthat we can treat businesses differently than individuals here? Why \ndon't we join together and delay the individual mandate, at least until \n2015, as businesses are being treated by the President now in his delay \nof the employer mandate?\n  I hope on the other side of the aisle we can work together and listen \nto the American people who loud and clear are expressing the worries, \nthe concerns, and the impact this law is having on them. It has not \nbeen, unfortunately, a good impact.\n  Finally, I wish to say in terms of the strategy of shutting down the \ngovernment, I don't support it also because it is not going to work. \nThe Congressional Research Service has said that even if we shut down \nthe government, there has been mandatory spending baked into this law, \nso ObamaCare can mostly continue.\n  To those who are asking us to take that step, I would say that even \nif we were to do so, we will not achieve the purpose of fully defunding \nObamaCare or stopping ObamaCare from hurting average Americans.\n  I hope we can work together to make sure that we don't continue to \nhurt Americans, such as my constituents who are going to have to drive \nmuch longer distances to go to the hospital in the ObamaCare exchange \nin New Hampshire. They are paying higher premiums because of ObamaCare \nand have less choice. I would hope we could work together to ensure \nthat average Americans don't continue to be harmed by this law.\n  Finally, this piece of legislation was a signature of the President's \npolicies. It was something when he got into office he pushed right away \nto pass. The impact that many of us feared about this law--less \ncompetition, higher costs, interfering with keeping the doctor you \nwant, hurting jobs--we have now seen come to fruition. So why would we \nat this point try to shut down the government? Why would we at this \npoint give the President a lifeline? To quote the President's own \nformer Press Secretary on ``Meet the Press'' this weekend:\n\n       If you think about this from the White House perspective, \n     you've had three fairly forgettable weeks at the White House, \n     right? About to lose a vote on Syria; immigration reform \n     looks dead; you're sinking in quicksand, and here your \n     enemies throw you the\n\n[[Page S6869]]\n\n     rope and want to get in the quicksand instead of you.\n\n  Why would we put ourselves in a position where we would shut down the \ngovernment over a law that is the President's signature piece of \nlegislation and hand him a lifeline on this issue and, in the process, \nhurt average Americans, such as our military, that could be impacted by \na government shutdown, such as our veterans that could be hurt by a \ngovernment shutdown, such as air travel that could be impacted by a \ngovernment shutdown.\n  By the way, the last time we shut down the government, it cost us \nmore to reopen the government--$1.4 billion more--than it would have \ncost to just run the government. So from a fiscally conservative \nperspective it doesn't make any sense either.\n  I urge my colleagues on the Republican side to be united in repealing \nand replacing ObamaCare, and let's work together to do that. Let's work \ntogether while keeping the government going forward with responsible \nspending levels. Let's not forget we are $17 trillion in debt. Let's \nnot let that debate get sidelined by this debate of ObamaCare.\n  Finally, to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you have \nbeen hearing many of the same stories from your constituents. How can \nwe treat businesses differently than individuals? Why wouldn't you \nagree to something such as a delay of ObamaCare for 1 year for \nindividuals similar to the delay businesses have been granted by the \nPresident? Why would you want to continue to fund a law right now that \nis already hurting people in terms of their choice for their doctor and \ndriving up costs and hurting job creation?\n  I know we can resolve these issues and I know the American people \nexpect us to. I think we can do this in a way that helps address health \ncare costs, coverage, and in a more responsible way than ObamaCare has \ndone, allowing people to keep the doctor they have chosen and allowing \npeople to have greater choice through competition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, folks back home will often come up to me \nafter the Senate has gone through some crisis or complex procedure and \nthey will ask me: What just happened? Usually I can give them an \nexplanation. But I hope nobody asks me about what we have seen last \nnight and today because, to me, it is inexplicable.\n  A Senator holds the floor overnight delaying what turns out to be a \n100-to-0 vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to this bill. I am \nnot sure I can explain that back home, so let me try to describe what I \nexpect to see in the days to come.\n  The question before the Senate this week is whether some Members of \nthe Senate will succeed in disrupting much of the Federal Government if \nthey do not get their way in one matter on which they feel \npassionately.\n  This group of Senators argue that we should take away health \ninsurance from more than 20 million Americans. They urge us to take \naway cheaper prescription drugs and free preventive care for more than \n6 million seniors. They argue for kicking millions of young adults off \ntheir parents' health insurance coverage, and they argue for a return \nto the days when insurance companies could deny Americans health care \nbecause of a preexisting condition.\n  Are arguments over the elements of the Affordable Care Act in order? \nOf course they are. But what should be out of order, what should be off \nthe table is the tactic that opponents of the Affordable Care Act are \nemploying--at least some of those opponents. As we just heard from \nSenator Ayotte, she is an opponent of the Affordable Care Act who is \nnot going to vote for this tactic, and I commend her for it.\n  In order to eliminate the Affordable Care Act, some of these \nopponents would deny our military members their paycheck, some of them \nwould shut down our NIH clinics, they would halt Small Business \nAdministration assistance to small businesses, and they would close \nHead Start classrooms. All of that and many more government operations \nwould grind to a halt if this group had their way in order to eliminate \nhealth care reforms that would bring insurance to millions of Americans \nand protect coverage for those who already have it.\n  That is not just a policy failure. In my book, that is a failure to \nunderstand the role of an elected official in a democratic government. \nThis system does not function when Members of Congress threaten to shut \ndown the government and bring about legislative anarchy if they do not \nget their way on a particular policy.\n  So I am not going to try to persuade those Members on the value of \nObamaCare, even though already, thanks to ObamaCare, the number of \nyoung adults without health insurance has fallen by nearly 1 million, \nand a higher percentage of young adults have coverage today than at any \ntime since 1999.\n  I am not going to try to persuade those Senators on the value of \nObamaCare, although already inflation in health care costs has slowed \nto the lowest level in half a century. While the causes for this good \nnews are complex, many health care experts believe the Affordable Care \nAct's focus on quality and coordination of care is already having a \nmeasurable impact.\n  I am not going to try to persuade those Senators of the value of the \nAffordable Care Act, even though more than 6 million seniors are paying \nless for prescription drugs because the Affordable Care Act is closing \nthe doughnut hole in drug coverage and even though the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office projects that by 2016, 25 million Americans \nwho otherwise would have no health insurance will be covered, again \nthanks to the Affordable Care Act.\n  I am not going to try and persuade those Senators about the value of \nObamaCare, even though repealing the Affordable Care Act would, \naccording to the independent Congressional Budget Office, raise the \nbudget deficit by about $110 billion over 10 years.\n  While I am not going to question the sincerity of the Senators who \nargue that denying the American people those benefits is a good idea, I \ndo question the willingness of those who are willing to close down this \ngovernment to achieve their goal, to create legislative and \ngovernmental anarchy in pursuit of their goal as acceptable. I believe \nthe tactic of shutting down or threatening to shut down the government \nto get their way on an issue is appalling, and that is what the basic \nquestion is before us.\n  I have a number of issues that are important to me. So does every \nMember of this Senate. I believe very strongly in universal background \nchecks for firearms purchases. An opinion poll shows a large majority \nof the American public agrees with me. Should I threaten to shut down \nthe government if we don't pass universal background checks? Should I \nthreaten to delay pay to our men and women in uniform, to close \nclassrooms and health clinics and research labs, to waste billions of \ndollars by creating anarchy in the government if I don't get my way on \nuniversal background checks for firearms purchases?\n  I believe strongly we should close offshore tax loopholes that cost \nthe Treasury hundreds of billions of dollars, and I am hardly alone in \nthat belief. Should I threaten to default on the public debt and to \ndamage the full faith and credit of the United States if we don't pass \na bill to close those offshore tax loopholes?\n  I hold these beliefs and others with the same passion as those \nSenators who oppose the Affordable Care Act, but threatening a \ngovernment shutdown and chaos unless I get my way is, I believe, \ninconsistent with our responsibilities as Senators. So, yes, I feel \nvery strongly about background checks and tax loopholes and a host of \nother issues, but I can't imagine threatening government shutdown or \ndefault on our debt if I don't get what I want.\n  The effects of a government shutdown would be devastating to our men \nand women in uniform, who would be told they must stand at their post \nwithout pay. It would be devastating to patients with deadly diseases \nwho depend on clinics that would close their doors, and researchers who \nmust leave their labs. The mere cost of shutting down and then \nrestarting government operations would run to several billions of \ndollars. A shutdown could cut gross domestic product by a percentage \npoint or more, putting us back into a recession.\n  When the Founding Fathers launched this experiment in democracy, most\n\n[[Page S6870]]\n\nobservers--at least many observers--expected it to fail. They did so in \npart because they doubted that democracy could exist in a large and \ncomplex nation. Montesquieu declared that in any large democracy ``the \npublic good is sacrificed to a thousand private views.''\n  The Founding Fathers designed Congress so it could represent the \ninterests of large States and small States, of populace and rural \nareas, of North and South. The task they gave to Congress was to prove \nthat Montesquieu was wrong. It was here that our ``thousand private \nviews'' were to be weighed and considered, and from those deliberations \npublic policies aimed at the public good were to emerge.\n  The form of our government was designed to guard against any one \nfaction from succeeding in attempts to sacrifice the public good to its \nown concerns. At every turn, the Founders designed our constitution to \ndefend against extremism, to help all-too-flawed elected officials \ntransform what could be the anarchy of a large Nation with varied \nopinions into a coherent whole.\n  The tactics we are seeing in this debate, and the tactics threatened \nin the debt ceiling debate we will soon face, turn the Founders' vision \non its head. We are told that unless we give in to the demands of one \nfaction, that America will be plunged into shutdown, recession, \ndefault, and catastrophe. Two hundred twenty-six years into our \nexperiment in democracy this faction of Congress is trying to prove \nMontesquieu right. They would, indeed, sacrifice the functioning of our \ngovernment to advance one of their own views.\n  I oppose the efforts to defund ObamaCare, and I believe that \npreserving health care reform is vitally important to millions of \nAmericans. Defeating this attempt to close down the government unless \nzealots get their way is important to the very functioning of our \ndemocracy. It is deeply destructive to our ability to function as a \ndemocracy for Members of this Senate to threaten to bring down the \nwalls around us unless they get their way, and, hopefully, they will \nnot succeed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, in the United States we have the best \nhealth care in the world. We have the best doctors, the best nurses, \nthe best hospitals, the best clinics--across the board, the best health \ncare. I believe that is because we have a health care system where \nindividuals make decisions about their health care. They decide what \ndoctor they go to, what hospital, what clinic. They decide what health \ncare plan or what health care policy to choose.\n  But ObamaCare changes that. It brings government into running the \nhealth care system in a way we have never experienced before in the \nUnited States, a level of government involvement far beyond what we \nhave ever had before. The proponents of ObamaCare say otherwise, but \nthat is just not the case. Government will set up exchanges and operate \nthose exchanges, and it actually limits the number of policies and \noptions that can be offered on those exchanges. At the same time, the \ngovernment also prescribes coverage that must be offered in policies, \ndriving up costs and again reducing options--choices--for consumers.\n  Furthermore, ObamaCare kicks in effectively October 1--the start of \nthe fiscal year, next week--but clearly neither the Federal nor State \ngovernments are ready to go. That has been very well publicized, and, \nof course, that is why the administration has delayed the employer \nmandate for a year.\n  The question then is, Why hasn't President Obama also delayed the \nindividual mandate? Why would you delay the mandate for big companies \nacross this country but then not at the same time delay the mandate for \nthe American people, for individuals across this country?\n  That is just one of the many inconsistencies in the law and in the \nadministration of this law. That is why I support anything we can do to \neither defund or delay ObamaCare, and that is why our entire Republican \ncaucus supports doing anything we can to defund or delay ObamaCare. \nGranted, we have some different ideas on tactics, how best to do it, \nbut we are absolutely united in our effort to oppose ObamaCare.\n  The reality is that instead of ObamaCare, we should be encouraging \nmore choice and more competition in health care, not more government \ncontrol. That means things such as tort reform to help reduce the cost \nof health care. It also means encouraging more competition among health \ninsurance companies across State lines and expanded health savings \naccounts. Expanded health savings accounts, combined with high-\ndeductible insurance policies, will encourage young people to buy \nhealth insurance because their insurance premiums will be much more \naffordable. Again, more competition, more choice, more participation by \npeople of all ages, and as a result, a system that is sound, a system \nthat truly encourages and empowers individuals. That is how we empower \npeople to take control of their medical costs--not with a government-\nrun system but by empowering individuals. We empower health care \nproviders with tort reform, and we empower consumers with more choice, \nmore competition, and more options.\n  At the same time, we need to reform Medicare and Medicaid. We can \nsave hundreds of millions of dollars by reducing waste, fraud, and \nabuse. But we also need to provide the right incentives and more \nflexibility.\n  Take Medicare, for example. Right now in my home State of North \nDakota, on a relative basis we have lower cost health care than many \nother States, and at the same time that we have lower costs in North \nDakota, we have better outcomes. On a comparative basis, we have very \nhigh-quality medical care. So think about that--lower costs, better \noutcomes. But under Medicare, for that performance we are not rewarded. \nWe don't get more reimbursement, we get less reimbursement. That makes \nno sense. Think about it. So a State with low costs and better outcomes \ngets lower Medicare reimbursement than a State with high costs \nregardless of outcomes. Then you get more reimbursement? Think about \nthat as a system, rewarding higher costs, penalizing lower costs. That \nis the exact opposite of what we should have.\n  Those are the kinds of things we should be reforming, and we should \nreform them in a way that creates the right incentives.\n  Take Medicaid. Medicaid, the same thing. Here, you have way too much \nof a Federal one-size-fits-all. Why not give the States more \nflexibility so that they can respond to the circumstances in their \nState, find ways to improve care, and reduce costs and make sure those \nStates benefit when they do that so that they have the right \nincentives.\n  These are the kinds of health care reforms that make sense, common \nsense. These are the kinds of health care reforms that empower people. \nThese are the kinds of health care reforms we need.\n  Republicans will vote to defund ObamaCare. We need some Democrats to \njoin us for the sake of health care, for the sake of our economy, full-\ntime employment versus part-time employment. ObamaCare is hurting our \neconomy and hurting job creation. So for the sake of health care in \nthis country and for the sake of our economy, it is what the American \npeople want. They want us to fund this continuing resolution and they \nwant us to defund ObamaCare, and I ask our colleagues to join us in \nthis effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, here we are again. On Monday, September 30, \n5 days from now at midnight, absent some agreement and cooperation \nbetween the parties in the Chambers here in the Congress, the entire \nFederal Government will begin shutting down. Here we are again, another \nday, another fiscal crisis, another politically manufactured crisis--\nanother politically manufactured crisis that is threatening to tear at \nthe economic fabric of our whole country.\n  It would be hard to believe if it were not totally, completely \nbelievable. I have been in the Senate now just under 3 years but this \nis my third of these\n\n[[Page S6871]]\n\ncrises. I was actually up in the chair presiding that night back in \n2011, when we narrowly averted a shutdown, just minutes before funding \nexpired.\n  I was here with all the other Senators on New Year's Eve this past \nyear where we stopped just short of going over the fiscal cliff.\n  Here we are again. From shutdown to default, from the debt ceiling to \nthe fiscal cliff, now back to threatened shutdown and another default \ncrisis weeks away and with, of course, unemployment still standing \nabove 7 percent--7.3 percent.\n  In my home State, Delawareans don't understand how we keep ending \nback up in this place. We have a saying in Delaware that our politics \nare dominated by what we call the Delaware way, which means doing what \nis right even when it is hard. It means coming together to make tough \nchoices, Republicans and Democrats listening to each other and finding \nprincipled compromise.\n  It means being civil and playing by the rules, putting what is good \nfor our people ahead of what is good for our politics. It does not look \nto me as if we have been able to muster much of that Delaware way here \nin Washington.\n  Last week the Senate considered the bipartisan Shaheen-Portman energy \nefficiency bill. Energy efficiency is about as commonsense and \nnonpartisan as you can get. It is not about fossil fuels or renewable \nenergy, it is about making smarter choices and reducing our energy \nconsumption. The bill had support on both sides of the aisle. It was \nsupported by business and labor and the environmental community, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil, the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades. A very \nbroad range of folks and organizations all over our country endorsed \nthat bill.\n  I myself did work in energy efficiency when I was in the private \nsector at a manufacturing company and then again when I led Delaware's \nlargest county as county executive. I saw the real impact energy-\nefficiency technologies and strategies did have on the bottom line, for \nthe private sector and public sector, for families and businesses, and \nit is significant.\n  There is so much opportunity to make a real difference for our \neconomy, for our planet, for our communities in energy efficiency. That \nShaheen-Portman bill gave us a chance to tap into it. It would have \ngiven millions more Americans a chance to benefit and was scored at \ncreating 136,000 new jobs--but we blew it.\n  Instead of debating energy policy, taking up and amending and \nreforming and passing that bipartisan energy efficiency bill, the \nSenate was then dragged down into a petty partisan political battle \nover the Affordable Care Act, a law that, by the way, was debated in \nboth Chambers and passed, litigated before the Supreme Court and \nupheld, was central to the last Presidential election and was \nsustained.\n  I am not going to debate the merits of the Affordable Care Act at \nenormous length again. It is law. It needs to be modified. It needs to \nbe amended so it can work more smoothly and more effectively. But, \nfrankly, the law needs to be implemented. Every minute this Chamber \nspends reliving the settled debates of the past is a minute we are \nignoring the 11 million Americans out of work, the 31,000 Delawareans \ncurrently looking for a job. Each minute this Chamber spends on a \nfutile effort to strip middle-class Americans of their access to \naffordable health care is a minute we are ignoring so many challenges: \ninfrastructure, a generation of students ill-prepared for the \nchallenges of the future, communities ripped apart by tragic, senseless \ngun violence--there are so many other challenges and tasks before us. \nIt is insanely frustrating.\n  Is this what we signed up for? Is this why all of us worked as hard \nas we did to get here, knocked on doors and campaigned across our \nStates for months and months? Is this it? Is this governing? If \nCongress spent half as much time on manufacturing policy and on \nmanufacturing jobs as we seem to spend on manufacturing political \ncrises, our country would be in far better shape. It cannot pass laws \nbut Congress has become very good at manufacturing crises.\n  I am not running for President and I don't have to impress the tea \nparty so maybe I am missing something here. But we do have to be better \nthan this. We just have to. There is too much at stake for our States, \nfor our country, for our families, for the economy, for the world.\n  This morning the Steering and Outreach Committee had a dozen \neconomists come in and offer their insights on what would happen if the \ngovernment really does shut down 5 days from now. If we do then default \non our national debt the next month, what would happen to the 11 \nmillion Americans still looking for jobs? What would happen to our \nresurgent American manufacturing industry and the half million jobs \nthat have been created there? Their answers were not encouraging--in \nfact, depressing, really.\n  What was clear is that these political showdowns in this Chamber \nexact a real cost on our economy. They hurt the ability of business \nowners to plan ahead. They inject incredible unneeded uncertainty into \nour markets. They generally erode our Nation's credibility and \nleadership on the world stage. But we keep ending up right here.\n  One of my constituents, John Henderson from Frederica, DE, wrote me \nlast week and said:\n\n       The strength of our economic recovery is on the line and \n     government's ability to make people's lives better is in \n     jeopardy. Congress needs to confront our problems \n     responsibly, but when some lawmakers dig in their heels and \n     threaten to seriously damage America if every one of their \n     demands isn't met, our Government can't function. This isn't \n     the time for a game of chicken. It's time to govern.\n\n  John, you are right. Mr. President, he is right. This gridlock, this \nrepeated manufactured crisis environment is embarrassing. I am on the \nBudget Committee, and under the leadership of our Chair, Senator \nMurray, we passed a budget earlier this year. Not only did the Senate \nbudget responsibly reduce the deficit, not only did it fairly replace \nthe sequester, but it actually invested in economic growth. We took it \nup here on the Senate floor and passed it here, too, so not just out of \ncommittee but out of the Senate. We stayed up all night voting on \namendment after amendment, for hour after hour, and in the end it is \none of the most functional things we have done this year. The Senate \npasses a budget, the House passes a budget, and then we come together \nto reconcile the differences. That is how it has been done for 200 \nyears. And this year, finally, after years of criticism that we hadn't \npassed a budget, we had our chance to return to regular order, so there \nwe are, ready to go, budget passed--and nothing. House Republicans will \nnot even come to the table and a few Senate Republicans are blocking \nthe door. They literally will not even come to the table to negotiate \nand resolve our budget differences and lay the groundwork for moving \nforward. It is insanely frustrating.\n  Einstein once said the definition of insanity was doing the same \nthing over and over and expecting a different result. He was not wrong. \nI believe at this point the House has repealed the Affordable Care Act \n42 times. Doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different \nresult is the definition of insanity.\n  I am on the Appropriations Committee and, under the able leadership \nof our Chair Senator Mikulski the committee has passed 11 \nappropriations bills. The House Appropriations Committee has passed 10 \nof theirs. We took up one of these vital appropriations bills that \nallows the Senate to work its will and to form and shape Federal \nprograms and Federal spending. Earlier this summer we took up one of \nthese appropriations bills, the bill to fund the Departments of \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development. But Republicans on this \nfloor were so afraid of returning to regular order, of having a \nresponsible, reasonable, regular working process to move forward on \nspending on this government and our economy, it was blocked. It was \nblocked, prevented from even being debated.\n  I will ask again: Is this working for anybody?\n  Back in June of this year the Senate passed a bipartisan farm bill. \nGreat work was done by Senator Stabenow, Chair of the Agriculture \nCommittee, along with her ranking member and Senators from both side of \nthe aisle. The Agriculture Committee did significant work to reform \nAmerican farm policy, such as moving away from commodity subsidies and \ntoward crop insurance. That alone would have saved\n\n[[Page S6872]]\n\ntaxpayers $23 billion. We all hear that is important. We need to reduce \nour spending and make our programs more effective. This was a great \nbipartisan bill. It would have modernized our agricultural policies and \nstrengthened programs that help farmers, ranchers, and small business \nowners, and created jobs.\n  House Republicans will not negotiate with us on that bill either. \nThey passed a bill that guts the nutrition assistance program, food \nstamps--cuts it by $40 billion, but will not work with us on a full \nfarm bill. The current law also expires at the end of the month. If we \ndo not pass a modernizing farm bill by the end of this year, our \nNation's agriculture policies will revert to those of the 1940s.\n  If it sounds familiar, it is because we are in the exact same \nposition on the farm bill as last year. Is this working for anybody? It \nis certainly not working for America.\n  Delawareans, whom I hear all the time, are enormously frustrated. I \nhope we are able to reach a deal and I hope we are able to keep the \ngovernment running. I hope we come back next week and refocus on our \neconomy and refocus all this energy on manufacturing and jobs and on \nmanufacturing jobs, not on manufacturing crises; helping American \nbusinesses grow and helping our private sector create jobs.\n  Americans deserve better than this. They deserve better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, just 6 days \nnow before the Obama health care law exchanges go into effect, to point \nout that even those who may support the law say with regard to the \nexchanges, expect trouble. It was interesting that today the District \nof Columbia--their health exchange announced it is not going to be able \nto be ready to go October 1 for those seeking information regarding tax \ncredits, for those asking about Medicaid coverage. People will still be \nable to submit applications online but apparently they need to then \nhave this information go to so-called experts with an eligibility \ndetermination not to be made until sometime in November.\n  I applaud the District for pointing this out, that this is what they \nfound because what they attributed the delay to was a ``high error \nrate'' discovered during testing. I am delighted that they were \nactually doing testing, discovered this high error rate and made that \ndecision. But as people take a look at the upcoming exchanges as they \nopen, I believe these exchanges open doors to fraud and to identity \ntheft. The reason I say this is we are hearing this actually reported \nfrom supporters, again, of the health care law.\n  I will quote someone who has worked in support of the law in Chicago \nwho says that, ``Fraudsters are poised to take advantage of widespread \nconfusion over the Affordable Care Act--also known as ObamaCare--to \ntake advantage of widespread confusion to steal Americans' credit \ncards, Social Security numbers, and other personal information.''\n  My goodness, how can that happen? It happens for a number of reasons. \nOne is because of all of these so-called navigators, people who are \nhired by the government or people posing as those hired by the \ngovernment to help folks sign up on the exchange. When they fill out \nthe paperwork or fill out the computer forms, the information they are \ngoing to send in is to go to the data hub--tax information, income \ninformation, employment information, patient record information, Social \nSecurity number, welfare information, family size, demographic data--\nand then where does all this information go?\n  No. 1, to the Department of Justice. Also to the Social Security \nAdministration. Also the Department of Homeland Security to check \ncitizenship. Of course the Social Security Administration will validate \nbirth, validate the person is not dead, validate the Social Security \nnumber. The Department of Justice will check on criminal history. The \nHealth and Human Services Department, another recipient of the \ninformation, will check enrollment or eligibility for entitlement \nprograms, collects and analyzes medical data. Then of course the IRS, \nwho are the folks who are the enforcers of the Obama health care law--\nthe enforcers will, along with the Treasury Department, verify \nemployment stats, individual income stats, determine premium subsidies, \nall with the potential for significant fraud and all because of a lack \nof providing the privacy safeguards that the law mandates this \nadministration to provide. Yet the administration is not doing so. A \nnumber of us have been asking for months to see what is involved with \nthese so-called navigators. What kind of education do they need? What \nkind of background checks are there? We still have not been able to get \nthe information we are seeking.\n\n  We want to know: Do these people have to have a driver's license? Do \nthey have to be of a certain age? Do they have to have a high school \ndiploma? Do they have to have a criminal background check? Yet this \nadministration will not give out that information about those \nindividuals. Even the census takers have to have completed a certain \nlevel of education and have a criminal background check.\n  Yet this administration is not asking of those who were supposed to \nbe the navigators handed very confidential information, of course, \nsubject to fraud and identity theft when you give that sort of \ninformation--and I say to people all around the country it is time to \nbeware next Tuesday when the exchange is open.\n  I just quoted a couple of things that supporters of the health care \nlaw have said, such as expect trouble and worry about con artists. Here \nare some other things that some of the supporters have said--people who \nsupported the adoption of this law in the first place. They said: It \nwill destroy the foundation of the 40-hour workweek that is the \nbackbone of the American middle class. These, of course, are union \nfolks who are saying: Hey, this is going to end up forcing millions out \nof their multi-employer plans. It will create unstoppable incentives \nfor employers to reduce weekly hours for workers. We see that all \nacross the country.\n  Just last week the Cleveland Clinic--a wonderful health care \ninstitution and one of the major employers in the State of Ohio--\nannounced that because of the health care law and because of the cuts \nin reimbursement, the Cleveland Clinic is going to cut hundreds of \nmillions of dollars from their budget and actually reduce their \nworkforce because of the President's health care law and the things \nthey are learning about the law as time goes on.\n  It is interesting to see a union leader say: In its rush to achieve \nits passage, many of the act's provisions were not fully conceived. \nPeople on this side of the aisle were telling Members of this body that \nvery thing a number of years ago before the law was passed in this body \non a sole party-line basis.\n  Yesterday, President Obama, once again, tried to bring in help, and \nhe provided essentially the warmup act for an infomercial with \nPresident Bill Clinton, the so-called secretary of explaining stuff, \nbecause the President has failed to explain benefits of the health care \nlaw to the point that it would actually convince the American people it \nwas good for them. Currently, the President is under water in the polls \nregarding his leadership on health care, and this health care law \ncontinues to be very unpopular with the American people.\n  More people think their costs will go up and their benefits will go \ndown than the other way around. So they are looking at their own \nquality of care and what it means to them: paying more, getting less, \nsomething that the American people don't want.\n  So in an effort to try to provide some solace to the American people, \nthis is what the President said yesterday in New York: Make your own \ndecision about whether it is good for you. What we are confident about \nis when people look and see they can get high-quality affordable health \ncare for less than their cell phone bill, they are going to sign up.\n  I would say if you use that criteria, you are going to have very few \npeople signing up for your health care law.\n  According to the 2012 report issued by the Cellular \nTelecommunications Industry, the average monthly cell phone bill was \nabout $47. So make your own decision--less than your cell phone bill. \nSo what the President is saying is that for less than $47 a month, \npeople will be able to receive insurance.\n\n[[Page S6873]]\n\n  The interesting thing is that, of course, the President says that is \nwith the subsidies. But for many people the subsidies are not in any \nway going to reduce the cost of their insurance at all, and it may not \ngo up as high as many people had feared, but it is still going to be \nhigher than they are paying now because of the sticker shock that is \ncoming.\n  This is today's Wall Street Journal. This is coming out of the \nadministration:\n\n       Prices Set For New Health-Care Exchanges.\n       Across the country, the average premium for a 27-year-old \n     nonsmoker, regardless of gender, will start at $163 a month \n     for the lowest-cost ``bronze'' plan.\n\n  That is just about four times the average of a monthly cell phone \nbill. So could the President of the United States be mistaken?\n  Let's look around the country. They say:\n\n       Likewise, the least-expensive bronze policy would rise to \n     $195 a month in Philadelphia for that same 27-year-old, from \n     $73 today.\n\n  So it would go from $73 up to $195.\n  Let's look at my home State of Wyoming. I am still reading from the \nfront page of today's Wall Street Journal.\n\n       In Cheyenne, Wyo., the lowest-cost option would be $271 a \n     month, up from $82 today.\n\n  This just goes to prove that when Washington comes up with something, \nit does not one-size-fits-all across this country, and in rural States \naround the country there are huge problems related to the very fact \nthat one size doesn't fit all.\n  In spite of the President's comparison to a cell phone bill, what we \nare seeing is that people all across the country are going to be paying \nexcessive amounts of money for insurance in spite of the President's \npromises that if you like what you have, you can keep it. We know that \nis not the case for many people, as the unions have spoken of, and we \nknow that what the President promised of lowering insurance premiums by \n$2,500 per family by the end of his first term never materialized and \nthe costs continue to go up.\n  So this health care law has turned out to be terrible for patients, \nthe providers, the nurses, and doctors who take care of them, and it is \ngoing to be terrible for taxpayers.\n  There was an interesting story on the front page of the New York \nTimes on Monday: ``Lower Premiums to Come at Cost of Fewer Choices.'' \nIn new plans, insurers often leave out many providers. I think that is \nthe key: leave out many providers. Because what we are seeing is that \nin many locations around the country, hospitals have been excluded, \ndoctors have been excluded, and there is going to be significant \nexplaining to be done when people realize that they are not going to be \nable to continue to go to the pediatrician that their children have \nbeen going to since birth. They are not going to be able to go to the \nhospital in their community. They are not going to be able to keep the \nhealth care plan they have.\n  So it is interesting to see in a Blue Cross/Blue Shield in New \nHampshire, one of the Nation's largest insurers has put a plan together \nthat is consistent with the health care law, and it has created a \nfuror. The reason it has created this furor is that it excludes 10 of \nthe State's 26 hospitals from the health plans it is going to sell \nthrough the insurance exchange.\n  The insurance exchange, regardless of what the President promises, is \ngoing to be something which potentially causes fraud, abuse, and loss \nof the care that you have, the doctor that you have, and the hospital \nthat you have.\n\n  The article points specifically to the State of California. In \nCalifornia, it says the statewide Blue Shield developed a network \nspecifically for consumer shopping in the insurance exchange.\n  The executive vice president of Blue Shield of California said the \nnetwork for its exchange plans had 30,000 doctors or 53 percent of the \ndoctors in the State. So they only include about half the doctors, not \nall the doctors, and they said the new network you get through the \nexchange in California--remember this is a State-run exchange that the \nPresident has touted as a successful exchange--``did not include the \nfive medical centers of the University of California or the Cedars-\nSinai Medical Center near Beverly Hills'' that are all well known for \ntheir excellent reputation. It is a place that patients want to go for \ncare.\n  So go to the exchange in California, sign up for something the \nPresident has promised you, and then if you need to use that insurance \ncard, you will learn that you are not welcomed and your card is not \naccepted at the five medical centers at the University of California or \nthe Cedars-Sinai Medical Center near Beverly Hills.\n  That is what we have under this health care law, and that is why we \nneed to repeal it and replace it with patient-centered care so patients \ncan get the care they need from a doctor they choose at a lower cost.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I listened to colleagues predicting doom \nand gloom, and it brings back what I have read about what happened when \nMedicare was brought to this country by the Democrats and what happened \nwhen Social Security was brought to this body and to the House after \nthe Great Depression.\n  I am going to go into that in a little bit, but somebody said this \nearlier and it reminded me that one of the definitions of insanity is \ndoing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome.\n  The Republicans in the House have voted 42 times to repeal the \nAffordable Care Act or to defund it. Health care reform has taken years \nand years to do, and we finally got it done. Millions of Americans are \non the cusp of getting health insurance for the first time.\n  Republicans are desperately trying to block this from happening. \nSenator Reid couldn't be more clear: We are not going to delay health \ncare for the people of this great Nation. We are not going to go back \nto the days when people with a preexisting condition were left to die \nwithout health care. We are not going back there. Yet it continues.\n  The Republicans are so adamant about it that a very large group of \nthem are threatening to shut down the government of this great country. \nAgain, it is not like they didn't do this before. The Republicans did \nthis before. It was a disaster for the people. People got hurt. They \ndidn't get paid. Business was disrupted, Social Security and Medicare \nwere disrupted, veterans' benefits were disrupted, and parks were shut \ndown. People were hurt as a result of that, and it cost a fortune for \nthe taxpayers. But somehow Republicans feel they can play games, and I \nthink it is a shame.\n  My colleague Senator Cruz spoke for a very long time and said he \nwould speak until he dropped. He said that over and over: I will speak \nuntil I drop. If he were to drop and suffered some kind of health \nepisode, which he apparently was willing to risk, he would have had \nhealth care because he is insured. If he had to be lifted off the floor \nof the Senate and driven to a nearby hospital, Senator Cruz would have \nhad great health care. Why does he want to stop that for millions and \nmillions of hard-working Americans? Only he can answer that.\n  I could only say that as I listened to some of his interviews, it \nsounds like what he is feeling in his heart is if this goes into \neffect, the people might like it and then woe is us. Because there is \nan ideological split here in the Senate where we have Senators and \nHouse Members who don't think there is any role for the Federal \nGovernment to play in making people's lives better. Some say military \nspending, fine; highway spending, fine. But when it comes to lifting \npeople up and giving them a quality of life and helping to do that, oh, \nno.\n\n  So Senator Ted Cruz is fortunate. If he talked until he dropped on \nthe floor, he would have had the best health care, he would have been \non his feet and super fine. There are a lot of people out there who are \ndropping because they put off going to the doctor because they have a \ncondition and they have no insurance, and when they drop they have to \ngo to an emergency room where they can be patched up--and by the way, \ntaxpayers pay for that.\n  So here is the thing. We have the Affordable Care Act, which \nRepublicans call ObamaCare, so that is fine--ObamaCare, Affordable Care \nAct, whatever we want to call it. It is based on a Republican-suggested \nmodel of\n\n[[Page S6874]]\n\nhealth care where we use private insurance, we go to an exchange, and \nthere is a lot of competition. I am excited about it, frankly, because \nin my home State of California, we are on board: coveredca.com. People \ntype in coveredca.com, and they find out how they can get health care. \nSome people will apply and get a Medicaid card, the working poor. The \nmiddle class will be able to move forward and go to the exchanges, and \nmany will get a subsidy to help them if they are in the middle class.\n  Here is the thing that really shocks me. Republicans act as if this \nhealth care bill, this Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, just came down \noff the ceiling and dropped on the floor and became law. It took a long \ntime. Senator Baucus worked and worked and worked. We took many \nRepublican amendments. We passed the bill. It became the law of the \nland 3 years ago.\n  They took it to the Supreme Court and said it was unconstitutional. \nThe Supreme Court said it was constitutional. And now that it is about \nto go into play, Republicans are willing to shut the government down to \nstop it.\n  It was the centerpiece of the 2012 election. We all know that.\n  Mitt Romney said: If I am President, I am getting rid of that law.\n  The people of the country said: OK. What are you going to put in its \nplace?\n  Well, let's see. We will allow insurance to go across State lines.\n  Well, what does that do for me if I have a preexisting condition?\n  They wanted to replace it with nothing. The American people are \nsmart. It doesn't mean this law is perfect and we can't make it better, \nbut let me tell my colleagues, many of us served under many Presidents. \nI am looking at my colleague from Maryland who served a long time in \nthe House. I served with five Presidents, a couple of whom I didn't \nagree with, and I did everything I could to fight against the \nlegislation they liked that I felt was bad. But once it passed, I \ndidn't try to shut down the government. I tried to work with everybody, \nand I am not an exception. That is what we used to do around here, all \nof us. Suddenly, it is: My way or the highway. I am taking my Teddy \nbear, my blankie, and I am going home because I don't like the health \nreform act. It doesn't suit me.\n  Some of them are so angry about it, they are trying to take away the \nemployer contribution from their own staff. What an outrage--hard-\nworking people who love their country, who work here.\n  Now, let me tell my colleagues, Earth to the Republicans: A, you lost \nthe election not only for President but in the Senate, where colleagues \nwho supported the Affordable Care Act got elected; B, President Obama \nwas reelected, Mitt Romney lost. Health care reform was a major issue \non the campaign trail. So wake up, smell the roses, put a smile on your \nface, and know you tried, but don't shut down the government. Enough \nalready.\n  I wish to spend some time showing my colleagues how the Affordable \nCare Act is already working, so I have some charts to go over quickly.\n  In my State over 1 million Californians are already newly insured. \nThis includes in my State 400,000 young adults who are now on their \nparents' policies. If the Republicans have their way and they defund or \nrepeal ObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act, what is going to happen to \nthose young adults? They will be kicked off of their parents' policies. \nIs this why Senator Cruz stood on the floor for hours and hours until \nhe would drop--to hurt young adults, 3 million of them nationwide?\n  Seventy-one million Americans are getting free preventive care, such \nas checkups and birth control and immunizations. I don't know how many \nof us heard Senator King from Maine today talk about his own experience \nwhen he worked here as a young man and had insurance, so he got a \npreventive care checkup, which came with his insurance. They found a \nmelanoma. Had he not gone to the doctor and had they not seen that mole \nthat turned cancerous, he said he would not be here anymore. Health \ninsurance saved his life.\n  So I wish to rhetorically ask Senator Cruz and the Republicans \nsupporting him in this body and in the House, why would you take away \nfree preventive care and immunizations from 71 million Americans and \nconsign them to a status where they are absolutely sitting there \nwithout any protection because they have no health insurance?\n  Let's see what else we have already achieved that the Republicans \nwant to repeal. They want to repeal 17 million kids with preexisting \nconditions, such as asthma and diabetes, who can now no longer be \ndenied coverage. If my colleagues ever saw those pictures of a child \ngasping for air, my colleagues know those kids need coverage, they need \nhelp, and they need to be able to get that help and get the medication \nwhen they need it.\n  Insurers can't cancel health insurance because someone gets sick. How \nmany stories did we hear as Congresspeople and as Senators where people \nwent to get insurance and they said: Sorry, 25 years ago you had a \nsuspicious mole, and therefore we are not going to insure you--or you \nhave high blood pressure or 10 years ago you had cancer. No more. And \nhow many times have you heard the stories where people were kicked out \nof their insurance because they hit a lifetime cap? That is no more. \nRepublicans want to repeal all these benefits, and Senator Cruz was \nwilling to talk until he dropped so these benefits could be taken away \nfrom our constituents.\n  I heard my friend from Wyoming, Senator Barrasso, say that health \ncosts are rising and they are rising like never before. I guess he \nmissed it when President Clinton told the country that health care \ncosts are growing at the slowest rate in over 50 years--50 years. And \nthat is because more people are getting covered and we don't have to \ntreat people at the end game or in an emergency room because we are \nalready seeing people get more health coverage. Insurance companies now \nhave to justify a premium hike. Before, they could double premiums, but \nnow they have to justify it and make sure 80 percent of the premiums \nthey get are spent on the policyholders.\n  So in 2014--and we are around the corner from that--unless Senator \nCruz and his Republican friends have their way, there will be no more \nextra charges for preexisting conditions. Right now it is just children \nwho have that benefit, but in 2014 everybody gets it.\n  In 2014, no longer can insurance companies charge women more than men \nfor their coverage. This is a huge issue. There was gender \ndiscrimination. Being a woman was considered a preexisting condition. A \nwoman who was abused by her spouse or by her boyfriend, and she walked \nin and the insurance company found out, that was considered a \npreexisting condition because she might get beat up again. So she was \ntold: Take a hike. That can't happen anymore.\n  They cannot impose dollar limits on the amount of health care spent \non you in a single year. Right now, if you have a serious illness, they \ncan say: Sorry, you reached your annual cap.\n  So where are we now? ObamaCare, or the Affordable Care Act, is \nalready in effect. Republicans want to stop it because in 2014, when \nthose exchanges open, they know people are going to like what they see. \nI am telling my colleagues, when I go home and I go to community health \ncare centers, people are so excited. And not enough of them know about \nit, but when they find out how easy it is--if they qualify for \nMedicaid, they just get their card and they are covered, and they no \nlonger have to sneak into the emergency room when a problem gets so \ndrastic. And all the others will have options. They will be able to \nchoose from a platinum plan, a silver plan, or a bronze plan. We are \nvery excited about this law.\n  Senator Cruz says he will stand on his feet until he drops to stop my \npeople and your people from getting health insurance? He has met his \nmatch in us because we can stand until we drop. But we don't have to do \nthat because we have the votes, and the reason we have the votes is \nthis is what the last election was about.\n  In closing my presentation, I wish to share with my colleagues a very \nbrief history of what happened when Social Security was proposed. It is \nso interesting.\n  In 1935, after the Great Depression and our great-grandparents were \nlying in the street and had nothing and people were jumping out of \nwindows because they had nothing--they had lost their homes, they had \nlost their jobs, they had lost their savings, and there\n\n[[Page S6875]]\n\nwas no safety net. This is what President Franklin D. Roosevelt said \nwhen he signed the act in 1935:\n\n       We can never insure one-hundred percent of the population \n     against one-hundred percent of the hazards and the \n     vicissitudes of life. But we have tried to frame a law which \n     will give some measure of protection to the average citizen \n     and to his family against the loss of a job and against \n     poverty-ridden old age. This law represents a cornerstone in \n     a structure which is being built, but it is by no means \n     complete.\n\n  Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke about the safety net in 1935. Just think \nabout that.\n  Let's see what happened in the debate. Let's look at what happened in \nthe debate.\n  Representative William Ditter, a Republican from Pennsylvania, took \nto the floor and said:\n\n       . . . security for the individual, whether worker or aged, \n     will be a mockery and a sham if in the attainment thereof we \n     . . . allot to our people the role of puppets of a \n     socialistic state . . .\n\n  Where have we heard that before? He called Social Security part of a \nsocialistic state.\n\n       We cannot provide a sense of security by programs for the \n     destruction of wealth. . . . We cannot assure to the people a \n     sense of security by measures threatening their investments \n     of life savings.\n\n  Could this guy have been more wrong? He calls Social Security \nsocialism and said it was going to destroy wealth when, in fact, it \npreserved our people in their old age.\n  Now, here is another--Representative Jenkins of Ohio, a Republican. \nHe talks about Social Security this way:\n\n       This is compulsion of the rankest kind. Do not be misled by \n     the title. The title says ``Old-Age Benefits''. Shame on you \n     for putting such a misleading and unfair title on such a \n     nefarious bill. Old-age benefits? Think of it! Oh, what a \n     travesty!. . . . Mr. Chairman, what is the hurry? Nobody is \n     going to get a dime out of this until 1942. . . . what is the \n     hurry about crowding an unconstitutional proposition like \n     this through the House today?\n\n  Honestly--honestly--this is what we hear them say about affordable \nhealth care: Socialism, unconstitutional. It is a sham. We have plenty \nof time. We should delay it.\n  History is repeating itself right in front of our eyes.\n  Now it did not stop then.\n  In 2005, Republicans continued to attack Social Security. President \nGeorge W. Bush and Congressman Paul Ryan wanted to do away with Social \nSecurity as we know it. We all remember that. They proposed abolishing \nSocial Security and replacing it with private accounts in the stock \nmarket. We all know how safe that is. I am a former stockbroker. You do \nnot buy stocks when you are ready to retire. That is their plan. Had \nthis become law, seniors retiring in 2008 would have lost up to \n$26,000. But we stopped them and we did not allow it to happen.\n  Lastly, let's look at Social Security's success.\n  Before Social Security became the law in 1935, half of America's \nseniors lived in poverty in the midst of the Great Depression--half. \nToday, 57 million Americans receive Social Security, and it lifts 14 \nmillion elderly Americans out of poverty. It is the most successful and \nthe most popular antipoverty program.\n  The Republicans said it was unconstitutional. They said it was \nsocialism. They said it was a sham, a disaster. They are back here \nsaying the same thing, just as we are on the cusp of delivering a \nbenefit to so many--probably 50 million Americans.\n  This is my last discussion about Medicare.\n  When President Lyndon Johnson signed the Medicare Act, he said:\n\n       No longer will older Americans be denied the healing \n     miracle of modern medicine. No longer will illness crush and \n     destroy the savings that they have so carefully put away over \n     a lifetime so that they might enjoy dignity in their later \n     years. No longer will young families see their own incomes, \n     and their own hopes, eaten away simply because they are \n     carrying out their deep moral obligations to their parents, \n     and to their uncles, and their aunts.\n\n  This was President Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s. Some of us actually \nwere around in the 1960s. We remember it. And this is what the \nRepublicans said about Medicare. Listen carefully. This is a history \nmoment here. We are looking at what the Republicans said every time we \nwere about to get a new benefit for the people of this Nation.\n  Sixty percent of Republicans in the Senate and 50 percent of House \nRepublicans voted against Medicare. Representative Durward Hall of \nMissouri, a Republican, said:\n\n       . . . we cannot stand idly by now, as the Nation is urged \n     to embark on an ill-conceived adventure in government \n     medicine, the end of which no one can see, and from which the \n     patient is certain to be the ultimate sufferer.\n\n  This is what the Republicans said. And Senator Milward Simpson of \nWyoming, a Republican, said:\n\n       I am disturbed about the effect this legislation would have \n     upon our economy and upon our private insurance system. . . .\n\n  Well, of course, what we found out is this turns out to be one of the \nmost successful programs.\n  Medicare is a success. Before Medicare became law, a majority of \nseniors had no health insurance. Today, nearly all seniors are \nreceiving guaranteed health care benefits. Mr. President, 8 out of 10 \nseniors age 65 and older feel the program is working. With few \nexceptions throughout history, Medicare has been more successful than \nprivate insurers at holding down costs. And we still have to fight for \nMedicare. We still have to fight.\n  In 1995, Dick Armey, the Republican House majority leader, said, \nMedicare is ``a program I would have no part of in a free world.'' A \nbit of an overstatement--Dick Armey.\n  That same year, after leading an effort to raise premiums and costs \nfor seniors, Newt Gingrich predicted that Medicare was ``going to \nwither on the vine.''\n  Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole bragged in 1996, ``I was there, \nfighting the fight, voting against Medicare. . . . because we knew it \nwouldn't work in 1965.''\n  And Paul Ryan's budget ends Medicare as we know it today.\n  So all this brings us to the moment we are in. Now Republicans are \ntrying to defund the new health reform law. Speaker John Boehner said: \nPassage of health reform is ``Armageddon'' because the law will ``ruin \nour country.''\n  They said it about Social Security, they said it about Medicare, and \nnow they are saying it about the Affordable Care Act.\n  The Republican Party Platform, in 2012, said:\n\n       [ObamaCare] was the high-water mark of an outdated \n     liberalism, the latest attempt to impose upon Americans a \n     euro-style bureaucracy to manage all aspects of their lives.\n\n  So I felt it was important to put into the Record the historical \ncontext of the battle we face today. I try to tell my kids and my \ngrandkids, when we fight these battles, we sometimes forget the \ncontext, that it is not that much different than what went before us. \nWe look different certainly. The women here were not around here then. \nBut the fact of the matter is, they are the same battles. It is about \nwhat is the role of the national government of the greatest country in \nthe world. I certainly, for one, believe making life better for our \npeople and doing it in a smart way, in a fiscally responsible way, is \nthe way to go.\n  We will have to make our changes to the Affordable Care Act if we see \nwe can make it better. And we invite our Republican friends to work \nwith us. I was one who did not vote for the drug benefit because I did \nnot like that big, fat doughnut hole that came in there, which put \npeople on the spot. They had to stop taking their medicine. They could \nnot recover money. But we worked with our friends, and we ended that. \nAnd, by the way, we did it in this bill, the Affordable Care Act.\n  So, yes. Working together, yes. But standing up until we drop in \norder to stop important benefits from going to America's families? That \nis wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first let me thank Senator Boxer for \nputting into the Record the history of how we fought for Medicare, how \nwe went through a lot of the health care fights, and what we have stood \nfor in protecting the American public for affordable, quality health \ncare. I applaud her and agree with the comments she has made.\n  I think it is very interesting to point out the contrast to the \npassage of the Affordable Care Act that has been law now since March \n23, 2010. It went through hearing after days of hearings in the House \nand in the Senate. It went through days of markups in the committee, \nwhere hundreds of amendments\n\n[[Page S6876]]\n\nwere offered in both the House and the Senate. We had a long debate on \nthe floor of the Senate and the floor of the House. We reconciled the \ndifferences between the two Houses. It went through the regular \nprocess. We spent as much time on that bill, I think, as we have spent \non any major bill. And yet there were differences. The bill was passed \nand signed into law.\n  When we expanded Medicare--and I was in the House at the time on \nMedicare Part D. I also voted against it. Most Democrats voted against \nit. We voted against it for the reason the Senator just said--the \ncoverage gap, the doughnut hole, that we knew seniors would still not \nbe able to afford coverage. There was no public option, as the Senator \nremembers.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right.\n  Mr. CARDIN. It was all private insurance. They did not pool the total \npurchasing power to reduce the cost of prescription drugs--another \nmatter that we felt very strongly that we were overpaying. And we are \noverpaying for prescription drugs, as a result of that change.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. CARDIN. By the way, it was not paid for. It was estimated to cost \n$400 billion, and there was no offset of cost. So we were worried it \nwould have an impact on the affordability of the Federal Government to \npay the bill. So we all voted against it. Many of us did.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is right.\n  Mr. CARDIN. And it became law.\n  Senator Boxer is absolutely right: When that bill passed, we came \ntogether and said: Let's make it better. We lost the battle on the \nfloor. It became the law. Let's try to make it work. And we did that, \nDemocrats and Republicans.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is right.\n  Mr. CARDIN. We are now into 3 years under the Affordable Care Act, \nand all we get from the Republicans is repeal after repeal after \nrepeal--no effort to deal with legitimate problems of implementation \nthat we would like to work together to do.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right.\n  Mr. CARDIN. What a difference. Instead, they are using the process of \nholding hostage the Federal Government from being in operation in order \nto advance their extreme agenda.\n  It has been nearly 20 years ago when the Government shut down because \nthe Republicans decided it would be better to close government to prove \ntheir point. Well, they were wrong then. We recognized the cost of a \ngovernment shutdown and the inconvenience to the American people and \nthe damage to our economy. Yet Monday night we run the risk of another \ngovernment shutdown because the Republicans are holding hostage the \ncontinuation of government to try to move forward their extreme agenda.\n  Let me talk a little bit about this. Let me talk about what it would \nmean if we were, in fact, to pass the continuing resolution that was \npassed by the House. We are not going to do that. We are not going to \npass that. Everybody knows we are not going to pass that. But I think \nthe American people need know what would happen if that did pass and we \ndid defund the Affordable Care Act.\n  I could talk a lot about provisions that have already taken effect. I \ncould talk about the fact that in my State of Maryland, 46,000 families \nhave taken advantage of putting their children on their health \ninsurance policies to age 26. If you repeal the Affordable Care Act, \nthose 46,000 families will have to find another way to take care of the \nhealth insurance for their children.\n  I could talk about the fact that come January, we will eliminate \nlifetime caps on health insurance. How many families have had to go \nthrough bankruptcy because they cannot afford health coverage? They may \nhave insurance, but their caps put them into bankruptcy. Well, that is \ngone. If you repeal the Affordable Care Act, we are back to the \narbitrary limits.\n  How many families have told us about preexisting condition \nrestrictions that are in their health insurance policies? We have \nalready corrected that for children. That is already the law. Come \nJanuary, there will be no further preexisting conditions. Women will \nnot be discriminated against in health premiums. Pregnancies will no \nlonger be considered a preexisting condition. Being a victim of \ndomestic violence will no longer be considered a preexisting condition.\n  I could cite, and I am sure the Presiding Officer could too, examples \nin our own States where people have not been able to get full coverage. \nI have a family in Montgomery County that had to take out two insurance \npolicies and pay two separate premiums for the family because of \npreexisting condition restrictions. That is history. If you pass the \nresolution that came over from the House, that is all gone, we are back \nto how it used to be.\n  I know we talk a lot about affordability. I want to talk a moment \nabout that. Because before we passed the Affordable Care Act, we got \nletter after letter from individuals and businesses about their \npremiums going up. They had to cut back coverage, and they required the \nemployee to pay more. The benefits were less, and the premiums were \nhigher. We were seeing double-digit cost increases in health care.\n  Well, now we have a quality product, a guarantee that essential \nbenefits are going to be in there. We have protection that at least 80 \nto 85 percent of the premium dollar must actually go to benefits. If it \ndoes not go to benefits, you get a rebate, you get a refund. In my \nState of Maryland, 44,000 Marylanders are getting rebates because their \npremiums were too high. The average rebate is $143 a family--$13 \nmillion in rebates.\n  With the House-passed continuing resolution, that is gone. Those \nprotections are no longer in the law. We are back to how it used to be: \nno guaranteed coverage, no guaranteed benefits, no guaranteed value.\n  There is another aspect to this, one that I am very proud of. The \nUnited States will at last join the industrialized nations in the world \nand say that we are going to make affordable health care available to \nevery person, every American in our country. I think that is an \nimportant point. I have 800,000 people in my State of Maryland who do \nnot have health coverage today--800,000.\n  Now, come October 1, next Tuesday, they are going to be able to go to \nthe Maryland Health Connection and get health coverage. But guess what. \nThey are going to have a variety of plans they can choose from. They \ncan make their decision. But a large number, over 85 percent--87 \npercent--of the people who will be going to the Maryland Health \nConnection, it has been estimated, are going to be entitled for help in \npaying for those premiums--87 percent.\n  We talked about the individual mandates. What we provided was an \naffordable option so everyone can be in the system. We want universal \ncoverage because we think it is the right policy. Everybody should be \ncovered. We want universal coverage because we think it is wrong for \nsomeone who has health insurance to pay for someone who does not have \nhealth insurance because they use the health facility and do not pay \nfor it, and we pay more as a result of that. Hospital costs are more, \nphysician costs are more. We think everybody should pay their fair \nshare.\n  But we make it affordable. Eighty-seven percent will be entitled to \nhelp. Those who go through the Maryland Health Connection and are \nenrolled in Medicaid obviously are going to get their help. We have \nexpanded that coverage. Those who go into the exchanges--and Maryland \nis one of those States that the State will be operating the exchanges.\n  The overwhelming majority will be entitled to some help in the \npayment of those premiums. If the House-passed resolution were to \nbecome law, and it is not going to become law--the purpose for sending \nit over here was to make it hostage in the closing of our government. \nIf it became law, that help would be gone. These uninsured have no \nprospect of getting health coverage, and the inefficiencies of our \nsystem continue, the use of emergency rooms, the lack of preventive \ncare continues.\n  The Senator from California Mrs. Boxer talked about the Medicare \nsystem. Let me take a moment about the Medicare system, because this is \nvery important. The so-called doughnut hole, that prescription drug gap \nof coverage, is being closed as a result of the passage of the \nAffordable Care Act. How many seniors fell into that doughnut hole and \nliterally could not afford their prescription drugs? We closed that in \nthe Affordable Care Act. In my State of Maryland, 50,000 seniors \nbenefited from that--50,000 seniors. If we\n\n[[Page S6877]]\n\npass the bill that came over from the House, those 50,000 seniors would \nbe calling our office every day finding out what happened to that \ncoverage they lost. You better believe our phones would be ringing \nabout why are we taking away their benefits.\n  It is even more who are benefiting from the preventive health care \nservices. They do not have to pay copayments. About half a million \nMarylanders are eligible for that benefit--who are taking advantage, 34 \nmillion nationwide. They would lose that preventive health care service \nthat they have today as a result of the passage of Affordable Care Act. \nThat is gone if the House-passed resolution were to become law.\n  Probably even more serious than that, and Senator Boxer alluded to \nit, the passage of the Affordable Care Act improved the solvency of the \nMedicare system for a decade. You repeal the Affordable Care Act, you \nare back with whether Medicare itself will be a solvent program.\n  I could go on and on. We have provisions in the Affordable Care Act \nthat are working to prevent fraud within the Medicare system, saving \ntaxpayers dollars. That is gone. We help to make sure that the Medicare \nAdvantage plans are properly paid. That is gone. All of that is \nrepealed if the House resolution were passed, which it will not be. I \nwill make it clear. It was sent over to us with a strategy to put the \ngovernment operations in jeopardy. There are many on the other side who \nbelieve it is a good idea to close the government. That is their \nobjective. Even the Republicans admitted this strategy would not work \nto actually defund the Affordable Care Act.\n  I think we should at least talk about what impact it would have. I \nhear my colleagues talk frequently about small business. I have had a \nlot of forums with small businesses in Maryland. I must tell you, yes, \nsmall businesses are concerned about whether they can afford the cost \nof their employees and health benefits. They are concerned about it. \nThat is a legitimate issue. But let's talk about what are the \ncircumstances without the passage of the Affordable Care Act. Well, \nthey are on their own. They do not have large markets. They have to pay \nmore than large companies have to pay. They do not have a lot of \noptions.\n  Under the exchanges, under Maryland Health Connection, they will get \ndifferent opportunities that they did not have before, more affordable \ncoverage that they did not have before. There are credits available to \nhelp them pay for their health insurance. If you have less than 50 \nemployees, there is not a single new mandate in this law for a small \nbusiness. So this is good news for small companies. That is gone if the \nresolution that passed the House were to become law. It is not going to \nbecome law. My Republican colleagues know it is not going to become \nlaw.\n  I think it is important to point that out. What happens if we do not \nget to an agreement by Monday night? That is possible. That is \npossible. We are going to send back a continuing resolution to the \nHouse. We do not know whether they are going to accept it. What \nhappens? Well, I can tell you this. I represent the State of Maryland. \nI represent a lot of Federal workers. I tell you something, they have \nbeen through furloughs, they have been through pay freezes, they have \nbeen put to the test. They have been asked to do a lot more work with \nless workers. We have less per capita workers than we have had in \nmodern times on a per capita basis of Federal workers. They have been \nasked to do more with less. They have already contributed greatly to \nreducing the deficit.\n  Once again, come Tuesday morning, they are going to be asked in some \ncases to show up for work not knowing whether they will get paid, in \nother cases, to stay home not getting paid, trying to figure out again \nhow they are going to pay their bills. They have rent payments and \nmortgage payments and food payments. Guess what. That is going to have \na major impact on our economy. Make no mistake about it, it will hurt \nour economy. We have been through this. We have seen this movie before. \nIt hurts our economy. It hurts our country. This is a self-inflicted \ncrisis. This is totally avoidable. If that happens, yes, people will be \nterribly inconvenienced.\n\n  You ask the 10,000 people a day who elect to enroll in Medicare and \nthere is no one there to enroll them in Medicare. What are they going \nto do? You ask the person who needs a passport and cannot get a \npassport, what are they going to do? I can go through a whole host of \nthings. In 1995 and 1996, I think it was estimated 9 million people who \nhad planned to go to national parks did not go to national parks.\n  It is a cumulative effect. Why are we doing this? To advance our \nagenda? No, it is not going to pass. Why are we not using regular \norder? This is costly to our economy, it is costly to American \nfamilies. It is causing a slowdown in the recovery of our economy. An \neven greater concern is that in a couple of weeks, middle of October, \nwe are talking about going through this again perhaps on whether we \nwill pay our bills. The limit that we have deals with whether we can \npay the expenses that have already been incurred. This is not about new \nspending. This is about money that has already been spent, will we pay \nthe bill when the bill is received?\n  In the House-passed resolution, they said: Well, we will prioritize. \nWe will pay some but not all. I do not know how you can do that. \nAdministratively, I do not know how you can do that. You certainly are \ngoing to make it much more difficult to deal with those that are not in \nthe priority category. So we become a selective deadbeat? We say we are \nnot going to pay contractors, we are not going to pay doctors, we are \nnot going to pay workers? I mean, who are we not going to pay? They \nhave already done the work. They have already provided the services. \nThey have responsibilities. They expect us to pay our bills.\n  It does not work. We have been through this before in the last \nCongress. We saw. It hurt America's reputation. We came close. We did \nnot go over the cliff. But just coming close presented a huge problem \nfor this country. If we actually go over the cliff and do not pay our \nbills, it will be very costly to the American taxpayers. Interest rates \nwill go up on our national debt. It will go up. That will cost the \ntaxpayers more money. For what? Another self-inflicted crisis by the \nRepublicans to advance their extreme agenda.\n  We have the votes here to pass what we call a clean CR, a clean \nextension of paying our bills. We have the votes here. There is a \nmajority of us prepared to vote for that. We have said that. We have \nshown that. But, instead, it is being held hostage to an extreme agenda \nand trying to shortcut the regular process. What is the regular \nprocess? The regular process is we do our work, they do their work, the \nHouse, the Senate go to conference, work it out.\n  Yes, there is a Republican-controlled House. Yes, there is a \nDemocratic-controlled Senate. We do not have 60 votes but we have a \nmajority. In the White House is President Obama. So that is what the \nvoters gave us. Our responsibility is to work with that.\n  We did. The House passed a budget. I did not like the budget. I did \nnot like their budget. But that is a democracy. They passed their \nbudget. We passed a budget here. Our Republican friends said we \nprobably will not do it. We did it. We did not pass that last week, we \npassed that months ago. And what we said is, okay, let's go to \nconference, work out the difference. It will not be everything I want, \nit will not be everything the Republicans want. That is how the process \nworks.\n  Republicans will not sit down and talk with us. They will not let us \ngo to conference. They will not let us work out a budget. So when you \nlook at why we have not been able to reach a budget by October 1, it \nstarts with the fact that we have not been able to sit around a table \nto work out our differences because the Republicans will not let us go \nto conference. That is a fact. So we have got to get to conference. We \nhave got to get that done.\n  In the meantime, do not hold the government hostage, or paying our \nbills hostage, because all that does is create additional costs, hurts \nAmerica's reputation, hurts our economic recovery. It does not at all \nadvance a final resolution of an orderly process in which we work out \nthe problems of this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to put America's interests first, stop the games \nwe are playing and threats we are making. We are coming too close. Too \nmany people we are again telling: We do not\n\n[[Page S6878]]\n\nknow whether you are going to get a paycheck next week. What do you do \nif you are a worker or contractor and you do not know if you are going \nto get a paycheck next week?\n  You are already cutting back on your commitments. This is already \nhurting our economy. Every day we wait it hurts our economy. That is \nwhy a host of us are upset that we had to waste yesterday. It would \nhave been nice to be able to use yesterday to resolve this issue. Every \nday we wait costs our economy, it costs our country. Let's pass the \nnecessary legislation to keep government operating and pay our bills. \nLet's sit down as we should and work out the budget problems in a way \nthat is befitting the tradition of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Blumenthal, \nbe recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. We are going to have a vote here in the next few days, \ndepending on how the schedule and the calendar works out, on whether to \ndefund ObamaCare. That is a vote that I think many of us in this \nChamber want to have. I know many of our colleagues on the other side, \nthe Democrats, would prefer not to have that vote. But it is time for \nus to go on the record and to indicate to the American people, who are \nvery fed up with this law, and frankly have not had a good opportunity \nyet to see much of it being implemented, because much of the \nimplementation will occur in the next few months--but we are going to \nget to that vote here in the next few days, one way or the other. The \npressure is on. The pressure is on Republicans and Democrats to stand \nand to indicate one way or the other about whether they are willing to \nstand with the American people and against ObamaCare, which is having a \nharmful impact on so many different levels across the country.\n  I want to point out, if I might, a few of those impacts. Obviously, \nmany of us here in the Chamber are very concerned about the economy, \nabout jobs and about creating a better economic future for the people \nwe represent.\n  We are suffering through a very sluggish, anemic economy, with growth \nrates that are hovering in that 1 to 2 percent range, but certainly not \na range that gets Americans back to work or increases the take-home pay \nfor middle-income Americans.\n  If you look at the economic data, it is pretty sobering. We have had \nthis chronic high unemployment rate that has been sustained for several \nyears in a row, 7.5 percent. If you add in the number of people who \nhave quit looking for work or are underemployed, in other words they \nwant to work full time but they are working part time, the real \nunemployment rate is much, much higher.\n  There are about 22 million Americans who are unemployed today. If you \nfactor in those who have quit looking for work and those who are \nunderemployed--who are working part time instead of full time--the \nunemployment rate goes up to well over 10 percent.\n  You have a lot of Americans looking for jobs. At the same time, the \njobs that are being created in the economy are part-time jobs.\n  What is happening? A lot of Americans, who would love to be working \nfull time to be able to provide for their families, are now being \nforced into part-time jobs.\n  In fact, 60 percent of the jobs created this year are part-time jobs, \nnot full-time jobs.\n  If you look at the labor participation rate, it is at the lowest \nlevel that we have seen in 35 years. You have to go back to the \nadministration of President Jimmy Carter to find the time when the \nnumber of people in the workforce, as a percentage of those available \nto be working, is as low as it is today, 63.2 percent.\n  The economic data just rolls on and on. This is a very sluggish, very \nweak, very anemic economy.\n  When you ask people and ask businesses why that is, why are you not \nhiring full-time workers, why are you hiring part-time workers, why are \nyou reducing the size of your workforce or not hiring people that you \notherwise might hire, why is this issue of take-home pay going down \nrelative to what it was when the President first took office, the \nanswer, in most cases, comes back pretty simple: It is ObamaCare. It is \nthe cost, the mandates, the requirements, and the uncertainty \nassociated with the President's health care law, and some other \nconcern, I might add--government regulations. But policies coming out \nof Washington, DC, are making it more difficult and more expensive for \nour small businesses and job creators to create the jobs that are \nnecessary to keep our economy going.\n  This is why you have this sluggish economy and this chronically high \nunemployment rate, part-time jobs rather than full-time jobs, and lower \ntake-home pay. This is the slowest recovery we have seen, literally, in \nthe last 50 years. This is the economy that we are in the midst of \nright now.\n  As we talk about ObamaCare--and my colleagues and I come down here, \nand I was here when we voted on it back in 2009 and 2010--I was on the \nfloor on a regular basis talking about why I thought this was going to \nbe a disaster for jobs, for the economy, for health care costs. I was \noffering up amendments, alternatives that we thought would be better. \nWe think there are many that would work much better in terms of \nactually making health care more accessible and more affordable to more \nAmericans, but we were unsuccessful.\n  They had the votes. They passed it. It was a partisan vote. It was \nwithout a single Republican vote here or in the House of \nRepresentatives. It was a party-line vote. I think that is now why the \nAmerican people have rejected it. They know that it was a partisan \npiece of legislation passed without any input from the other side and \nwithout the ideas and alternatives that might have made more sense in \nterms of addressing the health care needs the American people said they \nwanted to see addressed.\n  But that being said, it is not only us who come down and talk about \nthis. We have now seen, as this thing has been slowly implemented, some \nof the impact. Some of the taxes have kicked in. You are starting to \nsee some of the additional costs that we said would impact middle-\nincome families in this country when it comes to the cost of their \nhealth insurance.\n  You don't have to look very far to see the people who are writing \nstories about that.\n  In fact, instead of listening to only Republicans who come down here \non floor and talk about this, you can look at the headlines of the \nnewspapers across this country. These are just this last week. We are \nnot talking about a long period of time, these are headlines from the \nlast week.\n  The National Review Online: ``Sorry, Mr. President, There Is `Serious \nEvidence' Obamacare Is Bad For Economic Growth.''\n  The Associated Press: ``Census: No sign of Economic Rebound for Many \nin the U.S.''\n  The Hill: ``Franchise owners come to the Hill to plead for ObamaCare \nrelief.''\n  Washington Times: ``Georgia Health Care Company Cuts 101 Employees \nDue to Obamacare.''\n  Reuters: ``Cleveland Clinic announces job cuts to prepare for \nObamacare.''\n  WSB-TV: ``Emory Healthcare to cut 100 jobs partly because of \nObamacare.''\n  Lancaster Online: ``How part-time workers are feeling the pain of \nObamacare.''\n  You can go on and on with only the headlines talking about the impact \non jobs and the economy of this ObamaCare legislation, which is in the \nprocess now of being implemented.\n  I think the other thing that we have said all along would happen--and \nthat is what we are seeing happen as well--is that health insurance \ncosts are going up, not down. If you look at the data--and these are \nsome of the news stories that I have mentioned, these are headlines \nfrom just the last week.\n  National Public Radio: ``Health Care Costs Are Projected To Outpace \nEconomic Growth.''\n  Associated Press: ``Premium concerns lead some small businesses to \ntemporarily sidestep health law.''\n  I could go on. But the point, very simply, is that the validators of \nthe things that we are seeing here are out there every single day in \nthe media.\n\n[[Page S6879]]\n\n  There is a study that came out, or I should say a report that came \nout from HHS, which was supposed to give us a new idea, or a glimpse of \nwhat the premiums are going to be under the exchanges when they are \nfully up and running. That is supposed to be sometime next week.\n  The Health and Human Services department issued some information \nabout that yesterday.\n  What is ironic about it is that with less than a week to go before \nthese exchanges are supposed to go online, it is a 15-page report and a \npress release that summarizes some of the premium data.\n  What they did is HHS compared what the Congressional Budget Office \nprojected rates might look like in 2016 to its own findings. It didn't \ncompare it to what it cost last year. It didn't compare it to the \nreality that most Americans are experiencing in terms of the health \ncare costs that they deal with on an annual basis. We are not getting \nany information that gives us any insight into what these costs are \nactually going to be.\n  Fortunately, there are others who have looked at this same \ninformation, the data dump that was released yesterday by the Health \nand Human Services department, and compared it to what insurance costs \nbefore the Affordable Care Act passed. In other words, we heard the \npromises from the President when this was being debated, that health \ncare costs were going to go down by $2,500 per family. Obviously, we \nare seeing the exact opposite. There was a CMS study that came out just \na few days ago that said health care costs, because of ObamaCare, \nactually are going go up by $621 billion. If you divide that by the \nnumber of families in this country, a family of four, that is $7,450 \nper family of four increase, not decrease, in health care costs. That \nis the estimate of the CMS actuaries.\n  When you look at what the information coming out of HHS suggests, and \nyou compare it to a baseline of what health care costs are before this \nbecomes implemented, you get a very different picture. Some of the \nanalysis that has been done suggests that ObamaCare is going to \nincrease underlying insurance rates for younger men by an average of 97 \nto 99 percent and for younger women by an average of 55 to 62 percent.\n  It says the worst off is the State of North Carolina, where \nindividual market rates are going to triple for women and quadruple for \nmen. We can go down the list State by State, and we get sort of a \ndetailed explanation of people at various stages in life, such as a 40-\nyear-old woman. I am looking at some charts here comparing my State of \nSouth Dakota. This is the Affordable Care Act bronze premium versus the \npre-Affordable Care Act health care premiums that people in similar \ncircumstances were faced with. For a 40-year-old man in my State of \nSouth Dakota, it says that this is going to increase his premiums by \n146 percent and for a 40-year-old woman 96 percent.\n  The evidence keeps piling up out there. It is in the news stories, \nfrom the people, and the businesses who were talking about the impact \nthat it is going have on them. The analysis that is being done actually \ncompares what this is going to do in the exchanges--the premiums are \ngoing to be at the exchanges--with what people are actually \nexperiencing today. It is not some hypothetical like the HHS numbers \nsuggested; you find that it is like a picture. A picture is being \npainted of a very serious situation for middle-class families who were \nhoping, hoping, when all the promises were made, that they were going \nto see their health insurance costs go down, not up. An exact opposite \neffect is happening.\n  We can go through, again, State by State and look at the various \nanalyses. But I think the point is that instead of having health \ninsurance costs go down as a result of ObamaCare, they are going up, \nand they are going up dramatically.\n  In this CMS estimate by the actuary, that just came out a few days \nago, there is a $621 billion increase in health care spending in this \ncountry attributable solely, singularly to ObamaCare. Divided by the \nnumber of families in the country, as I said, that is a $7,450 \nincrease.\n  Why are people rejecting this? Well, I think that is the obvious \nreason. They realize, most people do, at least, that these are \npocketbook issues. These are kitchen table issues. These are the types \nof things that as Americans they are trying to figure out, how to pay \ntheir bills and how to keep their family covered. They want to figure \nout how to save a little money for their children's college education, \nhow to make ends meet, and how to keep things afloat.\n  They are very concerned about what they are seeing and the impact of \nthis legislation on what they are having to pay for health care \ncoverage. They are also very concerned about what it might mean for the \njobs that they have today and hopefully aspire to in the future. Many \nof these are in jeopardy, because businesses who are hit with these new \nmandates, these new penalties, these new requirements under ObamaCare. \nBusinesses are finding it more and more difficult and more expensive to \ncreate the jobs that will help these middle-income families meet the \nneeds of their families and try to provide a better future for their \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  One of the reasons is, at the end of the day, as people are assessing \nthis, there is so much information, polling data, and survey data that \ncorroborates the anecdotal information we are hearing from individuals \nand businesses out there. People are increasingly skeptical, \nincreasingly suspicious, and increasingly frustrated with the ObamaCare \nlegislation. They want to see a do-over.\n  One of the biggest examples of that--and they probably were the \nbiggest advocates of this--were the labor unions. If you look at what \nthe labor unions are now saying, there was a letter a few weeks back \nfrom three of the largest unions in the country, including the \nTeamsters union, led by Jimmy Hoffa.\n  They said that ObamaCare would shatter benefits for their members. \nThey said it would create nightmare scenarios. They said that it would \ndestroy the foundation, the backbone, if you will, of middle-class \nfamilies, and that is the 40-hour work week.\n  The reason they are saying that is because, as I mentioned, the \nnumber of jobs that are being created in America today are primarily \npart-time jobs. Why? Because small businesses have incentives to hire \npart-time workers.\n  One, if they hire above 50 employees, they are covered by the mandate \nthat says they have to provide government-approved health care to their \nemployees.\n  Two, the full-time employee hour limit is 30 hours. More and more, \nemployers are trying to stay under 50 employees and trying to employ \npeople for fewer than 30 hours a week so that they are not hit with \nthese mandates under the ObamaCare legislation.\n  This is not a good scenario for someone who is out there looking for \na job and for someone who is looking for a better job. It certainly \nisn't going to help Americans improve and increase the amount of take-\nhome pay that they receive on a weekly to monthly basis.\n  That is why, if you look at again, some headlines from newspapers.\n  The Washington Examiner says: ``Just 12 percent think Obamacare will \nhave a positive impact on their families.''\n  Fox News poll: ``68 percent concerned about their health care under \nthe new law.''\n  NBC News poll: ``Obamacare remains highly unpopular as implementation \nlooms.''\n  Washington Post poll: ``Many Americans confused about the health-care \nlaw.''\n  CNN Money: ``Most employees still in the dark about health care \nreform.''\n  There is anxiety, there is frustration, there is skepticism. I think \nmost of these folks share the view that was expressed by the unions, \nperhaps the biggest advocates of the health care law when it passed. \nWhat we would like is a do-over. It either needs to be fixed or it \nneeds to be repealed.\n  That was essentially the message that was coming from the unions at a \nmeeting they had in California a week ago.\n  It goes on and on. We are going to have an opportunity to right that \nwrong. We are going to have an opportunity to get that do-over and to \nhave a vote.\n  The vote is going to occur in the next few days, and it is going to \ngive us an\n\n[[Page S6880]]\n\nopportunity to go on the record about whether we ought to continue to \nfund a program that we now know is not working. And all the evidence \nthat I mentioned here today, all the conversations we have with \nbusinesses in our home States, with hospitals--I mentioned earlier \nCleveland Clinic, which is reducing its workforce to prepare for \nObamaCare. That is going on all across this country. It is not too late \nfor us to get this right. We can correct this. There is a better way to \ndo this. It didn't take a 2,700-page bill and 20,000 pages of \nregulations to fix the things that were wrong with the American health \ncare system.\n\n  But now we have a government takeover of literally one-sixth of our \neconomy, massive amounts of redtape and bureaucracy and regulation and \nthe uncertainty associated with that, higher cost for individuals, much \nhigher costs--dramatically higher costs, as I pointed out--and fewer \njob opportunities for families around this country, at least for full-\ntime jobs, and lower take-home pay and a lower labor participation rate \nand sluggish economy. That is what this has wrought. That is what we \nneed to correct and fix, and we are going to have an opportunity to do \nthat with a vote later this week.\n  So, Mr. President, I know it is very hard to acknowledge sometimes \nwhen something is not working, and it is something you have invested \nin, something that in this case a number of our colleagues voted for \nwhen it was passed here several years ago. But in the interest of the \nAmerican people, in the interest of doing what is right for jobs, for \nour economy, for the health care needs of American middle-class \nfamilies across this country, it is time for us to fix this, to right \nthis wrong, and to move in a different direction.\n  So I hope we will have the votes. There will be some of our \ncolleagues on the Democratic side who will vote with us when we get to \nthis vote here in the next few days and may send a very clear and loud \nmessage to the American people that we are listening, that we hear you, \nwe understand your frustration, we want to fix this and get it right, \nand we want to go in a different direction. And I think that will be a \nwelcome relief to Americans, who in overwhelming numbers are finding \nthis less and less to their liking. The more they find out about it, \nthe less they like it and the more concerned they are about their \nfuture and their families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I rise this evening to talk as well \nabout the Affordable Care Act and perhaps cut through some of the \nrhetoric and talk a little about specific realities and the reason to \npreserve its funding, along with honoring our other commitments in the \ncontinuing resolution that will keep the Federal Government open and \nworking for the American people.\n  I want to say at the outset that I hear from folks in Connecticut \nabout the need for improvements and minor changes in the Affordable \nCare Act, which should be possible. But what should be impossible is \nholding hostage the work of the government to achieve changes in the \nAffordable Care Act and making improvements that may be necessary but \nshould be done separately from keeping the government open for our \nveterans and Social Security recipients who may need services in \nconnection with the checks they are issued, in paying our troops here \nand abroad who are serving and sacrificing for us, in the countless \nways our Federal Government makes a difference in people's lives. Most \nimportantly, the threat of closing the government helps to create \nuncertainty and confusion, which in turn undermines investment and job \ncreation and economic growth and, indeed, recovery from the great \neconomic recession that has so financially crippled our Nation.\n  The health care reform measure--the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, \ncall it what you will--has already made achievements, enabling young \npeople to stay on their parents' policies; moderating, if not \neliminating, many of the insurance coverage abuses I fought against as \nattorney general; and achieving advances in health care delivery reform \nfor greater efficiency and lower cost.\n  As we have noted on this floor countless times, the Affordable Care \nAct was passed by majorities of this body and the House of \nRepresentatives and signed by the President. It predated my service \nhere, but it is the law of the land. The effort now is, in effect, to \nachieve through the back door what was not accomplished through the \nfront door. It is to achieve indirectly what opponents of the \nAffordable Care Act wanted to achieve directly, which is to block it, \nto stop it, to halt it. That should not be the objective of this \nmeasure and certainly should not be achieved by a small minority, a \nfringe extreme group of ideologs who have, in the House of \nRepresentatives, threatened to hold hostage the entire Federal \nGovernment.\n  I am disheartened that some of the same Senators who rightly decried \nthe pace of our economic recovery are themselves now undermining that \ngoal by demanding an end to the Affordable Care Act and engendering \nuncertainty and confusion so inimical to job creation and economic \ngrowth.\n  Forums in Connecticut and my conversations and discussions with \nhealth care providers, our hospitals, our medical professionals, have \nconvinced me that one of the central achievements already of the \nAffordable Care Act relates to preventive care, and I want to talk a \nlittle while about those specifics, about the reality on the ground in \nConnecticut that I have seen and heard--not the predictions or \nprognostications but the realities of preventive health care \nachievements in Connecticut that have already been demonstrated. They \nrelate specifically to the Prevention and Public Health Fund.\n  Let me repeat that term: the Prevention and Public Health Fund. It is \nnot exactly a household word to many Americans, but it should be \ncredited, along with ObamaCare and the Affordable Care Act, with \nspecific tangible accomplishments in helping people learn how to make \nsmart decisions and prevent the onset of obesity, diabetes, heart \ndisease, and cancer. These conditions and diseases have real costs and \npreventing them has real savings. So we can seriously reduce not only \nthe overall levels of spending on health care but also save people a \nlot of suffering and families a lot of heartbreak.\n\n  In my home State of Connecticut, the funding from the Prevention and \nPublic Health Fund has supported vital care and services in three \ncritical areas: mental health, tobacco cessation, and women's health \ncare--not the only three that has those accomplishments, but they are \nthree.\n  On mental health services, last year the State of Connecticut \nreceived nearly $900,000 from the Prevention and Public Health Fund for \nuse by the State's department of mental health and addiction services \nand the direct care providers in the State. Let me give an example of \nhow that money was used.\n  Community Mental Health Affiliates, which serves more than 8,300 \nchildren, adolescents, and adults each year in 17 locations throughout \nConnecticut, received some of those funds to provide direct care. In \nparticular, they are using those funds to create the Allied Health \nSystem, and they are doing it with the Hospital of Central Connecticut, \nwhich means having advanced nursing and practical help from the \nHospital of Central Connecticut to come to their outpatient facility to \nprovide case management and wellness programs and suicide prevention \nand screening programs. They are helping save lives and health.\n  We know that investment in mental health makes a difference. In fact, \nit ought to be a centerpiece of a comprehensive gun violence prevention \nmeasure. We know reaching dangerous people, along with keeping guns out \nof the hands of dangerous people before they commit acts of violence is \ncentral to what we have to do to make our Nation safer and better. An \ninvestment in behavioral health services is vital to addressing the \ndiseases--the psychoses, addictions, depression, post-traumatic \nstress--and helping to reach people before tragedy occurs.\n  We know that lack of investment makes a difference as well, not only \nin violence but in heartbreaking failures and life-changing illnesses \nthat are perhaps invisible but in children can transform lives for the \nworst. The Connecticut Children's Medical Center recently came to my \noffice and shared with me what the lack of investment in\n\n[[Page S6881]]\n\npreventive health care means for them and the children who come to this \nchildren's hospital. They have seen numbers of children arriving in a \nbehavioral health crisis unmatched in our history--nearly quadrupled \nsince the year 2000. Last year that meant 2,300 children seeking care \nin the emergency department of that children's hospital.\n  Emergency departments are not equipped to provide the kind of \nspecialized care that the children need who come to them in these \ntraumatic life-changing situations--in crises. And for some kids who \nwait over a week for placement in an appropriate inpatient facility, \nthat is a crisis not only for them but for their family and their \ncommunities. We have seen the tragic results of failing to address \nthose crises which affects individuals, and it is so heartbreaking.\n  I have fought for and made my life's work tobacco prevention and \ncessation programs. My colleagues want to talk about reducing Federal \nspending. Well, let's talk about the $96 billion a year in direct \nhealth costs that are necessary to treat diseases caused by tobacco \naddiction. That is $96 billion a year in direct health costs, with \nnearly $55 billion of it from the Federal Government. I hope to work in \na bipartisan way to reduce that figure with my colleagues through the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  A study in the Lancet on the first ``Tips From Former Smokers''--the \ncampaign of the Federal Government--found that 1.6 million additional \nsmokers are making a quit attempt because of this campaign and over \n100,000 have quit tobacco since 2012 because of that campaign.\n  The final area I think is so important is women's health care, and in \nthis area the Affordable Care Act has been monumental in maternity care \nin our hospitals, in contraception coverage, in health insurance \nprovisions that make a difference in women participating equally in our \neconomy as well as having the health care they need, which in turn \nsaves money not just for them but for children who are born in \nhospitals and who receive the kind of care they need in those first \ndays of birth. The Prevention and Public Health Fund has made a \ndifference in those lives, and it has made meaningful improvements to \nthe lives and health of women and children across this country.\n  Cost savings to the Nation resulting from preventive health care are \nhuge, but those economic benefits also accrue to our families. More \nthan half of all the bankruptcy cases today are caused by health bills \npeople simply can't pay. I know because I see the results and try to \nhelp the families who are affected by it.\n  One example is a family whose son struggles with Lyme disease and \nreceived denials from insurance companies. They had to exhaust their \nretirement savings and their health care funds as well as their college \nfund for medical treatment. My office was able to persuade the \ninsurance company to reverse those denials but only after the family \nhad to resort to asking their neighbors to pay for their son's medical \nbills.\n  Story after story after story about medical insurance denials \nconvinced me that the Affordable Care Act will make a difference in \nreforming health care coverage practices by the insurance companies as \nwell as enabling families to avoid the financial travails of \nbankruptcy.\n  Let me say finally, Connecticut has been a leader in insurance \nmarkets with many leading insurers headquartered in my home State. I am \nproud that Connecticut has been that leader that is home to many \ninsurance companies and that Access Health Connecticut, the individual \nmarketplace in Connecticut, has been working tirelessly and \nsuccessfully with these insurance firms to put together a ground-\nbreaking exchange.\n  The Kaiser Family Foundation recently found that the likely cost for \na family of four in Hartford, CT earning $60,000 a year for a bronze \nlevel plan through the exchange will be $122 a month. That is about the \ncost of a Starbucks coffee every day. The products being offered \nthrough the exchanges are high quality, and they are available even to \npeople who have a preexisting condition.\n  In fact, the Affordable Care Act enables health care insurance for \nall people with a preexisting condition. No longer will people have to \nconfront their insurance companies as regularly and frequently as they \ndid. No longer will insurance companies be permitted to engage in the \negregious practices they did. And hopefully, no longer will the \nservices of my office, such as I did when I was Attorney General and \nnow as Senator, be as necessary as often.\n  Shutting down the government is a movie we have seen before. It ends \nbadly. It ends with undercutting investments, undermining job creation \nand economic growth. It is a disservice to our Nation. Hopefully, with \nbipartisan cooperation and compromise we can afford it and proudly go \non with the work of this body and of the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on Friday night in Illinois and all over \nthe country thousands of high school students will take to the football \nfield.\n  They will put on helmets, they will put on pads, but unfortunately \nsome of them will still get hurt.\n  Almost half the concussions in high school sports occur in football.\n  But it is not just football.\n  Injuries are a part of all sports, but as we learn more about the \nlong-term effects of concussions and how frequently they are ignored, \nit is clear we have to step up our game to confront this health risk.\n  The National Federation of State High School Associations estimates \nabout 140,000 students who play high school sports have concussions \nevery year.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, the number of children \nage 19 and younger being treated in ERs for traumatic brain injuries \nwent from 153,373 in 2001 to 248,418 in 2009--a 60 percent increase.\n  Some students stay in the game not recognizing the risks of playing \nhurt--especially when they have had a concussion.\n  Many athletes do not know the signs and symptoms of concussion, which \nmay cause many concussions to go undetected.\n  A 2010 Government Accountability Office study found many sports-\nrelated concussions go unreported.\n  Athletes who continue to play while concussed are at risk for \ncatastrophic injury if they sustain another concussion before \nrecovering from the first one.\n  This second injury can cause symptoms that can last for months and \ncan even be fatal.\n  Youth athletes are at the greatest risk from sports-related \nconcussions because their brains are still developing and are more \nsusceptible to injury.\n  According to the American Academy of Neurology, athletes of high \nschool age and younger with a concussion should be managed more \nconservatively when it comes to returning to play because they take \nlonger to recover than college athletes.\n  Michael Schostok played football in Mundelein, IL.\n  He experienced a concussion on the football field. Immediately after \ntaking a hit to his head, he stumbled off the field.\n  He was disoriented and explained to his coach that he was in severe \npain, especially when looking into the sun.\n  But his coach urged him to continue playing and he remained on the \nfield for the rest of the game.\n  Two days after the game, Michael was unable to look at a computer \nscreen without severe pain and suffered from blurred vision and slow \ndecision-making.\n  Three days after the game, he went to a doctor and was diagnosed with \na concussion.\n  Michael was lucky that he did not suffer another concussion while he \ncontinued to play.\n  Unfortunately this situation is not unusual.\n  According to the Center for Injury Research and Policy in Columbus, \nOH, more than 40 percent of young athletes return to play before they \nare fully recovered.\n  Since 2009, States have started implementing legislation guiding \nreturn-to-play procedures for student athletes who have sustained a \nconcussion.\n  As of August 2013, 49 States and the District of Columbia have \nsuccessfully passed some form of legislation with varying concussion \nsafety measures.\n  Illinois has been a leader on this issue and passed legislation in \n2011, recognizing the dangers associated with concussion.\n  In Illinois, a student athlete who is suspected of sustaining a \nconcussion or head injury in a practice or game is immediately removed \nfrom the game until he or she is cleared by a health care professional.\n  This is a great step forward for Illinois, and I commend the Illinois \nHigh School Association for its work protecting student athletes.\n  This week I will introduce the Protecting Student Athletes from \nConcussions Act, which would support the progress made by States such \nas Illinois.\n  The bill would, for the first time, set minimum State requirements \nfor the prevention and treatment of concussions.\n  The legislation requires schools to post information about \nconcussions on school grounds and on school websites and adopt a ``when \nin doubt, sit it out'' policy.\n  This policy requires that a student suspected of sustaining a \nconcussion be removed from participation in the activity and prohibited \nfrom returning to play that day.\n  They can return to play in future events after being evaluated and \ncleared by a qualified health care professional.\n  The ``when in doubt, sit it out'' policy is recommended by the \nAmerican College of Sports Medicine and the American Academy of \nNeurology, which recommends that an athlete suspected of a concussion \nshould not return to play the day of their injury--under any \ncircumstance.\n  Concussions are not always easily diagnosed, and symptoms that might \nindicate concussion don't always manifest themselves immediately.\n  Athletes don't want to let down the team or the coach and are often \neager to return to the game.\n  So helping athletes, school officials, coaches, and parents recognize \nthe signs and symptoms of concussion can make all the difference in \nputting a player's safety above winning.\n  This legislation will ensure that school districts have concussion \nmanagement plans that educate students, parents, and school personnel \nabout how to recognize and respond to concussions.\n  And it asks schools to adopt the ``sit it out'' policy to be sure \nathletes are\n\n[[Page S6883]]\n\nnot put back in the game before they have recovered from an initial \nconcussion.\n  I am pleased that a variety of organizations are supporting this \nbill, including the NFL, NCAA, NHL, NBA, American College of Sports \nMedicine, American Academy of Neurology, among others.\n  I look forward to working with the schools, athletic programs, and \nothers to build on the progress already made in protecting student \nathletes from concussions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/24/senate-section/article/S6883-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CORPORATION FOR NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Since its inception in 1993, more than 5 \nmillion Americans have participated in its programs.\n  The mission of the corporation is to improve lives, strengthen \ncommunities, and foster civic engagement through service and \nvolunteering. The Corporation for National and Community Service is \ncommitted to helping address national and local needs by supporting our \ncountry's nonprofit sector.\n  My State of Mississippi remembers how important this commitment was \nto our recovery from Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters. We \nremember the incredible outpouring of support from around the country. \nMany people in our State invest their time and energy, through everyday \nacts of kindness and charity, in our neighborhoods, schools and \nchurches.\n  National service opportunities also contribute to workforce \ndevelopment, offering participants practical experience and on-the-job \ntraining. Service is part of our American way of life, and it is about \nmaking a difference in each and every community across the country.\n  It is important for us to support and applaud the contributions of \nthe Corporation for National and Community Service on its 20th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/24/senate-section/article/S6883-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            KIEFER'S FLORIST\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the city of \nDublin, OH, and Muirfield Village Golf Club as hosts of the 10th \nPresidents Cup from October 1 to 6, 2013. The Presidents Cup was first \nplayed in 1994 and is a biennial event played in non-Ryder Cup years. \nSimilar to the Ryder Cup, the Presidents Cup gives the world's best \nnon-European players an opportunity to compete against the United \nStates in an international team match-play competition featuring two \nteams of twelve golfers.\n  In total, more than $27 million has been distributed to at least 425 \ncharities in 16 countries since the inception of the Presidents Cup in \n1994, including a record-setting $4.5 million from the 2011 event \nalone. These funds are distributed to charitable causes around the \nworld as chosen by the 30 players, captains, and captain assistants.\n  Muirfield Village will become the third golf course in the United \nStates to host the Presidents Cup and will be the only golf course in \nthe world to have hosted the Presidents Cup, the Ryder Cup, the Solheim \nCup, and an annual PGA tour event, the Memorial Tournament. Muirfield \nVillage is a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course in Dublin, OH, that was \nestablished in 1974. Jack Nicklaus, four-time U.S. Presidents Cup \ncaptain, will serve as the tournament host this year.\n  I had the opportunity to visit Muirfield Village in early June at the \nMemorial Tournament and saw firsthand how special this golf course is \nand how great a venue it will be to host the Presidents Cup. The \nPresidents Cup will bring nearly 150,000 spectators and an expected $22 \nmillion in revenue to the Columbus region. Today, I congratulate \neveryone involved in bringing the Presidents Cup to Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/24/senate-section/article/S6883-4", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          DOWNTOWN DAILY BREAD\n\n Mr. CASEY.

Since then, the organization has \nexpanded its programming to become one of Delaware's leading agencies \nserving youth, families, and victims of domestic violence.\n  Today, CHILD, Inc. primarily works with children who may be troubled, \nneglected, or abused, as well as children and families who have been \nimpacted by domestic violence. In addition to being the only children's \nshelter and runaway center in the State of Delaware, CHILD, Inc. \nprovides a wide\n\n[[Page S6884]]\n\narray of violence prevention and treatment programs tailored to the \nneeds of children and families.\n  Under the leadership of longtime director Joseph M. Dell'Olio, who \nled the organization from 1973 until his retirement in 2008, CHILD, \nInc. has become a powerful force for advocacy, helping to push through \nkey improvements to Delaware's child welfare system. The organization \ncontinues to expand that advocacy mission today.\n  CHILD, Inc.'s dedication to Delaware children and families, as well \nas its determination to continuously grow and improve its services, has \nhelped thousands of children grow up and thrive in a stronger, safer \ncommunity. On behalf of all Delawareans, I thank CHILD, Inc. for 50 \nyears of tremendous service and congratulate them on this significant \nmilestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/24/senate-section/article/S6884-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/24/senate-section/article/S6884-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/24/senate-section/article/S6884-3", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 7:44 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Chiappardi, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 527) to amend \nthe Helium Act to complete the privatization of the Federal helium \nreserve in a competitive market fashion that ensures stability in the \nhelium markets while protecting the interests of American taxpayers, \nand for other purposes, with an amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/24/senate-section/article/S6884-4", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6884-S6885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-3131.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1548\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Haiti and Armenia \n     Reforestation Act of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the established policy of the Federal Government is to \n     support and seek protection of forests around the world that \n     provide a wide range of benefits by--\n       (A) harboring a major portion of the biological and \n     terrestrial resources of Earth and providing habitats for \n     almost \\2/3\\ of all species on Earth, including species \n     essential to medical research and agricultural productivity;\n       (B) contributing to the livelihood of over 1,600,000,000 \n     people through access to food, fresh water, clothing, \n     traditional medicines, and shelter;\n       (C) ensuring environmental functions such as biodiversity, \n     water conservation, soil enrichment, water supply management, \n     and climate regulation; and\n       (D) storing carbon, where deforestation accounts for up to \n     20 percent of the global greenhouse gas emissions that \n     contribute to global warming;\n       (2) while forests cover a little less than \\1/3\\ of the \n     land area on our planet, approximately 76 percent of the \n     planet's original primary forests have been destroyed or \n     degraded;\n       (3) in 1923, over 60 percent of the land of Haiti was \n     forested but, by 2006, that percentage had decreased to \n     approximately less than 2 percent as a result of--\n       (A) an acceleration in the rate of deforestation in Haiti \n     by more than 20 percent during the period beginning in 2000 \n     and ending in 2005 compared to the period beginning in 1990 \n     and ending in 1999; and\n       (B) a loss of nearly 10 percent (approximately 11,000 \n     hectares) of the forest cover and approximately 22 percent of \n     the total forest and woodland habitat of Haiti;\n       (4) while archeological data indicated that approximately \n     35 percent of Armenia was originally forested, less than 12 \n     percent of Armenia's territory was covered in forest in 1990, \n     which has been reduced to approximately less than 7 percent \n     by 2013 as a result of an energy crisis that crippled the \n     nation in the 1990s and a loss of total of 24.5 percent \n     (nearly 85,000 hectares) of forest cover during the period \n     between 1990 and 2010;\n       (5) poverty and economic pressures are--\n       (A) two factors that underlie the deforestation of Haiti \n     and Armenia; and\n       (B) manifested particularly through the clearing of vast \n     areas of forest for conversion to agricultural uses where \\2/\n     5\\ of the population of Haiti depend on the agricultural \n     sector, which consists mainly of small-scale subsistence \n     farming, and where wood and charcoal produced from cutting \n     down trees accounts for a major supply toward Haiti's and \n     Armenia's energy sectors;\n       (6) 80 percent of the population of Haiti lives below the \n     poverty line and 36 percent of the population of Armenia \n     lives below the poverty line;\n\n[[Page S6889]]\n\n       (7) soil erosion represents a significant effect of the \n     deforestation of Haiti and Armenia, as erosion has--\n       (A) lowered the productivity on the land due to poor soils \n     underlying the forests;\n       (B) worsened the severity of droughts, landslides, and \n     floods;\n       (C) led to further deforestation;\n       (D) significantly decreased the quality and, as a result, \n     quantity of freshwater and clean drinking water available to \n     populations; and\n       (E) increased the pressure on the remaining land and trees \n     in Haiti and Armenia;\n       (8) forests provide cover to soften the effect of heavy \n     rains and reduce erosion by anchoring the soil with their \n     roots;\n       (9) research conducted by the United Nations Environmental \n     Programme has revealed a direct (89 percent) correlation \n     between the extent of the deforestation of a country and the \n     incidence of victims per weather event in the country;\n       (10) both Haiti and Armenia have faced natural disasters in \n     recent years that have been at least partly exacerbated by \n     the effects of deforestation, such as--\n       (A) flooding in Armenia that has cost nearly $33,000,000 in \n     damages each year and swept away or damaged thousands of \n     homes, schools, health clinics, and other institutions, \n     partly because of damage to forests through illegal loggings, \n     landslides, and soil erosion;\n       (B) hurricanes in Haiti that have killed thousands and \n     displaced hundreds of thousands more, partly because \n     deforestation had resulted in the clearing of large \n     hillsides, which enabled rainwater to run off directly to \n     settlements located at the bottom of slopes; and\n       (C) the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti, which destroyed \n     much of the infrastructure of Port au Prince and had greater \n     consequences because of deforestation, which reduced hillside \n     stability and increased the likelihood of mudslides, soil \n     erosion, and flooding factors, which also negatively impacted \n     the water supply and heightened concerns for the spread of \n     waterborne diseases;\n       (11) economic benefits for local communities from \n     sustainable uses of forests are critical for the long-term \n     sustainable management of forests in Haiti and Armenia;\n       (12) on July 29, 2010, the Supplemental Appropriations Act, \n     2010 (Public Law 111-212) was enacted into law, which \n     included $25,000,000 for ``the reforestation and other \n     restoration of Haiti's key watersheds''; and\n       (13) reforestation efforts would provide new sources of \n     jobs, income, and investments in both Haiti and Armenia by--\n       (A) providing employment opportunities in tree seedling \n     programs, contract tree planting and management, sustainable \n     agricultural initiatives, sustainable and managed timber \n     harvesting, and wood products milling and finishing services; \n     and\n       (B) enhancing community enterprises that generate income \n     through the trading of sustainable forest resources, many of \n     which exist on small scales.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide \n     assistance to the Government of Haiti and the Government of \n     Armenia to develop and implement, or improve, nationally \n     appropriate policies and actions--\n       (1) to reduce deforestation and forest degradation and \n     improve forest management and natural regeneration;\n       (2) to increase annual rates of afforestation and \n     reforestation in a sustainable, measurable, reportable, and \n     verifiable manner--\n       (A) to restore social and economic conditions for \n     environmental recovery of--\n       (i) 35 percent of Haiti's and Armenia's land surface areas \n     within 7 years after the date of the enactment of this Act; \n     and\n       (ii) the forest cover of Haiti and Armenia to at least 7 \n     percent in Haiti and at least 12 percent in Armenia (about \n     each country's respective levels in 1990) within 20 years \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act; and\n       (3) to improve sustainable resource management at the \n     watershed scale.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 255\n\n       Whereas, on August 15, 1947, India became a sovereign, \n     democratic nation;\n       Whereas India is the world's largest democracy, embracing \n     fundamental liberties and freedoms, justice, and the rule of \n     law;\n       Whereas India is a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, and multi-\n     religious society that promotes tolerance, diversity, and \n     equality;\n       Whereas a strong relationship with India, the world's \n     largest democracy, is critically important to United States \n     interests;\n       Whereas the 2014 parliamentary elections in India are a \n     further opportunity to strengthen the democratic institutions \n     of the world's largest democracy;\n       Whereas the Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh, \n     has led his government in undertaking a series of reforms \n     designed to strengthen the Indian economy and transform the \n     bilateral economic relationship into a true strategic \n     partnership;\n       Whereas India is one of the world's fastest growing and \n     dynamic economies, and a strong, economically competitive \n     India is ultimately good for American business and American \n     jobs;\n       Whereas the 100,000 Indians who are studying in the United \n     States and the 2,700,000 Americans of Indian descent living \n     in the United States, including Nobel Laureates, artists, \n     business leaders, journalists, and public servants, have \n     contributed enormously to the rich social, political, and \n     economic fabric of the United States;\n       Whereas India serves as a pivotal and effective partner in \n     ensuring international peace and security and is the third \n     largest contributor of personnel to United Nations \n     peacekeeping missions;\n       Whereas security and defense cooperation between the United \n     States and India continues to grow, as India remains a \n     steadfast partner in countering the rise of extremists and \n     currently participates in more naval exercises with the \n     United States than any other nation;\n       Whereas the Defense Trade Initiative is successfully \n     realigning India and United States procurement processes and \n     United States military sales to India have totaled almost \n     $9,000,000,000 in the last several years;\n       Whereas India is the largest regional contributor to \n     reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan and will be an \n     important partner in the transition of United States forces \n     from Afghanistan in 2014;\n       Whereas the market economy in India has contributed to \n     increased economic opportunities, reduced poverty, and \n     accompanying stability;\n       Whereas foreign direct investment and a transparent and \n     progressive investment climate can play a critical role in \n     economic development in India and strengthening United \n     States-India economic relations;\n       Whereas the foundation of a strong economic partnership \n     between India and the United States requires a mutual respect \n     for innovation and an investment environment that fosters \n     continued research and development;\n       Whereas a Bilateral Investment Treaty would provide \n     protections for investors and help unleash needed investment \n     in India;\n       Whereas furthering the bilateral dialogue on trade and \n     investment is key to broadening and deepening the economic \n     relationship between the United States and India, which can \n     provide both Indian and American companies increased \n     opportunities for exports; and\n       Whereas a strong relationship between the people and \n     Governments of the United States and India, based on mutual \n     trust and respect, will enable the countries to more closely \n     collaborate across a broad spectrum of interests, such as \n     global peace and prosperity, counterterrorism, defense, \n     nonproliferation, economic prosperity, energy and climate \n     change, education, scientific research, outer space, public \n     health, and agriculture: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) warmly welcomes the Prime Minister of India, Dr. \n     Manmohan Singh, on his visit to the United States, which \n     provides a timely opportunity to reinforce the United States-\n     India relationship and make progress on a number of fronts;\n       (2) believes that together, the Governments of India and \n     the United States can bring immense benefits to their people \n     and make enormous contributions to addressing the global \n     challenges of the 21st century;\n       (3) looks forward to making progress on a range of issues \n     to deepen and broaden the strategic partnership between India \n     and the United States;\n       (4) welcomes continued progress towards a Bilateral \n     Investment Treaty;\n       (5) supports progress and implementation of the landmark \n     United States-India civil nuclear agreement;\n       (6) acknowledges that the progress made by the Government \n     of India on economic reforms has opened new channels for \n     foreign direct investment, and believes further \n     liberalization can bring increased prosperity to both \n     countries; and\n       (7) recognizes there is strong potential to grow the \n     bilateral relationship and increase cooperation between the \n     United States and India, elevating the relationship to an \n     even stronger strategic partnership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/24/senate-section/article/S6892-2", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6892-S6893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 256--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 23 THROUGH 29, \n     2013, AS ``NATIONAL ADULT EDUCATION AND FAMILY LITERACY WEEK''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, \nMr. Kaine, Mr. Brown, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Isakson, Ms. Warren, \nMr. King, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Cardin, Ms. Collins, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Graham, \nand Mr. Baucus) submitted the following\n\n[[Page S6893]]\n\nresolution;

RESPECT FOR RIGHTS OF CONSCIENCE.\n\n       (a) Findings and Purposes.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (A) As Thomas Jefferson declared to New London Methodists \n     in 1809, ``[n]o provision in our Constitution ought to be \n     dearer to man than that which protects the rights of \n     conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority''.\n       (B) Jefferson's statement expresses a conviction on respect \n     for conscience that is deeply embedded in the history and \n     traditions of our Nation and codified in numerous State and \n     Federal laws, including laws on health care.\n       (C) Until enactment of the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148, in this section \n     referred to as ``PPACA''), the Federal Government has not \n     sought to impose specific coverage or care requirements that \n     infringe on the rights of conscience of insurers, purchasers \n     of insurance, plan sponsors, beneficiaries, and other \n     stakeholders, such as individual or institutional health care \n     providers.\n       (D) PPACA creates a new nationwide requirement for health \n     plans to cover ``essential health benefits'' and ``preventive \n     services'' (including a distinct set of ``preventive services \n     for women''), delegating to the Department of Health and \n     Human Services the authority to provide a list of detailed \n     services under each category, and imposes other new \n     requirements with respect to the provision of health care \n     services.\n       (E) While PPACA provides an exemption for some religious \n     groups that object to participation in Government health \n     programs generally, it does not allow purchasers, plan \n     sponsors, and other stakeholders with religious or moral \n     objections to specific items or services to decline providing \n     or obtaining coverage of such items or services, or allow \n     health care providers with such objections to decline to \n     provide them.\n       (F) By creating new barriers to health insurance and \n     causing the loss of existing insurance arrangements, these \n     inflexible mandates in PPACA jeopardize the ability of \n     individuals to exercise their rights of conscience and their \n     ability to freely participate in the health insurance and \n     health care marketplace.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (A) to ensure that health care stakeholders retain the \n     right to provide, purchase, or enroll in health coverage that \n     is consistent with their religious beliefs and moral \n     convictions, without fear of being penalized or discriminated \n     against under PPACA; and\n       (B) to ensure that no requirement in PPACA creates new \n     pressures to exclude those exercising such conscientious \n     objection from health plans or other programs under PPACA.\n       (b) Respect for Rights of Conscience.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 1302(b) of the Patient Protection \n     and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148; 42 U.S.C. \n     18022(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(6) Respecting rights of conscience with regard to \n     specific items or services.--\n       ``(A) For health plans.--A health plan shall not be \n     considered to have failed to provide the essential health \n     benefits package described in subsection (a) (or preventive \n     health services described in section 2713 of the Public \n     Health Service Act), to fail to be a qualified health plan, \n     or to fail to fulfill any other requirement under this title \n     on the basis that it declines to provide coverage of specific \n     items or services because--\n       ``(i) providing coverage (or, in the case of a sponsor of a \n     group health plan, paying for coverage) of such specific \n     items or services is contrary to the religious beliefs or \n     moral convictions of the sponsor, issuer, or other entity \n     offering the plan; or\n       ``(ii) such coverage (in the case of individual coverage) \n     is contrary to the religious beliefs or moral convictions of \n     the purchaser or beneficiary of the coverage.\n       ``(B) For health care providers.--Nothing in this title (or \n     any amendment made by this title) shall be construed to \n     require an individual or institutional health care provider, \n     or authorize a health plan to require a provider, to provide, \n     participate in, or refer for a specific item or service \n     contrary to the provider's religious beliefs or moral \n     convictions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     title, a health plan shall not be considered to have failed \n     to provide timely or other access to items or services under \n     this title (or any amendment made by this title) or to \n     fulfill any other requirement under this title because it has \n     respected the rights of conscience of such a provider \n     pursuant to this paragraph.\n       ``(C) Nondiscrimination in exercising rights of \n     conscience.--No Exchange or other official or entity acting \n     in a governmental capacity in the course of implementing this \n     title (or any amendment made by this title) shall \n     discriminate against a health plan, plan sponsor, health care \n     provider, or other person because of such plan's, sponsor's, \n     provider's, or person's unwillingness to provide coverage of, \n     participate in, or refer for, specific items or services \n     pursuant to this paragraph.\n       ``(D) Construction.--Nothing in subparagraph (A) or (B) \n     shall be construed to permit a health plan or provider to \n     discriminate in a manner inconsistent with subparagraphs (B) \n     and (D) of paragraph (4).\n       ``(E) Private rights of action.--The various protections of \n     conscience in this paragraph constitute the protection of \n     individual rights and create a private cause of action for \n     those persons or entities protected. Any person or entity may \n     assert a violation of this paragraph as a claim or defense in \n     a judicial proceeding.\n       ``(F) Remedies.--\n       ``(i) Federal jurisdiction.--The Federal courts shall have \n     jurisdiction to prevent and redress actual or threatened \n     violations of this paragraph by granting all forms of legal \n     or equitable relief, including, but not limited to, \n     injunctive relief, declaratory relief, damages, costs, and \n     attorney fees.\n       ``(ii) Initiating party.--An action under this paragraph \n     may be instituted by the Attorney General of the United \n     States, or by any person or entity having standing to \n     complain of a threatened or actual violation of this \n     paragraph, including, but not limited to, any actual or \n     prospective plan sponsor, issuer, or other entity offering a \n     plan, any actual or prospective purchaser or beneficiary of a \n     plan, and any individual or institutional health care \n     provider.\n       ``(iii) Interim relief.--Pending final determination of any \n     action under this paragraph, the court may at any time enter \n     such restraining order or prohibitions, or take such other \n     actions, as it deems necessary.\n       ``(G) Administration.--The Office for Civil Rights of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services is designated to \n     receive complaints of discrimination based on this paragraph \n     and coordinate the investigation of such complaints.\n       ``(H) Actuarial equivalence.--Nothing in this paragraph \n     shall prohibit the Secretary from issuing regulations or \n     other guidance to ensure that health plans excluding specific \n     items or services under this paragraph shall have an \n     aggregate actuarial value at least equivalent to that of \n     plans at the same level of coverage that do not exclude such \n     items or services.''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) \n     shall be effective as if included in the enactment of Public \n     Law 111-148.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1974.

Mr. President, the House of Representatives passed a \nbipartisan reauthorization of the Missing Children's Assistance Act \nthat ensures the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children can \ncontinue.\n  We cleared it a week ago here on the Democratic side. I understand \nthat now it has cleared the Republican side.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nH.R. 3092, which was received from the House and is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3902) to amend the Missing Children's \n     Assistance Act, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week, the House of Representatives \noverwhelmingly passed a bipartisan reauthorization of the Missing \nChildren's Assistance Act. This important measure will ensure that the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) can continue \nits critical and lifesaving work on behalf of some of the most \nvulnerable children in our communities. I thank Ranking Member \nGrassley, as well as the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House \nEducation and the Workforce Committee for working with me to develop \nthis bipartisan legislation. The current authorization for NCMEC will \nexpire at the end of the month, so the Senate must take action without \ndelay.\n  While I would have preferred a straightforward reauthorization of \nNCMEC and its programs, I agreed to Ranking Member Grassley's request \nto include several additional auditing provisions, which I had hoped \nwould facilitate the bill's swift passage and enactment. I also agreed \nto several changes suggested by the House, working in a bipartisan \nfashion on this bill which overwhelmingly passed the House of \nRepresentatives and which is pending before the Senate. Despite working \nin a bipartisan way, it has already been more than a week since the \nHouse sent us the reauthorization bill. The Senate has been unable to \npass this measure because of an objection on the Republican side. The \nDemocratic side approved this bill for passage last week.\n  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has served as \na vital national resource for law enforcement and families for nearly \n30 years, and has assisted law enforcement in the recovery of more than \n188,000 missing children. Of the cases reported to NCMEC from 1990-\n2012, 97.8 percent have been resolved. If any Senator has a problem or \nconcern with the reauthorization of this important work, then that \nSenator should come to the floor and voice those concerns publicly. I \nhave heard of no such concerns.\n  So if there are no substantive concerns with reauthorizing the work \nof NCMEC, what are we waiting for? I hope that this reauthorization \nbill is not falling victim to the same political tantrums thrown by \nsome in an effort to remove funding for our citizens' healthcare. \nInstead of playing politics, the Senate should renew its obligation to \ndo everything we can to quickly locate a missing child and to protect \nall our children from being victimized by predators by passing this \nimportant legislation.\n  For nearly 30 years, NCMEC has spearheaded efforts to locate and \nrecover missing children and raise public awareness about how to \nprevent child abduction, molestation, and sexual exploitation. The \nSenate should pass this legislation immediately and not allow the good \nwork of the National Center to be jeopardized.\n  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children addresses the \npainful reality that hundreds of thousands of people go missing or are \nabducted each year. Sadly, children account for more than 40 percent of \nthe FBI's active missing persons cases. The exploitation of children is \nalso a growing problem, particularly in the internet age. Between 2004 \nand 2008, the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Forces reported a \n230 percent increase in the number of documented complaints of online \nenticement of children. Perpetrators utilize new technologies to \ntarget, contact, manipulate, and entice children so the dangers facing \nchildren and their families are greater than ever.\n  In passing the Missing Children's Assistance Act in 1984, Congress \nrecognized the need for national leadership to help address the problem \nof missing and exploited children, and to assist the families of these \nvictims. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children was \ncreated shortly after passage of that legislation, and has led a number \nof efforts to combat child exploitation.\n  NCMEC has created a nationwide, toll free, 24-hour hotline to take \nreports about missing children and clues that might lead to their \nrecovery; a National Child Pornography Tipline to gather reports on the \nsexual exploitation of children through the production and distribution \nof child pornography; and a CyberTipline to process online leads from \nindividuals reporting the sexual exploitation of children. In addition, \nNCMEC has circulated millions of photographs of missing children, and \nserves as a vital resource for law enforcement agencies throughout the \nNation in the search for missing children and in the pursuit of \nadequate child protection.\n  This legislation before us will allow the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children to continue its important role in protecting our \nchildren. We should continue to do everything we can to protect our \nchildren. I am proud to support this bill, which will enable NCMEC to \ncontinue its critical work. I thank my friends on both sides of the \naisle for joining me in this effort, and urge the Senate to take \nimmediate action to pass H.R. 3092, the Missing Children's Assistance \nReauthorization Act.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent the bill be read a third time and \npassed; and the motion to reconsider be\n\n[[Page S6902]]\n\nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3092) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that it now has \npassed.\n  I thank the Republican leader and others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/09/24/senate-section/article/S6902-1", "month": "09", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 2013\n\n  Mr. REID.
