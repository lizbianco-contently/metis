We need to do \nthat because a few years ago we had some madman crash through the House \nside and kill some police officers.\n  We see that things have gotten more difficult since then. We have \npeople standing with automatic weapons. We have bomb squads. We have \ndogs that work with us so well. We have people who are on bicycles. But \nwith the appropriations process coming soon,--I hope--we have to make \nsure we supply the Capitol Police with the tools and materials and \nequipment they need to continue doing their job.\n  Is it inconvenient for people coming here, and for us on occasion? \nThe answer is yes. But they are doing that for us, for the people who \ncome to this complex. I want to acknowledge the good Chaplain.

Mr. President, I had a number of meetings yesterday with \nDemocratic and Republican proponents of the Marketplace Fairness Act. \nThis\n\n[[Page S2910]]\n\nis a piece of legislation that is overwhelmingly supported by Democrats \nand Republicans. I appreciate the remarks of the Presiding Officer \nyesterday on behalf of this legislation.\n  Succinctly, what this legislation would do is level the playing field \nbetween online sellers and brick-and-mortar retailers. As everyone \nknows, we have had a lot of problems with the economy. But in Nevada we \nhave been hit very hard. We led the Nation for 20 years with a vibrant \neconomy. In the last 4 or 5 years it has been difficult. We are doing \nbetter now but we are not doing great. For lack of a better \ndescription, I was going to say it breaks my heart. I am not sure that \nis proper. But I feel very badly when I drive in Reno or Las Vegas and \nsee these little strip malls with ``for lease'' signs. They would not \nbe for lease if they had the ability to compete with these online \nsellers.\n  As indicated yesterday on a number of occasions in presentations I \nheard made, people come to the retailers who pay money for brick and \nmortar. They will find a pair of shoes, they will find a coat they \nlike, or whatever else, and they immediately walk out of there and go \non line and do not pay the sales tax. That prevents that business from \nsucceeding.\n\n  The reason I mention this today, we could finish this legislation \ntoday, on Wednesday, and move on to the other bipartisan legislation. \nWe have a small number of Senators who are holding this up, stalling. \nThis has 50 Democratic votes and at least 25 Republican votes. I know \nmany of my Republican colleagues want to attend--and I think that is \nappropriate; I wish I could--the opening of the Bush Library in Texas. \nUnfortunately, there are Senators who are playing procedural games that \nare going to prevent that from happening. I do not say this often. \nThere is no chance they can prevail. We have three States basically \nholding up this legislation. For people to talk, you are coercing us to \ndo something. We are coercing those States to do nothing. Zero. \nNothing. We are just trying to make the playing field level.\n  So I want everyone to understand, just a handful of Senators is \npreventing us from doing our work. We are going to finish this \nlegislation this week. I know this sounds like me crying wolf, but this \nmay be the time the wolf is really coming.\n  We have a bipartisan bill we have to move to next work period. It is \nthe WRDA, Water Resources Development Act, supported by one of the most \nliberal Members of this Senate, Barbara Boxer, and one of the most \nconservative Members, Senator Vitter. They have worked out a bill. It \nhas been reported out of their committee. It is on the calendar right \nnow. We are going to move to that.\n  In addition to that, we have another bipartisan bill in the wings \ncoming out, the agriculture bill. We need to complete those bills next \nwork period, because we have to get to immigration. So everyone \nunderstand, this is not crying wolf. We are going to finish this bill.\n  I spoke yesterday to Senator Enzi who has worked on this bill for 11 \nyears. I spoke to my good friend--and certainly Mike Enzi is my good \nfriend; I do not mean to choose favorites here--Lamar Alexander. They \nboth said we have got to finish this bill this week. We are going to do \nthat. When I have requests from Dick Durbin and my Republican friends \nto move forward on this bill, we are going to move forward on it. If we \nhave to be here Friday and Saturday, I am telling everybody we are \ngoing to finish this bill.\n  We have a 3-week work period next time. We have to jam in WRDA and \nhopefully the ag bill so we can move before July 4 and finish the \nimmigration bill which is going to take up quite a bit of time. We have \ntoo much to do when we return from our in-State work period.\n  I have a lot to do. I have a conference. I am going to do some things \nthere with Eric Cantor. We do not do things together very often, but we \nare going to talk about some issues people want to talk about. I want \nto be able to do that. It is not here in Washington. If I have to put \nthat off, it would be a shame for me and Eric Cantor, and I think the \npeople putting on the conference. But if that is what it takes, that is \nwhat it takes. I want to go home. So we are going to finish this bill.\n  I am going to read an editorial from one of the world's leading \nnewspapers. It says, ``Budget Cuts, Minus the Inconvenience.'' \nHeadline: Republicans encourage a sequester affecting the poor, but \nthey are furious about travel delays.\n  Here is what it says. I am not editorializing, I am just telling you \nwhat they put in this newspaper editorial today.\n\n       On Monday, after the sequester cuts forced the Federal \n     Aviation Administration to begin furloughs for air traffic \n     controllers, delays began to build up at airports around the \n     country. Travelers had to wait, but nothing delayed \n     Republicans from scurrying away from all responsibility. \n     Speaker John Boehner started using the Twitter hashtag \n     #ObamaFlightDelays, the latest effort in his party's campaign \n     to blame all the pain of the sequester on the Obama \n     administration while claiming all the credit for its effect \n     on reducing the deficit.\n       ``Why is President Obama unnecessarily delaying your \n     flight?'' Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, wrote in a \n     message on Twitter. If the President wanted to, Republicans \n     said, he could easily cut somewhere else and spare travelers \n     any inconvenience.\n       As it happens, the sequester law is clear in requiring the \n     F.A.A. and most other agencies to cut their programs by an \n     even amount. That law was foisted on the public after \n     Republicans demanded spending cuts in exchange for raising \n     the debt ceiling in 2012. Since then, the party has rejected \n     every offer to replace the sequester with a more sensible mix \n     of cuts and revenue increases. Mr. Boehner is so proud of \n     that strategy that he recently congratulated his party for \n     sticking with the sequester and standing up to the \n     president's demand for tax increases.\n       But drastic cuts in spending carry a heavy price. \n     Republicans certainly don't want voters they care about--\n     including business travelers and those who can afford to fly \n     on vacation--to feel it. They continue to claim that the $85 \n     billion in this year's sequester can be covered by \n     eliminating waste, fraud, consultants, and the inevitable \n     grant to some obscure science or art project. And of course \n     to programs for the poor.\n       You don't see any Republican hashtags blaming the president \n     for cutting housing vouchers to 140,000 low-income families, \n     which has begun. These vouchers are given by cities to \n     families on the brink of homelessness, and about half of them \n     go to families with children.\n       There aren't any tweets about the 70,000 Head Start slots \n     about to be eliminated, which is forcing some school \n     districts to distribute these valuable services by lottery.\n\n  This is not the editorial. The Presiding Officer's colleague, Senator \nRockefeller--a wealthy man with this great name--as a young man went to \nWest Virginia and fell in love with the poor because he was a VISTA \nvolunteer, and he never left. He is now here in the Senate.\n  Let's get to the editorial. I am sorry about that.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Or about the cuts to Vista [Volunteers in Service to \n     America], which is hurting the program that performs \n     antipoverty work in many States. Or the 11 percent cut in \n     unemployment benefits for millions of jobless workers.\n       The voiceless people who are the most affected by these \n     cuts can't afford high-priced lobbyists to get them an \n     exception to the sequester, the way that the agriculture \n     lobby was able to fend off a furlough to meat inspectors, \n     which might have disrupted beef and poultry operations. And \n     what was cut in order to keep those inspectors on the job? \n     About $25 million from a program to provide free school \n     breakfasts.\n       As bad as the sequester was, it was being made worse by \n     these special-interest demands for exceptions, as well as \n     politically motivated attempts to deflect the responsibility \n     for pain.\n       The maneuvering shows the futility of trying to reduce the \n     deficit with crude and arbitrary cuts. Both Senate Democrats \n     and the White House have proposed budget plans that replace \n     the sequester with a much better mix of spending cuts and \n     revenue increases.\n       On Tuesday, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, \n     proposed replacing the sequester for 5 months with unspent \n     money from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n  This is what one of America's major newspapers said today that \nmillions of people will have the opportunity to read.\n  The sequester was designed as a tool to bring Democrats and \nRepublicans together to reduce the deficit in a responsible way. By now \nwe can all see that didn't work, and we can see that sequester's costs \nfar outweigh the savings.\n  As indicated in this editorial, these across-the-board cuts would \ncost, this year, 750,000 jobs--three-quarters of a million jobs. They \nwill cost us investments in education that keep America competitive. \nThey will cost millions of\n\n[[Page S2911]]\n\nseniors, children, veterans, and needy families the safety net that \nkeeps them from descending into poverty.\n  Most of the headlines are focused on the hours the sequester has cost \ntravelers in airports across the Nation. The frustration and the \neconomic effects of those delays should not be minimized.\n  The sequester could also cost this country, and humankind, a cure for \nAIDS, Parkinson's disease, or cancer. These arbitrary cuts have \ndecimated funding for medical researchers seeking cures for diabetes, \nepilepsy, and hundreds of other dangerous and debilitating diseases.\n  The National Institutes of Health has delayed or halted vital \nscientific projects and reduced the number of grants it awards to \nresearch scientists. Thousands of research scientists will lose their \njobs in the next few months. Research projects that can't go on without \nadequate staffing will be cancelled altogether. Ohio State University, \nwhich is known for more than a good football and basketball team, is \nalso one of the premier research centers in America. Grants for cancer \nresearch and infectious disease control have been axed. They are over. \nAt the University of Cincinnati, which is at the forefront in research \non strokes--a leading cause of death in the United States--scientists \nare bracing for some more cuts. Vanderbilt University and the \nUniversity of Kentucky are accepting fewer science graduate students \nbecause of funding reductions. At Wright State University, scientists \nresearching pregnancy-related disorders, such as preeclampsia, will \nlose their jobs. Boston University has laid off lab scientists, and \nresearch laboratories in San Francisco have instituted hiring freezes \nand delayed the launch of important studies. Grants to some of Harvard \nUniversity's most successful research scientists were not renewed \nbecause of the sequester.\n  The research I have talked about today--and these are only a few of \nthem--saves lives and saves misery. These scientists are looking for \nthe next successful treatment for Alzheimer's or the next drug to treat \nhigh cholesterol. They might never get the chance to complete their \ngroundbreaking work or make their lifesaving discoveries because of \nthese shortsighted cuts.\n  We have seen the devastating impacts of these arbitrary budget cuts. \nNow it is time to stop them.\n  Be prepared, everybody--the House is now working on another bill \nbecause we have the debt ceiling coming soon. They are working on \nanother bill to make it even more painful for the American people.\n  Last night I introduced a bill that would roll back the sequester for \nthe rest of the year, and just like the editorial indicated, it is \nsomething we should do. The bill would give Democrats and Republicans \ntime to sit down at the negotiating table and work out an agreement to \nreduce the deficit in a balanced way. It wouldn't add a penny to the \ndeficit. It would use the savings from winding down the wars in \nAfghanistan and Iraq to prevent cuts that will harm our national \nsecurity and our economy.\n  Before the Republicans dismiss these savings, they should recall that \n235 Republicans voted to use these funds to pay for the Ryan Republican \nbudget. They didn't consider it a gimmick when it served their own \npurposes.\n  We can stop the flight delays and the pink slips. We can stop the \ndevastating cuts to programs that protect low-income children, \nhomebound seniors, and homeless veterans. We can stop the cuts to \ncrucial medical research. But Democrats can't do it without \nRepublicans' help.\n  Republicans overwhelmingly voted for these painful, arbitrary cuts, \nand Republicans bear responsibility for their consequences. Remember, \nthese cuts came about because of the debt ceiling they refused to move \non until these devastating cuts came about, and Republicans bear \nresponsibility for the consequences, from travel delays to cuts to \nvital programs. Now Republicans must accept that they have an \nobligation to cooperate with us to help stop these Draconian cuts and \nmitigate the consequences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/24/senate-section/article/S2911-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, something really remarkable happened in \nthe Senate last night. It was sort of late in the day, so for those who \nmissed it, here is a little recap.\n  Late yesterday afternoon the majority leader handed us a hastily \ncrafted bill and then asked if we could pass it before anybody had seen \nit. Apparently, someone on the other side realized they had no good \nexplanation for why they hadn't prevented the delays we have seen at \nairports across the country this week, so they threw together a bill in \na feeble attempt to cover for it. It is pretty embarrassing.\n  It actually proposes to replace the President's sequester cuts with \nwhat is known around here as OCO. I know this isn't something that will \nbe familiar to most viewers, so let me borrow an explanation provided \nby Senator Joe Lieberman in a letter he signed with Dr. Coburn last \nyear. Here is what Senator Lieberman said about OCO:\n\n       The funds allocated for OCO or ``war savings'' are not \n     real, and every member of Congress knows this. The funds \n     specified for Overseas Contingency Operations in future \n     budgets are mere estimates of what our nation's wars cost may \n     be in the future. And since it is likely that future OCO \n     costs will be significantly less than the placeholders in the \n     Congressional Budget Office's estimates, it is the height of \n     fiscal irresponsibility to treat the difference between the \n     assumed and actual OCO costs as a ``savings'' to be spent on \n     other programs.\n\n  Let me read that last part again.\n\n       It is the height of fiscal irresponsibility to treat the \n     difference between the assumed and actual OCO costs as a \n     ``savings'' to be spent on other programs.\n\n  This is from the man who was once the Democratic nominee to be Vice \nPresident.\n  There is bipartisan consensus that this thing we call OCO is a \nfiscally irresponsible gimmick. The director of the Concord Coalition \nhas called it ``the mother of all . . . gimmicks.'' The president of \nthe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget called it a ``glaring \ngimmick.'' Whether OCO is the mother of all gimmicks or just a glaring \none, everybody other than the majority leader evidently agrees on one \nthing: It is the height of fiscal irresponsibility.\n  Now, just as important as what the majority leader's proposal is, \nhowever, is what it isn't. It isn't a tax increase. That is actually \nnews. The majority leader is clearly ditching the President on this \nissue. As you may recall, the President has said he would only consider \nreplacing the sequester with a tax hike. Whatever you want to say about \nOCO, it is not a tax hike--it is borrowed money that will have to be \nrepaid later.\n  Still, it doesn't punish small businesses the way the President's \nproposals would. So this is, in a sense, big news. It represents a \nsignificant break from the President's favored approach on this issue.\n  As I said yesterday, the President rejected the flexibility we \nproposed on the sequester for obvious political reasons. He wanted \nthese cuts to be as painful as possible for folks across the country \nand to provide an excuse to raise taxes to turn them off. Well, it is \nsimply not working. Even his own party is starting to abandon him on \nthis issue.\n  The broader point is this: Even without the flexibility we propose, \nhe already has the flexibility he needs to make these cuts less \npainful. He has it right now. He should exercise it.\n  I also think we should all acknowledge that there is now a bipartisan \nagreement that tax hikes won't be a replacement for the sequester. The \nreal solution, as I said, is for the administration to accept the \nadditional flexibility we would like to give them to make these cuts in \na smarter way and to get rid of wasteful spending first.\n  Surely, in the $3.6 trillion we are spending this year, we could find \na way to reduce the spending we promised the\n\n[[Page S2912]]\n\nAmerican people we would reduce a year and a half ago when the Budget \nControl Act was passed and do that in a sensible way. This is what we \nhave consistently said. There is more flexibility in the law right now. \nWe would be happy to give the President even more to achieve the cuts \nwe promised the American people we would achieve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Remember, Congressman Ryan, when he came up with one of \nthese budgets, used these overseas contingency funds to balance his \nbudget.\n  Let's not even worry about that for purposes of this conversation, \nthe overseas contingency fund. Let's just talk about the war in \nAfghanistan. What my friend is saying is that it is OK to borrow money \nfor the war in Afghanistan but not to use that same money to reduce \npains being felt all over America today.\n  Even Joe Scarborough on ``Morning Joe,'' a former Republican \nCongressman from Florida, said today that he can't believe that the \npain is being felt all over America today and no one is concerned about \nthe war in Afghanistan.\n  Does anyone think we are going to be fighting a war in Afghanistan 5 \nyears from now, 10 years from now? That is the money people are trying \nto protect. I hope not. For the sake of my children and grandchildren, \nI hope we are not still fighting in Afghanistan 5 or 10 years from now.\n  We are asking to take a few dollars of the $650 billion that is \nthere--billion dollars--to relieve the pain we are feeling now for 5 \nmonths. That is it.\n  I think it is really unfair that it would be so easy to turn the \nsequester around and allow us to do something for a long term to take \ncare of this issue, but, no, the Republicans like the pain.\n  One Republican Senator who came here last night said: Well, why don't \nwe take the money from the construction fund for airports?\n  Those create jobs.\n  He said: Why don't we take it from essential air services?\n  That dog has been here and fought lots of times. That has been \nstripped bare.\n  As I indicated in my opening statement, this is supposed to be fair \nand equal. You can't jimmy things around. It is the same amount of \nmoney. The Republicans say: Well, it is the same amount of money, but \ngive more pain to somebody else than the other; just balance it out. \nThe pain is too severe; it can't be balanced out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/24/senate-section/article/S2912-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp).

Madam President, I rise as a member of both the Senate \nAppropriations Committee on Transportation and as a member of the \nSenate Commerce Committee to discuss what I believe is a shocking \ndisplay of mismanagement and incompetence by the leadership of the \nDepartment of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration says the sequester will result in \nas many as 6,700 delays per day. To put this in context, on the worst \nweather day in 2012, we had 2,900 flight delays. So the FAA's projected \n6,700 delays per day would more than double the worst day in 2012.\n  To me, this is disturbing evidence of the lack of planning on the \npart of both the Department of Transportation and the FAA, leading up \nto what we all knew was going to take place--in fact, since the law was \nsigned by the President. We have known for 1 year this may happen. The \nPresident signed it into law, and we are now many months down the line \nand suddenly the FAA came along just a few days ago and said: Oh, we \njust need to let you know, by the way, we are going to implement this \npart of the sequestration.\n  This across-the-board furlough is especially surprising given the \nprevious announcements their guiding principle when implementing \nsequestration would be to enact a plan that ``maintains safety and \nminimizes the impact to the highest number of travelers.'' Announcing 3 \ndays or so before they implement this plan that potentially results in \nas many as 6,700 delays per day minimizes the impact of the highest \nnumber of travelers?\n  This is disingenuous. It is mismanagement at its worst. It is \nincompetence at its worst. It is a failure to do what every agency has \nbeen required to do; that is, plan for this. Now that it has been in \nlaw for several months, there is no excuse for simply saying: Oh, we \ndidn't have time to put this in place, so this is what we are going to \ndo.\n  I voted against sequestration because it treats every Federal program \non an equal basis regardless of its necessity, its effectiveness, or \nwhether it is an essential function of the Federal Government.\n  Clearly, keeping our skies safe and getting our passengers from point \nA to point B is an essential function. We need those air traffic \ncontrollers. The plan that was put forth by the FAA flies in the face \nof their own judgment and their own statements in terms of what they \nneeded to do.\n  Instead of furloughing 47,000 employees and causing significant \ndelays for travelers, they should have been seeking reductions \nelsewhere. We tried to give these essential agencies additional \nflexibility necessary to do so. Unfortunately, the President did not \nsupport that effort, and the majority party in the Senate did not \nsupport that effort. Therefore, they have no reason to point their \nfingers over here and say: Oh, sequestration is so terrible. We never \nshould have been in this position in the first place.\n  The FAA, for the record, could have considered cutting back on the \n$541 million it spends on consultants--in other words, those who have \nbeen hired to work at the FAA because the FAA can't do the job \nthemselves, so they need to spend $541 million to hire outside \nconsultants--and the $2.7 billion it spends on non-personnel costs. But \ninstead of looking at how to better manage their own administration, \nthey turned to furloughing up to 10 percent of the air traffic \ncontrollers, creating up to 6,700 delays per day on the traveling \npublic.\n  Then they say they haven't had time to work this out. Haven't had \ntime? They have had months' worth of time since the law was signed. How \nabout the time people now wasted standing at airports for 3 and 4 hours \nwaiting to board their plane and the overall disruption this causes? \nAnd this is in good weather. That in itself is a lame excuse the FAA \nhas put forward.\n  I did not vote for the sequestration, as I said before. I thought it \nwas an inadequate way to deal with the necessary need to cut spending \nhere. But the Federal Government says: We would like to do that, but we \ncan't afford to do that right now and still focus on the essential \nservices and give them the opportunity to manage that. Clearly, the FAA \nand the Department of Transportation have not managed this well at all. \nThis is incompetence.\n  As I mentioned, Congress was only informed just days ahead of the \ntime of these furloughs. This decision kicked in to the surprise of the \nairlines and to the surprise of Congress. But clearly what we have \nlearned, despite 1 year of advance warning and refusals to analyze all \npossible alternatives to minimize impacts to the traveling public--and \nit is hard to come to any other conclusion--is this is a politically \nmotivated decision to inflict as much pain on Americans as possible in \nan effort to make the case that sequestration never should have taken \nplace in the first place; that a 4-percent across-the-board cut to the \nFAA budget is simply something they can't manage. In other words, we \nwould have asked the FAA to do what they did in 2010 with the money \nthat was allocated to them, but they can't do that now. This is 2012-\n2013 and they need this extra money and they need these hundreds of \nbillions of dollars to continue to hire consultants. They don't want to \nbe asked to make the kinds of decisions every\n\n[[Page S2913]]\n\nbusiness in this country has had to make over the last 4 or 5 years \nduring the malaise of economic growth following the recession that has \ntaken place. We shouldn't ask them to do what every family has had to \ndo? Their thinking is: We are the Federal Government. How dare you \nimpose a 4-percent cut on what we do. We need to increase that every \nyear because we need to keep hiring more and paying more consultants. \nWe are not capable of managing.\n  It is shocking. I hope the President understands if he wants \neffective, efficient government, he is going to have to hire effective, \nefficient management. He is going to have to give them the instructions \nto do what every business in America has had to do during this \ndifficult economy and slow economic growth.\n  I think we should take a very close look at the kinds of decisions \nthat have been made at the Department of Transportation, the lack of \ncompetent management, and the mismanagement of taxpayer money. This \nadministration needs to step up to the plate and be accountable. The \nPresident, as I said, created and signed into law the sequestration \npolicy. His administration has known for more than 12 months this \npolicy was imminent and they have done nothing to prepare for it \neffectively.\n  Our country is a long way from getting our spending under control, so \nit is time the administration stops looking for excuses and starts \nmanaging its budget effectively.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hoeven pertaining to the introduction of S. 794 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate is in a period of morning business.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I will be speaking shortly on matters of \nimmigration. I just wanted to report to the Senate that since February \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee has held six hearings on immigration. We \nconcluded the last one yesterday with the testimony of Secretary Janet \nNapolitano.\n  In all, we have had dozens of hearings on immigration in the last \ncouple of years, but these six were especially important for the Senate \nand for our work in the Judiciary Committee. Tomorrow we will put the \nimmigration bill on the Judiciary Committee's agenda.\n  Under our normal practice, I have consulted with the ranking member. \nWe both agree. The bill would be held over until the first Thursday we \ncome back from our early May recess. This actually works well because \nit will give all members of the committee, and those Senators not on \nthe committee, more time to read it.\n  Once we start marking up the bill and voting on it in committee, it \nwould be my intention to not go Thursday to Thursday, which is normal \ncommittee procedure, but to hold markups several days a week. I am told \nthat people do not intend to delay this immigration bill for the sake \nof delay, and I hope that is so. This is too important an issue.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, to go back, earlier this morning I spoke \nof the immigration hearings we have held in the Judiciary Committee and \nhow important they are, not only to the Senate but to the country.\n  It was an extraordinary series of hearings. Forty-two witnesses spoke \nabout the need for meaningful immigration reform. I believe there is a \nchance to have real immigration reform this year, the kind of reform \nthat our great and wonderful country deserves. This is a country where \nevery one of us is a child, grandchild, or great grandchild of \nimmigrants; a country where a large percentage of the major Fortune 500 \ncompanies were started by immigrants.\n  We heard from ``Dreamers'' and farmers, business people, religious \nleaders, economists, government officials, practitioners, law \nenforcement advocates, and others. We heard from those opposed to \ncomprehensive immigration reform, and we heard from those who support \nit.\n  Since the bipartisan legislation was introduced a week ago, we held 3 \ndays of hearings with live testimony from 26 witnesses. I have \naccommodated many member requests. I worked with ranking member Chuck \nGrassley to ensure that all viewpoints were heard. In fact, no witness \nhe suggested was denied the opportunity to appear and testify. I think \nwe all realize--whether Republican or Democrat--no matter how we may \nvote, we should have a clear record.\n  I asked Secretary Napolitano to return to testify, again, even though \nshe just did so in February. She was scheduled last week. But with the \nhorrific circumstances in Boston, of course we all understood why she \nhad to cancel that appearance. She came yesterday and answered every \nsingle question asked of her.\n  As I said earlier, when we meet tomorrow the right will be exercised \nunder our committee rules to hold over the immigration reform bill for \na week. I have discussed this with Senator Grassley, and I think we \nboth agree that this is a wise thing to do, to hold it over and give \npeople that extra time to read the bill. Next week is a recess week, so \nwe will be able to turn to marking up the legislation in May. By that \npoint, the bill will have been publicly available for three weeks \nbefore we vote on any aspect of it or consider any amendments offered \nto it. Everybody will have had a chance to see it. We live-streamed all \nthe hearings. All of this is on the Judiciary Committee Web site.\n  The legislative proposal we are examining is a result of the \nsignificant work on a bipartisan compromise. I do not want to see \ncomprehensive immigration reform fall victim to entrenched or partisan \nopposition even though it may well exist. In the course of my hearings \nI quoted my dear friend of many years, Ted Kennedy, one of the lions in \nthis body. In the summer of 2007, he and I had worked very closely with \nformer President George W. Bush to pass comprehensive immigration \nlegislation. But that immigration reform was being blocked in the \nSenate. He spoke of our disappointment. He said:\n\n       But we are in this struggle for the long haul. Today's \n     defeat will not stand. As we continue the battle, we will \n     have ample inspiration in the lives of the immigrants all \n     around us.\n       From Jamestown, to the Pilgrims, to the Irish, to today's \n     workers, people have come to this country in search of \n     opportunity. They have sought nothing more than a chance to \n     work hard and bring a better life to themselves and their \n     families. They come to our country with their hearts and \n     minds full of hope.\n\n  I urge all Senators to consider the recent testimony of Jose Antonio \nVargas, Gaby Pacheco, and the families who can be made more secure by \nenacting comprehensive immigration reform.\n  The dysfunction in our current immigration system affects all of us. \nI hope that our history and our decency can inspire us finally to take \naction to reform our immigration laws. I know this is something my \nmaternal grandparents, who were so proud to come to this country, \nspeaking a different language, beginning a business, raising a family, \nseeing their grandson become a Member of the Senate, I know that is the \nway they would feel.\n  I know my wife's parents, who came to this country speaking a \ndifferent language, having their children here in the United States and \nhaving stood with Marcelle and me and my parents when I was sworn into \nthe Senate, and then watching these children and grandchildren, \nunderstand what a wonderful country this is.\n\n[[Page S2914]]\n\n  We are a great and good country. But we are also a country that \nbecomes greater and better because of the diversity brought to our \nshores. That is true from the beginning of this country to today. Let's \nmake it possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/24/senate-section/article/S2914-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, just last month Senate Republicans \nfilibustered the nomination of Caitlin Halligan to fill a vacancy on \nthe D.C. Circuit that arose when Chief Justice Roberts left the D.C. \nCircuit to join the Supreme Court 8 years ago. Caitlin Halligan is a \nwoman who is extraordinarily well-qualified and amongst the most \nqualified judicial nominees I have seen from any administration. The \nsmearing of her distinguished record of service was deeply \ndisappointing.\n  Senate Republicans blocked an up-or-down vote on her confirmation \nwith multiple filibusters of her nomination and procedural objections \nthat required her to be nominated five times over the last 3 years. To \ndo so they turned upside down the standard they had used and urged upon \nthe Senate for nominees of Republican Presidents. In those days they \nproclaimed that everything President Bush's controversial nominees had \ndone in their legal careers should be viewed as merely legal \nrepresentation of clients. They abandoned that standard with the \nHalligan nomination and contorted her legal representation of the State \nof New York into what they contended was judicial activism. It was not \njust disappointing but fundamentally unfair to a public servant and \nwell qualified nominee.\n  Also disconcerting were the comments and tweets by Republican \nSenators after their filibuster in which they gloated about payback. \nThat, too, is wrong. It does our Nation and our Federal judiciary no \ngood when they place their desire to engage in partisan tit-for-tat \nover the needs of the American people. I rejected that approach while \nmoving to confirm 100 of President Bush's judicial nominees in just 17 \nmonths in 2001 and 2002.\n  Had Caitlin Halligan received an up-or-down vote, I am certain she \nwould have been confirmed and been an outstanding judge on the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Instead, \nall Senate Republicans but one supported the filibuster and refused to \nvote up or down on this highly-qualified woman to fill a needed \njudgeship on the D.C. Circuit. Now that Senate Republicans have during \nthe last 4 years filibustered more of President Obama's moderate \njudicial nominees than were filibustered during President Bush's entire \n8 years--67 percent more--I urge them to cease their practice of \nsacrificing outstanding judges based on their misguided sense of \npartisan payback.\n  Regrettably, however, Senator Republicans are expanding their efforts \nthrough a ``wholesale filibuster'' of nominations to the D.C. Circuit \nby introducing a legislative proposal to strip three judgeships from \nthe D.C. Circuit. I am tempted to suggest that they amend their bill to \nmake it effective whenever the next Republican President is elected. I \nsay that to point out that they had no concerns with supporting \nPresident Bush's four Senate-confirmed nominees to the D.C. Circuit. \nThose nominees filled the very vacancies for the ninth, tenth, and even \nthe eleventh judgeship on the court that Senate Republicans are \ndemanding be eliminated now that President Obama has been reelected by \nthe American people. The target of this legislation seems apparent when \nits sponsors emphasize that it is designed to take effect immediately \nand acknowledge that ``[h]istorically, legislation introduced in the \nSenate altering the number of judgeships has most often postponed \nenactment until the beginning of the next President's term'' but that \ntheir legislation ``does not do this.'' It is just another of their \nconcerted efforts to block this President from appointing judges to the \nD.C. Circuit.\n  In its April 5, 2013 letter, the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates, chaired by Chief Justice John Roberts, sent us recommendations \n``based on our current caseload needs.'' They did not recommend \nstripping judgeships from the D.C. Circuit but state that they should \ncontinue at 11. Four are currently vacant. According to the \nAdministrative Office of U.S. Courts, the caseload per active judge for \nthe D.C. Circuit has actually increased by 50 percent since 2005, when \nthe Senate confirmed President Bush's nominee to fill the eleventh seat \non the D.C. Circuit. When the Senate confirmed Thomas Griffith--\nPresident Bush's nominee to the eleventh seat in 2005--the confirmation \nresulted in there being approximately 119 pending cases per active D.C. \nCircuit judge. There are currently 188 pending cases for each active \njudge on the D.C. Circuit, more than 50 percent higher.\n  Senate Republicans also seek to misuse caseload numbers. The D.C. \nCircuit Court of Appeals is often considered ``the second most \nimportant court in the land'' because of its special jurisdiction and \nbecause of the important and complex cases that it decides. The Court \nreviews complicated decisions and rulemaking of many Federal agencies, \nand in recent years has handled some of the most important terrorism \nand enemy combatant and detention cases since the attacks of September \n11. These cases make incredible demands on the time of the judges \nserving on this Court. It is misleading to cite statistics or contend \nthat hardworking judges have a light or easy workload. All cases are \nnot the same and many of the hardest, most complex and most time-\nconsuming cases in the Nation end up at the D.C. Circuit.\n  Today's nominee is fortunate to be from Iowa and nominated to a \nvacancy on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. I fully support \nconfirming her and commend Senator Harkin for recommending her to the \nPresident and Senator Grassley for also supporting her confirmation. \nThe confirmation to fill a vacancy on the Eighth Circuit also \ndemonstrates that the caseload argument that Senate Republicans sought \nto use as justification for their unfair filibuster of Caitlin Halligan \nwas one of convenience rather than conviction. With the confirmation \ntoday, the Eighth Circuit will have the lowest number of pending \nappeals per active judge of any circuit in the country. Yes, lower than \nthe D.C. Circuit. The sponsors of the partisan bill directed as a \nwholesale filibuster of the D.C. Circuit do not propose the Eighth \nCircuit, which covers Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, \nNorth Dakota and South Dakota, be stripped of any judgeships.\n  Although they unnecessarily delayed the confirmation from last year \nto this year of Judge Bacharach of Oklahoma to the Tenth Circuit, \nSenate Republicans all voted in favor of confirming him. They did not \nobject, vote against, filibuster or seek to strip that circuit of \njudgeships even though its caseload per judge is 139, well below that \nof the D.C. Circuit.\n  This Iowa nominee has also proven the exception to the practice of \nRepublicans of holding up confirmations of circuit nominees with no \nreason for months. The Senate is being allowed to\n\n[[Page S2915]]\n\nproceed to her confirmation barely a month after it was reported by the \nJudiciary Committee. I would like to think that this signals a new \nwillingness to abandon their delaying tactics but fear that it is an \nexception. To expedite this nomination meant skipping over a number of \nnominees, including some who have been waiting since last year for the \nSenate to vote on their confirmations.\n  President Obama's other circuit court nominees have faced filibusters \nand unprecedented levels of obstruction. Senate Republicans used to \ninsist that the filibustering of judicial nominations was \nunconstitutional. The Constitution has not changed, but as soon as \nPresident Obama was elected they reversed course and filibustered \nPresident Obama's very first judicial nomination. Judge David Hamilton \nof Indiana was a widely-respected 15-year veteran of the Federal bench \nnominated to the Seventh Circuit and was supported by Senator Dick \nLugar, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate. They delayed his \nconfirmation for 7 months. Senate Republicans then proceeded to \nobstruct and delay just about every circuit court nominee of this \nPresident, filibustering 10 of them. They delayed confirmation of Judge \nPatty Shwartz of New Jersey to the Third Circuit for 13 months. They \ndelayed confirmation of Judge Richard Taranto to the Federal Circuit \nfor 12 months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Albert Diaz of North \nCarolina to the Fourth Circuit for 11 months. They delayed confirmation \nof Judge Jane Stranch of Tennessee to the Sixth Circuit and Judge \nWilliam Kayatta to the First Circuit for 10 months. They delayed \nconfirmation of Judge Robert Bacharach of Oklahoma to the Tenth Circuit \nfor 8 months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Ray Lohier of New York \nto the Second Circuit for seven months. They delayed confirmation of \nJudge Scott Matheson of Utah to the Tenth Circuit and Judge James Wynn, \nJr. of North Carolina to the Fourth Circuit for 6 months. They delayed \nconfirmation of Judge Andre Davis of Maryland to the Fourth Circuit, \nJudge Henry Floyd of South Carolina to the Fourth Circuit, Judge \nStephanie Thacker of West Virginia to the Fourth Circuit, and Judge \nJacqueline Nguyen of California to the Ninth Circuit for 5 months. They \ndelayed confirmation of Judge Adalberto Jordan of Florida to the \nEleventh Circuit, Judge Beverly Martin of Georgia to the Eleventh \nCircuit, Judge Mary Murguia of Arizona to the Ninth Circuit, Judge \nBernice Donald of Tennessee to the Sixth Circuit, Judge Barbara Keenan \nof Virginia to the Fourth Circuit, Judge Thomas Vanaskie of \nPennsylvania to the Third Circuit, Judge Joseph Greenaway of New Jersey \nto the Third Circuit, Judge Denny Chin of New York to the Second \nCircuit, and Judge Chris Droney of Connecticut to the Second Circuit \nfor 4 months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Paul Watford of \nCalifornia to the Ninth Circuit, Judge Andrew Hurwitz of Arizona to the \nNinth Circuit, Judge Morgan Christen of Alaska to the Ninth Circuit, \nJudge Stephen Higginson of Louisiana to the Fifth Circuit, Judge Gerard \nLynch of New York to the Second Circuit, Judge Susan Carney of \nConnecticut to the Second Circuit, and Judge Kathleen O'Malley of Ohio \nto the Federal Circuit for 3 months.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has reported that the \nmedian time circuit nominees have had to wait before a Senate vote has \nskyrocketed from 18 days for President Bush's nominees to 132 days for \nPresident Obama's. This is the result of Republican obstruction. So \nwhile it is good that they have allowed this vote on Jane Kelly from \nIowa, if it proves an exception rather than a change in their tactics \nof obstruction, we will recognize it for what it is. Senate Republicans \nhave a long way to go to match the record of cooperation on consensus \nnominees that Senate Democrats established during the Bush \nadministration.\n  Delay has been most extensive with respect to circuit court nominees \nbut not limited to them. Consensus district court nominees are also \nbeing needlessly delayed. During President Bush's first term alone, 57 \ndistrict nominees were confirmed within just 1 week of being reported. \nBy contrast, during his first 4 years only two of President Obama's \ndistrict nominees have been confirmed within a week of being reported \nby the Committee.\n  Just before the Thanksgiving recess in 2009, when Senator Sessions of \nAlabama was the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, we were \nable to get Republican agreement to confirm Judge Abdul Kallon, a \nnominee from Alabama, and Judge Christina Reiss, our Chief Judge for \nthe Federal District Court for the District of Vermont. They had their \nhearing on November 4, were voted on by the Judiciary Committee two \nweeks later on November 19, and were confirmed by the Senate on \nNovember 21. They were not stalled on the Senate Executive Calendar \nwithout a vote for weeks and months. They were confirmed two days after \nthe vote by the Judiciary Committee. That should be the standard we \nfollow, not the exception. It should not take being from the ranking \nRepublican's home State to be promptly confirmed as a noncontroversial \njudicial nominee.\n  The obstruction of President Obama's nominees by Senate Republicans \nhas contributed to the damagingly high level of judicial vacancies that \nhas persisted for over 4 years. Persistent vacancies force fewer judges \nto take on growing caseloads, and make it harder for Americans to have \naccess to speedy justice. While Senate Republicans delayed and \nobstructed, the number of judicial vacancies remained historically high \nand it has become more difficult for our courts to provide speedy, \nquality justice for the American people. There are today 83 judicial \nvacancies across the country. By way of contrast, that is nearly double \nthe number of vacancies that existed at this point in the Bush \nadministration. The circuit and district judges that we have been able \nto confirm over the last four years fall 20 short of the total for this \npoint in President Bush's second term.\n  There should be no doubt that these delays, and the vacancies they \nprolong, have a real impact on the American people. Last week, the \npresident of the American Bar Association wrote in The Hill that:\n\n       Real costs are often borne by businesses whose viability \n     relies on the timely resolution of commercial disputes, by \n     defendants who lose jobs and sometimes family ties while \n     languishing behind bars awaiting trial, and, ultimately, the \n     public that expects courts to deliver on the promise of \n     justice for all. Our economy depends on courts to enforce \n     contracts, protect property and determine liability. Judicial \n     vacancies increase caseloads per judge, creating delays that \n     jeopardize the ability of courts to expeditiously deliver \n     judgments. Delay translates into costs for litigants. Delay \n     results in uncertainty that discourages growth and \n     investment.\n\n  She concluded that ``vacancies are potential job-killers.'' I ask \nunanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  Today the Senate will vote on the nomination of Jane Kelly to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. She has a distinguished \ncareer in the Federal Defender's Office, first as an assistant federal \npublic defender and then as a supervising attorney. In addition to \nworking in the Federal Defender's Office, Jane Kelly has also served as \na visiting instructor at the University of Illinois College of Law and \ntaught at the University of Iowa College of Law. After law school, she \nserved as a law clerk to two Federal judges: the Honorable Donald J. \nPorter of the U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota and \nthe Honorable David R. Hansen of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nEighth Circuit. Jane Kelly was reported unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee one month ago. I am especially pleased that her nomination is \nnot being blocked the way Senate Republicans blocked the nomination of \nBonnie Campell, the former Attorney General of Iowa and first head of \nthe Justice Department's Violence Against Women Office. In part because \nthat nomination was blocked, Jane Kelly will be just the second woman \never to serve on the Eighth Circuit.\n  After today's vote, a dozen judicial nominees remain pending on the \nExecutive Calendar, including four who could and should have been \nconfirmed last year. Like Jane Kelly, they deserve swift consideration \nand an up-or-down vote.\n  Finally, over the last several months, I have continued to speak out \nabout the damaging effects of sequestration\n\n[[Page S2916]]\n\non our Federal courts and our system of justice. The harmful effects \ncontinue. As a result of sequestration, Federal prosecutors and Federal \npublic defenders continue to be furloughed. In a column dated April 18, \n2013, distinguished Federal Judges Paul Friedman and Reggie Walton from \nthe United States District Court for the District of Columbia spoke out \nagainst the harmful impact of sequestration. They wrote:\n\n       [S]equestration poses an existential threat to the right of \n     indigent defendants to have publicly funded legal \n     representation--a right that the Supreme Court recognized 50 \n     years ago in its landmark decision in Gideon v.

This is a price we cannot afford to pay.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this column be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From The Hill, Apr. 17, 2013]\n\n       President and Congress Must Act to Fill Judicial Vacancies\n\n                          (By Laurel Bellows)\n\n       The judicial appointment process has been broken for two \n     decades. Through the first two centuries of our republic, the \n     Senate was renowned as the world's greatest deliberative \n     body, the home of lawmakers and statespeople who understood \n     not only the impact of soaring rhetoric but also the value of \n     collaboration and compromise. Senators assiduously exercised \n     their authority to provide advice and consent on judicial \n     nominations. The judicial appointment process was divisive at \n     times, but presidents and senators have historically \n     recognized that stonewalling judicial nominees undermines the \n     independence of the judiciary as a coequal branch of \n     government. With 86 (one in 10) vacancies on our federal \n     bench and with 37 vacant judgeships qualifying as judicial \n     emergencies, the time for collaboration and compromise is \n     now.\n       Successive presidents and Senate majority and minority \n     leaders have pointed at each other and claimed with \n     exasperation that their political opponents are responsible \n     for stalling judicial nominees. Neither side is willing to \n     end a process that has degenerated into Beltway gridlock. \n     There are many losers in this stalemate. One is the judicial \n     nominee, whose law practice and family suffer during the \n     extended limbo of the pending nomination. Real costs are \n     often borne by businesses whose viability relies on the \n     timely resolution of commercial disputes, by defendants who \n     lose jobs and sometimes family ties while languishing behind \n     bars awaiting trial, and, ultimately, the public that expects \n     courts to deliver on the promise of justice for all. Our \n     economy depends on courts to enforce contracts, protect \n     property and determine liability. Judicial vacancies increase \n     caseloads per judge, creating delays that jeopardize the \n     ability of courts to expeditiously deliver judgments. Delay \n     translates into costs for litigants. Delay results in \n     uncertainty that discourages growth and investment. With 60 \n     percent more judicial vacancies at present than in January \n     2009 and pending civil cases in U.S. District Courts 7 \n     percent higher than in 2005, vacancies are potential job-\n     killers.\n       The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of \n     Georgia has had one open judge's position for more than 1,500 \n     days and another for more than 1,100 days. Federal courts in \n     Arizona, North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin have similarly \n     long-lived vacancies. In the U.S. District Court for the \n     Central District of California, a venue that recently \n     considered a $1 billion case, a seat on the Ninth Circuit \n     U.S. Court of Appeals has been open for more than 3,000 days, \n     since 2004.\n       Vacancies affect our criminal justice system. Major crimes \n     like terrorism, bank robbery and kidnapping are tried in \n     federal courts that are understaffed. Plus, the number of \n     defendants pending in criminal cases before U.S. district \n     courts has increased 33 percent since 2003. The \n     constitutional rights of defendants to a speedy trial are not \n     waived because senators cannot agree on judges. To meet those \n     constitutional obligations, criminal trials receive \n     precedence over civil matters, further adding to the civil \n     backlog. Exacerbating slowdowns caused by vacancies, the \n     courts have announced that sequestration will require staff \n     furloughs. Some courts will not accept civil filings on \n     certain days.\n       Progress can be made with small steps and collaborative \n     leadership. As a first step, Democrats and Republicans should \n     schedule up-or-down floor votes for those 13 nominees \n     favorably reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee with \n     little or no opposition.\n       Second, the 11 nominees who were pending on the floor when \n     the 112th Congress adjourned should be fast-tracked. These \n     women and men nominees already have endured the laborious \n     review process and Judiciary Committee approval. The \n     technicality of adjournment should not stall their \n     consideration.\n       Next, the Senate majority and minority leaders should agree \n     to prioritize filling judicial emergencies and shorten the \n     period of time between nomination and votes. A nominee for \n     Majority Leader Harry Reid's home state of Nevada has waited \n     more than 200 days without a floor vote. Minority Leader \n     Mitch McConnell's home state has fared even worse. A seat has \n     been vacant in the Western District of Kentucky for more than \n     500 days.\n       Finally, the White House should offer a nominee for every \n     open seat on the bench. The many vacancies and anticipated \n     vacancies warrant making judicial vacancies a priority this \n     year. Additional nominations from President Obama will \n     emphasize the responsibility of the Senate to end decades of \n     escalating retaliation against qualified judicial nominees.\n       Bellows is president of the American Bar Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 18, 2013]\n\n     Public Defenders Offices Shouldn't Suffer Under Sequestration\n\n               (By Paul L. Friedman and Reggie B. Walton)\n\n       Paul L. Friedman and Reggie B. Walton are federal judges on \n     the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n       Generally, federal judges should not become embroiled in \n     political disputes. But we feel compelled to speak out \n     because sequestration poses an existential threat to the \n     right of indigent defendants to have publicly funded legal \n     representation--a right that the Supreme Court recognized 50 \n     years ago in its landmark decision in Gideon v. Wainwright.\n       Before becoming judges, we served as federal prosecutors \n     and as defense lawyers. As the former, we vigorously pursued \n     the prosecution of individuals accused of violating the law. \n     And upon securing convictions, we aggressively sought \n     incarceration when the circumstances warranted. Our ethical \n     obligation as prosecutors was not only to secure convictions \n     but also to ensure that the results we obtained were just. \n     Confidence in the justice of an outcome--especially when the \n     accused loses his or her freedom--is maximized only if the \n     defendant has had competent legal representation.\n       Our adversarial system works best with competent lawyers on \n     both sides. In federal court in the District of Columbia, \n     where we serve as judges, 90 percent of criminal defendants \n     cannot afford to pay for lawyers. Of those defendants, 60 \n     percent are represented by attorneys employed by the Office \n     of the Federal Public Defender for the District of Columbia; \n     the others are represented by private attorneys approved by \n     the court, provided training by the federal public defender \n     and paid from public funds under the Criminal Justice Act. \n     Because of the demanding selection criteria for defense \n     attorneys, the caliber of representation provided to indigent \n     defendants in D.C. federal courts is outstanding. So when a \n     person represented by one of these attorneys is convicted in \n     our courtrooms, we can impose sentences with a high degree of \n     confidence that the defendant's best arguments and defenses \n     were explored or presented.\n       Sequestration has the potential to alter this reality. \n     Federal public defender offices throughout the country stand \n     to have their already tight budgets reduced significantly. \n     The District's office is poised to furlough each of its \n     lawyers for at least 15 days before the end of the fiscal \n     year on Sept. 30. Also impaired will be its ability to assist \n     private attorneys appointed to represent indigent defendants. \n     Already, we judges are seeing court dates pushed back because \n     lawyers at the federal public defender's office and the U.S. \n     attorney's office are being furloughed.\n       Lawyers in the federal public defender's office in the \n     District--public servants who earn much less than their \n     private-sector counterparts--must also endure a roughly 12 \n     percent reduction in salary. (The furloughs and salary cuts \n     were poised to be worse, but the executive committee of the \n     Judicial Conference announced efforts this week to help make \n     up the shortfall.) ``It's tremendously demoralizing, even for \n     people who are used to fighting against extraordinary odds,'' \n     noted one federal public defender.\n       This all seems a heavy price, given that cutting the \n     judiciary's budget will do little to redress the country's \n     economic crisis. The federal courts' budget nationwide \n     comprises only 0.2 percent, or about $7 billion, of the $3.7 \n     trillion federal budget, and funding of federal public \n     defenders and Criminal Justice Act attorneys must come from \n     that small share.\n       ``Lawyers in criminal cases are necessities, not \n     luxuries,'' the Supreme Court said 50 years ago in Gideon. A \n     federal public defender in Ohio echoed the sentiment this \n     month: ``These are not luxury services that we're providing. \n     These are constitutionally mandated services, and because \n     they're mandated, someone has to do it.'' When it comes to \n     the constitutional right to the effective assistance of \n     counsel, can we really say, ``We don't have the money''\n       Alexander Hamilton observed in the Federalist Papers that \n     unlike the legislative branch, which ``not only commands the \n     purse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties and \n     rights of every citizen are to be regulated,'' and the \n     executive branch, which ``not only dispenses the honors, but \n     holds the sword of the community,'' the judiciary ``is beyond \n     comparison the weakest of the three departments of power.'' \n     Because it has ``neither force nor will, but merely \n     judgment,'' Hamilton explained, the judicial branch depends \n     on the other branches to fulfill its constitutional mandate.\n\n[[Page S2917]]\n\n       Particularly as concerns grow about wrongful convictions, \n     it is distressing to see resources so dramatically diminished \n     for those who protect the rights of the poor in the criminal \n     justice system. And the judiciary is virtually powerless to \n     do anything about it. We appreciate that the country's fiscal \n     problems must be addressed. But the effect of sequestration \n     on the courts severely threatens the rights guaranteed by the \n     Sixth Amendment to those accused of crimes and, in the \n     process, threatens our federal judiciary's reputation as one \n     of the world's premier legal systems. This is a price we \n     cannot afford to pay.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I come to the floor to speak about the \nnomination of Jane Kelly. I compliment the chairman for speaking on \nimmigration. I am not going to speak on immigration today, probably, \nbut I hope to be able to speak several times before the bill actually \ngets to the floor of the Senate, to inform my colleagues about my point \nof view on the whole issue of immigration. But I can say generally that \nwe all know the immigration system is broken and legislation has to \npass. I hope we can get something that has broad bipartisan agreement. \nAlready the product before us is a product of bipartisanship because \nfour Democrats and four Republicans have submitted a proposal for our \ncommittee to consider.\n  I rise today, as I have said, in support of the nomination of Jane \nKelly to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit. The nominee \nbefore us today, Ms. Kelly, presently serves as an assistant public \ndefender for the Federal Public Defender's Office for the Northern \nDistrict of Iowa. She does that work in the Cedar Rapids office.\n  She is well regarded in my home State of Iowa, so I am pleased to \nsupport Senator Harkin's recommendation that he made to the President, \nand subsequently the President's nomination of Ms. Kelly.\n  She received her BA summa cum laude from Duke University in 1987. \nAfter spending a few months in New Zealand as a Fulbright scholar, she \nwent on to Harvard Law School, graduated there cum laude, earning her \nJ.D. degree in 1991.\n  Upon graduation, she served as a law clerk, first for Judge Donald J. \nPorter, U.S. District Court, South Dakota, and then for Judge David R. \nHansen of the Eighth Circuit. Judge Hansen sent us a letter in support \nof Ms. Kelly. Before I quote from it, I have confidence in Judge \nHansen's words because he was a person I suggested to Republican \nPresidents, both for district judge and then his long tenure on the \nEighth Circuit, and he has been a friend of mine as well.\n  This is what now-retired Judge Hansen said in support of Ms. Kelly: \n``She is a forthright woman of high integrity and honest character.''\n  Then he went on to say she has an ``exceptionally keen intellect.''\n  Then Judge Hansen concludes by saying: ``She will be a welcome \naddition to the Court if confirmed.''\n  I have no doubt that she will be confirmed.\n  Beginning in 1994, she has served as an assistant Federal public \ndefender in the Northern District of Iowa. She handled criminal matters \nfor indigent defendants, has been responsible for trying a wide range \nof crimes. She became the supervising attorney in that Cedar Rapids \noffice starting in 1999.\n  Ms. Kelly is active in the bar and in district court matters. She \npresently serves on the Criminal Justice Act Panel Selection Committee, \nthe blue-ribbon panel for criminal cases. She also serves on the \nFacilities Security Committee of the district court.\n  In 2004, her peers honored her with the John Adams Award from the \nIowa Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and Drake University Law \nSchool. She was unanimously chosen for this award, which recognizes \nindividuals who show a commitment to the constitutional rights of \ncriminal defendants.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary gave her a unanimous ``qualified'' rating.\n  I congratulate Ms. Kelly on her accomplishments and wish her well in \nher duties. I am pleased to support her confirmation and urge my \ncolleagues to join me.\n  This brings us to a point where, as of today, prior to this supposed \napproval of Ms. Kelly, we have a record in the Senate of approving 185 \njudges throughout the 4\\1/2\\ years of this Presidency, and the Senate \nhas only rejected 2. That would be a .989 batting average for the \nPresident of the United States with his nominees here in the Senate.\n  As I stated last week, a .989 batting average is a record any \nPresident would be thrilled with. Yet this President, without \njustification, complains about obstruction and delay.\n  Today's confirmation is the 14th so far this year including 5 Circuit \nJudges and 9 District Judges.\n  Let me put that in perspective for my colleagues. At this point in \nthe second term of the Bush presidency, only one judicial nomination \nhad been confirmed. A comparative record of 14-1 is nothing to cry \nabout.\n  As I said, this is the fifth nominee to be confirmed as a Circuit \nJudge this year, and the 35th overall. Over 76 percent of his Circuit \nnominees have been confirmed. President Clinton ended up at 73 percent; \nPresident Bush at 71 percent. So President Obama is doing better than \nthe previous two Presidents.\n  So again, this President and Senate Democrats should have no \ncomplaints on the judicial confirmation process. The fact of the matter \nis that President Obama is doing quite well.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Sequestration\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this morning our Democratic leader, \nSenator Reid, and the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, came to the \nfloor and talked about sequestration. Sequestration had an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 74 to 26. What it said was if \nCongress, on a bipartisan basis, could not reach an agreement on budget \nreduction, then automatic spending cuts would go into place.\n  Unfortunately, we did not reach that agreement. The spending cuts, \nknown as sequestration, went into place, and for the last month or so \nthere has been speculation as to whether anybody would notice.\n  People are starting to notice because across this country changes are \ntaking place. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration has been \nasked to cut about 5 percent from their operating budget, such as \nsalaries for employees. Because it is being done in a 6-month period, \nit turns out to be a 10-percent cut.\n  What that means, for example, is one of the largest groups of \nemployees in the FAA, the air traffic controllers, is going to go \nwithout pay 1 day out of every 10 working days. So with fewer air \ntraffic controllers on the job and fewer people able to direct flights, \nwe have noticed this week that flights are starting to slow down across \nthe country. The FAA estimates that some 6,800 flights a day will be \ndelayed. We have already started feeling that because air traffic \ncontrollers are being laid off due to the sequestration plan.\n  Putting that into perspective, on the worst day of last year, because \nof weather, 3,000 flights were delayed. Now, on a regular daily basis \nmore than twice that number will be delayed because of the reduction in \nforce of air traffic controllers due to the sequestration passed by \nCongress.\n  Senators are coming to the floor and looking for relief from that. \nSome on the other side are arguing if the Secretary of Transportation \njust had the power to pick and choose within his Department, he might \nbe able to avoid these layoffs. I don't know if that is true, but I \nwill say that making these cuts at the end of a fiscal year is going to \ncreate hardship in a lot of different departments and agencies.\n  I heard one of my colleagues from Indiana come to the floor and say \nfamilies face this all the time, and they have to make cutbacks. That \nis true. I have had that happen with my own family. They also want to \nmake certain, if they can, to get through tough periods without cutting \ninto the essentials of life, such as prescription drugs, paying the \nmortgage, and paying the utility bills. We need to make this a \nthoughtful effort to avoid sequestration.\n\n[[Page S2918]]\n\n  The Democratic leader, Senator Reid, has proposed that we, in fact, \ndefer this sequestration through the remainder of this fiscal year, \nuntil October 1. To make up the costs, he uses the overseas contingency \nfund. This was a fund created to pay for our wars overseas, and thank \ngoodness Iraq has been closed down as an act of war and Afghanistan is \nin the process. So there will be a surplus of money in this fund--some \n$600 billion--that otherwise had been anticipated to be spent.\n  What the majority leader suggested is that we take a small part of \nthat and use it so we can avoid the impact of sequestration and go back \nto business as usual for the remainder of this year.\n  I happen to think sequestration is not a good policy. We need a \nbetter approach and more thoughtful approach, and this will give us a \nchance. We can take the funds that otherwise would be spent overseas--\non a war that, thank goodness, will not be there--and instead use them \nat home to avoid some hardships which have just been described.\n  So now we hear from the Republican side that they don't think this is \na viable alternative. They question whether there is an overseas \ncontingency account. The irony is that Congressman Paul Ryan, chairman \nof the House Budget Committee, included the same money in his \nRepublican budget. Senator McConnell, who was critical of it today, \nsaid back in April 2011:\n  Today, the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, Congressman Paul \nRyan, is releasing a serious and detailed plan for getting our nation's \nfiscal house in order.\n  That serious plan, I might remind Senator McConnell, included just \nthe funding that Senator Reid is asking for. So we are not asking for \nsomething the Republicans have not already stood up and embraced. \nInstead, we are saying let's deal with the national challenges and \nnational emergencies and let's deal with them with the money that would \notherwise be spent overseas.\n\n\n                        Marketplace Fairness Act\n\n  After we have finished the vote on the judge, I am hoping this \nimportant issue will leave us in a position to move to proceed to the \nunderlying bill, the Marketplace Fairness Act. This is a bill that \nSenator Enzi of Wyoming and I have introduced in an effort to bring \nsome equity and fairness when it comes to the collection of sales tax.\n  Currently, in the United States, Internet retailers are not required \nby law to collect sales tax from sales in States that have a sales tax, \nand that is about 45 or 46 States. The Supreme Court told us 20 years \nago if remote sales--catalog sales and Internet sales--are to collect \nsales tax, Congress has to pass the law to do it. That is what this is. \nWe have been waiting 20 years. In the meantime, it has created some \nserious problems.\n  First, Internet retailers have an advantage over the brick-and-mortar \nbusinesses in communities. They have an advantage because the Internet \nretailers don't collect sales tax, so there is an automatic discount on \nwhatever the State sales tax might be--6, 8, 9, or 10 percent. This has \ncaused many of the stores on Main Street and in shopping malls to face \ncompetition that is unfair and sometimes forces them into closing their \nbusinesses.\n  We are trying to level the playing field and say: If you sell into a \nState such as Illinois, you will collect our sales tax on the sales to \nIllinoisans buying your products, period.\n  The debate has come up over the States which have no sales tax. Let \nme make it clear: There is nothing in the Marketplace Fairness bill \nwhich will impose any new Federal tax or any sales tax beyond what is \ncurrently in the law in every State in the union.\n  If a State, such as Oregon, Montana, New Hampshire, Delaware, even \nAlaska, has no State sales tax, this bill will not change it. \nThe residents of those States will not be compelled to pay a sales tax \neither over the counter or over the Internet. If a retailer that \nhappens to be located in one of those States sells into a State with a \nsales tax, we will provide, free of charge, the software for them to \ncollect the sales tax and remit it to the State where the purchase was \nmade.\n\n  There have been arguments that this is too complicated; that there \nare 9,000 different taxing districts. I just have to say that with \nsoftware available today, what we are suggesting is something that is \neasily done without great cost. In fact, in this bill we are requiring \nthe States to provide software to the Internet retailers free of charge \nso they can collect the sales tax as it is charged on each Internet \npurchase.\n  There have been suggestions by some that we ought to carve out some \nStates; that we ought to say this new law will apply to some States but \nnot to other States. The States and their businesses have to volunteer \nto collect a sales tax for another State.\n  I cannot accept that. It is worse than the current situation.\n  In the current situation, the store on Main Street is competing with \nan Internet retailer that doesn't collect a sales tax. This carve-out \napproach would say not only will we discriminate against those shops on \nMain Street, other Internet retailers which are not in the State that \nis carved out have to collect sales tax, but those in the carve-out \nState don't. So it makes for an even more inequitable situation. I \ncould not accept it.\n  I might say the Presiding Officer, who has quite a history on this \nissue, having been one of the parties to the Quill Supreme Court \ndecision, also made the point that we ought to take care; the standard \nwe set for the collection of sales tax is likely to be used in the next \ntrade negotiation with a country that is trying to establish their \nrules when it comes to competition on Internet commerce.\n  So if the collection of sales tax is required across the board in \nAmerica, the same can be asked in our trade agreements with other \ncountries. If we don't do that, we run the risk that the carve-out \nbecomes the exception that makes the rule in the next trade agreement, \nwhich is something that would be totally unfair to American companies.\n  So that is where we stand. What I said yesterday, I will repeat now. \nAt noon today we will move to proceed to this bill. I have urged my \ncolleagues to come forward with amendments if they have them. If they \ndon't, that is fine. But if they do, bring them forward. Let's not \ndelay this issue.\n  We are in the last week before a recess. Members have plans back in \ntheir States for the weekend, and we want to make sure they can keep \nthose plans. Those Members who have an amendment to this bill should \nstep forward with their suggestions immediately after the vote on the \nmotion to proceed.\n  Members should bring their amendments to the Senate floor. Don't \nwait. It is important that we do this on a regular basis so we can \ndebate those amendments which need to be debated and vote on them, \nwhich is almost how a Senate is supposed to do it. That is what we \nface.\n  I urge those who are holding back their amendments and want to wait \nuntil Thursday or Friday--if anybody does that, we are likely to be \nhere beyond Thursday and Friday, and that is not fair to our \ncolleagues. If anybody has a good amendment--or any amendment for that \nmatter--bring it to the floor.\n  Senator Enzi, Senator Alexander, Senator Heitkamp, and I will work to \ntry to find a way to accommodate amendments that are consistent with \nthe bill--or at least debate them and have a vote on them if they are \nnot. I think that is the best thing we can do. As I said, I think that \nis why we were elected--to debate these issues, resolve them, and vote.\n  So this is a fair warning to everyone. There are no excuses left. \nThis bill has been on the calendar and available for amendment since \nlast week, which gave everyone plenty of time to craft their amendment. \nBring it to the floor immediately after the vote on the motion to \nproceed, and let's get down to business. Let's do what we were elected \nto do and pass this bill--or at least vote on this bill, and I hope \npass it--before we break for this recess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for up to 5 minutes on the marketplace fairness legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, before he leaves the floor, I would \nlike to thank the distinguished majority whip for his leadership. I \nalso want to thank Senator Enzi, Senator Alexander, and\n\n[[Page S2919]]\n\nthe Presiding Officer for their leadership on what is an important \nissue to my State, and really to every State.\n  The marketplace fairness bill is a good idea whose time has finally \ncome. We have been waiting 20 years since the court decision to give \ndirection to our States so they can collect the retail sales tax upon \nwhich many of them finance most--if not all in some cases--of their \ngovernmental operations. This is not a new tax. It is not a different \ntax. It is not a tax we are applying to anybody. It is a mechanism for \nthe collection of a tax that has been owed for over 20 years by people \nmaking retail purchases in our States from people who sell out of \nState.\n\n  I commend the leadership on the legislation, the way it is drawn. I \nhope everybody will bring their amendments to the floor, if they have \nany. I don't know that there is any need for them. I hope we can send a \nclear message to the House and to our States that we are prepared to \nlet our local governments and our State governments collect the tax \nthat is owed to them and has been owed to them.\n  The Governor of my State, Nathan Deal, last year led a major tax \nreform package that passed with only one dissenting vote in our \nlegislature. It reformed taxes on utilities for manufacturing to \nattract businesses to our State. It reformed our income tax code and it \nreformed a lot of our taxes, but it also passed legislation consistent \nwith the Marketplace Fairness Act so we can finally collect a tax that \nhas been owed for a long time in our State.\n  As a real estate guy, as someone who used to lease retail space in \nshopping centers and on corners in the cities and counties in our \nState, I know what it has meant to retailers. What has happened is, in \nmany cases, they become showrooms and servicing agents for an offsite \nseller. Customers in our community will go to the retail store, look at \nthe products, go home and go on the Internet, buy the product on the \nInternet, and if something goes wrong with it, they will go back to the \nstore and try to get it fixed. But the State never gets the sales tax \non that sale because it was an Internet sale made by someone offsite.\n  Secondly, it has put pressure on the rest of the tax system. Think \nabout this. If a local community gets most of its revenue from a local \nspecial purpose sales tax and all of a sudden that tax goes down, not \nbecause people aren't paying it but because it is not being collected, \nwhat happens? The pressure on the ad valorem tax goes up. So the \nretailer, who is already burdened with losing business because of \nInternet sales, becomes further burdened because they have more \npressure from the ad valorem tax they pay for the space they lease and \noccupy. So it has had a compounding effect.\n  Also, we are famous in Washington for what is known as unfunded \nmandates to local government, whether it is IDEA in education or \nwhatever it might be. It is time we gave our local governments the \nchance for a mandate to collect a tax that is owed to them.\n  Lastly, for my State of Georgia, we have a 4-percent sales and use \ntax that goes to our State. We have special purpose local option sales \ntaxes that are referendum taxes levied by local communities to finance \nschool construction and other opportunities. We have a Metropolitan \nRapid Transit Authority in Atlanta which in 1974 was seeded with a \nreferendum that passed a 1-cent tax in Fulton and Dekalb Counties for \nthe financing of the beginning of that subway system. It is not fair to \ndeny those States and those entities the ability to collect a tax that \nis owed. It is only right, after 20 years of getting direction from the \nappellate courts as to what to do, that this Senate and this Congress \nand our country say to our States we are going to give a mandate for \nStates to collect the taxes owed to them. We are going to take the \npressure off the local retailers. We are going to level the playing \nfield. We are not adding a tax to anyone; we are adding opportunity to \neveryone.\n  I commend Senator Durbin, the Presiding Officer, Senator Alexander, \nand Senator Enzi for their tireless leadership. I urge all Members of \nthe Senate to do what we did on the motion to proceed and what we did \non the amendment on the budget. Let's give an overwhelming ratification \nof the Marketplace Fairness Act.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, would the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Absolutely.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I wish to join with the Senator from \nGeorgia. There are issues we disagree on, but this is a subject we \nagree on--another one we agree on.\n  I was privileged to be the Governor of Delaware for 8 years, and now \nI have served with the Senator from Georgia and other colleagues for \nthe last 12 years. Delaware is one of those States that doesn't have a \nsales tax. I think most of these States that don't have a sales tax are \nnot supportive of this bill. I am. Either I am out of step or maybe \nnot.\n  We have all these signs when people come into a State that say \n``Welcome to,'' whether it is Georgia or Delaware or North Dakota. We \nhad a sign that said, ``Welcome to Delaware, the Small Wonder, the \nFirst State'' and they all had the name of the Governor. When I became \nGovernor, I said why don't we take down the name of the Governor and \nput something else up, and what we put up is ``Home of Tax-Free \nShopping.'' That is what we put up: ``Home of Tax-Free Shopping.''\n  In our little State, we have borders with New Jersey to the east and \nPennsylvania to the north and Maryland to the west. They have sales \ntax. A lot of people in those States come to Delaware to shop, to buy \nthings, and help to fuel our economy, our retail economy, and to help \nfuel our tourism economy as well. When people say to me: As a former \nGovernor and a Senator from a State that doesn't have a sales tax, why \ndo you support this bill, one, I think it is an equity issue. The \nbrick-and-mortar merchants are there collecting the sales tax in those \n45 or so States that have a sales tax to help support the community, \nhelp to support the government and the services that are provided \nlocally in States across America. Then we have folks who are selling \nthings over the Internet to people who live in those States without \ncollecting the sales tax, without being part of the solution.\n  The other thing--and the Senator from Georgia knows as well as I do--\nthe brick-and-mortar merchants have people come into their stores \npretty regularly, and they ask the merchants: How would you like to \nhelp support the Little League? How would you like to help support the \nBoy Scouts and Girl Scouts? How would you like to support this festival \nor this function? They get asked about those things all the time--and \nthey do. Meanwhile, the folks they are competing with--the Internet \nsales--they are not supporting those kinds of activities. So there is \nan equity question here.\n  For me, why I see value in this--a guy who comes from a State who \ndoesn't have a sales tax--is this: I want more people from other \nStates, including the three around us, to come and buy things in my \nState. If they can buy things over the Internet and not pay a sales \ntax, then why would they come to Delaware? But if they have to pay a \nsales tax that is going to be collected by the Internet provider \nselling to people in those States with sales taxes, they might come to \nDelaware and shop.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I appreciate the leadership of the \ndistinguished former Governor. Knowing him as well as I do, he is a \nStates rights advocate and this is a States rights issue and we are \nhere to protect the rights of our States.\n  Mr. CARPER. It sure is a States rights issue. I would be remiss if I \ndidn't say this. I know my colleague has to leave. But in my first term \nas Governor, I had never heard of Mike Enzi. Who is this Mike Enzi guy? \nIt turns out he is a great guy. He is one of our colleagues and a \nformer mayor of Gillette, WY, and he has been pushing this as a Senator \nforever. Mike Leavitt, who succeeded me as chairman of the NGA, has \nbeen pushing this forever, a former Governor of Utah. So I give a shout \nout to both of them for their leadership. If we don't give up, \nsometimes we can get stuff done, and Mike Enzi doesn't give up and I \nknow the Senator from Georgia doesn't. So I thank my friend.\n\n\n                  Nomination of Sylvia Mathews Burwell\n\n  Madam President, I would like to speak a bit, if I may, on the \nnomination of Sylvia Mathews Burwell, whose nomination as the Director \nof the Office of Management and Budget has come through our Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs as well as through the \nBudget\n\n[[Page S2920]]\n\nCommittee. Her nomination was reported out unanimously by voice vote a \nweek or so ago by our committee and unanimously on the same day by the \nBudget Committee.\n  The nomination comes at a critical time not just for this \nadministration but I think at a critical time for our country. We are \nwrestling with this large budget deficit. We know there are management \nchallenges. When a person says OMB, it stands for the Office of \nManagement and Budget, and whoever is confirmed to serve in this \nposition is expected to oversee a great group of people, a good team \nthat will focus on budget issues. The issues include how do we continue \nto rein in our budget deficit and bring it back to a more sustainable \nfiscal position for us, also what do we need to do on the management \nside to help hasten that day.\n  We have across the Federal Government in this administration, and we \nhad it in the last Bush administration as well, something I call \nexecutive branch Swiss cheese. We have too many senior positions in \nthis administration; we had a number of them in the last administration \nbut not to the extent we have them in this administration. We have too \nmany positions that are going wanting. In some cases, the \nadministration has not vetted, nominated, and submitted names to us; in \nsome cases, we are not moving them very quickly once they have, so \nthere is a shared responsibility. The administration--in this case, we \nhaven't had a confirmed Director of OMB for about 1 year, since Jack \nLew left to become Chief of Staff, who is now Secretary of the \nTreasury. We have gone about 1 year without a Senate-confirmed OMB \nDirector. That is not good. Jeff Zients, who has been the Deputy \nDirector and who has basically been responsible for being Acting \nDirector; also, if you will, the ``m'' in OMB, the Management Deputy \nfor OMB. We haven't had anybody running it for a while, which these are \nthe regulations since Cass Sunstein left, who was very good at it.\n  So the senior leadership team at OMB pretty much has been Jeff \nZients, and we are grateful to him for taking on all this \nresponsibility. But he may have other things he wants to do with his \nlife and we need to put somebody in place to head up OMB and to \nsurround that person with a first-rate team and I pledge to do that.\n  I wish to say to my colleagues, Democratic and Republican in the \nSenate, on our Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, \non the Budget Committee, just a big thank-you for getting this \nnomination, once we had it in hand, to move it quickly, hearings, \nthrough the vetting, staff interviews, and to bring that nomination to \nthe floor. Thanks to the leadership, Democratic and Republican, for \nhelping to make that possible.\n  Who is this person whom the President has nominated? She used to be a \nMathews, with one ``t''--a Mathews with one ``t.'' She is now Sylvia \nMathews Burwell. She is a pretty remarkable person for someone who was \nraised and grew up in Hinton, WV, where I lived when I was 4 years old. \nI was born in Beckley, WV, not far from where Sylvia grew up. I said to \nher at our confirmation hearing: What is the likelihood that the \nPresident would nominate as the Director of OMB, one of the most \npowerful positions in any administration, a gal who was born in Hinton, \nWV, on the New River, close to the Bluestone Dam where I learned to \nfish as a little boy and she would be before our committee at a hearing \nchaired by a guy who used to live in Hinton, WV, when he was a 4-year-\nold kid? Pretty amazing. But she is extraordinary, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows.\n  Sylvia Burwell grew up in West Virginia. She didn't go off to some \nfancy private school in another State. She went to Hinton High School. \nShe played on the girls' basketball team there. I was kidding her at \nher confirmation hearing, and I asked her: What was the mascot? She \nsaid: We were the Bobcats. So she is a Bobcat. There were at the \nconfirmation hearing a number of her colleagues from Hinton, who were \nfellow Bobcats and played on the basketball team with her--just a great \ncelebration. She is a real person. She is just a real person. She has \nwonderful interpersonal skills.\n  When the President nominated her, I found out she used to work in the \nClinton administration. But I asked her after high school what did she \ndo. I like to say she couldn't get into Delaware or North Dakota \nUniversity, she had to go to Harvard. From there, she became a Rhodes \nScholar over in England. She came back and did some work on the \nClinton-Gore campaign, I think, in 1992 and ended up working for the \nadministration. What did she do? She was Chief of Staff to Bob Rubin, \none of the leaders of the economic development team in the Clinton \nadministration. She was a Deputy to Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, \nDeputy Chief of Staff, and I think for the last year or two of the \nClinton administration she was Deputy OMB Director and she had a pretty \ngood experience there. She finished there and ended up working for \nMcKinsey & Company, one of the top management consulting firms in the \nworld. She helped stand up the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and \nmore recently has helped to run the Wal-Mart Foundation. What great \ncredentials.\n  I called Erskine Bowles when I found out she worked for and with him, \nand I said: Tell me about this Sylvia Burwell, who has been nominated \nto head up the OMB. Here is what he told me. He told me a truly great \nstory. He said: Here is the setting. We are in the Oval Office with the \nPresident. Bob Rubin, Sylvia Mathews at the time--for a while--and \nErskine, and the President is having a conversation with Bob Rubin, \nasking him some questions. And Erskine notices Sylvia, who is Rubin's \nChief of Staff, slips him a note and Rubin looks at the note, and he \nanswers the President's questions to great effect and very brilliant \nresponses. The President is oohing and aahing at how good that response \nwas, and Erskine says: Mr. President, I have broken the code here on \nRubin. He is not that smart. It is Sylvia. She gave him the note to \nanswer the question. If I had Sylvia working for me, people might think \nI am as smart as they think Rubin is.\n\n  Well, she ended up working with Erskine as the Deputy Chief of Staff.\n  I also talked to Bruce Reed about her. Bruce was President Clinton's \nformer domestic policy adviser. He and I worked with a bunch of other \npeople on welfare reform. He is a great guy. He is Vice President \nBiden's Chief of Staff today. I asked him to tell me some more about \nSylvia.\n  One of the other things I sensed from both of them is this: She is a \nreal person. She is a good person. We have all heard the term ``good \nguy.'' I do not know how you say that about a woman--if they are a \n``good gal'' or whatever--but if she were a man, you would say ``a \nreally good guy.'' She has a great personality. People like her. Around \nhere, that is actually pretty helpful. The other thing they said is \nthat she is incredibly bright and able to juggle a whole lot of things \nat the same time.\n  Somehow along the way, she has gotten married to a lucky guy named \nStephen. She said she is lucky too. They have these two young kids, and \nsomehow they have managed to keep all the balls in the air and raise a \nfamily while having these careers.\n  But I asked Erskine and Bruce, what is she really like? Great, just a \nreally good person, with good values. I have talked to her about her \nvalues, including the one that involves faith, and it is just the kind \nof thing you are encouraged to hear. She is very bright.\n  The other thing they said about her is this: She has a great ability \nto get things done. We all know people who are a good guy or gal, \npeople who are arguably bright, but they are not able to get things \ndone. Well, we need somebody in this position who is able to lead a \nteam that gets things done. We have a huge deficit, about $800 billion. \nIt is coming down, but it is still too big. We have all kinds of GAO \nissues that they raise to us on their High Risk List--the things that \nare problematic because we waste money on ineffective spending. GAO, \nmost recently, has given us a whole big report on duplication in the \nFederal Government. There is a huge to-do list. And part of it is our \njurisdiction in our Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs. That is an obligation and responsibility we share with the \nadministration and with other branches of our government. But we need \nsomebody who is very good at multitasking and who can get things done. \nAnd I think if we help put the\n\n[[Page S2921]]\n\nright team around here, they will get a lot done and we will do this \ntogether.\n  I will close, if I could, with this: I have never met her parents. \nObviously, I think she has at least one sibling. But, boy, when I asked \nher how she turned out this way, Sylvia really gives the credit to her \nparents. I think most of us probably do if we have had success in life, \nalthough we had a great witness before the Finance Committee at \nyesterday's hearing--Antwone Fisher, a sort of self-made, up-from-the-\nroots, amazing, successful guy. You never would have imagined he would \nhave enjoyed the success he has, coming up through the foster care \nsystem in his home State.\n  But she gives a lot of credit to her parents. Obviously, they are \ndoing something right at Hinton High School and maybe even at Harvard \nand over in Oxford, England. But she has had good mentors. She is a \nvery humble person--a very humble person. She is the real deal, and we \nare lucky she is willing to take this on.\n  I commend the President for nominating her. I want to thank her \nhusband and her family for their willingness to share her. I hope she \ngets a unanimous vote here today. She ought to.\n\n\n                        Commending the President\n\n  The other thing I want to say, if I could, is this: The President \ntook some folks out for dinner last night. I do not know if our \nPresiding Officer was one of them. My guess is she was. I will talk to \nher later about what they had and how it went. But I commend the \nPresident for reaching out to Republicans and Democrats, Senators and \nRepresentatives. It is the kind of thing you have to do. It is the kind \nof thing you have to do if you want to get things done. As President, \nyou have a million people pulling on you--300 million people pulling on \nyou--and folks from around the world pulling on you, and it is hard to \nfocus on building and rebuilding relationships here. It is absolutely \nnecessary.\n  I was talking with Angus King the other day. Angus--now our colleague \nhere in the Senate, a great addition--used to be Governor of Maine. We \nwere comparing notes as to his role as Governor of Maine and mine as \nGovernor of Delaware, how we worked with the legislature. I am sure you \ncould find people who were in the legislature when I was Governor who \nsaid: Thank God he is gone. But we actually worked pretty well \ntogether.\n  One of the keys--not my idea but an idea that started with, I think, \nPete du Pont, when he was Governor a number of years ago; also done by \nMike Castle as Governor and Ruth Ann Minner as Governor and by me in \nbetween Governor Castle and Governor Minner--every Tuesday when the \nlegislature was in session in Delaware--every Tuesday; they are usually \nin session on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays most weeks between \nJanuary and June--I would host a lunch with the legislative leadership \nof the house and the senate, Democrats and Republicans from the house \nand the senate. Occasionally, we had somebody in from my \nadministration, my staff. We would have lunch together. Sometimes we \nwould talk about issues; sometimes we would talk about sports or \nwhatever else was the topic of the day. We always had lunch together, \nand we did it week after week, month after month, year after year. You \nget to know people and you develop a sense of trust, and in many cases \nyou kind of like each other.\n  One of the keys to our success in Delaware is we sort of like each \nother, Democrats and Republicans. We work together, and we govern from \nthe center.\n  Angus had a similar story, only they did not do lunch together with \nthe legislative leadership. They did breakfast together in Maine. He \ndid it every week, every month, every year for the 8 years or so he was \nGovernor.\n  The President is doing something like that. He is doing like a DC \nversion of that now. It is just great, and I urge him to keep it up.\n\n\n                           Deficit Reduction\n\n  I will close with this: My colleague, the Presiding Officer, has \nheard me say this before. The President has heard me say this a few \ntimes as well, probably more than he wants to remember. But I think \nthere are three things--if we are really serious about deficit \nreduction--three things we need to do.\n\n  I would mention, the first one of those is--go back to the Clinton \nadministration. Erskine Bowles, the Chief of Staff, whom Sylvia helped, \nand others, put together, with Republican help in the House and \nSenate--it was then a Republican House and Senate in those years--they \nput together a deficit reduction plan. It was 50 percent revenues; it \nwas 50 percent spending. They put together a balanced budget plan that \nled--for the first time since 1968, we ended up not with one balanced \nbudget, not two, not three, but four balanced budgets in the last 4 \nyears of the Clinton administration. It was 50 percent deficit \nreduction on the spending side and 50 percent on the revenue side.\n  For those 4 years, if you look at Federal revenue as a percentage of \nGDP, it ranged anywhere from 19.5 percent to 20.5 percent. That was the \nrange--19.5 percent to 20.5 percent Federal revenues as a percentage of \nGDP--but the average was about 20 percent.\n  Look at last year. We had a big budget deficit. Federal revenues as a \npercentage of GDP were right around 16 percent. I think spending as a \npercentage of GDP last year was around 23 percent or so. But that gap \nbetween 16 percent in revenues as a percentage of GDP and spending at \nabout 23 percent--and spending is coming down and the revenues are \ngoing to go up under the fiscal cliff deal, but we will still have a \ndeficit--a substantial deficit, by historical standards--so we need to \ndo something more.\n  The something more we need to do is, No. 2--after we address \nrevenues, get them up closer to the historic mark of about 20 percent, \nwhere we were in the Clinton administration, 20 percent of revenues as \na percentage of GDP, the second thing we need to do is entitlement \nreform.\n  I will use the President's words, and I think he has been courageous \nbecause not everybody in our party agrees with him on this. We need to \nreform the entitlement programs in ways that save money, do not savage \nold people or poor people, and preserve these programs for the long \nhaul.\n  I remember I spoke to--it was back at Ohio State, where I did my \nundergrad as a Navy ROTC midshipman a million years ago--it was back a \nmonth or so ago, and I had a chance to talk to 400 fraternity brothers \nfrom different States, including the Presiding Officer's State, who \nwere there for a weekend conference, a leadership conference. I talked \nto them about leadership. I also talked to them about making tough \ndecisions and how we use our values to make these tough decisions.\n  I asked the 400 guys from across those eight States: How many of you \nthink you will someday receive a Social Security check?\n  Not one hand went up.\n  I asked: How many of you think someday you might be eligible for \nMedicare when you are 65?\n  Not one hand went up.\n  My sons who are 23 and 24, they do not think they will. I want to \nmake sure they do. I will predict that they will need it. I want to \nmake sure that for our sons, our daughters, our grandsons, our \ngranddaughters, our nieces, and our nephews, those programs are going \nto be there for them.\n  The President gets that. And we understand we cannot just keep doing \nbusiness as usual. We are going to run out of money in the Medicare \ntrust fund by--when?--2024, and we will start to run out of money--our \ninability to pay Social Security checks fully--by about 2030 or so. So \nwe need to do something differently, and we need to be smart to do it \nso we do not hurt the least of these--the least of these--in our \nsociety. I think we can be that smart.\n  So first, we need some revenues. Second, we need entitlement reform \nthat is true to Matthew 25: the least of these, looking out for the \nleast of these. And the third thing--and this is where we have focused \nin our Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, as the \nPresiding Officers knows--we have put together more than a dozen \nDemocrats and Republicans in this committee who are--``rabid'' is \nprobably the wrong word, but I will use it--rabid about waste, rabid--\nr-a-b-i-d--about waste. What we believe--as I do--is that everything we \ndo as human beings, we can do better. I think that is true of all of \nus. It is true of Federal programs. Everything we do, we can do better.\n\n[[Page S2922]]\n\n  The challenge for us is to leverage from one committee, working with \nour colleagues here in the Senate and the House; working with GAO, the \nGovernment Accountability Office; working with OMB, the Office of \nManagement and Budget; working with the inspectors general across the \nFederal Government; working with outside groups, such as Citizens \nAgainst Government Waste, and with other groups; with David Walker, a \nformer Comptroller General; and just a bunch of folks, to say this is \nlike an all-hands-on-deck deal and a shared responsibility as well. To \nthe extent we have the ability to work with all those partners I just \nmentioned, we will get more done and we will leverage the effectiveness \nof our committee, but most importantly, we will actually continue to \nreduce the budget deficit.\n  The three things, in closing: We need some additional revenues. We \nneed to do it in a smart way. We need to reform the entitlement \nprograms in ways that do not savage old people and poor people and \nwould save these programs for the future. And we need to look in every \nnook and cranny of the Federal Government to say: How do we get a \nbetter result for less money? Find out what works and do more of that. \nFind out what does not work and do less of that. Look wherever we are \nduplicating responsibilities and activities and see how we can maybe do \nless of that.\n  So there you have it, Madam President. I do not usually get to talk \nthis long, but I am wound up today, very excited about this nomination, \nas the Presiding Officer can tell. Sylvia Mathews Burwell has the \npotential of being a terrific OMB Director. One of the keys to doing \nthat is we have to get her confirmed today, and I think we will. Then \nwe have to move promptly.\n  The President has to give us a good name. I think he has given us one \ngood name to be part of her team, if she is confirmed. But the \nPresident needs to send us somebody not just for Deputy OMB Director, \nnot just to be deputy at OMB for management, not just to be the \nperson--the new Cass Sunstein, whose job it will be to work the \nregulation side, but all of the above. When we get good names, we have \nan obligation to vet them quickly and promptly and, if they are good \npeople with the best credentials, get them confirmed and in place so \nthey can go do their job because with an $800-some-billion deficit, we \nhave work to do and need a good leadership team to do that.\n  Madam President, I do not see anybody standing around to chew up the \nrest of this time, which is probably a good thing. I think it signals \nthat maybe we will get a good vote on this nomination.\n  I am pleased to put in a good word for Sylvia and say to her husband \nand family, thanks for sharing her, and to her parents, thanks for \nraising her.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I rise to urge the Senate to confirm \nthe nomination of Sylvia Mathews Burwell to be Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget. I do so with great pride because Sylvia \nBurwell is from my home State of West Virginia. I have been dear \nfriends with her family for a long time.\n  Her parents have been community leaders in Hinton, WV, for over half \na century. Her father Dr. William Mathews is a longtime optometrist, \nand her mother the Honorable Cleo Mathews previously served as the \nmayor of Hinton, as well as in a number of other public service \npositions. I worked with Sylvia for many years as mayor when I was \nGovernor of the State--she was quite competent--including 8 years on \nthe State Board of Education when she served as president of the board \nof education.\n  If you want to know Sylvia, you should look at her small hometown of \nHinton, WV, and the surrounding Summers County that she grew up in \nbecause that is her grounding. It is pure Americana, a one-time \nrailroad boom town, woven into the mountains of Appalachia. The \ndowntown historic district, 200 buildings, including churches, \nstorefronts, and private residences, is an architectural gem of \nAmerican Gothic, Classical, Victorian and Greek Revival styles. It is a \nmovie just waiting to happen.\n  Hinton is the ideal example of smalltown West Virginia and probably \nsmalltown America. It only has 2,600 residents. That is a pretty large \ntown for West Virginia and probably North Dakota. It is nestled into a \nlush green valley on the banks of the New River, surrounded by the \ntowering, majestic mountains and forests of Summers County, one of the \nmost beautiful counties in West Virginia.\n  New River is one of the oldest rivers in the world. It flows south to \nnorth, which may be due to the fact that it was formed long before the \nAppalachian Mountains.\n  This is the special place Sylvia Mathews Burwell calls home, a \nshowcase for the best of West Virginia and America, the beauty, the \noutdoors, and the people are warm and welcoming. Sylvia is humble, \nhardworking, has spent most of her life helping hard-working families \neverywhere achieve the American dream her Greek immigrant grandparents \nfound in this country.\n  She went off to Harvard, was a Rhodes Scholar, and has traveled the \nworld over. But she has never lost touch with her West Virginia roots \nand the ties that bind us together. No matter where she is, 1 day each \nweek like clockwork, Sylvia is on the phone with the two best friends \nshe made in the first grade in Hinton. Think about it. That is who we \nare. That is the heart and soul of West Virginia, friends and family.\n  But make no mistake, I am supporting Sylvia's nomination not because \nshe is from West Virginia, which makes it all that much sweeter, but \nbecause she embodies the best of our State and our country. In West \nVirginia, we judge people by their deeds as much as their words, and \nSylvia has already accomplished so much in her life, the public service \nand philanthropy she has been involved with.\n  Sylvia Mathews Burwell is an exceptional choice to lead the Office of \nManagement and Budget, especially in the aftermath of sequestration, \nwhich is what we are going through now, and which so many of our \ncolleagues detailed on the Senate floor this past week. We are still \ndiscussing it.\n  I say that because Sylvia served as the Deputy Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget, which now she will become Director of, from \n1998 to 2001, which was our last era--think about the last time of \nfiscal responsibility, when balanced deficit reduction gave us balanced \nFederal budgets.\n  The fiscal plan she and Erskine Bowles, whom she worked with, put \ntogether, had we followed it to this day and not changed, would have \nerased our national debt completely by now. Can you believe that. We \nwould have been totally out of debt as a nation if we had followed the \nplan that was put forward back in 1996, 1997, 1998, and followed \nthrough after 2001.\n  Sylvia was a key part of the Clinton White House team which reached \nacross the aisle, negotiated those balanced budgets with a Republican \nCongress. If we look closely at the numbers, we can see what an \naccomplishment it was to fix our finances in the 1990s. Prior to 1993, \nwhen Sylvia joined the Clinton administration, the United States had \nfailed to balance its budget for 23 years--23 years.\n  By 1992, spending had risen to historic highs--I think we all know \nthat story--and revenues had reached near historic lows. We know that \none too. That is exactly the dilemma we are in right now, compared to \nthe size of the economy. In 1992, the Federal budget deficit topped out \nat $290 billion. I think we are close to $17 trillion in debt right \nnow.\n  By the time Sylvia left the Clinton White House and went to the \nOffice of Management and Budget in 1998 as a Deputy, the wheels were in \nmotion of sustainable balanced budgets for years to come. She put these \nwheels on. Spending had shrunk drastically and revenues were soaring to \nhistoric highs, thanks to a thriving U.S. economy and reasonable tax \npolicy that ensured both corporations and wealthy individuals paid \ntheir fair share.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the majority has expired.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 5 minutes. At\n\n[[Page S2923]]\n\nthat time, I wish to be able to turn it over to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. In 1998, Sylvia's last year in the White House and the \nfirst year at OMB, the Federal budget had a $69.3 billion surplus, the \nfirst surplus in a generation. Sylvia has been out of government for \nthe last 12 years. But I am confident she will bring a fresh \nperspective to the fiscal debate we will be having over the next few \nyears.\n  After serving in high-profile leadership positions, she has been well \nbalanced, and she has been with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. \nShe has been their top person. I would hope all my colleagues on the \nRepublican side and my colleagues on the Democratic side will look at \nSylvia as part of America, part of this great country, a product of who \nwe are. She will do a great job because she has a track record of \nalready doing it. With that, I would encourage all my colleagues to \nplease vote in support of Sylvia Mathews Burwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I was honored to recommend to the \nPresident that he nominate Jane Kelly to serve as a judge on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Today I encourage my \ncolleagues to vote for her confirmation, which will be the first vote \nat noon.\n  Let me begin by thanking Senator Leahy and his staff for their hard \nwork in advancing Ms. Kelly's nomination in such a timely manner. I \nalso thank my senior colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, for his \ninvaluable support and assistance. For all the years we have served \ntogether, Senator Grassley and I have cooperated in a spirit of good \nwill on judicial nominations in our State. I am grateful that tradition \nhas continued.\n  Jane Kelly possesses all the qualifications necessary to assume the \nresponsibilities of a Federal appellate judge. Before recommending Ms. \nKelly to the President, I reviewed a very strong field of candidates \nfor this position. She stood out as a person of truly outstanding \nintellect and character, with a reputation as an extremely talented \nlawyer with a deep sense of compassion and fairness. Not surprisingly, \nshe enjoys wide bipartisan support from the Iowa legal community.\n  Judge Michael Melloy, who was nominated by President George W. Bush, \nand whose seat on the Eighth Circuit Ms. Kelly is nominated to fill, \nsaid Ms. Kelly ``is very intelligent and thoughtful.''\n  Judge David Hansen, who was President George H.W. Bush's nominee to \nserve on the Eighth Circuit and for whom Ms. Kelly clerked, said: ``She \nis a forthright woman of high integrity and of honest character'' who \n``will be a welcome addition to the court.''\n  I might also point out for the record that both of those nominees \nunder Republican Presidents I was proud to support, under the \nleadership of Senator Grassley.\n  Federal District Court Judge Stephanie Rose remembered Ms. Kelly \n``has a great blend of personality, skills and common sense to make a \ngreat lawyer and judge.''\n  The American Bar Association gave her a unanimous ``qualified'' \nrating. Ms. Kelly is a credit to all of us who have chosen to be in \npublic service. She earned her bachelor's degree summa cum laude from \nDuke, served as a Fulbright Scholar, and received her J.D. cum laude \nfrom Harvard Law School. After law school she was a law clerk to Judge \nDonald Porter of the District Court of South Dakota and to Judge David \nHansen on the Iowa Eighth Circuit. She could easily have commanded a \nbig salary with a top law firm, but instead for over 20 years she has \nopted for public service and long hours as a Federal public defender. \nWe are fortunate she seeks to continue her public service to Iowa and \nour Nation by serving as a Federal judge.\n  Let me conclude with two additional notes about Ms. Kelly's \nnomination. First, if confirmed, Ms. Kelly will only be the second \nfemale judge in the history of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, a \ncourt established in 1891. While 56 men have sat on that court, to date \nthere has only been one woman, Diana Murphy of Minnesota. President \nObama has nominated approximately 100 former prosecutors to the Federal \nbench, including one I recommended, former U.S. attorney Stephanie \nRose, to the Southern District of Iowa. Among recent Presidents that is \nthe highest percentage of former prosecutors to be nominated to the \nFederal bench. These are all outstanding attorneys and dedicated public \nservants.\n  As Judge Melloy recently noted with respect to Ms. Kelly: ``It will \nbe good to have someone from the public defender realm on the bench.''\n  Ms. Kelly has served for more than 20 years in the Federal defender's \noffice, where she has argued hundreds of cases on behalf of indigent \nclients. She has fought tirelessly to ensure that the rights of all are \nprotected, and she has worked to give meaning to the phrase above the \nSupreme Court, ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' This is a critically \nimportant perspective that she will bring to the court.\n  As an aside, it strikes me as especially fitting that Ms. Kelly, a \ncareer public defender, has been nominated for the Federal bench this \nyear as we observe the 50th anniversary of Gideon v. Wainwright. As we \nall know, that landmark decision recognized that every person accused \nof a crime, no matter how poor, is guaranteed the right to counsel. At \nits core, Gideon is the promise of justice for all, including our most \nvulnerable citizens. This is an ideal to which Ms. Kelly has dedicated \nher entire legal career.\n  Jane Kelly is superbly qualified to serve as the U.S. Court of \nAppeals judge for the Eighth Circuit. I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport her nomination and confirmation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I want to share a few remarks on the \nnomination of Sylvia Mathews Burwell to be the Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget. I suspect she will be confirmed momentarily. \nShe was raised in a small town in West Virginia and seems to have some \ngood West Virginia values. She is smart, able, and has a winning \npersonality for sure.\n  This is, perhaps, properly utilized, the toughest, most important job \nin the U.S. Government. The primary responsibility of OMB is to assist \nthe President in overseeing the preparation of the budget, but also to \nhelp formulate spending plans to deal with agency programs, policies, \nand positions in setting funding priorities to make tough choices that \nare necessary to keep our financial house in order. It is a tough \nposition.\n  We could have elected a President such as Governor Romney, who was a \nmanager, a tough, proven executive. That was his strength. President \nObama's strength is in message, traveling the country and advocating \nhis positions, leaving it even more critically important than normal, \nit would seem to me, to have a very strong Office of Management and \nBudget leader. Ms. Burwell certainly seems to have the integrity to do \nthe job.\n  I am worried about her lack of experience. She served as the \npresident of the Global Development Program at the Bill & Melinda Gates \nFoundation. She served as the head of the Walmart Charitable \nFoundation, she served in the Office of Management and Budget for a \ntime--Chief of Staff, I believe, to the Secretary of Treasury--and at \nthe National Economic Council. Her most recent experience has not been \nin directly trying to rein in a government that is out of control.\n  The Web site of OMB says as part of its mission:\n\n       It reports directly to the President and helps a wide range \n     of executive departments and agencies across the Federal \n     Government to implement the commitments and priorities of the \n     President.\n\n  It is a big job.\n  I would say that in failing to nominate someone like a proven \nexecutive, a proven Governor, or a former Cabinet member who can look \nthese Cabinet members in the eye and say: No, Secretary, this is not \ngoing to be within our budget; this isn't within our plans--you are \ngoing to have to see if you can do this. We have a nominee\n\n[[Page S2924]]\n\nwho will really have to rise to the occasion to be able to defend \ncommon sense and spending because our Cabinet people get ideas and \nvisions. They want to do all kinds of things, particularly in this \nadministration. Sometimes you have to say: We don't have the money. We \nwould like to do that, but we do not have the money.\n  The President's budget that OMB is required to produce and that he \nhas submitted so far has not been impressive. That is an \nunderstatement. They have not exemplified the leadership and management \nthat we would expect in a President.\n  For instance, the 2013 budget, the one that was introduced last year, \nincreased spending by $1.5 trillion above the Budget Control Act \nspending levels to which we all agreed. That is not good.\n  The President signed the Budget Control Act. It limited spending from \nincreasing from $37 trillion at current law baseline. He was going to \n$47 trillion. The Budget Control Act reduced the increase to just $45 \ntrillion instead of going up to $47 trillion. It imposed the 2012 \nbudget limits. Yet the President's budget proposed a deficit of $2.7 \ntrillion above the agreed-upon baseline, so we had a good number of \nproblems with that budget. Of course, the budget, those two budgets, \nfailed in the Senate 99 to 0 and 97 to 0. It got not a single vote, and \nit didn't get a single vote in the House because it's an irresponsible \nbudget. Ms. Burwell will be replacing the OMB Director who put together \nthose budgets.\n  I see my colleague and able chair of the Budget Committee here. I \nthought I would have 10 minutes. What is the agreement at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time expires in 30 seconds, all time \nremaining under Republican control.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Republican time has expired.\n  I will say I intend to support Ms. Burwell's nomination. We will give \nher a chance. I hope she will rise to the occasion. I think she has the \nability. She certainly is a delightful person with whom to meet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would ask unanimous consent to speak \nfor 5 minutes on the nomination of Sylvia Mathews Burwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank Senator Sessions, and I rise \ntoday to speak in support of Sylvia Mathews Burwell, whose nomination \nto be the next Director of the Office of Management and Budget was \napproved last week with strong bipartisan support by our Senate Budget \nCommittee.\n  As we all know, our country does face serious fiscal and economic \nchallenges we have to work together to address. The American people are \nlooking to us to end this constant artificial crisis and political \nbrinkmanship that is threatening our fragile economic recovery. They \nwant us to come together around fair solutions that work for our middle \nclass, help the economy grow, and tackle our deficit and debt fairly \nand responsibly. It is time we stop governing from crisis to crisis and \nreturn stability and regular order to our budget process.\n  That is why I am so pleased we have such an exceptional and qualified \nnominee in Sylvia Burwell to lead OMB. I know she is the right person \nto come into this leadership role at this important time for our \ncountry. She is no stranger to OMB or to tackling important fiscal \nissues.\n  In the 1990s, she was a critical part of President Clinton's economic \nteam. She served as Deputy Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, Deputy Chief of Staff to the President, and Chief of Staff to \nthe Secretary of the Treasury. In those roles, she worked very closely \nwith Jack Lew, Erskine Bowles, Robert Rubin, and the rest of President \nClinton's economic team to help produce three out of four budget \nsurpluses in a row. During her tenure, our government took a fair, \ncredible, and sustainable approach to our Federal budget. That gave \nbusinesses the confidence to hire new workers and invest in their \ngrowth.\n  Her leadership and hard work in the 1990s helped to create broad-\nbased economic growth that worked for the middle class and turned our \ndebt and deficit problems around. Sylvia's firsthand experience \ncreating a balanced and responsible approach to deficit reduction makes \nher uniquely qualified to lead OMB at this important time for our \ncountry.\n  Since the 1990s, Sylvia has dedicated her life to helping people all \nover the world. As the president of the Global Development Program and \nthe chief operating officer at the Gates Foundation, she worked to \nimprove the lives of millions across the globe. Under her leadership, \nthe foundation invested in important programs to help combat poverty \nand produce clean water and improve literacy, and provides emergency \nrelief to those who need it the most.\n  Most recently, as president of the Wal-Mart Foundation, she led the \nFoundation's charitable giving and focused on critical issues such as \nhunger relief and women's economic empowerment.\n  Not only do Sylvia's achievements in the foundation of philanthropy \nworlds demonstrate her vast experience managing large global budgets, \nbut they also speak volumes of her values and demonstrate her deep \nlifelong commitment to serving others.\n  Sylvia grew up understanding the value of hard work and public \nservice. Her parents have been community leaders in West Virginia for \nover half a century. Her father is a long-time optometrist and her \nmother, the Honorable Cleo Mathews, served as the mayor of her hometown \nof Hinton, and later served on the West Virginia State Board of \nEducation for a decade. As my colleague Senator Manchin said when he \nintroduced her to our Budget Committee, it is easy to see public \nservice is a part of Sylvia's DNA.\n  As the Director of OMB, Sylvia will help set our Nation's priorities \nand make tough decisions about our Federal spending. So I am glad \nSylvia knows budgets are about more than abstract numbers and partisan \nback and forth. As a second generation Greek American, Sylvia \nunderstands the importance of the promise of American opportunity. She \nknows budgets are a reflection of our values and our priorities, and \nthey are about families across the country whose lives and futures are \nimpacted by the decisions we make.\n  Not only is Sylvia an expert on domestic economic policy and a \ndedicated public servant, she has a demonstrated track record of \nworking across the aisle to get things done. During her time in \nWashington in the 1990s, she reached across the aisle and negotiated \nthe balanced and fair budgets with Republicans in Congress. She knows \nworking to find common ground is the key to solving our fiscal \nchallenge--a point made clear by her during her confirmation hearing in \nfront of our Senate Budget Committee this month.\n  So I am pleased her nomination passed our committee on a voice vote \nwith strong bipartisan approval. Republicans, including Senator \nSessions, who here on the floor praised Sylvia as someone who is, by \nall accounts, well-liked and an able leader committed to public \nservice.\n  Madam President, I support this nomination, I urge my colleagues to \nvote yes, and I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I come to the floor to speak in \nsupport of the nomination of Mrs. Sylvia Mathews Burwell, to be \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Her previous \nexperience as Deputy Director of OMB during the Clinton administration, \nas well as her work with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and her \ncurrent position as president of the Walmart Foundation in my opinion, \nmake her well qualified to be the Director of OMB.\n  With our country now facing a $16.8 trillion dollar debt, which is \nmore than $53,000 per person, the Director of OMB is perhaps the \ntoughest job in Washington, and I am confident that Mrs. Burwell is up \nfor the challenge. In addition to the unsustainable debt, $85 billion \nin draconian, across-the-board sequestration cuts to defense and \nnondefense programs in fiscal year 2013 have now started to hollow out \nour military. I hope to work with Mrs. Burwell to remedy these cuts \nthat are devastating to our national security.\n  Although Mrs. Burwell and I will not always agree on how we tackle \nour\n\n[[Page S2925]]\n\ncountry's urgent fiscal challenges, I am confident that she will commit \nto finding bipartisan solutions to these real problems. Solutions that \nwill provide greater program efficiency and transparency and will put \nour country back on a path of fiscal stability so that future \ngenerations will not be forced to pay for the irresponsible spending \ndecisions we continue to make here in Congress. Again, I am pleased \nthat the President put forth such a qualified nominee, and I look \nforward to working with her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Jane Kelly, of Iowa, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nEighth Circuit?\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Madam President, on behalf of Senators Enzi, Durbin, and \nothers, I have an amendment at the desk and I ask the clerk to report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n     Durbin, Mr. Alexander, and Ms. Heitkamp, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 741.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 2, line 10, strike ``if the Streamlined'' \n     and all that follows through page 11, line 5, and insert the \n     following:\n     if any changes to the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement \n     made after the date of the enactment of this Act are not in \n     conflict with the minimum simplification requirements in \n     subsection (b)(2). A State may exercise authority under this \n     Act beginning 180 days after the State publishes notice of \n     the State's intent to exercise the authority under this Act, \n     but no earlier than the first day of the calendar quarter \n     that is at least 180 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (b) Alternative.--A State that is not a Member State under \n     the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement is authorized \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law to require all \n     sellers not qualifying for the small seller exception \n     described in subsection (c) to collect and remit sales and \n     use taxes with respect to remote sales sourced to that State, \n     but only if the State adopts and implements the minimum \n     simplification requirements in paragraph (2). Such authority \n     shall commence beginning no earlier than the first day of the \n     calendar quarter that is at least 6 months after the date \n     that the State--\n       (1) enacts legislation to exercise the authority granted by \n     this Act--\n       (A) specifying the tax or taxes to which such authority and \n     the minimum simplification requirements in paragraph (2) \n     shall apply; and\n       (B) specifying the products and services otherwise subject \n     to the tax or taxes identified by the State under \n     subparagraph (A) to which the authority of this Act shall not \n     apply; and\n       (2) implements each of the following minimum simplification \n     requirements:\n       (A) Provide--\n       (i) a single entity within the State responsible for all \n     State and local sales and use tax administration, return \n     processing, and audits for remote sales sourced to the State;\n       (ii) a single audit of a remote seller for all State and \n     local taxing jurisdictions within that State; and\n       (iii) a single sales and use tax return to be used by \n     remote sellers to be filed with the single entity responsible \n     for tax administration.\n     A State may not require a remote seller to file sales and use \n     tax returns any more frequently than returns are required for \n     nonremote sellers or impose requirements on remote sellers \n     that the State does not impose on nonremote sellers with \n     respect to the collection of sales and use taxes under this \n     Act. No local jurisdiction may require a remote seller to \n     submit a sales and use tax return or to collect sales and use \n     taxes other than as provided by this paragraph.\n       (B) Provide a uniform sales and use tax base among the \n     State and the local taxing jurisdictions within the State \n     pursuant to paragraph (1).\n       (C) Source all remote sales in compliance with the sourcing \n     definition set forth in section 4(7).\n       (D) Provide--\n       (i) information indicating the taxability of products and \n     services along with any product and service exemptions from \n     sales and use tax in the State and a rates and boundary \n     database;\n       (ii) software free of charge for remote sellers that \n     calculates sales and use taxes due on each transaction at the \n     time the transaction is completed, that files sales and use \n     tax returns, and that is updated to reflect rate changes as \n     described in subparagraph (H); and\n       (iii) certification procedures for persons to be approved \n     as certified software providers.\n     For purposes of clause (iii), the software provided by \n     certified software providers shall be capable of calculating \n     and filing sales and use taxes in all States qualified under \n     this Act.\n       (E) Relieve remote sellers from liability to the State or \n     locality for the incorrect collection, remittance, or \n     noncollection of sales and use taxes, including any penalties \n     or interest, if the liability is the result of an error or \n     omission made by a certified software provider.\n       (F) Relieve certified software providers from liability to \n     the State or locality for the incorrect collection, \n     remittance, or noncollection of sales and use taxes, \n     including any penalties or interest, if the liability is the \n     result of misleading or inaccurate information provided by a \n     remote seller.\n       (G) Relieve remote sellers and certified software providers \n     from liability to the State or locality for incorrect \n     collection, remittance, or noncollection of sales and use \n     taxes, including any penalties or interest, if the liability \n     is the result of incorrect information or software provided \n     by the State.\n       (H) Provide remote sellers and certified software providers \n     with 90 days notice of a rate change by the State or any \n     locality in the State and update the information described in \n     subparagraph (D)(i) accordingly and relieve any remote seller \n     or certified software provider from liability for collecting \n     sales and use taxes at the immediately preceding effective \n     rate during the 90-day notice period if the required notice \n     is not provided.\n       (c) Small Seller Exception.--A State is authorized to \n     require a remote seller to collect sales and use taxes under \n     this Act only if the remote seller has gross annual receipts \n     in total remote sales in the United States in the preceding \n     calendar year exceeding $1,000,000. For purposes of \n     determining whether the threshold in this section is met, the \n     gross annual receipts from remote sales of 2 or more persons \n     shall be aggregated if--\n       (1) such persons are related to the remote seller within \n     the meaning of subsections (b) and (c) of section 267 or \n     section 707(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or\n       (2) such persons have 1 or more ownership relationships and \n     such relationships were designed with a principal purpose of \n     avoiding the application of these rules.\n\n     SEC. 3. LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed \n     as--\n       (1) subjecting a seller or any other person to franchise, \n     income, occupation, or any other type of taxes, other than \n     sales and use taxes;\n       (2) affecting the application of such taxes; or\n       (3) enlarging or reducing State authority to impose such \n     taxes.\n       (b) No Effect on Nexus.--This Act shall not be construed to \n     create any nexus or alter the standards for determining nexus \n     between a person and a State or locality.\n       (c) No Effect on Seller Choice.--Nothing in this Act shall \n     be construed to deny the ability of a remote seller to deploy \n     and utilize a certified software provider of the seller's \n     choice.\n       (d) Licensing and Regulatory Requirements.--Nothing in this \n     Act shall be construed as permitting or prohibiting a State \n     from--\n       (1) licensing or regulating any person;\n       (2) requiring any person to qualify to transact intrastate \n     business;\n       (3) subjecting any person to State or local taxes not \n     related to the sale of products or services; or\n       (4) exercising authority over matters of interstate \n     commerce.\n       (e) No New Taxes.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed \n     as encouraging a State to impose sales and use taxes on any \n     products or services not subject to taxation prior to the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (f) No Effect on Intrastate Sales.--The provisions of this \n     Act shall apply only to remote sales and shall not apply to \n     intrastate sales or intrastate sourcing rules. States granted \n     authority under section 2(a) shall comply with all intrastate \n     provisions of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement.\n       (g) No Effect on Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act.--\n     Nothing in this Act shall be construed as altering in any \n     manner or preempting the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing \n     Act (4 U.S.C. 116-126).\n\n     SEC. 4.

When no delivery location is \n     specified, the remote sale is sourced to the customer's \n     address that is either known to the seller or, if not known, \n     obtained by the seller during the consummation of the \n     transaction, including the address of the customer's payment \n     instrument if no other address is available. If an address is \n     unknown and a billing address cannot be obtained, the remote \n     sale is sourced to the address of the seller from which the \n     remote sale was made. A State granted authority under section \n     2(a) shall comply with the sourcing provisions of the \n     Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement.\n       (8) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several \n     States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto \n     Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, \n     the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and any \n     other territory or possession of the United States, and any \n     tribal organization (as defined in section 4 of the Indian \n     Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. \n     450b)).\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID.

I now ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum under \nrule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDonnelly be recognized for up to 20 minutes to give his maiden speech, \nand he will proceed as in morning business. Following his speech, I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Durbin, the manager of the bill, be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                         An Opportunity Agenda\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Madam President, one of the best parts about this job \nis getting the chance to talk to Hoosiers here in Washington, back home \nin Indiana, and, on those special occasions, a chance to see our \nHoosiers when they are serving our country overseas.\n  When I was visiting our servicemembers in Afghanistan in Khost \nProvince in July 2009, I asked our Indiana National Guard members if \nthere was one thing I could do for them, what would that be? I expected \nthem to tell me about safety vests or about new trucks. They said, Joe, \nwe have this handled here. What we need more than anything is a chance \nto have a job when we get home. We owe our servicemembers that \nopportunity.\n  From Hoosiers serving our Nation in Afghanistan and around the world \nto the communities of Vincennes and Madison and Plymouth and Gary, the \nmessage is the same everywhere. It is about jobs, and the chance to go \nto work and take care of your family. So how do we take the Hoosier \ncommonsense approach, focus on jobs and create the conditions needed \nfor our people and our businesses to succeed?\n  I propose an opportunity agenda. Government doesn't create jobs; \nbusinesses create jobs. So let's create the opportunities, help put the \nconditions in place for our businesses in Indiana and around the \ncountry to be able to create more jobs, put the programs in place for \nall of the American people to be ready to hit the ground running on day \none. Because if we don't have a job, nothing else works. We can talk \nabout health care, we can talk about climate change, we can talk about \nany other issue, but if we don't have the chance to go to work and earn \na living and take care of our family, nothing else works.\n  That is why earlier this month I conducted a series of roundtable \nmeetings in eight different Hoosier communities trying to get ideas \nfrom Hoosier businesses, community leaders, and educators, asking one \nsimple question: How can we help our entrepreneurs, our small business \nowners, the men and women who go to work every day, how can we help \nthem create more jobs? So in creating an opportunity agenda built on \nHoosier common sense, I heard loudly and clearly: The place to start is \nwith education and with training.\n  In every community I went to, I heard about the skills gap: jobs that \nare currently going unfilled--opportunities that are there for the \ntaking but we have to have workers who have the skills our employers \nneed. Getting a job is a two-way street. Both Hoosier companies and \nHoosier workers have responsibilities. We can't expect a good job and \ngood pay if we don't bring some skills to the table.\n  I heard from a welding trainer in Gary, IN, from an IT company in \nNoblesville, and from rural health care providers in Terre Haute, IN, \nand the message was the same, and it resonates across the board and \nacross the State: Employers need more skilled workers. Good skills \nequal good jobs.\n  That is why I helped introduce the bipartisan AMERICA Works Act, \nwhich modifies Federal training programs to place a priority on those \nprograms and those certifications demanded by today's businesses and \ntoday's industries.\n  The improvements in this bill are a benefit for both workers and \nemployers. Workers would know the time they spend training is more \nlikely to lead to a good job. For employers, they will be more likely \nto hire people they know have the training they need to be productive \nthe moment they walk in the door.\n  We also have to make sure our businesses do not get overwhelmed by \nregulations. In Fort Wayne I heard about businesses dealing with too \nmany regulations that don't make any sense for their particular \nindustry. It is time to get rid of the bureaucratic mess and to keep \nwhat works. Regulations should be like the umpire on the field: Make \nsure everyone is playing by the rules, make sure the rules are common \nsense, and then stay in the background. Regulations should protect the \nhealth and safety of our families and our workers while not creating \nunnecessary burdens for our business owners.\n  Further, the regulatory system should give businesses the certainty \nthey need to plan for the future and the ability to compete with anyone \nanywhere in the world.\n  We need to go all-in on American energy. This helps our businesses, \nhelps our families, and helps national security. I was in Lawrenceburg, \nIN, a beautiful town right along the Ohio River. When I was there, I \nheard of one of the companies located there, a trucking company, that \nis trying to turn their fleet into a natural gas fleet. They are \ninterested in making that transition, but the front-end costs are high \nand the infrastructure isn't in place yet. So developing American \nenergy sources makes sense for American business, makes sense for our \nfamilies, and makes sense for national security.\n  Let's keep more of our hard-earned dollars in Indiana--or in \nWisconsin, the home State of the Presiding Officer--by investing in \nhomegrown energy including solar, coal, wind, oil, natural gas, \nbiodiesel, ethanol, nuclear.\n  We are blessed with an abundance of energy right here in America. It \nmakes us stronger, creates jobs, reduces our debt, and gives us a \nchance to make our Nation safer.\n\n[[Page S2928]]\n\n  I support projects such as the Keystone Pipeline because it creates \njobs, puts people to work, and has significant bipartisan support. That \nis an example of a commonsense investment in domestic energy that both \nsides of the aisle can support.\n  These are just a few of the ideas I have gotten from people who are \ncreating jobs, running businesses, meeting payroll, employing our \nneighbors, and growing our businesses all across Indiana.\n  There is a whole lot more wisdom in Washington, IN, than there is in \nWashington, DC. A big reason for this is because Hoosiers, as many \nAmericans, are focused on just getting things done, working together. \nIt is not about partisanship, and it is not about politics. In Indiana \nit is about common sense and trying to solve the problem. It is about \nan opportunity agenda that creates jobs for hard-working people and a \ngood life for their families. That is what it is all about.\n  Here is what I am about: taking the best ideas from both parties, \nboth sides of this Chamber, and getting things done--starting with \njobs. As Hoosiers, we do not care if you are a Democrat; we do not care \nif you are a Republican; we care if you are ready to go to work on what \nmatters most.\n  We make decisions based on what is best for our families. We take \npride in making the checkbook balance and making tough choices \nnecessary to make that possible. We expect the same from our \ngovernment. Keep taxes low, cut waste, and do not throw more money at \nthe problem. Just try to solve the problem.\n  Hoosiers are hard working. We do not want a free lunch; all we want \nis a fair shake. We believe respect is earned through the sweat and the \nhard work we put in every single day. We do not expect to receive \nanything we have not earned.\n  Hoosier common sense tells us that our families are all better off \nwhen we have stronger communities and more opportunities for businesses \nand workers. We take care of our brothers and sisters in need, not with \na handout but by providing them with the opportunity to work hard and \nto build a better life.\n  We have a proud tradition of Senators from Indiana who have embodied \nthese principles of Hoosier common sense: from Senator Lugar's decades \nof leadership in matters of commonsense foreign policy, his leadership \nin saving over 100,000 Hoosier auto jobs, and his constant efforts on \nbehalf of Indiana's farmers, from Lake Michigan to the Ohio River; to \nSenator Birch Bayh's tireless efforts to expanding voting rights and \nequality for women through his efforts on title IX; to Senator and Vice \nPresident Dan Quayle's bipartisan efforts to pass job training \nlegislation; to Senator Evan Bayh flexing his independence and his \npassion to get our fiscal house in order; and to my current colleague, \nSenator Dan Coats, in his efforts to keep our Nation safe.\n  The people of Indiana expect their leaders to put Hoosier common \nsense ahead of partisanship. We expect our Senators not to be the \nloudest people in the building but the hardest working people in the \nbuilding, and in my case to make my job about making sure I am looking \nout for their jobs.\n  I am honored to be here in this Chamber working every day--not \nbecause I work for anybody here; I work for everyone back home. That is \nmy mission, that is my job, and I am incredibly privileged to do that.\n  God bless Indiana. God bless the United States.\n  Madam President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let me congratulate my colleague from my \nneighboring State of Indiana, Senator Donnelly, on his first speech on \nthe floor of the Senate. I can tell you, as a downstater in Illinois, I \ncan identify with so many things he said about his State and his pride \nin his State and his feelings about his responsibility as the new \nSenator from the Hoosier State.\n  I thank him so much for that comment and look forward to working with \nhim for many years to come as we represent adjoining States.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 745 to Amendment No. 741\n\n  Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask that it be \ncalled up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 745 to amendment No. 741.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n       This Act shall become effective 1 day after enactment.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would like to explain where we stand \non the pending legislation. This is a bill which has been introduced by \nSenators Enzi, Alexander, Heitkamp, and myself. It is S. 743. Pending \nnow on this bill is the managers' amendment, which we have crafted, and \na second-degree amendment, which is a slight technical change.\n  The reason we are at this stage is because we are looking for \ncolleagues to come forward if they have amendments to this bill. We \nwould like to entertain those amendments. We hope they are germane and \nrelevant amendments and not far afield from the important subject \nmatter before us. But I made this announcement yesterday, again this \nmorning, and I make it now: Any Member of the Senate who is interested \nin amending the bill, please come to the floor with your amendment. \nSenator Enzi and I will be happy to work with you if we can accept it. \nIf we cannot, we will at least give an opportunity for debate and a \nvote.\n  We want to finish this bill this week. We are going to stay until we \nfinish it, so the sooner Members get serious about their amendments the \nmore likely it is we will be able to leave this week.\n  So that is the state of play on S. 743.\n  I have spoken to the substance of this bill several times, but I see \nsome Members on the floor seeking recognition. At this point I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Harkin and Mr. Sanders pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. Con. Res. 15 are printed in today's Record under \n``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, before I yield the floor to the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, I would like to again make the point I made earlier.\n  Pending before the Senate is S. 743. This is the Marketplace Fairness \nAct cosponsored by myself, Senator Enzi, Senator Heitkamp, Senator \nAlexander, and others. This matter is now pending before the Senate, \nand we are asking all Members with amendments to please bring them to \nthe floor. I know the Senator from Arkansas has heard that call, and \nthat is why he is here. We want to move this forward and have an active \ndebate on this issue. We are asking our colleagues not to put it off. \nIf we want to wrap this up in a timely fashion, we need their \ncooperation. So I urge all offices, if you have an amendment, please \ncome to the floor and discuss it with Senator Enzi and me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I wish to talk about amendment No. 740, which is an \namendment I am offering with the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Blunt. We \nunderstand there will be an objection to this. I will not ask unanimous \nconsent to call it up at this moment. Hopefully, one of our colleagues \nwill arrive in a minute to do that.\n  Let me say first that I am for the Marketplace Fairness Act. I am a \ncosponsor. I believe it is the right thing to do. It is an issue I have \nbeen working on since my time more than 10 years ago in the attorney \ngeneral's office in the State of Arkansas when we were trying to set up \na multistate compact about how to collect sales tax on the Internet. \nThis is taxes on Internet sales on the Internet.\n  What I am talking about today, the Pryor-Blunt amendment, is \ndifferent. We are talking about amendment No. 740, which is sometimes \nconfused with it, but basically amendment No. 740 deals with the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act--sometimes called ITFA, of all things--but \nnonetheless, basically it does just a few things.\n  First, it makes it clear that online retailers will not begin to have \nto pay\n\n[[Page S2929]]\n\nadditional tax just for doing business online. So the way this works is \nthat right now States and cities, counties, et cetera, are prohibited \nfrom taxing Internet service. We are not talking about sales tax, we \nare talking about Internet service, the Internet service itself. This \nis a moratorium that has been around for a long time. Amendment No. 740 \nis the amendment that would extend this for 10 years.\n  This is a clean extension. Basically, there are some States that have \nbeen grandfathered under the current moratorium. They will continue to \nbe grandfathered. We do not cover things such as voice, audio, video. \nThat is a separate issue. We are talking about just the Internet \nitself.\n  This also does not have any negative impact on the Universal Service \nFund, 9-1-1, e911, and other fees like those. Those are separate. We \nhave crafted this very carefully to do just a straight and clean 10-\nyear extension.\n  We understand there will be an objection to this. Before we hear that \nobjection, I yield the floor for my colleague from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Let me quickly yield to my friend from Oklahoma for a \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask that at the conclusion of the remarks by the \nSenators from Arkansas and Missouri, that I be recognized as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. As my good friend from Arkansas said and for the benefit \nof the Senator from Oregon, we haven't made a request yet for this \namendment to be moved to the front of the line to be debated, but we \nare here to say that we would like to have this amendment on this bill. \nWe are both supporters of the Marketplace Fairness Act for reasons that \nI hope we have well established, and I think people, including Members \nof the Senate, are beginning to understand that it is a fairness \nprinciple.\n  But what this amendment does, recognizing the importance of online \ncommerce, that it has grown dramatically since 1998 when this amendment \nfirst became part of the law, the Internet Tax Freedom Act--and in \n1988, it said that you wouldn't tax the Internet itself for use of the \nInternet. Unless we act, this law will expire in 2014. This would be a \n10-year extension that would simply say that we would continue to \nensure that people's access to Internet services is tax free.\n  To be clear, the underlying bill we are considering, the Marketplace \nFairness Act, doesn't create a new tax. It doesn't tax consumers' use \nof the Internet, and Senator Pryor and I both would oppose taxing use \nof the Internet at this point. But this simply adds to the fair tax \ncollection processes that will be available to States under the \nMarketplace Fairness Act by extending current law to ensure without any \nquestion that this is not about taxing the Internet.\n  In fact, this amendment would extend for a decade the almost 15-year \nprohibition on taxing the Internet, the one that goes back to 1998.\n  So I support the Marketplace Fairness Act. I believe this bill would \nbe even better if it clarified for the next decade that we continue to \nmaintain the view the Congress and the Federal Government has had on \nthe Internet since the Internet first emerged as an avenue of commerce \nand would not allow for the taxing of the Internet and prevents those \ntaxes from being collected.\n  I yield for my friend from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to ask the Senator from Arkansas \nif he would yield for a question through the Chair.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Be glad to, Madam President.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, pending before us is S. 743, the \nMarketplace Fairness Act, and this legislation would require Internet \nretailers selling into States with sales taxes to collect the sales \ntax. The Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from Missouri have \noffered a different piece of legislation relating to the Internet. I \nwould like to ask the Senator from Arkansas if he would please clarify \na few things.\n  First, is there any tax imposed by this Marketplace Fairness Act on \nthe use of the Internet?\n  Mr. PRYOR. No, there is no tax in this amendment. Amendment 740, in \nfact, extends the moratorium on taxing the Internet.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am asking before your amendment is adopted. The \nunderlying bill has no tax on access to the Internet.\n  Mr. PRYOR. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So the Senator is suggesting the extension of protecting \nAmerica's right to access the Internet from being taxed; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. PRYOR. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So for those who would come to the floor and argue \nsomehow this bill is going to inhibit or restrain Americans in the use \nof the Internet, it does not, and the Pryor-Blunt amendment, which is \nbeing offered, extends for 10 years this prohibition against taxing \naccess to the Internet.\n  I ask the Senator from Arkansas: The last time this was considered, \ndoes the Senator know when and what the disposition of that matter was?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I am not familiar with the history of that. Would the \nSenator from Illinois know that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. My impression--and I could be mistaken--is it was adopted \nby voice vote. The amendment the Senator is offering giving a 7-year \nprotection against taxes for using the Internet was adopted by voice \nvote. It was clearly unanimous--at least there were no objections--on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  So what is being offered by the Senators from Arkansas and Missouri, \non behalf of Internet users all over the United States to protect them \nfrom being taxed on this measure, is over and above anything in this \nbill but is consistent with policy we have lived with for 15 years, if \nI am not mistaken. I think the Senator from Missouri mentioned it was \n15 years. From my point of view, this is a friendly amendment, it is an \namendment which is good for America, it protects our access to the \nInternet, and it does not jeopardize--does not jeopardize--the \nunderlying legislation.\n  In fact, if I am not mistaken, the two sponsors are cosponsors or at \nleast have supported the underlying Marketplace Fairness Act.\n  I thank the Senator from Arkansas for yielding for those questions.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I see my colleague from Oregon is here, and he has a long \nhistory with this legislation and other legislation similar to it. Let \nme make one final point before I try to set aside the current amendment \nand bring up 740 to make it pending.\n  My final point is this: The Internet has been an amazing success \nstory. It is unbelievable how successful it has been, how diverse, and \nhow robust. But we think of it as ubiquitous. The truth is, it is not. \nIn the United States, 80 percent of American households have access to \nthe Internet, but only 65 percent take it. So only 65 percent of people \nin this country actually utilize the Internet and take Internet \nservice.\n  I am afraid if we do add a tax, if the State and local governments \nadd a tax, it will make it less affordable. A lot of people do not take \nInternet service because they cannot afford it. So I am afraid if we \nallow State and local governments to tax access to the Internet--tax \nthe service itself--then we will see that effort hurt even more.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and call \nup amendment No. 740 to make it pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I do this to have a colloquy with my friend \nfrom Arkansas. I want him to understand that I have stayed off the \nfloor of this body for well over 1 day for the sole purpose of trying \nto see if we can bring both sides together on this issue. I think that \nis important, and I have already acknowledged I am willing to look at \nhow we could bring both sides together, recognizing the Quill decision.\n  As I have already said, I have looked at compacts between States and \nthings of this nature, and I have made repeated offers to the advocates \nof this bill, offering specifics on paper, and essentially nothing is \noffered in return other than: We have the votes and we are going to \ncoerce you, as Oregonians, to go along with this.\n\n[[Page S2930]]\n\n  What I wish to do just for a moment is explain why I have to object. \nI think the Senator knows I authored the Internet tax freedom bill in \nthe Senate back in 1998, and I did it because I thought it was \nimportant to have the defense shield against potentially thousands of \ntaxing jurisdictions singling out the Internet for these kinds of \ntaxes. Regrettably, the underlying bill is going to be a targeted \nstrike on the Internet. It is not going to be a defense shield. It \nwould, as it stands today, serve as an amendment that would undercut \nwhat we sought to do back in 1998.\n  As the original author here, I am looking forward to working with the \nSenator under any circumstance to reauthorize a law that I think has \nworked. All the law says is you have to do offline what you do online. \nIf we boil it down, it is a nondiscrimination law. This comes up the \nnext year, and the Commerce and Finance Committees both have interests \nin this. We have always worked cooperatively in these areas. I remember \nour experience together on nanotechnology.\n  So I just have to say I am going to have to object at this time, but \nI am very interested in working with my colleague, with Senator Durbin, \nand Senator Blunt, who was just here, to come up with an arrangement \nthat goes to the heart of this question; that is, should States such as \nOregon be coerced, required to collect these online taxes for States \nthat are thousands of miles away. The refrain throughout this whole \ndiscussion has been this is a States rights bill.\n  I respect that, but what it translates into is folks say they are for \nStates rights if they think the State is right and the State is willing \nto go along with this particular approach that has come out of \nWashington, DC, which is they would be coerced into collecting these \nsales taxes for jurisdictions from thousands of miles away. In some \ncases--New Hampshire and other places have been making this point as \nwell--it would be discriminatory because the online sector would be \nsubjected to requirements that were not required of brick-and-mortar \nretailers. Again, this undermines our vision for the tech sector, which \nhas been about bricks and clicks. We want both the brick-and-mortar \nretailers and the online people to do well. I know the Senator from \nArkansas agrees with that as well.\n  So I haven't said anything on the floor of this body on a matter my \nconstituents feel very strongly about for going on 2 days, until just \nnow, solely for purposes of working with my friend from Arkansas and \nthe distinguished leader from Illinois, Senator Durbin, and I will \ncontinue to do that. But at the end of the day, States rights, to some \nextent, has to have an element of voluntariness. If States rights has \nno element of voluntary judgments by States, it is pretty hard to say a \nState has any rights. The State truly is going to be coerced when we \nhave reached the point, as I would characterize it, where we are going \nto say in Washington, DC, we believe in States rights if we think the \nState is right and they are going to go along with the approach we have \ndictated.\n  In my part of the world, to show the irony of this situation, \nWashington State has a sales tax. Oregon does not have a sales tax. \nThere are differential tax considerations in both jurisdictions, and we \noften make agreements in terms of how we do business. So we have shown \nit is possible to deal with this issue, and I want my colleague from \nArkansas and my friend from Illinois to know I am willing to set aside \nabsolutely everything and work around the clock to see if we can find \nsome common ground, with my theory being it is hard to say it is a \nStates rights approach if a State is unable to have any element in the \nprocess with respect to its own judgment, its voluntary judgment, about \nwhat it wants to do.\n  So I object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am disappointed. I am disappointed \nbecause I know this was a good-faith effort on behalf of the Senators \nfrom Arkansas and Missouri to make certain Americans across the board \nwouldn't have to pay a tax to use the Internet. That has been policy \nfor 15 years. We just had an opportunity to extend it for 10 more years \nand there was an objection by the Senator from Oregon.\n  I know in his heart of hearts he didn't want to object because I know \nhis commitment to the Internet and what a difference it has made in \nthis country. Here is the problem he faces and the reason he objected, \nif I can try to interpret what he just said. There are five States in \nAmerica with no sales tax--five States. No State sales tax in Alaska, \nOregon--the home State of the Senator--Montana, New Hampshire, and \nDelaware. No sales tax. That means, because that State has decided \nthere will be no sales tax, the people living in that State who make a \npurchase at a store pay no sales tax--visitors as well, no sales tax. \nThose who buy things over the Internet in that State don't pay a sales \ntax either. That is the State's decision. We don't change that a bit. \nIf this underlying bill passes, that will continue.\n  There is no coercion--which the Senator from Oregon uses as his \nterm--on the State of Oregon to impose any sales tax on their citizens, \non the people buying in their State. It is their State right to decide. \nWhat this bill does impact is the Internet retailer in Oregon selling \nproducts in the State of Illinois. When Nike or Columbia sell products \nin the State of Illinois, the Supreme Court told us Congress has to \ndecide, if they sell a product in the State of Illinois to an Illinois \nconsumer, do they have to collect the Illinois sales tax. That is what \nthe bill says. That is all it says.\n  So at the end of the day, here is the question: If you are Nike and \nyou are located in Oregon and you decide to do Internet sales--which I \nbelieve they do--but you also decide to have Nike shops available--and \nwe have seen them in malls--what is the law going to be? You know what \nthe law is going to be if you are Nike and you want to come and open a \nshop in a mall near Chicago--you play by the rules of Chicago and \nIllinois.\n  If we require certain filings with our government, if we require you \npay certain property taxes, if we require you collect certain sales \ntaxes--rules of the road: If you want to do business in Illinois, you \nplay by Illinois rules. The same thing holds true if I want to open a \nbusiness in Oregon; I play by Oregon rules.\n  Now the question: If you don't physically locate in Illinois but sell \ninto Illinois, do you still have to play by Illinois rules? That is \nwhat this bill says. That is not coercion.\n  Nike can decide they don't want to sell in Illinois because they \ndon't want to collect the sales tax in Illinois. That is their business \ndecision. Let it be. But if they want to come and use the customers of \nIllinois to make a profit, all we are saying to them is: Collect the \nsales tax. Why? Because their competitors in Illinois--the families who \nhave opened the shops and the stores--are collecting sales tax every \nday from their customers. They are finding people who are showrooming, \nwalking into the running shoe store, trying on all the shoes, and \nsaying, Just great, let me write something down here, see you later, \nand then going to the Internet and buying those shoes over the Internet \nwithout paying the sales tax. What happens to the store they used to \ntry on the shoes? Eventually, they lose business and sometimes they go \nout of business.\n  We are trying to level the playing field. No coercion. Oregon, make \nup your own laws for your own citizens and people who do business \nthere. We don't change a word of it. But if you want to do business in \nanother State, we are asking that you collect the sales tax of that \nState. In fact, we provide the software free for you to do it.\n  I am sorry the Senator from Oregon objected to the Internet freedom \nbill offered by the Senators from Arkansas and Missouri. It is a good \none. It is one we would have liked to have seen part of this \ndiscussion. I hope before this conversation and debate end that we get \na chance to reconsider.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, by unanimous consent, I was to be \nrecognized after the conclusion of the remarks of the Senators from \nMissouri and Arkansas. I wish to ask when that would be, because this \nis going on and on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n[[Page S2931]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to pose a question \nto my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, if I would be able to engage the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, with his leave, I could take about 5 minutes or so--no \nmore--to respond to the points Senator Durbin has made. That would be \nthe end of my time, and I believe the Senator from Oklahoma would be \nnext.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I do not object to that, but I would ask \nthe Senator from Arkansas if he has any objection to that. I want to be \nsure to get in the queue sometime here.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, very briefly to respond to comments made by \nmy friend from Illinois, this legislation has nothing to do with Nike. \nNike of course is a very large company and has stores and trucks and a \nphysical presence all over the United States. They pay taxes because of \nthat physical presence under the Quill decision. So the comments by my \ncolleague from Illinois are very unfortunate, because they misstate \nwhat this debate is all about.\n  This debate is about the little guy.\n  Later on this afternoon, Senator Merkley and I are going to come to \nthe floor of the Senate and actually read accounts from small \nbusinesses here in our State. They are people who don't have a physical \npresence all over the country, and they are scratching their heads this \nafternoon and they are saying to themselves, How in the world are we \npossibly going to be able to comply with this, because in a difficult \neconomy, we are barely able to make ends meet. We are going to have to \ngo out and spend time and money and staff figuring out how to do this.\n  That is what this is about. Are we going to take something like our \ncurrent policy--which is the defensive shield against discriminatory \ntreatment from these tech-based online businesses--and turn it into a \ntargeted strike on them, which this legislation does, or are we going \nto work together, which is what I have tried to do pretty much nonstop \nsince Monday, to see if we can find some kind of common ground? Part of \nthe challenge is we have to get some equity even in terms of the \namendments, because it looks as though one side is getting to offer \ntheirs and another side may be foreclosed.\n  I am going to continue to try to reach out to colleagues on both \nsides of this debate. But I appreciate very much the courtesy of my \nfriend from Oklahoma, because I had to clarify that this amendment is \nabout the small, innovation-oriented businesses that we think are the \nfuture and the center of this debate since it got going. I thank my \ncolleague from Oklahoma for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, my good friend from Pennsylvania, Senator \nToomey, and I had an amendment that we put forth several weeks ago back \nin the time when we did not know for sure whether sequestration was \ngoing to become a reality. We have some comments to make about that.\n  I will be yielding to the Senator from Pennsylvania in a moment, but \nI first want to make an observation here, that anytime a bureaucracy is \nforced to cut, they will find the one thing the people of America want \nmost and that is what they will cut. There is no better example of this \nthan the FAA. I went around with them for quite some time on the pilots \nbill of rights last summer. We were able to get something done. But I \nknow they are a very powerful agency. There is no question about that.\n  To give you an example of that, the FAA began furloughing traffic \ncontrollers--and others too--on April 21. This is what is interesting, \nand you have to pay attention to this. The cuts that were going to come \nto the FAA through sequestration amounted to 5 percent of the FAA's \nbudget to bring it down to 2010 levels.\n  The FAA operations budget has grown by 109 percent since 1996. That \nhas more than doubled since 1996.\n\n  On April 22, the first day after furlough took effect, over 400 \nflights were cancelled and nearly 7,000 flights were delayed. That, my \ngood friends, is a way of making people miserable to bring them around \nto their way of thinking that somehow there is not enough fat in a \nbureaucracy that has more than doubled in the last 15 years that they \nhave to take these drastic steps. The FAA has the flexibility to reduce \nthe costs, but they have not attempted to do that.\n  As I said, very clearly, in 1996, the FAA's operating budget was $4.6 \nbillion. In 2012, the operation budget was $9.7 billion. I don't know \noff the top of my head of another bureaucracy that has grown that much \nin that period of time. The FAA operations budget has increased by $5.1 \nbillion over 14 years. That is 109 percent.\n  The furloughs of the air traffic controllers are expected to save \nonly $200 million. I wish I had a chart here to show you what a small \npercentage that $200 million is of the increase of $5.1 billion over 14 \nyears. I think it is very important that we talk about that in light of \nsome of the things we are trying to do with sequestration. That was the \nFAA.\n  Unfortunately, it is our defense system that has been taking all the \nhits. Here we have the defense at 18 percent of the budget and they are \ntaking 50 percent of the hits. This is after the President through his \nprograms has knocked down spending levels by $487 billion over this 10-\nyear period, and sequestration would be another $\\1/2\\ trillion--which \nin the mind and the statements of the Secretary of the Defense at that \ntime, Secretary Panetta, would be devastating, to use his words. So \nthat is where we are right now.\n  When the majority leader last night introduced an amendment that \nwould transfer the overseas contingency operations funds from the \nfiscal years of 2014, 2015, and 2016 to offset the sequester impacts in \nthe current year, I think this is not implementable because he uses \nfuture appropriations to offset current year spending. It is also \ndangerous to continue to hollow out our military.\n  A couple days ago I talked about how we are comparable today in the \nhollow force we are approaching to what we were in the 1970s and the \n1990s. Now it could actually be worse. In one of the hearings we had, \none of the chiefs of the military made the statement that this would \nnot be just as bad--it would be worse.\n  That is what we are faced with right now. I think we need to look \nvery carefully and make sure we do not allow our warfighters--every \ntime you cut their money out of the OCO account, that increases risk. \nIncreasing risk increases lives lost. That is how serious this is.\n  Now back to our amendment we put together some time ago. This was \nback before March 1, which was when the realization appeared that \nsequestration was going to be a reality, and it was this: If the whole \npurpose of sequestration is to save money out of the budget, and if you \ncome along with something that says: We will live with the top line \nthat is dictated by sequestration but we would ask that the chiefs of \nthe services be allowed to make those decisions as to where the cuts \nwould be. I had occasion to call all five service chiefs, and it has \nbeen reaffirmed in the last 2 weeks by them in public hearings that if \nthey could take this top line that would be so devastating to their \nservice--and this was the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force. If they \ncould determine where some of that was, would it be less devastating, \nNo. 1? No. 2, would you be able to do it? The answer was yes and yes.\n  I think the Senator from Pennsylvania and I had a very good idea, and \nwe are here today to talk about that.\n  With that, I yield for my friend from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Oklahoma \nfor his leadership and work, and say a few words, and then I am going \nto make a unanimous consent request in this regard--but first a little \nbit of context here.\n  This Federal Government has doubled in size in the last 12 years. \nTotal spending is up 100 percent in a little over a decade. What the \nsequester amounts to is 2.5 percent of this gigantic bloated \ngovernment. But it is actually less than that in a very meaningful way, \nbecause the 2.5 percent we referred to--the sequestration, this cut--\n\n[[Page S2932]]\n\nis a reduction in the permission to spend. We call it budget authority. \nWhat it is is permission for the government to spend money. It actually \ntakes a while for the government to get around to spending the money \nthat is authorized in any given year. So the actual reduction in \nspending, the real reduction in cash that will go out the door in this \nfiscal year if the sequester goes into effect is a little over 1 \npercent, about 1.25 percent. That is what we are talking about.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle say, This is impossible; \nyou can't do it; it will be devastating. They predicted all kinds of \ncalamity if a government that has grown by 100 percent has to find 1 \npercent to trim over the next 6 months.\n  Here is another point we ought to keep in mind. If the cuts and \nsequester hold, if we achieve the savings that were signed into law, \nthat were voted on by both Chambers, and that the President of the \nUnited States agreed to by virtue of his signature--if we do, then \ntotal spending this year will still be greater than last year. And we \nare told that is somehow a Draconian austerity program.\n  What we are talking about is a modest reduction in the rate at which \nthis Federal Government grows. That is all we are talking about here. \nAnd we are told that is not possible; there is no way you can do it.\n  That is simply not true. One of the things that is maddening to me is \nthe administration--and the President is responsible for this. They are \nwillfully choosing to make the cuts in the most disruptive way they \ncan, because they have got so much invested in this idea that we can't \ncut any spending. Because they predicted such dire consequences and \nsuch disaster, they can't very well allow reasonable and manageable \ncuts to take place which would be easily attained. So we have this \nextremely irresponsible set of cuts that are completely unnecessary.\n  Let me zero in a little bit on the FAA budget itself. The sequester \nis in effect now. If it holds--if it is fully implemented--the FAA \nbudget will, as a result, be larger than the President asked for in his \nbudget submission.\n  Does anybody think when the President submitted his budget request he \nwas intending to shut down air traffic control operations? I can assure \nyou he didn't tell us that at the time.\n  The fact is there are plenty of places where we can achieve this \nsavings. The administration knew this day was coming for over 1 year. \nThere has been plenty of time to plan for this and to prioritize.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma points to the huge growth in the FAA's \nbudget. That is wildly disproportionate to any growth in flights. There \nare plenty of opportunities to achieve the savings, as evidenced by the \nfact that the President never asked for all this money.\n  Let me give a few examples of places where the President, within the \nFAA budget, could be tightening belts so we don't have to furlough air \ntraffic controllers.\n  For instance, the FAA spends $540 million a year on consultants. That \nis nice. I am not sure all of that is as important as keeping planes \nflying in the air. The FAA operates a fleet of 46 aircraft. That costs \n$143 million a year--very nice indeed. Probably not as important as \nmaking sure planes are coming and going from La Guardia and Kennedy and \nNewark and Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and across the country. The FAA \nbudget includes $1 billion more in grants for airport improvements. I \nam a pilot. I fly in and out of lots of airports and it is great when a \nnice little airport has a new taxiway, terrific, but is it truly as \nimportant as keeping our air traffic controllers there on the job? \nThese are the kinds of tradeoffs we ought to be making.\n  My Republican colleagues and I have been offering a wide range of \nsolutions. Senator Blunt had the idea that maybe we ought to treat \nFederal workers, in this context, the context of the sequestration, the \nsame way we do in other emergencies and designate essential workers. \nThat makes some sense to me. I think that would make a lot of sense. \nJerry Moran has another idea for how we could address this.\n  Senator Inhofe and I introduced a bill before the sequester went into \neffect. What we said was let's give the President the maximum \nflexibility--right? The reason they say they have to lay off or \nfurlough air traffic controllers is because they do not have any \nchoice, the law requires it--except they did not want the change in the \nlaw which would have given them the choice. Senator Inhofe and I had a \nbill that would give the administration complete flexibility.\n  I say this because I pointed to a number of areas in the FAA's budget \nwhere I think they could find the savings, avoid furloughing air \ntraffic controllers, but under the approach Senator Inhofe and I \nsuggested, they would not be limited to finding the savings within the \nFAA budget; they could look anywhere in the government for the lowest \npriority spending, the most wasteful spending, the least necessary \nspending or perhaps redundancy and duplication.\n  I will give just another few examples. The GAO has discovered that \nthroughout the Federal Government we have 47 different job training \nprograms. Does anyone truly think we need 47 of these and that by \nconsolidating them maybe we could save some overhead, some \nadministrative costs? Maybe some of them don't work so well.\n  How about the fact that we have 94 different green building \nprograms--94 programs--679 renewable energy programs. This is all over \ngovernment because we have never bothered to scrub this and come up \nwith the savings we could have achieved.\n  Senator Coburn from Oklahoma has offered all kinds of ideas, Senator \nLee from Utah. There are all kinds of places we can save. The fact is, \nespecially in a government that has grown this big, we absolutely can \nfind the little, tiny savings that are required in the sequester so we \ndo not have to do it in a disruptive way.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 799\n\n  That is why I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. 799. I ask unanimous consent the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator from \nPennsylvania. I have heard his arguments. I know he is convinced of his \narguments.\n  There are several things he did not mention. The sequestration we are \ncurrently going through was a bipartisan decision. Both parties agreed \nto do it. In fact, the leadership on the Republican side and the \nleadership on our side voted for it. It was to be the outcome if we did \nnot reach an agreement on the budget, and we did not. So now we are in \nsequestration.\n  When he suggests it is only 1 percent of government spending, I would \nadd a couple of facts. We have exempted a long category of Federal \nspending so it will not be subject to these cuts. For example, we have \nsaid we will not cut the pay for our military 1 penny, so we exempted \nthat part. When we take all the exemptions out, it is not 1 percent of \nour budget. For the agencies affected, it is closer to 5 percent on an \nannual basis. Since there are only 6 months left in the year, it turns \nout to be closer to 10 percent that they have to cut to make the cuts \nfor the remainder of the year, so 1 percent does not quite tell the \nwhole story.\n  Also, in terms of the number of people working for the Federal \nGovernment, the largest increase in Federal employment in the last 10 \nyears has been in the Department of Defense. Why would that be? Two \nwars, that is why. When they talk about the increased number of people \nworking for the Federal Government, don't overlook the fact of the \nDepartment of Defense effort and our effort to make sure the men and \nwomen in uniform were safe and came home safe. So when they talk about \nthat increase, that is part of it.\n  Here is what we have suggested. Instead of just shifting the \nfurniture around in the room, let us avoid what we are facing. We are \nfacing the reality of 6,800 flights a day in America being delayed \nbecause air traffic controllers are being furloughed 1 out of every 10 \ndays. We should avoid that--if not just for convenience, certainly for \nsafety. I agree.\n  When it comes to cutting 70,000 children, little kids, out of the \nHead Start\n\n[[Page S2933]]\n\nProgram, let's agree we should not be doing that. We get one chance at \nthose kids to have a good education and a good life. Don't blow it \nbecause of a sequestration problem.\n  Shall we cut $1.8 billion out of the National Institutes of Health \nmedical research money? $1.8 billion? No. This Senator believes that is \nstupid--shortsighted and stupid. If we don't put money into medical \nresearch, we are not thinking. America leads the world in medical \nresearch. The sequestration should not put us further behind.\n  What I am going to make a unanimous consent request to do is use the \noverseas operations contingency account, an account set aside for \nfuture war which we will not need because this President is bringing \nour troops home from Afghanistan as he did in Iraq.\n  I will object to the consent request of the Senator from Pennsylvania \nand I will make my own after that. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 788\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to \nconsideration of Calendar No. 64, S. 788, a bill to suspend the fiscal \nyear 2013 sequestration and offset with funds from overseas contingency \noperations; that the bill be read three times and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to explain what this amounts to. Let's be very clear. There is no \nmoney in the overseas contingency operation fund. This is barely an \naccounting device. Do you know what this really is? The proposal is \nthat we do away with the sequester and we thereby spend more money and \nwe just pretend it is offset. But the fact is, some time ago, this \nadministration made a decision about the level of our involvement in \nAfghanistan that had nothing to do with this sequester. That has \nnothing to do with the sequester. The fact that we are no longer at war \nthere does not allow us to spend money we do not have.\n  Let me give an analogy. I could come down to the Senate floor and \nsuggest I think it should be the policy of the United States that we \nabsolutely not invade Canada and we not have a war with Canada. Imagine \nthe money we could save if we do not go to war with Canada.\n  So, with all that savings, let's go out and spend it because we have \nthis terrific savings. This proposal is absolutely no more meaningful \nthan if I were to make that suggestion, which obviously everyone \nunderstands is ridiculous.\n  So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I just want to make one postscript. When \nPaul Ryan, the Republican candidate for Vice President and the chairman \nof the House Republican Budget Committee, wrote his 2011 budget, he \nincluded the very fund which the Senator from Pennsylvania refers to as \nthe Canadian invasion fund. So it was a good idea when Paul Ryan had to \nwrite a budget. It is a bad idea when we are trying to avoid the pain \nof sequestration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I also agree we should not invade Canada. \nI live right near there. It would be terrible.\n  What we are hearing and what we have heard now for a number of months \nis a discussion about deficit reduction, about how we proceed and how \nwe address the fact that this country has a $16.6 trillion national \ndebt. That is a serious issue.\n  I think as we contemplate how we address this issue, we have to put \nit into a broader context as to what is going on in the United States. \nWhat is the best way forward in terms of deficit reduction at a time \nwhen the United States has by far the most unequal distribution of \nwealth and income of any major country on Earth. In other words, we \ncannot talk about how we proceed with deficit reduction, we cannot say \nit is OK to cut Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid or nutrition \nprograms when the middle class of this country is disappearing, poverty \nis extremely high, while at the same time the wealthiest people and the \nlargest corporations are doing phenomenally well. Any serious \ndiscussion about deficit reduction has to include those issues.\n  Let me bore you for a moment with some interesting statistics. This, \nin fact, came out just yesterday from the Pew Research Center. What \nthey said is that all the new wealth generated in this country from \n2009 to 2011 went to the top 7 percent of the American households. All \nthe new wealth went to the top 7 percent of American households, while \nthe bottom 93 percent of Americans saw a net reduction in their wealth.\n  The Pew Research Center found that from 2009 to 2011, the mean net \nworth of American households in the top 7 percent rose by 28 percent, \nwhile the mean net worth of the bottom 93 percent of American \nhouseholds went down by 4 percent; in other words, the people on top \nare doing very well, everybody else is not doing well.\n  Over this same time period, the top 7 percent of American households \nsaw their wealth increase by a combined $5.6 trillion--the top 7 \npercent, $5.7 trillion in wealth increase; the bottom 93 percent saw a \nwealth decline of $600 billion. That is what the Pew Research Center \nreported just yesterday.\n  Today, when we talk about distribution of wealth and income, the \nwealthiest 400 individuals in this country own more wealth than the \nbottom half of America. Four hundred people have more wealth than the \nbottom 150 million Americans. Today, one family, the Walton family--\nowners of Walmart--own more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the \nAmerican people; one family has more wealth than the bottom 40 percent.\n  Today--and this is truly a remarkable fact which of course we do not \ntalk about too much--the top 1 percent of Americans own 38 percent of \nall financial wealth. Let's guess what the bottom 60 percent of the \nAmerican people own. The top 1 percent own 38 percent of the wealth. \nThe bottom 60 percent own 2.3 percent of the wealth in America. That is \na rather remarkable and disturbing fact.\n  Today, as Warren Buffett has pointed out, the 400 richest Americans \nare now worth a recordbreaking $1.7 trillion, more than five times what \nwe were worth just two decades ago. Meanwhile, according to a June 2012 \nstudy from the Federal Reserve, median net worth for middle-class \nfamilies dropped by nearly 40 percent from 2007 to 2010. That is the \nequivalent of wiping out 18 years of savings for the average middle-\nclass family.\n  That is distribution of wealth. That is incredibly unequal, \nincredibly unfair, and getting worse and worse. That is something we \nmight want to keep in mind when we talk about how we do deficit \nreduction.\n  Then when we talk about distribution of income, what we earned last \nyear, that is even worse than distribution of wealth, as bad as that \nis. If you can believe it, the last study we have seen on this \nsubject--this is quite amazing--showed that from 2009 to 2011, all the \nnew income created during that time period went to the top 1 percent \nwhile the bottom 99 percent actually saw a decline in their income. All \nthe new income created in that time period, 2009 to 2011, went to the \ntop 1 percent. Real unemployment today is not 7.6 percent, it is 13.8 \npercent if we count those people who have given up looking for work and \nthose people who are working part-time. The youth unemployment rate is \njust horrendous, and it is even higher than the general average.\n\n  Very interestingly, a new poll came out by Gallup that was done just \na few days ago--April 17, 2013. I find the results of that poll very \nremarkable. This poll deals with an issue that very few people in \nCongress are even prepared to talk about, let alone act upon.\n  Here is what the poll from April 17, 2013--this week--said: About 6 \nin 10 Americans--about 60 percent--believe money and wealth should be \nmore evenly distributed among a larger percentage of the people in the \nUnited States, while only one-third of Americans think the current \ndistribution is fair.\n  So when my friends want to cut programs for the middle class and give \ntax\n\n[[Page S2934]]\n\nbreaks to the rich, they should understand that about 60 percent of the \nAmerican people already believe that we have an unfair distribution of \nwealth in America. What is even more interesting, according to this \nGallup poll from a few days ago--and they do this poll every year--is \nthat a recordbreaking 52 percent of the American people believe ``that \nour government,'' i.e, the Congress, ``should redistribute wealth by \nheavy taxes on the rich.'' Again, that is 52 percent of the American \npeople who believe that.\n  How many Members of the Congress get up and come close to reflecting \nwhat a majority of the American people want? The American people know \nthat the middle class is collapsing. They know poverty is unacceptably \nhigh. They know the wealthy and large corporations are doing \nextraordinarily well, and they want us to do something about it. But \naround here, forget doing something about it. We cannot even talk about \nwhat the American people want us to do.\n  The American people are frustrated with Congress for a whole lot of \nreasons, and certainly at the top of the list is how we are ignoring \nthe economic reality facing the middle class of this country and the \ngrowing wealth and income inequality. They want us to do something \nabout it, and I think it is high time we did.\n  So instead of cutting programs for the middle class, they are giving \nmore tax breaks for those people who don't need it. Maybe we should do \nwhat the American people want and ask the wealthy and large \ncorporations to start paying their fair share of taxes and protect \nworking families.\n  Interestingly enough, we hear from the wealthiest people in this \ncountry and from their organizations. What we hear from them is not: \nHey, we are doing really well. We know this country has a whole lot of \nproblems, and we are prepared to pitch in; we are prepared to help out \nwith deficit reduction. By the way, for those who are on Wall Street, \nremember that it was the American people who bailed out Wall Street. \nInstead of hearing how they are prepared to reciprocate now in \nAmerica's time of need, unfortunately what we are hearing is quite the \ncontrary.\n  Lloyd Blankfein is the CEO of Goldman Sachs, and this is what he said \non November 19, 2012, to CBS:\n\n       You're going to have to undoubtedly do something to lower \n     people's expectations--the entitlements and what people think \n     that they're going to get, because they're not going to get \n     it.\n\n  Blankfein and his friends at the Business Roundtable recently came \nout with a report. Now, the Business Roundtable is the organization \nrepresenting the CEOs of the largest corporations. All of them make \nmillions of dollars a year in salary or benefits. All of them have very \ngenerous retirement benefits. Some of them are worth hundreds of \nmillions of dollars.\n  These people, the Business Roundtable, which consists of Wall Street \nand other large corporations that are doing phenomenally well, came \nforward and said to Congress: You should raise the eligibility age for \nSocial Security and Medicare to 70 and cut Social Security COLAs by \nadopting the so-called chained CPI. The wealthiest people are doing \nphenomenally well, Wall Street gets bailed out by working families all \nover this country, and then these guys come back to Congress and say: \nRaise the retirement age for Social Security and Medicare to 70 years \nof age.\n  Needless to say, my views are a little bit different than Mr. \nBlankfein's or the Business Roundtable. I believe the way to do deficit \nreduction is not by punishing people who are already hurting and \nstruggling to keep their heads above water. We don't punish the sick, \nthe kids, the elderly, or disabled veterans. We need to ask those \npeople who are doing very well to start paying their fair share of \ntaxes.\n  Now I will talk about what I think we should be doing and why we \nshould be doing it. In 1952, 32 percent of all of the revenue generated \nin this country came from large corporations--about one-third of all \nthe revenue. Today just 9 percent of Federal revenue comes from \ncorporate America. In 2011, corporations paid just 12 percent of their \nprofits in taxes. That is the lowest percentage since 1972.\n  In 2005--the last figures we have--one out of four corporations paid \nno Federal income taxes at all even though they collected over $1 \ntrillion in revenue during that 1-year period.\n  In 2011, corporate revenue as a percentage of GDP was just 1.2 \npercent lower than any other major country in the OECD, including \nBritain, Germany, France, Japan, Canada, and many other countries. Each \nand every year corporations and the wealthy are avoiding more than $100 \nbillion in U.S. taxes by sheltering their incomes in the Cayman \nIslands, Bermuda, and other offshore tax havens.\n  So the point is: How do we do deficit reduction? Do we say to an \nelderly woman in the State of Vermont who is trying get by on $14,000 \nor $15,000 a year that we are going to cut her Social Security?\n  Do we say to a disabled vet: Thank you for your service and your \nsacrifice for this country, we are sorry you lost your legs, but we are \ngoing to have to cut your benefits?\n  Do we say to a struggling low-income family trying to survive on one \nor another nutrition program: Sorry, but you may have to go hungry and \nnot get dinner on Wednesday?\n  Do we say to working people who have lost their jobs: We are going to \nhave to cut your unemployment compensation which will make it almost \nimpossible for your family to survive?\n  Is that our approach or do we go to corporate America, which is \nenjoying recordbreaking profits?\n  One out of four corporations pays nothing in taxes. Do we say to \nthem: You know what, it is time you helped us with deficit reduction.\n  I hear a lot of my Republican friends and the President talking about \nhow we need tax reform, but we are going to do it deficit neutral. No, \nI beg to differ. We do need tax reform. We do need to end the absurdity \nof losing huge amounts of money because of the tax havens in the Cayman \nIslands and Bermuda and elsewhere, but we also have to raise revenue \nwhen we do tax reform. It is not simply lowering tax rates.\n  I will give some examples about how absurd the current situation is \nand why--before we cut Social Security and before we attack programs \nthat the middle class and working families of this country depend \nupon--we have to end these absurd loopholes corporate America is \nenjoying.\n  I have just a few examples. Bank of America is one of the financial \ninstitutions that was bailed out by the American people when their \nrecklessness and greed almost resulted in the collapse of our financial \nsystem. In 2010, Bank of America set up more than 200 subsidiaries in \nthe Cayman Islands, which, of course, has a zero percent tax rate to \navoid paying U.S. taxes. Bank of America set up 200 subsidiaries in the \nCayman Islands. In 2010, not only did Bank of America pay nothing in \nFederal income taxes, but it received a rebate from the IRS worth $1.9 \nbillion that year. Bank of America paid nothing in taxes.\n  In 2010, JPMorgan Chase operated 83 subsidiaries incorporated in \noffshore tax havens to avoid paying $4.9 billion in U.S. taxes. They \navoided paying $4.9 billion.\n  Goldman Sachs is one of the largest institutions in the country. In \n2010, Goldman Sachs operated 39 subsidiaries and offshore tax havens to \navoid an estimated $3.3 billion in U.S. taxes.\n  Citigroup, which is another financial institution that was bailed out \nby the taxpayers of this country, has paid no Federal income taxes for \nthe last 5 years. That is not bad. Many people who are out there \nwatching this are saying: That is pretty good. How did they avoid \npaying income taxes when they are one of the largest corporations in \nAmerica for a 5-year period? That is pretty good.\n  During the last 5 years General Electric made $81 billion in profit, \nwhich is not too shabby. Not only has General Electric avoided paying \nFederal income taxes during these years, it received a tax rebate of $3 \nbillion from the IRS. GE has at least 14 offshore subsidiaries in \nBermuda, Singapore, and Luxembourg for the purpose of avoiding U.S. \nincome taxes.\n  Does anyone still want to know why the American people are cynical \nabout what is going on in Washington? Does anyone want to know why the \nCongress of the United States has an extremely low level of support or \nfavorability? It is because the American people know they are getting \nripped off. They are\n\n[[Page S2935]]\n\nworking 50 or 60 hours a week, and they are paying their taxes. General \nElectric makes $81 billion, and over the last 5 years they have paid \nnothing in taxes. Does anybody vaguely think that is fair?\n  We have some people who say: We want to do tax reform, but we want to \nmake it revenue neutral. We don't want any new income in order to help \nus with deficit reduction. Let's cut Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid, education, but, no, we cannot get new revenue from large \ncorporations.\n  During the last 5 years Verizon made over $48 billion in profits. Not \nonly has Verizon avoided paying Federal income taxes during those \nyears, it received a $535 million rebate from the IRS--not too bad.\n  From 2008 through 2010, not only did Honeywell avoid paying Federal \nincome taxes, it received a $34 million tax refund from the IRS.\n  Merck is a pharmaceutical company. In 2009 not only did Merck pay no \nFederal income taxes, it received a $55 million tax refund from the \nIRS. On and on it goes: Corning, Boeing, Microsoft, Caterpillar, Cisco, \nDow Chemical. I have example after example of large profitable \ncorporations where CEOs make millions and millions of dollars, and they \nsay to the American people: We support cuts in programs for you--Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, you name it--but don't ask us to pay more \nin taxes.\n  This Senate has a decision to make: Do we occasionally--I am not \nasking for much--stand up to the lobbyists, campaign contributors, and \nbig money interests and ask the large corporations and the wealthy who \nare doing phenomenally well to help us with deficit reduction or do we \ncontinue to stick it to the working families and the middle class of \nthis country? That is the challenge and the issue we face. I hope we \nhave the courage to do the right thing.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning \nbusiness for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          National Challenges\n\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise today with some humility because I \nrise in the footsteps of one of Maine's greatest Senators, Olympia \nSnowe. I am fortunate enough to succeed her in this seat. In the midst \nof the campaign a year or so ago, I also realized I was not only \nsucceeding Olympia Snowe but George Mitchell and Ed Muskie, who are two \nof the greatest legislators of the 20th century. So it is with some \ntrepidation to be standing on the shoulders of those great Members of \nthis body.\n\n  Most speeches we hear in this Chamber are on a topic of the day--\ntaxation, gun control, fairness of the marketplace--but I think in \norder to understand the issues we are debating, the issues coming \nbefore us on a continuous basis, we have to have some context. We have \nto look back to the history of this body and the history of the \ncountry.\n  My favorite quote from Mark Twain--and there are lots of them, but my \nfavorite is: History doesn't always repeat itself, but it usually \nrhymes. And in this case I believe that is true.\n  Let's start with a very basic question: Why do we have government at \nall? Why are we here? Why do we have this grand edifice? Why do we have \nthe rules and laws and this panoply of the Constitution?\n  Well, it is all about human nature. Unfortunately, part of human \nnature is conflict. Often it is conflict that is resolved by violence. \nHobbes, the British philosopher, said: ``Life is nasty, brutish, and \nshort.''\n  A few years ago, Bill Moyers, whom I believe is one of the wisest \nliving Americans, spoke at the graduation of one of my sons. I was at \nthe graduation because I wanted to see what $100,000 looked like all in \none place at one time. Now it would be $200,000. But Moyers had a very \nprofound observation, and he talked about the propensity of people to \nbe mean to each other, to resolve disputes by violence. He used a \nphrase that has stayed with me, and I think it is very profound: \n``Civilization,'' Moyers said, ``is an unnatural act.'' Civilization is \nan unnatural act. It takes work to maintain civilization from one \ngeneration to the next. The world around us today gives us evidence of \nthis. All one has to do is open the paper: North Korea, the Middle \nEast, and, Lord help us, the Boston Marathon or two little boys in a \nsandbox with one truck. Conflict is part of our human nature.\n  So the basic function, the basic necessity that brings forth any \ngovernment throughout history is to provide security to our citizens, \ninternal and external, and, of course, the Constitution says this in \nthe Preamble: to ``ensure domestic tranquility''--that is Al Capone--\nand ``provide for the common defense''--that is Hitler or al-Qaida. \nBut, then, the paradox is once we create a government, we are handing \nover power to other people, and there is always the danger the \ngovernment itself will become abusive, and that has been true \nthroughout human history.\n  The ancient Latin quote is, ``Who will guard the guardians?'' \nGovernments are about power--power we give up in order for governments \nto serve us. But, again, human nature raises its head. Lord Acton, the \n19th century British philosopher, again had a very profound \nobservation: ``Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts \nabsolutely.'' That is true of all people in all times and in all \nplaces. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\n  So these two questions--why have a government and how do we control \nthe government once we create it--encompasses all one needs to know \nabout political science. Our Constitution is the best answer ever \nprovided to these two questions. It is the best answer, and the Framers \nknew exactly what they were doing.\n  Madison, in the 51st Federalist--and I have to apologize to my female \nSenator friends because Madison only talked in terms of men, but when \nwe hear ``men,'' we think ``men and women.'' He meant that, he just \ndidn't say it. But in the 51st Federalist, here is what he said: ``If \nmen were angels, no government would be necessary.'' We wouldn't need \nit. Then he said:\n\n       If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal \n     controls on the government would be necessary, either. In \n     framing a government which is to be administered by men over \n     men, however, the great difficulty lies in this: You must \n     first enable the government to control the governed; and in \n     the next place, oblige it to control itself.\n\n  That is the whole deal. That is what the Constitution is all about. \nHow did it do it? I think the best analogy for the U.S. Constitution is \nthe homely Vegematic. Remember Billy Mays: It slices, it dices, it \npurees. The Constitution is the Vegematic of power. It slices and \ndices. It lays it out. It divides it between the people and the \ngovernment, between the Federal Government and the States and the \nlocalities, and within the branches of the Federal Government. Power is \nseparated, and that was the theory of the Framers; that this division \nof power--ambition combating ambition--was the structural solution to \nthe danger of the government abusing its own people.\n  Then, finally, they weren't satisfied, and in the ratification of the \nConstitution was adopted the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights is \nnothing more than a sphere of protection around each of us as \nindividuals that says even if the government follows all these arcane \nrules and all these Rube Goldberg procedures and a law comes out at the \nother end, if it violates free speech, it is no good. If it violates \nthe right to bear arms, it isn't valid. If it violates people's right \nto be secure in their persons and possessions, it is off limits. So the \nBill of Rights is the last sword, shield, and buckler that protects us \nfrom an abusive government.\n  The tension between effective government and controlling government \nhas never been resolved in this society. Many of the arguments we are \nhaving now about gun control, the Federal budget, financial regulation, \nhealth care, climate change, and environmental policy are all \nmanifestations of this age-old debate we keep having.\n  What I think is amazing is that the arguments and even the rhetoric--\nthe words themselves--always seem to be about the same. On the \nFederalist side, we always hear about the necessity of national \nsolutions to national problems, universal principles, appeals to \nfairness. On the other side, we hear allegations of tyranny, \nnullification, references to Jefferson's famous quote, that \n``occasionally the tree of Liberty\n\n[[Page S2936]]\n\nmust be watered with the blood of Patriots and Tyrants.'' The 10th \namendment, States rights, and hints of secession, the rhetoric is the \nsame. In fact, the current divisions in this Congress between \ntraditional Democrats and a Republican Party largely driven by the \nanti-Federalist sentiments of the tea party is at least the 10th time \nthis same issue has arisen in American history.\n  The American Revolution itself, No. 1, was a populist revolt against \nconcentrated power far away. Second, the drafting of the Constitution \narose out of the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation. Many of \nus--all of us--sort of feel this government has been what it is \nforever. For 7 or 8 years, between the end of the Revolution and the \ndrafting of the Constitution, we were governed by something called the \nArticles of Confederation, which was too weak. It didn't concentrate \npower enough, and that gave rise to the Constitutional Convention in \n1787.\n  Then, the ratification of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights was \nitself a manifestation of this argument--the argument that the \nwonderful terms ``Federalist'' and ``anti-Federalist'' describe the \ndivision in the country which we are fighting over to this day. I think \nof Harry Reid and Dick Durbin as Hamilton and Adams and McConnell and \nCornyn are the pre-1803 Jefferson and Madison. I say pre-1803 because \nJefferson was the apostle of States rights, but he became President and \nsomehow found in the Constitution the heretofore unknown right to buy \nLouisiana. We are glad he did.\n  The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1800, which were the PATRIOT Act of \nthe day, passed by President John Adams to get at what they thought \nwere seditious activities in the country. Jefferson, when he was Vice \nPresident, secretly wrote a resolution for the Kentucky legislature \nsaying that the Alien and Sedition Acts were null and void in Kentucky \nand were a violation of the constitutional principles.\n\n  The tariff of 1828, known as the Tariff of Abominations, was a tariff \nthat protected northern manufacturers, but it prejudiced the South and, \nlo and behold, South Carolina wanted to nullify it and, in fact, in \n1832 voted to do so. The nullification crisis of 1832 was only averted \nby the election of Andrew Jackson and a compromise tariff that was \npassed in 1834.\n  That is five times already.\n  This is an interesting one. The fugitive slave laws in 1850 were \npassed by the Federal Government and it says if a slave escaped into \nyour State, even if it was a free State, your legal enforcement \ncommunity had to cooperate and return the slave to its master. The \nSupreme Court of the State of Wisconsin in 1854 declared that law \nunconstitutional, void, and of null effect in the State of Wisconsin. \nAgain, it was the tension between the power of the Federal Government \nto remedy national problems and the rights of the States and the people \nto make their own decisions.\n  Of course, tragically, the most dramatic manifestation of this was \nthe Civil War, but the Civil War itself was about this very question. \nWrapped up in States rights and slavery, it was a question of what are \nthe powers of the Federal Government and what are the powers reserved \nto the States and to the people. We all know the tragedy of that event \nand what happened.\n  I think one of the most interesting results of the Civil War is a \nchange in English usage of the term ``United States.'' Prior to the \nCivil War, people in the United States referred to the United States as \na plural noun: the United States are; they are. The United States, they \nare doing this or that. In other words, they referred to themselves as \na collective, as a group of States. After the Civil War, the usage \nwhich we have until today is that the United States is a singular noun, \none country: It is. That is an amazing development. There was no law \npassed, but that showed how the people's view of what their country was \nall about changed.\n  In the early part of the last century, the New Deal and the two \ncrises of depression and war--particularly the Great Depression--the \nissue then was fought out in the Supreme Court, and the U.S. Supreme \nCourt at first said the New Deal laws were unconstitutional. They went \ntoo far. The commerce clause wouldn't stretch that far. Then, of \ncourse, there was a lot of politics and discussion. The case went \nback--I believe it was the ``sick chicken'' case--and the Supreme Court \nsaid: Well, maybe the commerce clause does stretch that far. Historians \nrefer to that as ``the switch in time that saved nine.''\n  The civil rights movement was happening as I was growing up, and \nStates rights was the rhetoric again. What are the powers that we have \nin this city versus the communities and the States.\n  Here we are, No. 10: The tea party and the urge to shrink government. \nThe resistance to the Affordable Care Act. I was always surprised that \nsummer when people were getting red in the face about a health care \nbill. It wasn't the health care bill; it was the perception that \nWashington was somehow taking over something that should have been left \nto them.\n  Gun control is a classic example which we were debating last week, \nand the irony and the difficulty of gun control is the problem is \nlargely local and particularly in urban areas, but the solution is \nnational because the guns being misused in urban areas come from all \nover the country. That is why, in my opinion, we need national \nlegislation; at a minimum background checks and trafficking regulation. \nRegulation itself is an expression of governmental power, and it is \nresisted in many parts of the country.\n  Budgets--finally, budgets. I shouldn't say finally. My wife says I \nsay ``finally'' too much and it gets people's hopes up. Budgets. A \nbudget fundamentally reflects policy. It fundamentally reflects what we \nbelieve about ourselves and about the government. The budget passed by \nthe House--the so-called Ryan budget--is a classic political document. \nI don't mean that in a negative sense. It espouses a philosophy of what \nthis government should be. It is one more step in this discussion.\n\n  I do not believe the Ryan budget is about debt and deficits. It is \nabout shrinking government. That is what the policy is: to reduce the \nsize of the government to a place where it is much smaller.\n  Federal spending is not out of control. Nondefense discretionary \nspending today is the lowest it has been in 50 years. Defense is about \nthe same. What is out of control is all of our spending on health care. \nThat is what is driving the Federal deficit. It is not about debt and \ndeficits, it is about shrinking government.\n  So where does this leave us? An interesting history lesson.\n  I hope something more.\n  First, I think it provides us with a way of understanding what \nseparates us. If we understand what is going on here in this Chamber, I \nthink it helps us.\n  Second, I think it is important, for me anyway, to believe there is \nno right answer to this question. There is no right answer. It cannot \nbe all one or the other. Neither side has exactly the right response. \nWe should not be an uncontrolled, central government, and we should not \nbe a government that is so dispersed that we cannot do anything. The \ntension is hard-wired into our system, but I think it helps us find \nbalanced policy.\n  We need a national government--we need a strong national government--\nfor the same reasons as in 1789: to solve national problems, problems \nthat cannot be solved at the local level either because of the scope of \nthe problem itself--global terrorism: I am sorry, the Brunswick Police \nDepartment cannot deal with all the terrorism--or because piecemeal \nsolutions will not work. Environmental protection has to be done \nlocally, but it also has to be done nationally. Air moves. Polluted \nwater moves.\n  Or immigration. It has to be a national solution.\n  I am sorry, but strangling government in the bathtub is even less \nfeasible today than it was in 1789.\n  Gridlock, which is, if you think about it, gridlock is total victory \nfor the anti-Federalists. Gridlock is not the answer. The Framers knew \nthe government had to work. It may be slow and cumbersome, but, \nultimately, it had to be functional. Madison recognized this, and so \ndid the preamble: ``to form a more perfect Union''--``a more perfect \nUnion''--than that which had been formed by the Articles of \nConfederation.\n\n[[Page S2937]]\n\n  On the other hand, on the other side of this argument, though, \nFederal solutions all the time are not the answer either.\n  There is a grave danger that we all face because our job here is \nmaking laws; and the problem is, if the only tool you have is a hammer, \nevery problem looks like a nail. If the only tool we have is laws, then \nwe are inclined to try to solve every problem. I believe States rights \nare important. I think States have an important role to play in our \nsystem, and I think they are the best places to solve a lot of the \nissues that are facing our country.\n  One of them is education. I remember sitting at home and watching the \ndebate between George W. Bush and Al Gore in 2000, and they were \narguing what size the classroom should be and how big the school should \nbe, and I turned to my wife Mary and said: These guys think they are \nrunning for superintendent of schools.\n  This is not a Federal issue. The Federal Government has a \nresponsibility in education: to fund, to do research, and to help, but \nnot to guide.\n  Overreaching regulation, in my view, is a problem. I believe in \nstructural solutions. I was not a Member of this body, but had I been, \nI suspect I would have opposed Dodd-Frank and supported the restoration \nof the Glass-Steagall Act. I think that is a structural solution \nbecause regulatory solutions always end up being burdensome.\n  A friend of mine in Maine sent me a picture of him sitting next to a \nstack this high of regulations at a community bank as a result of Dodd-\nFrank that they are going to have to abide by. This is a community \nbank. Bangor Savings Bank did not cause the financial crisis of 2008, \nyet they are having to bear the burden of these regulations, which are \nexpensive, which are drying up credit for their customers, and which I \ndo not believe are going to contribute to a solution.\n  Another point on this, on the anti-Federalist side, is that deficits \ndo matter. Deficits do matter. We cannot continue to burden our \nchildren with the costs of government.\n  In a hypercompetitive world, it seems to me that every tax dollar \ncounts and every regulation must be smart and minimally intrusive. This \nis a new world we are in. We are competing not just with companies \naround this country but with companies all over the world, and they \nwant our jobs.\n  Understanding these differences and this age-old argument, we have to \nunderstand that we cannot be enthralled to this debate. We cannot be \nlocked into it. But we do have national challenges. They have to be met \nwith national solutions. Challenges such as cyber threats, research, \ninfrastructure, gun crime, terrorism--and, Boston, by the way, is an \nexample of coordination between levels of government that I think \nworked very effectively.\n  Our failure to act is a disservice to those who built what we have \ninherited. Calls to cut government spending are fine, but they must be \nmatched with specifics. You cannot just talk about government spending \nand not talk about FAA towers or our intelligence community or our \ndefense capability.\n  We have to understand that each generation must meet its own \nchallenges and redefine this question with its eyes open to practical \neffects, without blinders on of absolutism or ideology.\n  As I look back on history, the great accomplishments of the body, the \ngreat accomplishments of this government, have rarely if ever been \nvictories for one side or the other. Instead, they have been based upon \nhard-fought battles and grudging compromise, recognition of national \nneeds along with local interests, and a willingness to honor our most \nbasic charge: to form a more perfect union.\n  I hope in a small way to contribute to this, to contribute to the \nsearch for solutions that are practical and effective. I am caucusing \nwith the Democrats, but I agree with Enzi and Alexander on the \nMarketplace Fairness Act. I agree with Enzi and Alexander on the \nMarketplace Fairness Act, but with Blumenthal and Kaine on guns. I \nagree with Blumenthal and Kaine on guns, but I agree with Coburn on \nduplication and regulation. And I agree with Coburn on duplication and \nregulation, but I agree with Murray on the budget.\n  We face serious challenges--defense, budget, and constantly changing \ncircumstances. We live in a time of accelerated change.\n  Almost exactly 150 years ago, our greatest President sent a message \nto Congress in the midst of the greatest crisis this country has ever \nfaced. His message was about change and about how to deal with change \nand was to try to shake Congress out of the lethargy of politics as \nusual because we were in the midst of the Civil War.\n\n  I cannot argue that the crises we face today collectively or \nindividually equal the Civil War, but they are pretty serious. I have \nbeen in hearings in the last 2 weeks in the Intelligence Committee and \nthe Armed Services Committee, and every single one of the top \nprofessionals in both defense and intelligence have said this is the \nmost dangerous and complicated period they have experienced in their \n35, 40, or 50 years in this business. So we are facing some serious \nchallenges.\n  I want to share with you what I believe is the most profound \nobservation about how we deal with change that I have ever encountered. \nDecember 2, 1862, President Lincoln sent the message, and here is how \nit ended. Here is what Abraham Lincoln said:\n\n       The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy \n     present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we \n     must rise--with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must \n     think anew, and act anew.\n\n  And here is the key line:\n\n       We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our \n     country.\n\n  We must disenthrall ourselves, think in new and different ways, and \nthen we shall save our country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Commending Senator King\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me salute my colleague from Maine for \nan extraordinary maiden speech on the floor of the Senate. It was a \ngreat lesson in history, and those of us who continue to study history \nrealize he has an insight into this Nation which we all should hear and \nshare. I thank him for being here and for sharing his thoughts with us, \nand particularly for being part of the solution to America's challenge.\n  As I said to him when I went up to him, you will never get in trouble \nwith me if you quote somebody from Illinois; he quoted Abraham Lincoln, \nand did it in an extraordinary way.\n  So I thank him and commend him for his fine statement.\n  Pending on the floor is the Marketplace Fairness Act. It is a bill \nwhich has been before this body now for almost a week. It is 11 pages \nlong. It is not a new concept. Members have had ample time to review \nit. We have had three successive votes on the issue--on the budget \nresolution, on cloture on the motion to proceed, and on the motion to \nproceed--and the outcome of those votes were 75, 74, and 75. That is an \nextraordinary majority in this Chamber and indicates a willingness to \ntackle this problem and pass this bill.\n  I have invited my colleagues, as has Senator Enzi, to come to the \nfloor. If you have something you wish to offer to this bill, bring the \namendment to us. It is not that we are going to accept every amendment, \nbut that is not what the process is about. Some of these amendments \nwill be offered for a vote, as they should be, and debated.\n  So far, there has only been one amendment that has actually been \noffered on the floor, and it was objected to by the Senator from \nOregon, Mr. Wyden. The amendment Senator Wyden objected to was called \nthe Internet Freedom Act, and it basically said we would renew our 15-\nyear commitment that we will not tax Americans for access to the \nInternet. I think that is good policy, the Internet Freedom Act. So I \ninvited Senator Pryor to offer that on the underlying bill, and it was \nobjected to by the Senator from Oregon. Make no mistake, the \nMarketplace Fairness Act that Senator Enzi and I and Senator Alexander \nand Senator Heitkamp bring to the floor is not at war with the Internet \nat all. We value it. It is an important part of our economy, an \nimportant part of our lives. We support the notion of Internet freedom \nfrom taxes.\n\n[[Page S2938]]\n\n  What we are trying to achieve, though, is the appropriate role for \nthe Internet when it comes to retail sales. The Marketplace Fairness \nAct levels the playing field between businesses on Main Street or in \nshopping malls and businesses on the Internet. It says, if the business \nin Chicago, IL, on Michigan Avenue has to collect sales tax on sales \nover the counter, then Internet retail sales into the State of Illinois \nface the same sales tax. That is it. It is not that complicated. No \nFederal tax, no new tax; only the collection of existing State sales \ntaxes. That is all we are asking for.\n  Our opposition comes from several quarters, but primarily from no-\nsales-tax States such as Oregon, Montana, New Hampshire. Those Senators \nfrom those States where they pay no sales tax whatsoever would not even \nrequire their Internet sellers to collect sales tax on sales made in \nother States.\n  At the end of the day, if Marketplace Fairness passes, the citizens \nof Oregon will not pay 1 penny in sales tax more they pay now, nor will \nthe citizens in Montana, New Hampshire, Delaware, or Alaska. The State \nlaw prevails. We do not change it at all. But to suggest you could sit \nin Oregon as an Internet retailer and sell into our States at a \ndisadvantage to the local businesses and not collect sales taxes is \nunfair.\n  What we are trying to achieve here is fairness and balance. We have \nobviously the major retailers across America supporting this, but more. \nWe have units of government that are now not receiving the sales tax \nreceipts from Internet sales they could. Of course, we have others \ninterested--developers, Realtors, labor unions, business groups. It is \nthe most amazing coalition backing the Marketplace Fairness bill.\n  Senator Enzi and I urge every Senator with an amendment to this bill, \ncome to the floor now. Do not wait until tomorrow, and certainly do not \nwait until Friday. We want to bring up those amendments. I hope those \nopposing this bill will not continue to object to them, as the Senator \nfrom Oregon did earlier. But if you have an amendment, please bring it \nto the floor. Members get squirmy on Thursday night and Friday morning. \nThey want to get back home. I understand that. But if you want to reach \nthat deadline and do it in the appropriate, timely way, please bring \nall amendments to the floor now. We urge our colleagues to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Senator from \nMaine on his speech. It was a tremendous history lesson. I have enjoyed \ngetting to know him a little bit since he got here. I had quite an \ninteresting surprise yesterday. He came to my office and he brought an \nAmerican flag, all framed. The way he got it, there was a desk his \ngreat-aunt had. The desk was probably made in the 1860s. But behind one \nof the drawers they found this flag. It was a flag with 44 stars. \nWyoming was the 44th State. So he presented this framed flag to me. \nIncidentally, that was only the flag of the United States for a 6-year \nperiod. Then some other States came in and we added them. It has an \ninteresting arrangement of stars on it too, because the 44 stars do not \nfit in a nice even pattern unless you did four rows with 11 in a row. \nThat changes the dimensions of the flag considerably.\n  I appreciate his consideration on that. I appreciate the \nconsideration he has given to pieces of legislation that I have seen \nhim work on. We do not agree on all of those pieces of legislation, but \nit is nice to have the concern and the thought and the process for \ngetting things done that he brings to the Senate. That is very nice.\n  I too want to encourage my colleagues if they have amendments to \nbring them down. That is what we say this process is about. This is an \namendment process on the floor, which everybody has asked for. We are \ndoing it. So we need the amendments. A number of people have talked to \nme about different parts they had a potential concern about. I hope we \nsolved their concern by actually looking at the wording in the bill. \nThis is not a very difficult bill to read. Sometimes we do ones that \nare a couple of thousand pages. This one is 11 pages. I do not think \nthere is anybody who will not be capable of reading the bill. Unlike \nmost of the bills, this is in pretty normal language, rather than some \nof the conforming language that sometimes results around here.\n  I think most of the problems retailers should have with this have \nbeen taken care of. One that the nonsales-tax States talk about, and \nthe Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, also mentioned, the people in \nthose States still will not pay a sales tax. But if you happen to be \none of the people selling into other States, and you sell a tremendous \nvolume into other States, then under this bill you will be expected to \ncollect and remit the sales tax, as any retailer in the States that \nhave sales tax.\n  There is an exemption. The Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, asked us \nto have a compromise. That is why we have the exemption in there. It is \na compromise. We started with it in the Senate as being a $500,000 \nexemption. The House folks convinced us--as I mentioned, this is a \nbipartisan, Republican and Democrat, bicameral, House and Senate \neffort. The House convinced us that $1 million was a more reasonable \nfigure, and they gave some good reasons for it. Now $1 million would \ngive any small businessman quite a few years, perhaps--I hope it is a \nshort period of time, but it should give them quite an amount of time \nbefore they had to adjust to this, because they have to sell $1 million \non line in a year before they have to start collecting the tax the next \nyear.\n  In a State where there is a sales tax and the people are selling in \nthe brick-and-mortar store which we are trying to help out with this \nbill, they collect from every person from the first dime of sales. So \nwe have given a little bit of a break to particularly the nontax \nStates, and to those working on line that are small businesses to \ncontinue this effort to grow the Internet.\n  Of course, we are hoping a lot of our businesses in our States will \nget to that million-dollar mark. But here is the status on the million-\ndollar mark. We are told that if we reduced that to $150,000 it would \nonly affect less than one-quarter of 1 percent of the businesses in the \nUnited States--not very many. They are starting to be a relatively big \nbusiness when they are doing $1 million on line. This does not count \ntheir in-store sales. This is just their on-line sales. So I hope the \nother States that have had some difficulty with that will realize that \nis a pretty liberal mark we have gone to.\n  Of course, I know a lot of people are getting a lot of correspondence \nfrom eBay. eBay, in the 12 years I have been working on this bill, has \nconsistently opposed it, even though they appeared almost up to the \ntime we were ready to do the bill to be in agreement with some of the \nthings that were in the bill.\n  Incidentally, that is when we had a considerably bigger bill. It was \nabout 80 pages long. This one we changed. The main difference is now \nthere are States rights, which there should have always been. That is \nthe way it is in the Constitution. This is a States rights bill. That \nreduces the length of it considerably.\n  The million-dollar proposal is to give people time to adjust and \ncollect. Incidentally, there is kind of a phase-in in this. Some people \nsay, why don't we have kind of a phase-in? Well, we have 90 days. We \nagreed to do 6 months so people could gear up for it.\n  Besides that 6 months, the States are going to have to provide free \nsoftware to be able to do the tax, so that when they put in a ZIP Code \nfor where they are sending the product, they will automatically know \nthe tax. They talk about 9,600 tax jurisdictions. Well, in this there \nare only 46 different tax jurisdictions. Nevertheless, they put in that \nZIP Code and they will know what the tax is and have no liability \nwhatsoever because that falls on the people who provided them with this \nfree software. This makes a huge difference to States, counties, and \nmunicipalities.\n\n  I used to be a mayor. I was a mayor of a town that tripled in size \nduring the 8 years I was mayor. Had it not been for sales tax, we would \nhave been broke. I checked around to see how much towns and \nmunicipalities rely on the sales tax for their source of revenue. I was \nshocked. About the minimum that I run into is 30 percent. There are \nquite a few more than I ever thought that rely on sales tax for 70 \npercent of what they do.\n  So what does a municipality do with its money? Well, let's see, a lot \nof them have schools they have to take care of,\n\n[[Page S2939]]\n\nthey have law enforcement they have to take care of, they have \nfirefighters they have to take care of, some of them have ambulances. \nSo it is all of the first responders essentially they have to take care \nof.\n  If you are in the northern States, as I was, you have to do it for \nsnow removal. People are really particular about snow removal. \nIncidentally, Wyoming is still having a little bit of winter. Let's \nsee, today is Wednesday, so that is typically our spring. We have a lot \nof snow, even in April. That is when most of our moisture comes. We get \nsnow in January too, but that is a real dry snow. In fact, we are such \na dry climate that I often tell people that even our rain is only 80 \npercent moisture. Of course, a lot of it gets sucked up by the air as \nit falls. A long rainstorm in Wyoming might be 5 minutes. We get a \ntotal of 13 inches a year. So we rely on that snow. But if you are a \nmayor and it snows, you have a major problem, because people expect to \nbe able to get around. I found out that if you plow it to the center, \nthen they cannot make left-hand turns. If it is left on the ground very \nlong and that freezes, then you really have a problem getting it up. If \nyou plow it to the sides, you block in people's driveways and people's \ncars. That usually upsets them too.\n  I remember when I was mayor, every once in a while I would get a call \nfrom a disgruntled citizen who would complain that I just plowed their \ndriveway back in after they had gotten it open. They wanted to know \nwhat I was going to do about it. I would tell them to give me a few \nminutes. I would get in my car, which always had a snow shovel in the \ntrunk. I would go to their house and start digging it out. Usually when \nthey noticed me, they came running out and said: Oh, no, we did not \nintend for you to do that. I said: Well, everybody else is doing snow \nremoval. I never got two calls on that. But that is another use for \nsales tax money. There are many more.\n  All of the charities in a town usually go to the city council. They \nsay, we have this valuable project. We need some money. Anybody who \nsays they cannot fight city hall probably never tried. A lot of those \nrequests are granted.\n  But if the sales tax continues to shrink--that is what is happening \nwith it now, State sales tax, county sales tax, local sales tax is all \nshrinking. If that continues to shrink, they are going to have to start \ncutting back on things they do. Of course, probably some of the charity \nthings will be some of the first ones to go. It is always hard to tell \nwhat the net effect will be. But if they do not have any ability to \nincrease the revenues they have--and most of the towns in Wyoming do \nnot have a chance to increase the taxes they receive. Property taxes \nare limited by very specific sorts of things, such as how much you can \nlevy for the cemetery, and how much you can levy for a library, and how \nmuch you can levy for fire. Those things do not begin to cover the cost \nof the service that is rendered.\n  So to the people who are protecting the Internet, I would say it is \npretty hard to flush your toilet on the Internet. Sometimes those \nutilities come into play with these things too. Those taxes are very \nimportant to almost all of the communities across the United States, in \n46 States. The other four do not have a sales tax.\n  One of the things people have said is, if they get this extra sales \ntax, why don't they bring down some of the taxes they currently have? \nSome of the States and some of the municipalities and counties will do \nthat. I have had several of them tell me that if we could get a little \nbit more in sales tax, we would do that.\n  But let me tell you a little problem we have in the Federal \nGovernment. We are out of money, so we are cutting back. And one of the \nways we cut back was through the sequester.\n  The way some of that is worded, some of these things are considered \ntax expenditures. For instance, the Federal Government promised to pay \na property tax in lieu of real taxes. In other words, the municipality \ndoes not tax them, the county does not tax them. But the Federal \nGovernment says: Yes, we own property. If you can sell that property at \na private sale, the private entity would have to pay property tax on \nthat. So it is only fair that the Federal Government pays taxes in lieu \nof taxes. They have been doing that for a number of years.\n  The value of the properties, of course, has gone up considerably, \nparticularly in cities where there are Federal buildings, but also in \nthe forests. I have people who know the value went up because they are \nable to lease some cabin land in national forests. Their payments have \nmore than doubled in the last 3 years. That is a 100-percent increase. \nI guess this year it is even a more dramatic increase. But the Federal \nGovernment, while it is charging more for the property, is not paying \nmore in property taxes, which would be the normal thing. This year, \nthey are taking 5.3 percent out of every bit of that tax. Of course, I \nsay to people: Wouldn't it be nice if when you file your Federal income \ntaxes you could have taken 5.3 percent out of there? It is sort of the \nsame thing. It is what the government said they would pay in taxes.\n\n  There are a number of reasons these sales taxes are extremely \nimportant and getting more important. If you had Federal mineral \nroyalties, you lost 5.3 percent of that too. That is because the States \ncollect--half the money from the minerals in the State are supposed to \nbe for the State and half are supposed to be for the Federal \nGovernment. The half the Federal Government received they considered to \nbe revenue. The half that is supposed to stay with the States or go \nback to the States is considered a tax expenditure. Again, it was hit \nby 5.3 percent.\n  One of the reasons this is 5.3 percent this year in the sequester \ninstead of 2.3 percent--which is what it was across the board for the \n.3 percent--is we don't have any months left to revise those \nexpenditures, but these are one-time payments. The time for condensing \nthem has not expired, so at the most it should have been 2.3 percent. \nThat is a different problem that I will handle in a different bill. I \nam hoping people will not try to gum this up with a whole bunch of \nnongermane or irrelevant motions. If we stick to relevant ones where we \nare really trying to improve this bill, I am in favor of it. If we are \ntrying to do some other peripheral ones, in light of the tremendous \nsupport this bill has, I am hoping people will stick to the bill and \ntry to perfect it. We can have votes on that.\n  I see my friend from Tennessee is here.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. I wish to thank the Senator from Wyoming for his \noutstanding leadership on this issue. I know it is something he has \nworked on for a long time, and finally we have it on the floor for \ndebate.\n  I am a strong supporter of the Marketplace Fairness Act. I thank all \ninvolved on both sides of the aisle for getting it to this place. As \nthe Senator just mentioned, I do hope we will have an amendment process \nsoon which will allow people to improve the bill as the will of the \nbody sees fit.\n  I come from a State, the State of Tennessee, where we have no income \ntax. We generate funding for education and health care through a sales \ntax. That is the way our citizens like it.\n  What we found in the State over time is that more and more sales are \ncoming into Tennessee residents over the Internet. In many cases what \nis happening is people are going into the brick-and-mortar stores that \nare all part of the fabric of our community. They are going into brick-\nand-mortar stores where people have made investments in land, \nbuildings, roofs, and operation. They go in and try on goods, see how \nit looks, and then they order it on the Internet.\n  Obviously, those sales proceeds, the sales tax that normally would \ncome with that, are therefore bypassed. What we have done over time \nbecause of the tremendous success, which I am thankful for, of the \nInternet is, there is actually a system that has been created to get \naround State laws that exist all around our country. This bill has \nnothing to do with imposing any kind of new tax or revenue generator. \nThis law allows States that already have laws on the books to carry out \ntheir implementation.\n  Again, our citizens have no income tax. If the country and if society \ncontinues as is and sales tax continues to\n\n[[Page S2940]]\n\nerode because of Internet sales coming in from other places, what \neventually could happen in our State is we will have to move to an \nincome tax.\n  Our citizens like it the way it is. I am glad this legislation is \nwhere it is. I hope it is going to become law because I believe it is \nsomething that creates fairness, if you will, in the marketplace so all \nof those who are creating and selling goods in the State of Tennessee \nand other places are treated exactly the same.\n  I have heard some arguments from my friends in the financial \ncommunity talking about this opening the door to some kind of financial \ntransaction tax. I deal with a lot of these individuals. I am on the \nBanking Committee, and we discuss a lot of issues relative to financial \ninstitutions and transactions. I know of no reason anybody should have \nany fear of that.\n  There is nothing in this bill that creates a different arrangement \nwithin State or local governments that allows them to do something \ndifferent than they already are doing. I don't know of any precedent \nthat has been set in State and local governments as it relates to \ntransactions regarding financial activities. I don't know of anything \nin this bill that should cause people fear of that occurring down the \nroad.\n  Typically, when a piece of legislation such as comes up, we have all \nkinds of groups who come forward to try to poke holes in it. Some of \nthem, by the way, are legitimate. Hopefully, the amendment process we \nhave will help address some of the issues people may be concerned \nabout.\n  A lot of times there is just fear generated to keep anything that may \nexist from changing. I hope when we have a debate, when we actually \nbegin having amendments on this issue, what we will do is stick to the \nsubstance, as was mentioned, and that we will try to improve this bill \nin a meaningful way.\n  As it sits, again, I wish to thank the Senator from Wyoming. I wish \nto thank the senior Senator from Tennessee, Lamar Alexander, whom I \nknow has worked very closely with the Senator. I am an original \ncosponsor of this bill. I think it is an issue whose time has come. I \nhope the Senate will pass this piece of legislation after our debate \nconcludes. I hope the House of Representatives will do the same.\n  To me, this is about fairness, fairness in the marketplace so those \npeople who are involved in sales transactions, whether they are brick \nand mortar or whether they are Internet and being shipped out of \nsomeone's garage or shipped from a warehouse, I hope we will achieve a \nbalance that is appropriate for our country and fair to all those \ninvolved.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his comments. He is \nvery involved in the Banking Committee. He understands the transaction \ntaxes that they are talking about, and I appreciate his learned opinion \non that.\n  Mine comes from section 3, called ``Limitations,'' and in general it \nsays: Nothing in this act should be construed as subjecting a seller or \nany other person to franchise, income, occupation, or any other types \nof taxes other than sales and use taxes.\n  I hope we stick to that and make sure it just says ``sales and use \ntaxes.'' I have worked on this for 12 years, so it is tough enough to \nextend it beyond that. I know there are lots of things people would \nlike and to open this up.\n  I appreciate the one amendment that was presented but was objected \nto, which was an amendment which would have continued to ensure--we \nalready have a provision that says you cannot tax the Internet. You \ncannot tax the Internet. They wanted to extend that another 10 years, \nand it doesn't expire for another couple of years.\n  I thank the Senator for all of the effort he has gone to on this bill \nand all the ways he has helped us. I appreciate his plea for people to \ncome forward with their amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would further ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have had a long-standing problem in \nthe enforcement of immigration laws in the United States. The Secretary \nof Homeland Security, Secretary Napolitano, has regularly and \nsophisticatedly issued policy directives that have adversely impacted \nthe ability of law enforcement officers to do the job that is required \nof them by law. It has caused quite a bit of a problem.\n  The ICE officers association, the union, voted a couple of years ago \nunanimously no confidence in John Morton, the Director of that agency. \nHe should already have been removed, in my opinion. In addition, \nmorale, according to a government survey in the ICE officers \ndepartment, is one of the very lowest in the government.\n  I asked Secretary Napolitano in 2011 had she met with these officers \nand discussed the problems. The answer was no. I asked her Tuesday, \nyesterday, had she met with them. She said no.\n  I raised the point that these ICE officers are not complaining about \npay, not complaining about working conditions, and not complaining \nabout things that often enter into employment disputes. What they are \nsaying is that the Secretary and Mr. Morton are denying them the right \nto follow the law of the United States, denying them the right to \nenforce the law they are required to enforce, and they charged that \nthey are refused the right to carry out plain directives from the \nCongress that said under certain circumstances they shall commence, for \nexample, removal proceedings against someone. The Secretary just says: \nNo, we are not going to do that anymore.\n\n  Well, here is a very unusual development, I would suggest. I started \nout as a young Federal prosecutor in 1977, and I have never heard of \nthis occurring. The ICE officers sued Secretary Napolitano and Mr. \nMorton, and they raised the suggestion they were placed in an untenable \nposition where the law required them to do one thing and they were told \nby their superiors to do something contrary to law. The case was heard \nin Federal Court.\n  In the hearing yesterday, I raised this with the Secretary. And my \nfriend, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, \nlaughed. He said: Well, a lot of people file lawsuits, but it is \nanother thing to win one of these lawsuits.\n  That is true. It is unusual to see some of these lawsuits that are \nfiled actually reach a situation in which Federal officials are \ndirected to do something. But it appears that is exactly what the \nFederal judge did yesterday. He said the Secretary doesn't have the \nability to direct agents not to do what Congress has explicitly \nrequired them to do. They have a right to have certain policies and \nprocedures--although those are pretty dangerous as it is because \nsetting prosecutorial guidelines and procedures can create a \ncircumstance in which effective law enforcement is neutered. But to go \nforward and actually dictate that mandated statutory requirements not \nbe enforced, this Federal judge suggested, was not acceptable.\n  One ICE agent testified at the hearing that agents have witnessed \nlarge numbers of criminal aliens in jails telling each other how to \nevade immigration laws because word has gotten around that ICE agents \nare required to take their verbal claims at face value. If they say \nthey have been here and came here as a child, that must be taken at \nface value, without verification, and ICE agents must then release them \ninstead of putting them on a path to removal.\n  Another officer, Chris Crane, the president of the 7,600-member \nassociation, testified in court the administration's policies put \nofficers in the untenable position of releasing illegal aliens from \ncustody who have been identified as a result of their criminal behavior \nsimply because word has gotten around they do not have to be deported \nif they claim to qualify for the President's administrative amnesty.\n  It is a remarkable development, that a Federal judge has concluded \nthat law enforcement officers in America are being directed not to \nfollow plain law.\n\n[[Page S2941]]\n\n  With regard to the proposed legislation produced by the Gang of 8 \nthat is going to be brought up tomorrow in the Judiciary Committee. It \nhas hardly been read yet, but we know that law greatly expands the \ndiscretion given to the Secretary of Homeland Security. In many \ndifferent places it gives the Secretary the power to do that and waive \nsome of what would appear to be plain policy goals of the act, at least \naccording to the people who sponsored it.\n  This has far-reaching implications for the debate on the reform of \nimmigration. The bill gives the Secretary an unprecedented amount of \ndiscretion and waiver authority. By some estimates, there are over 200 \nmentions in this nearly 900-page bill of giving more power to the \nSecretary. Five times in the bill it affirms the Secretary's \n``unreviewable discretion'' to waive or alter provisions of the \nlegislation as she sees fit. In fact, the bill essentially codifies the \nflawed policies that are now being challenged in this lawsuit. It gives \nstatutory power to the Secretary to do what she has been doing.\n  Indeed, illegal immigrants apprehended after the new law goes into \neffect would not enter deportation proceedings. Instead, the Secretary \n``shall provide the alien with a reasonable opportunity to file an \napplication'' for provisional legal status provided the immigrant \n``appears prima facie eligible, to the satisfaction of the Secretary.'' \nThe bill emphasizes that it is not designed to ``require the Secretary \nto commence removal proceedings'' against any illegal immigrant.\n  We have a Secretary of Homeland Security who is issuing policies that \nrequire sworn law officers not to enforce actions specifically required \nby congressional law. A Federal judge just yesterday found that is not \nproper, and stated in effect the Secretary is not above the law, which \nI think most Americans would certainly agree with. Now we have a \nproposed new law that would give more authority to the Secretary to \ncontinue to waive policies in the future and would grant the Secretary \nadditional discretion in many areas.\n  This is the problem, colleagues: Congress tells America we are going \nto give legal status--amnesty--immediately to some 11 million people \nwho have entered the country illegally. By definition, that is to whom \nthis applies. And we say: Trust us, we are going to have the toughest \nlaws you have ever heard of in the future. Well, first, these laws \naren't that tough. Secondly, it provides multiple waiver authorities to \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security, and this Secretary has proven she \nis not willing to have the laws of this country enforced. She has even \nbeen sued by her own law enforcement officers, who have just won at \nleast an initial victory in a lawsuit in Federal Court.\n\n  This is a dramatic example of the problems I have been hearing from \nFederal law officers. They need to be respected and affirmed in their \nduties. On a daily basis they are out confronting people who are in \nthis country unlawfully and violating various laws. They are trying to \nremove them from the country, as we have always done--and as every \ncountry does when people violate their laws--and they have been \nundermined in that. Their morale has plummeted, and the Secretary \nhasn't even talked to them.\n  I will tell you who else hasn't talked to them--the people who wrote \nthis bill. Chris Crane, the head of the association, wrote, called, \npublicly asked for the opportunity to participate in these discussions \nand at least tell them what the real world is like. But, no, they had \nthe chamber of commerce, they had the agriculture people, they had \ncertain union officials, they had La Raza. They have all been meeting \nand talking but not the people out there struggling every day trying to \nmake sure we have a lawful system.\n  That is what the American people are asking for. The American people \nare not angry at people who want to come to America. We believe in \nimmigration. We are going to see immigration continue. No one is \nsuggesting that is going to end. But the American people are upset with \ntheir politicians and their government leaders who say one thing, \npromise one thing, and do the exact opposite. They have been promising \nfor 30 years that we are going to have a lawful system of immigration. \nIt hasn't occurred.\n  We passed a law to have 700 miles of fencing, and everybody \napplauded--some of them grudgingly. Yet only 30 miles of a double \nfencing, as required by law, has ever been built.\n  Twenty years ago there was a law mandating an effective entry-exit \nvisa system. Some of the foreign terrorists came in on 9/11 under the \nvisa system. Forty percent of the people here illegally, it now \nappears, come to this country through the visa system. It hasn't been \nfixed yet, but we continue to promise we will do it sometime. Even this \nbill, as I look at it, won't close the gaps in the entry-exit visa \nsystem. It will not fix that problem.\n  So I think the American people are pleading with Congress to do the \nright thing, to actually make sure we have a system that serves the \nnational interest and is fair. No system is fair if people who do the \nright thing have to wait and wait and wait and people who do the wrong \nthing get rewarded. That is so obvious as to be unmistakable.\n  So I look forward to going forward with a discussion of what we can \ndo to improve this system. We certainly need improvement. I certainly \nrespect my colleagues who worked on it. I think their hearts are right. \nI know their hearts are right. We can do some good things. But I do \nbelieve the American people are right to be dubious. The American \npeople are right to watch this very carefully, and they should not \naffirm another one of these situations in which a promise occurs, such \nas an immediate grant of legality, with a vague promise of enforcement \nin the future. This court case is dramatic proof that enforcement has \nnot been happening.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The senior Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the \npending bill before us.\n  This bill will hurt small businesses not just in Montana, New \nHampshire, and Oregon--non-sales tax States--but all across the \ncountry. The bill will let one State go after businesses in another \nState. This bill could give any State the right to make businesses \nacross the country collect sales taxes for that State when selling \nproducts online. Therefore, businesses could be forced to spend their \ntime and money collecting taxes for States across the country with no \nbenefit to them.\n  I am repeating that this bill has not been through regular order. The \nFinance Committee has not had a chance to improve this bill or address \nthe many unanswered questions about its provisions. The floor of the \nSenate is no place to try to improve upon the bill and make the bill \nwork.\n  Years of work have been put into the issue of State sales taxes, and \nI commend Senators Durbin and Enzi for it. Unfortunately, that work is \nnot reflected in the bill on the floor today.\n  For years, the concept of allowing States to require out-of-State \nsellers to collect sales taxes on their behalf was done through a \ncompact known as the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement.\n  After over a decade of work on streamlining, only 24 States adopted \nthe required simplification measures. The remaining States refused to \njoin the compact. Why? Because they didn't want to meet the \nrequirements for simplification.\n  To break the logjam, Senator Enzi introduced the Marketplace Fairness \nAct in November of 2011. This new bill is nothing like the streamline \nbill. They are totally different bills with different legislation.\n  This new bill says a State can require out-of-State sellers to \ncollect sales taxes on their behalf simply by meeting six or so \nsimplification requirements. But these simplification requirements were \nones chosen that the States could easily or already meet. They are \nwindow dressing.\n  First, the bill says a State must provide software free of charge \nthat calculates sales taxes due. What that means to the business owner \nis 45 different pieces of software. What kind of software is it going \nto be? Could it be a single Microsoft Excel file buried deep in a \nState's Web site? How would a business make this software workable? The \nbill does not say.\n  Let's say a business thinks the software provided by a State isn't \ngood\n\n[[Page S2942]]\n\nenough--that it isn't workable. Now this business will be forced to go \nto court in that State and prove the State didn't meet the \nsimplification requirements. What kind of fees--not to mention time--is \nthat going to take? A business will have to purchase software or \nservices from a private company to collect sales taxes owed for \nmultiple States. This won't be free. Businesses will also have to pay \nfor the ongoing service of collecting and filing taxes.\n  Second, one of the most confusing issues a business ever faces with \nState tax issues is whether it has what is called nexus. In tax jargon, \nthat means sufficient connection to the State. If the business has \nnexus, it has to collect sales taxes on sales into the State right \nnow--whether or not this pending legislation is passed. This bill does \nnothing to solve the confusion on nexus. Even if it passes, businesses \nwill still grapple with the issue of whether they have nexus in other \nStates.\n  Why does this matter? This matters because the bill sets up rules \nonly for those out-of-State sellers with no nexus--termed the remote \nsellers. Does this sound complicated? It is. It is very complicated.\n  This bill creates one set of rules for sellers that have nexus prior \nto the Marketplace Fairness Act, and another set of rules for remote \nsellers. What does the small business owner do who isn't sure where his \nbusiness falls--into one category or the other? If you get it wrong, \nthat business may be exposed to additional penalties.\n  Third, even if the business is clearly a remote seller, the so-called \nsimplification requirements are in no way simple. Streamline--that is \nthe other legislation that was worked out between about 24 States--was \nbook length. Here, instead, we have a bill that is only 11 pages.\n  The bill's sponsors have thoroughly compromised with 100 different \nfactions on this, and what they came up with may look simple on the \noutside but is total chaos underneath. Remember, too, a business still \ncould be forced to file sales tax returns in 50 different \njurisdictions. Some of these returns are due monthly. A business will \nbe subject to all those different jurisdictions' definitions of what is \nor is not taxable. It varies by State. In addition, small businesses \nwill be exposed to audit, collection, and enforcement by 50 different \nStates.\n  This bill carves out businesses with less than $1 million in remote \nsales. That threshold is too low. Retailers have notoriously low profit \nmargins, and small businesses can easily surpass that threshold with \nsales. In committee we could actually look at data to see what makes \nsense. We could bring experts in to talk about what a real small seller \nexception should look like, rather than arbitrarily picking a number.\n  I know Senator Durbin has invited Senators to come down to the floor \nand offer amendments. Other Senators are offering amendments on \ndifferent State tax issues, such as the Internet Freedom Act. But the \nfloor is not the right place to mark up a complicated statute, let \nalone tack additional legislation onto the bill. This bill needs to be \nreviewed in a comprehensive and thoughtful manner through regular \norder.\n  I repeat: This bill is not thought through. It is bad for Montana, \nand it is bad for small businesses all across our country, and not just \nnonsales-tax States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                             Sequestration\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, amid complaints from the White House about \nthe FAA furloughs, we need to keep at least one thing in mind: The \nsequester was President Obama's idea in the first place. His \nadministration created it; he signed it into law on August 2, 2011; and \nhe knew the date it would go into effect. And yet, as the deadline \napproached, earlier this year the President and his administration \ntraveled the country to stir up anxiety, concern, and fear over the \nimposition of the sequester, warning that the sky would fall like a \nmodern-day Chicken Little.\n  It has been almost 2 months since the sequester took effect, and the \nadministration's claims that the sky would fall have each proven to be \nfalse.\n  First, we had the Secretary of Education Arne Duncan claiming the \nschool teachers were already getting pink slips. But that wasn't true.\n  Then President Obama declared that U.S. Capitol janitors were getting \na pay cut. But on further examination, that proved not to be true.\n  Customs and Border Protection initially told their employees--\nincluding border agents--that they might be furloughed. However, a \nmonth into the sequester, Customs and Border Protection walked back \nthat claim and decided to make better use of departmental resources.\n  The Director of the National Park Service said the sequester might \nlead to cancellation of Washington, DC's cherry blossom festival. But \nas all the visitors who flocked to DC can tell you, the festival went \non as planned, and Washington's Metro reported one of its highest \nridership days in its history.\n  With all of these bogus claims, it seems the administration is \ndesperate to prove it wasn't crying wolf after all.\n  For example, we are learning that the Federal Aviation Administration \nis now deliberately engineering flight delays--deliberately engineering \nflight delays, just as families gear up for their summer travel. It is \na bizarre, almost surreal experience. All across America, businesses \nwork hard to take care of their customers because they know their \nlivelihood depends on their ability to satisfy their customers' needs. \nBut when it comes to the administration and the Federal Government, the \nFAA and this White House are deliberately trying to make it harder on \ntheir customers--the people who use the airways and fly airplanes.\n  Last week the head of the FAA acknowledged that, like other \ngovernment institutions, his agency has the discretion to fund high-\npriority projects--over low-priority projects not a particularly \nremarkable statement in and of itself. But we know now that instead of \nusing that discretion, the FAA has announced it plans to furlough \nemployees for the remainder of the budgetary year, potentially leading \nto flight delays all across this country.\n  The FAA's Director claims he has used all the flexibility allowed to \nhim under the law--even though his agency spends $541 million on \nconsultants, $179 million on travel, and $134 million on office \nsupplies.\n  By comparison, the sequester cuts the FAA budget by $637 million--\nless than 4 percent of the agency's 2012 budget. I don't know any \nbusiness in America that can't manage a 4-percent cut in their income. \nBut the FAA apparently can't, without disrupting the air-traveling \npublic, inconveniencing them, and even creating a hardship which is \ncompletely unnecessary.\n  We have already seen the FAA exercise discretion to one small extent, \nand that is by delaying the closure of air traffic control towers until \nJune 15, after announcing as many as three previous final dates for \nimplementation.\n  Much like the proposed tower closures, this recent round of furloughs \nis being driven not by the necessity of budget cuts but by political \ncalculations and sheer incompetence, along with the administration's \ndesire to apparently maximize the pain on American taxpayers because of \ntheir refusal to take our fiscal health seriously. It boggles the mind.\n  We have offered legislation that would give the President and this \nadministration the necessary flexibility to administer the cuts imposed \nby the sequester--which the President, again, knew was coming since he \nsigned it into law on August 2, 2011. But our friends across the aisle \nblocked that legislation, which would give the FAA and the executive \nbranch discretion, and the President's administration sent out a \nstatement of administration policy saying that if we passed it, he \nwould veto it.\n  This morning I joined with Senator Hoeven, our colleague from North \nDakota, to cosponsor bipartisan legislation that would direct the FAA \nto eliminate the flight delays it has imposed on air travelers. In \norder to meet this directive, the bill would give the Secretary of \nTransportation the additional authority to transfer funds within the \nDepartment's existing budget. This legislation represents just one of \nthe many proposals that are designed to ensure that the sequester is \nnot used as an excuse to endanger public safety and security, or \ninconvenience or create hardships for the air-traveling public.\n\n[[Page S2943]]\n\n  Unfortunately, between the cancellation of the White House tours and \nnow the FAA furloughs, the administration has repeatedly shown it is \nmore interested in finding ways to inconvenience the American people \nthan it is in looking for real solutions to our fiscal problems.\n  The American people, it would seem obvious, deserve more and better \nfrom their government. I urge the FAA, No. 1, to take another look at \nits budget, take a look at those piles of money that might be available \nto move around to help avoid the furloughs and avoid the inconvenience \nand disruption to the public or, 2, to use the flexibility that we \nwould be glad to give the FAA, if it needs additional authority, to \nmake commonsense decisions.\n  We don't need another round of scare tactics. We need a serious \nconversation about our country's priorities, and a budget that reflects \nthem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his \ncomments.\n  There is definitely a problem. We had people miss votes on Monday \nnight because the supposed furlough that the air traffic controllers \nhad to have in effect delayed some planes for more than 1\\1/2\\ hours. I \nlooked at some of the numbers, and I don't think that had to happen. \nEven within areas, there is enough flexibility to do better things.\n  I noticed some of the sequester things in Wyoming that came out and \nmade calls about them, and found out that people actually could change \nwithin their own budgets some things they were concerned with and make \nsure it didn't affect the customer.\n  That is just good management.\n  One of the things was closing down some of the visitors centers in \nYellowstone and Grand Teton. They are not open yet because at this time \nwe are just getting the snow cleared out. I called and asked about \nkeeping them open and they said we don't have enough personnel.\n  You have a gift shop there. That is a profit center. You are supposed \nto be making money on that.\n  They said the money goes to the general fund.\n  I said: Where do you think your money comes from?\n  The gift shop should operate, and if they have a problem with \npersonnel, all they have to do is the person who runs the gift shop \nopens the door, does their day's sales, and in the evening as they are \nready to leave, I hope they would look up and down the street and see \nif another customer was coming, but if they were not, go ahead and lock \nthe door and leave. That is just good business. That is the way they \ncould operate. It is my understanding those gift shops and visitors \ncenters will now be opened.\n  There are ways that could be handled. To go back to the bill----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to engage the Senator in a dialog, if I can, \nthrough the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Wyoming and the Senator from Tennessee \nand I, along with the Senator from North Dakota, have brought this \nmeasure to the floor and invited our colleagues to file amendments. We \nare starting to get a response. I can give this general report, kind of \ngeneral observation, because we have to decide how to move forward.\n  So far there are about 13 amendments that have been suggested to us. \nI would say, off the top of my head, six or seven of those I would move \nto table if they are brought to the floor because they all amend the \nInternal Revenue Code. They change Federal taxation. Our bill does not \nchange Federal taxation, and we run into a procedural problem, known as \na blue-slip problem, if we amend the Internal Revenue Code in the \nSenate and send that measure over to the House.\n  So I urge, and I hope my colleagues will join me, colleagues who want \nto change the estate tax, gift tax, whatever it may be, please save \nthat for another day. If they bring it to the floor, if we end up \nvoting before cloture, I will suggest we table those so we do not go to \nthe merits of any of those suggestions but simply say that is not part \nof this bill.\n  There are two or three amendments, one is a managers' amendment, one \nis a technical amendment on our side. As you can see, we are starting \nto get past the halfway point of the amendments currently filed. Then \nthere are a handful, five or six amendments from Senators from no sales \ntax States, and some of them are fairly predictable as to what they \nwant. One is a carve-out amendment which says don't let the law apply \nto our States. I think we are going to have to face that question at \nsome point and so be it. Let's have a vote on this and move forward.\n  But I am still going to join my colleagues urging everyone with an \namendment, please bring them forward. Let's get an understanding of \nwhat we are going to do next. Those who have already delivered the \namendments, thank you. I am sorry the Internet freedom amendment \noffered by the Senators from Arkansas and Missouri was objected to by \nthe Senator from Oregon because I think it would have been a good \naddition to this bill.\n  But I yield to my colleagues and ask for their thoughts, where we \nstand at this moment.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate that question. One of the \nreasons there is difficulty, there is the blue-slip problem with the \nHouse, but also we have the section on limitations in this bill that \nappears on page 7. There are only 11 pages in this bill so it ought to \nbe fairly easy for people to look through it and see what is included \nand what is not included. We have pretty much limited this--not pretty \nmuch, we definitely limit this to sales and use taxes. When they put \nother peripheral things in there, then they are opening the bill to go \ninto a lot of different things. So I hope that would not happen.\n  Of course, there was some question earlier in one of the speeches by \nthe Senator from Montana about the real difficulties of being able to \nadminister this. Again, there are only 11 pages in the bill. Page 4 \ncovers software, free of charge for remote sellers, that calculates the \nsales and use tax on that transaction due at the time it is completed. \nIt also has to provide a way to file the sales and use tax returns, and \nit has to be updated for any rate changes that there happen to be.\n  The responsibility is all on the State to provide the software. I \nthink the provisions that are in there pretty well specify how \ncarefully that has to be done. If it is not, there is no liability on \nthe remote seller. So I think we have covered that.\n  Yes, it will be difficult to do that software, but that is part of \nthe provision in here. It can be done. This is a day, as the Senator \nfrom Tennessee points out, that we can put in a ZIP Code and find out \nwhat our sales tax is going to be. That is what this program is calling \nfor. I think I have that right. I rely on the Senator from Tennessee to \nanswer that question more specifically.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senators from Illinois and Wyoming for \ntheir comments. Basically, the Senator from Illinois has said the bill \nis ready to be amended. It is here for that purpose. We encourage our \ncolleagues to bring amendments if they have them.\n  We could have started the amendments on Monday if the opponents had \nagreed to that. But we were forced, through Senate procedure, to go \nthrough Monday and Tuesday and most of today in order to deal with the \nfilibuster. But we are about to be ready to vote on amendments.\n  It was unfortunate; some people have said in a misleading way that \nthis taxes the Internet. Of course, it does not. There is a Federal law \nagainst taxing the Internet. The Senator from Arkansas attempted to \nextend that ban on taxing the Internet for 10 years and one of the \nopponents to our legislation blocked that. He blocked even having a \nvote on that. That is unfortunate.\n  It is ironic that the Senator from Montana would object to the fact \nthat this is an 11-page bill. I don't want to relitigate some of the \nother bills we have passed around here, but there was a big hue and cry \nwhen Senators got a 2,700-page bill that dealt with health care and it \nwas complicated and hard to read. We have gone in a different \ndirection. We have an 11-page bill that is the result of work that has \ngone on\n\n[[Page S2944]]\n\nsince 2001 by the Senator from Wyoming, that was introduced in 2011 in \nsubstantially this form, on which there was a full hearing in the \nCommerce Committee in 2012 and a partial hearing in the Finance \nCommittee in 2012. It has been introduced with exactly these 11 pages \nsince February of this year. So everybody can read it. It is not \ncomplicated. It is plain and simple. It is about States rights. I think \nit is good that we have an uncomplicated 11-page bill we all can read \nand we have had plenty of time to read it.\n\n  Of course, we would have preferred to have it reported by the Finance \nCommittee, but they would not report it. So the only choice we had was \nto bring it to the floor. Now it is open for amendment so I hope we \nwill do that.\n  The only other point is it was said there is no benefit to an out-of-\nState seller from, say, selling into Tennessee, if someone from Wyoming \nis selling into Tennessee. Of course there is a benefit. We are buying \nthat business's goods. All we want to be able to do is to have the \nright to say: Mr. Wyoming, if you want to sell into Tennessee, you are \ngoing to play by the same rules the Tennessee businesses have to play \nby. That is all we want to do. The equal protection clause of the \nConstitution guarantees we cannot do anything worse to you. But if you \nwant to sell to us, you do what we do.\n  We think that is fair and we think that not allowing States to \nconsider that is forcing States to play ``Mother May I'' with Members \nof Congress about matters which should be within their own sovereign \njurisdiction and keeping States from doing what they think is fair.\n  I thank Senators Durbin and Enzi for their leadership.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I think for the next half hour Senator \nMerkley and I are going to have the opportunity to outline specifically \nhow this affects small businesses in the real world. That has always \nbeen our concern. One of the proponents of the bill earlier today \ntalked about big businesses and big businesses getting a free ride. \nThat is not what this debate is all about if you are from Oregon or \nMontana or New Hampshire. What you are concerned about are your small \nbusinesses.\n  These are innovators. They are people without lobbies and political \naction committees. They are small businesses. Someday they would like \nto be big, but they are trying to compete in a nationwide marketplace \nand they are overwhelmingly in opposition to this bill and for \nunderstandable reasons.\n  They hear this is all about States rights and then they actually look \nat what this bill does and this bill coerces them to collect taxes for, \nin effect, thousands of jurisdictions around the country.\n  It has been my interest, and I want to repeat it, to work out a \ncompromise on this issue. Our side has put down on paper a number of \nproposals that we think ought to be the basis for trying to work out a \nposition that would allow, from our standpoint, at least some semblance \nof a right for a State to make its own judgments and not be coerced \ninto just going along with a piece of legislation that forces our small \nbusinesses to collect these taxes for everybody else. The way I have \ncompared it, whenever the proponents of the bill say they are for \nStates rights, what I have said is they are for States rights if they \nthink the State is right.\n  I am going to now read some examples because my colleagues have said \nthey want to hear specific instances. Here is what we heard from the \nOregon Nurserymen. These are not big businesses. These are not \nbusinesses with 500 people. These are businesses with five, seven or \neight employees. Senator Merkley and I are very proud of our Oregon \nnurseries. They produce an extraordinarily high-quality product, ranked \none, two or three in every category of nursery products.\n  The reality is those are products that are being sought out by \nAmericans in every nook and cranny of the Nation. That is how free \nmarkets are supposed to work. The seller of high-quality goods wins \nsales over those supplying lower quality goods.\n  What this bill is going to do, as outlined by the small businesses \nSenator Merkley and I represent, the Oregon Association of Nurserymen, \nthis bill is going to add substantial costs to Oregon retailers and \nmake it more difficult for them to compete with lower quality sellers \nin other parts of the country.\n  Here is a letter, and I will quote from it, from the Oregon \nNurserymen. They are the growers and sellers of plants and trees. They \nare the prototypical small business and the backbone of our economy. \nThis is a quote:\n\n       It is my view that this legislation would force small \n     businesses to spend precious time generating endless sales \n     reports for government instead of tending to customers, \n     selling plants and trees, and creating traded sector jobs. \n     Oregon growers are far away from their markets and we need to \n     look to knock down barriers to sales of our green goods.\n\n  There are fewer than five people at these firms. Here is another \nquote from a small business:\n\n       Let's call the bill what it is--a transaction tax. As the \n     legislation stands now, the bill will impact the \n     marketplace--to the detriment of the small business and their \n     ability to conduct commerce. Congress taxes things it wants \n     to go away.\n\n  That is what these nurserymen, whom Senator Merkley and I represent, \nare saying about this bill. They are saying the way they read this--\nwhere they would have to collect taxes for people in thousands of \njurisdictions across the country--is that it is the motivation of \nCongress trying to make these businesses go away.\n  Let me just say categorically, I have known Senator Durbin and \nSenator Enzi for a long time. They are not interested in an Oregon \nbusiness going away or anybody else's business going away. That is not \ntheir intent. Regrettably, that is the effect. I just outlined how a \nsmall businessperson describes the nature of free markets.\n  We are very proud of what we do in the nursery industry in Oregon. We \nlike the fact that we are selling high-quality goods, and we are \nwinning those sales over those supplying lower quality goods. However, \nI know this is going to add substantial costs to Oregon retailers, and \nin their own words they have said this would put them at a disadvantage \nin tough global competition.\n  I also want to say this--particularly since the Senator from Illinois \nis here--because I hope it indicates my desire to try to work something \nout for purposes of passing this bill. I made an enormous concession \nfor purposes of an agreement. This bill clearly gives a foreign \nretailer a leg up over an Oregon retailer or Montana retailer or \nanybody else because it doesn't apply to those foreign retailers.\n  One of my and Senator Merkley's constituents, Fire Mountain Gems--\nlocated in Grants Pass, OR--is competing in a tough global market. And \nwhat is going to happen is this bill--because it will not affect their \nforeign competition--is going to cause them to spend time and money \nthat their foreign competitors would not have to do. They sell all over \nthe country in scores of jurisdictions. This bill gives a big advantage \nto foreign retailers because it does nothing to, in effect, level the \nplaying field between the small merchants and the businesses that \nSenator Merkley and I represent and their foreign competitors.\n  For the purpose of a good-faith effort, we have made a concession to \ntry to work this out. At this time I am not pressing to have that flaw, \nwhich is an enormous flaw. It gives a significant advantage to foreign \nretailers over American business.\n  I see the distinguished President of the Senate here, and he has been \nso eloquent in standing up for the rights of American businesses. We \nhave a feature in this bill that actually gives a huge windfall to the \nforeign retailers at the expense of American business.\n  I am not asking for that to be corrected in this legislation, even \nthough I think it is enormous discrimination against American business. \nThe Senator from Wyoming and I both serve on the Finance Committee. I \nchair the Finance Subcommittee on Global Competitiveness. It is awfully \nhard to be globally competitive if we give an advantage to foreign \nretailers. But in the\n\n[[Page S2945]]\n\ninterest of trying to work this out, I said we will not insist on that \nbeing addressed in this bill. We will have to come back to the Finance \nCommittee and look at that.\n  So what our side has said is--Senator Merkley, the Senators from New \nHampshire, the Senators from Montana--just give us the opportunity to \nbe able to tell our constituents: You are not going to have this pushed \ndown your throat. You are not going to be coerced into collecting these \nsales taxes from thousands of jurisdictions around the country.\n  I don't see how we can have States rights if a State loses its \nability to make any judgments at all about areas where it wants to make \nits own priorities. Its priorities are being determined right here in \nWashington, DC, with this legislation with respect to the collection of \nsales taxes. Those priorities are being made here.\n  When Oregon small businesses are being coerced by State governments \nlocated thousands of miles from Oregon's borders, I think that is too \nmuch. I think adding a layer of bureaucracy to the large and growing \nnational marketplace fostered by the Net in the way this does attacks \nour most competitive small businesses.\n  I also want to highlight--because the only amendment I have objected \nto so far today has been the one with respect to the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act that I authored back in 1998 in the Senate--the reason I \nhad to object is the text of this legislation directly undercuts the \nInternet Tax Freedom act, and I will be specific.\n  The law we wrote prohibits discriminatory taxes on electronic \ncommerce. It is section 1101 of the Internet tax bill. It prohibits \ndiscriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. Under the text of the \nbill, in effect they could require an Internet company in one of these \nStates, such as New Hampshire, to collect sales taxes for the \nMassachusetts government. However, if somebody drives from \nMassachusetts to another one of these States, such as New Hampshire, \nthe brick-and-mortar store doesn't have to pump the perspective \ncustomer for all kinds of information about where they are from or \nwhere they are going and the like.\n  So the reason--with great reluctance--I had to object to adding this \nlegislation to this bill that I am the original author of in the Senate \nis because this bill in its current form directly undercuts the essence \nof the Internet Tax Freedom legislation.\n  At this time I will yield to my colleague, Senator Merkley. I just \nwant to make a special note that Senator Merkley has made a whole host \nof important contributions in the Senate, and I have been especially \npleased he has been a persistent advocate for small business. I know \nthe Senator from Illinois brought up big businesses in Oregon. The \ngrief we have here is what this is going to mean to those small \nbusinesses, those nurserymen--the Oregon Association of Nurserymen--\nwith 5, 8, or 10 people. Those are the people for whom Senator Merkley \nand I are advocating.\n  I am happy to yield the rest of my time to Senator Merkley.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time agreement.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I compliment the senior Senator from \nOregon who has come to this floor and very clearly laid out what is \nfelt in the heart of Oregonians across our State, and that is this bill \ntells Oregonians they have to be the collection agents for folks from \n45 other States and hundreds of local jurisdictions. This is not just \nan expense mandate, it is an offensive intrusion into the rights of the \ncitizens of our State.\n  In that regard, I want to just engage in a few questions and thoughts \nwith my colleague from Oregon and try to highlight some of the concerns \nand issues we have.\n  I ask through the Chair the senior Senator from Oregon: As he reads \nthis bill, does he see in it any compensation for the time and effort \nthat the businesses in Oregon will have to spend collecting the tax for \nhundreds of jurisdictions across this country?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I really don't. I know the sponsors of the legislation \nkeep talking about how this is not going to be a burden, for example, \nto the businesses my colleague advocates for, and that there is going \nto be software, computers, and technology. I think my colleague's \nquestion is pivotal.\n  There is a little bit of interesting history I think my friend from \nWyoming knows more about than anyone else. For years there has been an \neffort at the State level to try to remove some of the hassles and the \ncosts that my colleague has talked about. I think the official name--\nand my colleague probably knows this--is the State streamlined sales \ntax project or something along those lines.\n  If it were so simple, and if this was something that didn't have the \nkind of costs for small businesses that my colleague is so concerned \nabout, I think we would have already seen it put into effect by the \nproponents of the bill.\n  The reason we are on the Senate floor talking about it--and talking \nabout Oregon businesses being forced to do this against their will--is \nthat it is not without costs, it is not without hassle, and the \ntechnology and all of the marvels of software and computers that we \nhave heard about for the proponents is not there. They have not been \nable to do it through that kind of approach--which is essentially \nvoluntary--so now they are on the Senate floor to force States such as \nOregon to do it.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. The Senator makes a great point. If States have not \nvoluntarily entered into compacts where they get to collect their own \nsales tax for other States where it is a mutually beneficial \nrelationship, then it is very strange to have to be compelled--even \nthose 45 States that have sales tax obviously were not so excited about \nforming such a structure. They also seem determined to pull into this \ninvoluntary structure States that find the sales tax abhorrent. If they \nfind a tax abhorrent--and just a little bit of background there. I \nbelieve our State has voted nine times on a sales tax. Largely the vote \nhas been on heavy majorities defeating it. Many of those votes are 70 \nto 30.\n  Some of those reasons for that is because it is an extremely \nregressive tax. Another reason is that it is an expensive tax to \ncollect; therefore, it is much less efficient and much more government \nwaste.\n  Now we have all these Senators who are champions of government waste \nnot only forcing an extension of their own State's wasteful tax system, \nbut imposing it upon the small businesses of Oregon. Then we come to a \nwhole series of concerns that any small business is going to have in \nthis situation.\n  A small business is told they must participate, and basically \nanything beyond a single-person shop is pulled into this bill. Then \nthey are subjected to--I think it is over 800 tax jurisdictions--having \nto call them and say: We are not sure you gave us the right amount.\n  Is there anything in this bill that says those hundreds of tax \njurisdictions out there cannot call and basically challenge whether \nthey have the right amount of money?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator is right that certainly those jurisdictions \ncould challenge Oregon. It goes to the question, again, of how the \nsystems are not in place, so let's just force Oregon to do it even \nthough the systems have not been available. There are actually more \nthan 9,000 separate taxing jurisdictions.\n  What we have been told by the proponents of the bill is that they are \ngoing to get this down to a smaller number of systems than 9,000. \nAgain, that is why it ought to be possible--if the Senator from \nIllinois and the Senator from Wyoming will negotiate with us--to work \nsomething out.\n  We have given them on paper several proposals to try to find some \ncommon ground where our constituents--folks in Oregon especially, but \nthey are in New Hampshire and Montana and other States that have made \ntheir own judgments--would have the ability to shape some of our own \ndecisions. As my colleague knows, Washington State has a sales tax. We \ndon't have a sales tax. So our region alone shows that if we could \nallow States to come together and make their own voluntary judgments, \nit is pretty clear that folks in Washington believe they made some of \nthe right decisions for their economy and individuals and we have made \nour own. The fact that a State with a sales tax and a State without a \nsales tax coexist--and quite peaceably--right next to\n\n[[Page S2946]]\n\neach other is a pretty good argument why Senator Durbin and Senator \nEnzi should work with us to have some kind of a voluntary situation.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I think about the small businesses that \nwould be subject to so many jurisdictions that they now have a tax \nrelationship with and the responsibility to collect for and the \npossibility of having to basically call them and say: Well, you didn't \ndo it right; you didn't use the right amount or the right software or \nthis or that.\n  I can't imagine any small business wanting to be exposed to, as my \ncolleague pointed out, 9,000--and even if it is consolidated into 800, \nthat is still a lot of people to deal with. If we have to deal with \nfive or six, that is overwhelming. But then the question becomes \nwhether those States have the power to audit the Oregon small \nbusinesses as collectors of a tax, just as they might audit any other \ngroup that was collecting sales tax for their State.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Again, it sure looks as though those are going to be the \nkinds of burdens our States--the ones without a sales tax--are going to \nbe subjected to.\n  The proponents say: That is not going to happen. There is going to \nmagically be all of this software and all of this technology, so if \nanybody wants to come back and look later, this is not going to be hard \nto respond to.\n  I just know, looking at all of the businesses that have been in touch \nwith us--including A to Z Wineworks, for example. We have clothing \nstores, such as Queen Bee, a quintessential small business that is \nemploying eight skilled staff members who all help to bring the designs \nto life at the Hive on North Williams Street in Portland. The Senator \nand I know them. Their goods are locally crafted in Portland. Rebecca \nPearcy there said she--I will quote her:\n\n       Building, running, and maintaining a Web site is expensive \n     and complicated enough. I can't imagine having to include the \n     additional infrastructure of charging and paying sales taxes \n     to States outside of Oregon.\n\n  These are real businesses with six, eight people who, when they hear \nthat they are going to have to pay, that they are going to run the risk \nof having these kinds of audits and the like, and that maybe there is \ngoing to be software and computers for them to take care of it, they \nsay: You have to be kidding. We can't put our business at risk on the \npromise of that kind of hope and a Washington promise.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Well, I appreciate the Senator expanding on that.\n  On page 6 of this bill, there is a line that starts out very \npromising: ``Relieve remote sellers and certified software providers \nfrom liability to the State or locality for incorrect collection and \nremittance . . . '' Well, that sounds OK. That sounds as though you are \nnot subject to an audit. But then it goes on to say, only from \nbasically an error in the software provided by the State. In other \nwords, if a mistake is made, a business owner is subject to all of the \nsame things as if their efforts were inside the State of New York, and \nthat means subject to the State organizations inside the government of \nNew York, that means audits, that means fees. It could include court \nactions.\n  So we are talking about, as the Senator put it, 9,000 jurisdictions \nthat now can make life completely unmanageable. It would only take 2 or \n3 to make it unmanageable, but 9,000 can make it unmanageable for a \nsmall business in Oregon.\n  Now, my colleague from Illinois has said it is OK for small business \nbecause we put in an exemption for selling $1 million online. That is \nno kind of an exemption at all. Let me explain. Let's say a small \nbusiness is selling $1 million online and they have a 5-percent margin. \nThat means they are making $50,000 a year. After they basically \nrecognize that a person is working for themselves--they have no \nbenefits separate from that--that is a very modest, middle income. That \nis one person. So this has an exemption for only a business of one--a \nmodestly successful business of one--which means every other business \nin the State that is engaged online is subject to this provision.\n  So while others may feel comfortable telling their home State small \nbusinesses--and this would include those in the 45 sales tax States--\nthat they are subject to audits and fees and court action from 9,000 \nother entities, I am certainly not comfortable telling the small \nbusinesses of Oregon they are going to be facing this type of \nincredible bureaucracy created by some of the folks who come to the \nfloor and say they are all about small business.\n  Now, they want small businesses to be audited and fee'd and asked to \nturn up in some other State for a hearing. That is an outrageous attack \non small business, not to mention our States that do not have a sales \ntax. It is an outrageous overplay attacking States rights.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I couldn't say it any better than Senator \nMerkley. I think he has characterized what this legislation is all \nabout better than anybody I have heard on the floor of the Senate.\n  I have been in this debate for quite a while here. It is about \ncoercion. It is about putting those small businesses Senator Merkley is \ntalking about through sort of the equivalent of bureaucratic water \ntorture. I have explained how the text of it in its present form \ndirectly violates the prohibition in the Internet Tax Freedom Act of \ndiscriminatory taxes.\n\n  Again, to the sponsors of the legislation, I wish to repeat that I \nand Senator Merkley and Senator Shaheen, Senator Ayotte, the two \nMontana Senators--we have put down on paper--on paper, I say to my \ncolleagues--specific offers to try to work this out. Senator Merkley \nand I understand the votes that have been cast. We can count. That is \npart of how one gets to be a Senator. But the Senator from Illinois has \nnot responded in writing to any of the offers we made.\n  We would like to walk through this process and find a way to have \nsome opportunity to tell our constituents--particularly the ones \nSenator Merkley correctly identified as being small and going through \nall of these bureaucratic water torture drills--that they are going to \nbe able to shape their own future.\n  Washington has a sales tax. Oregon doesn't. The Senator from Illinois \nkeeps talking about how Oregon is going to be some huge haven if we get \nan opportunity to initiate a voluntary compact. That hasn't happened \ntoday. When we have one State and another that are borders--as my \ncolleagues know, we are very close. We have kept the peace. We can work \nout these approaches.\n  To have Senator Merkley and I concede on the major point, which is \nthe provision that gives a foreign retailer a leg up in this bill--\nwhich I think is a very serious defect, and I think a lot of Senators \nwho vote for this bill, when they see that it is going to be a huge \nadvantage for foreign retailers, they are going to have some real \nmisgivings about that--we gave that up for purposes of this. We have \nmade concessions. We can't even get an offer in writing about something \nto negotiate that would incorporate a way to protect our States from \nthe kinds of features Senator Merkley has correctly described.\n  I especially appreciate him going through the specifics, as he always \ndoes. Senator Merkley cited the fact that this legislation has a \nprovision to basically compensate people for errors, which suggests to \nme that they think there are going to be a bunch of errors and the \nreason they think so is because they are right, as my friend from \nWyoming knows, because they sought in the effort to try to sort this \nout during the streamlined sales tax discussions that have gone on for \nso many years.\n  I wish to yield to Senator Merkley for the last word. It is a \npleasure to partner with Senator Merkley on so many issues, and he has \ndescribed it today as well as anyone has in this discussion. I thank \nSenator Merkley for all of his leadership, and I yield to him for \nclosing it up, as our small businesses in Oregon, such as the Oregon \nAssociation of Nurserymen, have been talking to us about.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank my senior Senator for his championing and his \nleadership and his longtime defense of the Internet as a place of fair \ntransactions for small businesses and large, as a tax-free zone. I hope \nthis Chamber is not engaging in a course that is going to change that \ndramatically, as it seems so intent on doing at this moment.\n\n[[Page S2947]]\n\n  I am very struck by the correct point my colleague made about foreign \ncompanies. Here we have a company in Canada that is not subject to this \nbill. We have a company in Mexico that is not subject to this bill. For \nthat matter, we have a company in Nigeria or anywhere else in the world \nnot subject to this bill. So when American businesses say we should \nmaintain a level playing field to keep business in America, allow us to \nplay on a level playing field, they are certainly hoping we won't pass \nsomething such as this that gives such an enormous advantage to other \nnations.\n  I must say that constituents have been weighing in on this issue. I \ndon't think it would surprise anyone to know that they don't like it. \nNinety-eight percent are writing in to us to say: We don't like it. We \ndon't like the idea of other States auditing our businesses. We don't \nlike being asked to be a tax collection agency for another State.\n  Oregon is not asking anyone else to do that unless they have a State-\nto-State compact, which is exactly the way this could have been done \nand should have been done but hasn't been done because the States \ncouldn't agree, even though they were sales tax States. That tells us \nquite a lot.\n  They don't like the idea of being subject to bureaucrats or the \npotential for legal action where they might have to travel to another \nState, and they don't like the idea that there is absolutely no \ncompensation for the enormous imposition this bill places on the small \nbusinesses of Oregon. That is quite a lot not to like. So, of course, \nit is 98 percent against this bill.\n  I thought I would read one such letter:\n\n       Please do not support the Marketplace Fairness Act. It is \n     not fair to businesses like mine that other States could tax \n     my Oregon-based company. The voters of Oregon have \n     continually voted down sales taxes as a method of collecting \n     revenue within our State. It should not be imposed on us by \n     other States. If these States have problems with their \n     collection, they should figure it out with the help of their \n     local populace . . .\n       My company is an Internet retailer and we are able to \n     compete and create jobs on a level playing field.\n       The dynamics of this fight will have consequences for mid-\n     sized retailers like mine, especially companies based in \n     Oregon. Big retailers are fighting to limit our ability to \n     compete with them. Their goals are to have local footprints \n     and employees across the country in major metropolitan \n     markets. They should pay those local taxes and fees where \n     they are a burden. Companies like mine, that have not chosen \n     to be in that model, should not.\n       Please continue to support the Internet's free market. \n     Please protect Oregon business and maybe even create some new \n     opportunities.\n\n  That is what we should be doing in the U.S. Senate--creating new \nopportunities for Oregon small businesses to succeed in this tough \neconomy. That is what this business owner in Oregon believes, and I \nwill repeat that sentence since the writer made that point: That is \nwhat we should be doing in the U.S. Senate--creating new opportunities \nfor Oregon small businesses to succeed in this tough economy. But that \nis the opposite of what we are doing here. Maybe that is why Oregonians \nare overwhelmingly opposed to this bill.\n  I think it is clear that there are some ideas for which, if someone \npassionately believes in them, they are willing to try them out, they \nare willing to develop a pilot project before they impose it on the \nentire Nation.\n  Certainly out of the 45 States, since so many have come to the floor \nrepresenting their States passionately, saying this should be done, why \ndon't they have a pilot project among their States and demonstrate that \nthis is not going to be a burden in which there are audits and fees and \ncourt appearances and phone calls from the some 9,600 jurisdictions my \nsenior colleague has pointed out? Why don't they demonstrate that first \nbefore they decide to run an attack on the success of small businesses \nin the State of Oregon and, for that matter, across this Nation? How \nabout that? That is a fair proposal. Run a pilot project.\n  If you love this idea so much, do it among yourselves and demonstrate \nit and bring the report back to this Chamber for further conversation. \nBut the idea of coercing my citizens of the State of Oregon to do your \nwork, with enormous imposition and uncertainty, when they are trying to \nsucceed as small businesses--and when small businesses are the power of \ncreating jobs in this country--that is wrong.\n  So for those who speak about the heavy hand of government, those who \nspeak about the power of small businesses, those who speak about \nbureaucracy and imposition, then live your words in action and kill \nthis vicious attack on small businesses across this Nation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I understand the passion of my colleagues \nfrom Oregon. Oregon is one of five States with no sales tax. I know \nthey have voted down a sales tax by statewide referendum repeatedly, by \nmargins of 2 to 1, I am told. So it is clear they have a passionate \nfeeling about no sales tax in Oregon.\n  Here is the good news. The bill Senator Enzi and I have introduced \nand want to pass in the Senate will not impose one penny of sales tax \nobligation on anyone living in Oregon. Whether they are purchasing over \nthe counter or they are purchasing over the Internet--not one penny of \nsales tax liability. Their States rights are protected. Their passion \nagainst sales tax is honored. And the same is true in Alaska, Montana, \nNew Hampshire, and Delaware--all the other no-sales-tax States.\n  But this is what it really gets down to. This is not about the people \nin Oregon paying a sales tax. It is about the businesses--the Internet \nbusinesses in Oregon that want to sell into other States and not \ncollect the sales tax owed to that State. That is it. We are not \nforcing them to sell in Illinois or Wyoming. That is a business \ndecision they are making. We are just saying: If you sell, collect the \nsales tax required by Illinois law, Wyoming law, Connecticut law. That \nis what it comes down to.\n  Why is it important? It is important because businesses in our \nState--small businesses--are competing with Internet retailers that get \nan automatic discount when they do not collect the sales tax.\n  I listened to the explanation given by one of my friends from Oregon \nhere, and he said that I am defying the natural forces of the free \nmarket system, where good-quality goods are chosen over lower quality \ngoods. Well, I cannot argue about the pine trees that are grown in \nOregon because I do not know if they are better than the pine trees \ngrown in Washington or some other place. But we are dealing in many \ninstances here with identical goods--the Nike running shoes that you \ncan buy at Chris Koos' sporting goods store in Normal, IL, or buy over \nthe Internet with no sales tax. It is not a question of good quality \nversus bad quality; it is a question of sales tax or no sales tax.\n  So what the Oregonians have suggested to us is what they consider to \nbe a perfect solution: Remove any requirement for their Internet \nretailers to collect sales tax from anybody. Therefore, there would be \nno Federal mandate.\n  Well, let me remind them, there is no Federal tax in this bill. There \nis no new tax in this bill--State, local, or Federal. All we are asking \nfor is the basics. If Oregonians want to sell in an adjoining State \nsuch as California, they will collect the sales tax owed to California \nand pay it back.\n  Then I listened to them describe how onerous this would be. Right \nnow, eBay, which is no friend of this bill, offers a service available \nto businesses that they can buy that will tell them the exact sales tax \nto be collected based on your ZIP Code and address, and that service \ncosts--listen to this onerous cost--$15 a month. It is $15 a month. If \nyou want to go to the highest Cadillac version, it is $140 a month--\nless than $2,000 a year.\n  Incidentally, in our bill we require the States that are asking for \nthe collection of sales tax to provide, free of charge, software to \nevery Internet retailer so they can collect this without any expense to \ntheir business.\n  This is not onerous. It is not unfair. It is just basic leveling of \nthe playing field.\n  I want to yield the floor to my friend from Wyoming, my cosponsor of \nthis measure.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, Senator Brown was here earlier, and I had \nwanted to be able to speak briefly. So if, when I finish my remarks, he \nis here, I ask unanimous consent that he be recognized to speak.\n\n[[Page S2948]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I want to talk about what we have just heard here and an \nimplication that we are not champions of small business.\n  I was in small business. I had shoestores, retail shoestores, so that \nis why I know some of these problems. I know about the people coming \nin, trying on the shoes, getting exactly what fits, having all of the \nservice of looking through all of the styles and that sort of thing, \nand then leaving and making a purchase on the Internet.\n  Talking to other retailers now, that is not the biggest irritation. \nThey buy it on the Internet, the product has a problem--and every \nproduct has the potential of having some problem--and they bring it \nback to the store where they got the free service, where they did not \nbuy the shoe, and they ask for it to be replaced. I hope people can see \nthe inequity in that.\n  But we are not talking about the small business like the shoestore I \nhad. We are talking about small businesses that are selling online and \nare doing over $1 million a year in sales. I do not think people would \nconsider that to be a really small business--$1 million in sales. If \nthey are doing $1 million in sales, you can pretty much guarantee that \nthey are automated. They are automated in their manufacturing, they are \nautomated in their sales. That means they have a computer. Not many \nbusinesses today function without a computer. If they have a computer, \nyou would be amazed at some of the things those computers will do.\n  I go back to Wyoming almost every weekend, and I visit businesses. I \nvisit businesses so they can tell me what kinds of problems the Federal \nGovernment is causing for them. I am amazed at the automation they \nhave. I am amazed at what they are able to do. And most of it is \nbecause of computers. Now we are saying--and I think computers kind of \nstarted out on that coast--that computers just do not have the \ncapability to do these kinds of things. To be able to figure a sales \ntax? All you have to have is a ZIP Code, and it eliminates the 9,600 \njurisdictions we are talking about here. That computer can figure that \nsales tax, and at the end of the month, that same computer will have \nkept track of all of this stuff, and it will do the reports that are \nnecessary electronically. It can probably do that with about five or \nsix key taps, maybe less than that. I am sure they could actually be \nset to send the report on the last day of the month at a specific hour. \nThat is how computers work.\n  So an argument that this cannot be done--I do not think anybody will \nbuy that. And the States would not be willing to provide those programs \nfree of charge and then put in the protections from liabilities and \nerrors if they were not sure they could do it. The reason they put in \nthose protections for the retailer is because they are sure it can be \ndone.\n  I was fascinated by the audits. If they are using that computer \nprogram, how could they vary from what they actually take in to \nactually sell? The program takes it in, the program holds it, and the \nprogram sends it out with the report. There is not a lot of room for \nerror.\n  Then they say they are going to be running around auditing those \nfirms. They are going to audit the firm that looks as if it is shipping \neverything everywhere and not reporting at all. That is what \naccountants do. They figure out the high risk. They are not going to go \nin and look for pennies here and there. They go in and look for enough \nto at least cover the cost of the audit. If you are not doing probably \n10 or 20 times the value of the audit, you are not going to be hired to \ndo many of them.\n  So those that are complying, using the program, they are not going to \nhave any problem.\n  But this exempts all the businesses that are doing less than $1 \nmillion online in a given year. Until you do $1 million online in a \ngiven year, you are exempt from it.\n  I would imagine that a lot of those nurseries do not hit the million-\ndollar mark. They would like to hit the million-dollar mark, and I \nwould like them to hit the million-dollar mark, and if they got to that \nmillion-dollar mark, I think they would be so overjoyed, they would \nsay: I am automating on the computer. I will be happy to do it because \nmaybe I can sell $2 million worth of sales if that is the case.\n  Now, comments on the streamlined sales tax. My State was one of the \nfirst ones to get into it. So was South Dakota, so were Nebraska and \nanother 20, 21 States besides those. The comment was that you cannot \nstreamline this. What kind of incentive has there been for them to \nstreamline it more? The purpose of the compact is to streamline it \nmore, but at the moment they are having to protect their sales within \ntheir State to make sure they are not losing the revenues they were \nalready counting on.\n  They knew there was this little Supreme Court case that is now 20 \nyears old that challenged us to fix it. That is what we are trying to \ndo here--fix it. If that fix goes in, I am betting that a lot more \nStates will join the streamlined sales tax and it will streamline more \nthan what we envisioned. But even if they do not, there are \nrequirements in here that keep it uniform enough. And with the \ncomputers, we can show examples of how people already do this sort of \nthing on the computer. That should take care of a lot of their \nproblems.\n  I yield the floor under the previous order for Senator Brown.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Enzi, the senior Senator \nfrom Wyoming, for his good work on this legislation and for his always \ncourteous demeanor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for up to 8 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Working Families Tax Relief Act\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this week Senator Durbin and I are \nintroducing the Working Families Tax Relief Act with a majority of my \nDemocratic colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee.\n  For a number of years, one area of bipartisan agreement in Washington \nhas been on the need for comprehensive tax reform. Tax reform can clear \nthe Code of wasteful carve-outs and special interest loopholes.\n  Senator Enzi was part of a bipartisan meeting that the Finance \nCommittee is wont to do, sitting around a table talking about these \nissues, just last week.\n  We understand that comprehensive tax reform can place American \ncompanies on an even footing with foreign competitors. It can reduce \nthe deficit. It can provide a shot in the arm to economic \ncompetitiveness and growth. On that there is agreement.\n  What comprehensive reform should not do--and there is general \nagreement on this also--is undermine the earned-income tax credit and \nthe child tax credit. These credits are the single most effective \nincentive to increase low-income parents participating in the workforce \nand reward work and promote family formation--all goals which we, I \nbelieve, all seek. That is why support for these programs in the past \nhas been broad-based and bipartisan.\n  President Reagan and former Representative Jack Kemp--the former \nrunning mate of Senator Dole in a Presidential election--were champions \nof the modern earned-income tax credit. When it was expanded in 1986, \nPresident Reagan said it is ``the best antipoverty, the best pro-\nfamily, the best job creation measure to come out of Congress.'' He was \nright.\n  In Ohio some 1 million households received the EITC--the earned-\nincome tax credit--and 665,000 households received the CTC--the child \ntax credit--on average in the 3 years of 2009, 2010, and 2011.\n  That is why this week Senator Durbin and I, along with most of our \nDemocratic colleagues, are introducing the Working Families Tax Relief \nAct. Our bill would make permanent the 2009 levels for the earned-\nincome tax credit and the child tax credit. It would index the child \ntax credit for inflation. It would allow workers without children to \naccess the full earned-income tax credit. It would reduce the full \nearned-income tax credit access age to 21. It would simplify the filing \nprocess to reduce fraud because there is some acknowledged fraud in \nthis program, as\n\n[[Page S2949]]\n\nthere is throughout the tax system. And I have pledged to many of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, as this bill moves forward, to \nwork to reduce that fraud.\n  The Recovery Act of 4 years ago expanded access and refundability for \nboth the EITC and CTC. It was meant to respond to the great recession \nbut also to ensure the country's finest antipoverty programs keep up \nwith the times. Making these credits permanent at the current level is \ncritical to fighting poverty.\n  In 2011, the EITC and CTC lifted 10 million people, including 5 \nmillion children, out of poverty. The EITC has helped nearly half a \nmillion single mothers enter the workforce. These credits do not just \nreward work, they provide lifelong benefits to children. We know from \nstudies that it improves health outcomes, it increases earning \npotential for children in low-income families, because those families \npulled out of poverty can give advantages to those children that pay \noff later in life they could not give to those children in those \nfamilies if their incomes were below the poverty line.\n  Expectant mothers who receive the EITC are more likely to receive \nprenatal care. These are not opinions; they are fact. Newborns are more \nlikely to experience birth indicators, such as low weight and premature \nbirth. Behind all of these statistics are real people, people whose \nlives and opportunities are improved because of these credits.\n  Let me share a story. Michelle Eddy, a Cleveland native, is a single \nmother who works hard to support her two daughters. One is 9, the \nyounger is 4. This year the Neighborhood Housing Services of Greater \nCleveland helped Ms. Eddy prepare her tax return. She was able to use \nthe credits she received from Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax \nCredit to pay for school supplies, uniforms, and daycare for her two \ndaughters.\n  She has worked in a retail store as a shift manager for 5 years. She \nrecently, though, started a new job as a restaurant server so she can \nspend evenings and weekends with her daughters. Without EITC, without \nCTC, she would almost certainly have to work a second job to make ends \nmeet, leaving her children at home without her far too often. The EITC \nand the CTC are not what make Michele Eddy a good mother, but they \nenable her to be there with her children when they need her most.\n  Right now, some 30 percent of children under the age of 3 are in \nfamilies with too little earnings to qualify for full CTC. Even worse, \nnearly 13 percent of children under 3 are in families with no earnings, \nand as such get into CTC or EITC. We know the Child Tax Credit is not \nindexed for inflation. By the end of the decade another 1 million \nchildren will be forced to grow up in poverty.\n  The CTC needs to be more robust. We need to reform the Tax Code now. \nI am very hopeful that Senator Baucus in his last year and a half in \nthe Senate, with Ranking Member Hatch and leaders from that committee \nsuch as Senator Wyden and Senator Enzi and others, can reform the Tax \nCode, can put measures in place to prevent fraud.\n  As we introduce the Working Families Tax Relief Act, I remain hopeful \nour colleagues across the aisle will work with us to make these credits \na part of tax reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have enjoyed the discussion on the \nMarketplace Fairness Act. It is nice to have a good debate and I am \nlooking forward to voting on amendments that are here.\n  I wish to address two or three points that have been made during the \ndebate. The first is about what we call here regular order. What we \nmean by that is that the bill was introduced, it goes to a committee, \nand the committee reports it to the floor, and we bring it up on the \nfloor, and we have a debate and then we vote on it. We want to see more \nof that around here.\n  Well, the problem with this bill is that the Finance Committee would \nnot act on it. Let's be straightforward about it. This bill has been \naround a long time. The Finance Committee chairman is the only one who \ncan schedule a hearing and cause it to be acted on. He did not want to \ndo that, despite the fact that we asked him to do it. So as a result, \nthe majority leader used a procedure that brings the bill to the floor.\n  To underscore that, let me ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a timeline for the Marketplace Fairness Act. It details the \nsteps we have taken since 2001.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Marketplace Fairness Timeline\n\n\n                       107th Congress (2001-2002)\n\n       S. 512, Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act, Senator \n     Byron Dorgan--introduced 3/9/2001, Referred to: Senate \n     Finance, Finance Committee hearing--8/1/2001.\n       S. 1542, Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act, Senator \n     Michael Enzi--introduced 10/11/2001, Referred to: Senate \n     Commerce.\n       S. 1567, Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act, Senator \n     Michael Enzi--introduced 10/18/2001, Referred to: Senate \n     Commerce.\n       Senate Amdt. #2156 to H.R. 1552, Motion to table amendment \n     was agreed to--57 to 43 on 11/15/2001.\n\n\n                       108th Congress (2003-2004)\n\n       S. 1736, Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Act, Senator Michael \n     Enzi--introduced 10/15/2003, Referred to: Senate Finance.\n\n\n                       109th Congress (2005-2006)\n\n       S. 2152, Sales Tax Fairness and Simplification Act, Senator \n     Michael Enzi--introduced 12/20/2005, Referred to: Senate \n     Finance.\n       S. 2153, Streamlined Sales Tax Simplification Act, Senator \n     Byron Dorgan--introduced 12/20/2005, Referred to: Senate \n     Finance.\n       Senate Finance Subcommittee on International Trade hearing \n     on sales tax fairness and other state/local tax issues--7/25/\n     2006.\n\n\n                       110th Congress (2007-2008)\n\n       S. 34, Sales Tax Fairness and Simplification Act, Senator \n     Michael Enzi--introduced 5/22/2007, Referred to: Senate \n     Finance.\n       Senate Commerce Committee hearing on ``Communications, \n     Federalism, and Taxation'' where it was discussed--5/23/2007.\n\n\n                       111th Congress (2009-2010)\n\n       No bill introduced.\n\n\n                       112th Congress (2011-2012)\n\n       S. 1452, the Main Street Fairness Act, Senator Dick \n     Durbin--introduced 7/29/2011, Referred to: Senate Finance.\n       S. 1832, the Marketplace Fairness Act, Senator Michael \n     Enzi--introduced 11/9/2011, Referred to: Senate Finance.\n       11/30/2011--House Judiciary Committee hearing on \n     ``Constitutional Limitations on States' Authority to Collect \n     Sales Taxes in E-Commerce.''\n       1/31/2012--Official letter signed by 12 bipartisan Senators \n     requesting Finance Committee hearing on S. 1832.\n       2/1/2012--Letter sent by 208 national, state and local \n     organizations and companies requesting a hearing on S. 1832, \n     the Marketplace Fairness Act.\n       4/25/2012--Senate Finance Committee hearing on state and \n     local tax issues, including S. 1832, the Marketplace Fairness \n     Act.\n       7/11/2012--S.

Senate Record Vote #62--Enzi \n     Amendment agreed to 75 to 24.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. To summarize some of these steps, this began in the \n107th Congress in 2001. Now Senator Enzi started even before that, I \nthink, with Senator Dorgan. They introduced the Internet Tax Moratorium \nand Equity Act in 2000 and 2001. Then in 2003, the Streamlined Sales \nand Use Tax Act was introduced by Senator Enzi. That is 10 years ago.\n  Then again in 2005 and 2006 Senator Enzi and Senator Dorgan. Then \nagain in 2007 and 2008, Senator Enzi. In the 111th Congress no bill was \nintroduced. But now we are getting to a little more recent history. \nLast Congress, 2011 and 2012, Senator Durbin introduced the Main Street \nFairness Act. Senator Enzi joined him in that. It was referred to the \nSenate Finance Committee.\n  So for all of that time, the Finance Committee has had an opportunity \nto work on this legislation in the way\n\n[[Page S2950]]\n\nthey thought it should be. There were hearings in the Senate Commerce \nCommittee in August of 2012 on essentially the same 11-page bill that \nhas been introduced here today and that we are acting on.\n  There was a partial hearing in the Senate Finance Committee during \nthat year. But that was all. Then, in this year, in February, on \nValentine's Day, Senator Enzi introduced the Marketplace Fairness Act \nwe are debating here, this 11-page bill. There was a letter from 16 \nSenators, Republicans and Democrats, asking the Finance Committee to \nhold a hearing and to deal with it. But it has not.\n  I respect the decision of the chairman to be opposed to the bill and \nnot to hold a hearing and not to report the bill to the floor. But if \nhe does that, then I would suggest he should respect the right of the \nmajority leader to bring the bill to the floor and allow the Senate to \ndebate it.\n  As far as the regular order goes, a week should be long enough to \nconsider this bill, which has been in one form or another around since \n2001. We could have begun debating amendments on Monday. That is when \nthe bill came to the floor. But the opponents filibustered it. This was \nnot a Republican or a Democratic filibuster, it was both sides, from \nopponents. And what that deprived us of was an opportunity to vote and \ndebate amendments on Monday and Tuesday.\n  Then we had another vote. So we have now had three votes, one during \nthe budget session, one on cloture on the motion to proceed, and then \none on the motion to proceed itself. We have gotten 74, 75 votes each \ntime. It is a majority of the Democratic Senators, it is a majority of \nthe Republican Senators. This does not happen all the time, that we \nhave such strong majorities on each side of the aisle, saying in three \nsuccessive votes of 74 and 75 votes: We favor an important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I would hope the better course would be to come to some agreement \nthat we can take the amendments we have here from Democrats and from \nRepublicans, bring them up, table them, vote on them, debate them, and \nact on this and bring this to a conclusion this week.\n  Then there is substantial support in the House of Representatives for \nthis. The bill could then go to the House. The House could do whatever \nthe House wishes. There could be a conference and we could get a \nresult. Every attempt has been made by the sponsors of this legislation \nsince 2001 to bring this through the regular order, which means take it \nthrough the committee. The opponents of the idea have chosen first in \nthe Finance Committee to not allow there to be a markup of the bill, \nand then on the floor to not allow us to debate amendments.\n  For example, some people say this legislation taxes the Internet. Of \ncourse, that is 100 percent wrong, because there is a Federal law \nbanning State taxation of the Internet. Senator Pryor of Arkansas \nsought to extend that ban for 10 more years today. The opponents of the \nbill objected even to a vote on taxing the Internet. This is very \ndisappointing. That is the information about the timeline I wanted to \nput in.\n  Here is some more information that I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2013.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Hatch: We urge the \n     Finance Committee to markup the Marketplace Fairness Act of \n     2013 at the earliest date possible. This bipartisan \n     legislation would allow States to collect the sales and use \n     taxes on remote sales that are already owed under State law.\n       Since the 1992 Supreme Court decision, Quill Corporation v. \n     North Dakota, States have been unable to collect the sales \n     and use taxes owed on sales by out-of-state catalog and \n     online sellers. Congress has been debating solutions to \n     assist States for more than a decade, and some States have \n     been forced to take action on their own, leading to greater \n     confusion and further distorting the marketplace.\n       Today, 18 bipartisan Senators introduced the Marketplace \n     Fairness Act of 2013, which would give States the right to \n     decide for themselves whether to collect--or not to collect--\n     sales and use taxes on all remote sales. Congressional action \n     is necessary because the ruling stated that the thousands of \n     different state and local sales tax rules are too complicated \n     and onerous to require businesses to collect sales taxes \n     unless they have a physical presence (store, warehouse, etc.) \n     in the state.\n       Today, if an out-of-state retailer refuses to collect sales \n     and use taxes, the burden is on the consumer to report the \n     tax on an annual income tax return or a separate state tax \n     form. However, most consumers are unaware of this legal \n     requirement and very few comply with the law. Across the \n     country, states and local governments are losing billions in \n     tax revenue that is legally owed. On average, States depend \n     on sales and use taxes for 20 percent of their annual \n     revenue. According to the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures, this sales tax loophole will cost states and \n     local governments over $23 billion in avoided taxes this year \n     alone. At a time when State budgets are under increasing \n     pressure, Congress should give States the ability to ensure \n     compliance with their own laws.\n       The Quill decision also put millions of local retailers at \n     a competitive disadvantage by exempting remote retailers from \n     tax collection responsibility. The ``physical presence'' \n     standard means that local retailers in our communities are \n     required to collect sales taxes, while online and catalog \n     retailers selling in the same state are not required to \n     collect any of these taxes. In effect, this tax loophole \n     subsidizes some taxpayers at the expense of others and some \n     businesses over others.\n       State and local governments, retailers, and taxation \n     experts from across the country are urging Congress to pass \n     the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013 because it gives states \n     the right to decide what works best for their local \n     governments, residents, and businesses. Given the fiscal \n     constraints all levels of government are facing, we should \n     allow states to enforce their own tax laws.\n       The Finance Committee held a hearing last Congress titled, \n     ``Tax Reform: What It Means for State and Local Tax and \n     Fiscal Policy,'' on April 25, 2012, which highlighted the \n     growing demand to close this particular loophole. Two \n     witnesses, Kim Rueben and Sanford Zinman, expressed the need \n     for better federal polices to allow the collection of sales \n     and use taxes from online sales. In fact, Dr. Rueben called \n     passing legislation similar to the Marketplace Fairness Act \n     of 2013 a ``no-brainer.'' We appreciate your willingness to \n     address this issue and would request an additional forum to \n     further discuss the impacts of this legislation on the U.S. \n     economy.\n       The Finance Committee is in the best position to address \n     the collection of sales and use taxes on remote sales. We \n     urge the Committee to hold a markup on the Marketplace \n     Fairness Act of 2013 at the earliest date possible. Thank \n     you, in advance, for your consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n         Senator Michael B. Enzi; Senator Dick Durbin; Senator \n           Lamar Alexander; Senator Heidi Heitkamp; Senator John \n           Boozman; Senator Tim Johnson; Senator Roy Blunt; \n           Senator Jack Reed; Senator Bob Corker; Senator Sheldon \n           Whitehouse; Senator Amy Klobucher; Senator Al Franken; \n           Senator Ben Cardin; Senator Dianne Feinstein; Senator \n           Mary Landrieu; Senator Joe Manchin.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC., January 31, 2012.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Hatch. We urge the \n     Finance Committee to hold a hearing on The Marketplace \n     Fairness Act (S. 1832), bipartisan legislation to allow \n     States to collect sales and use taxes on remote sales that \n     are already owed under State law. For the past 20 years, \n     States have been prohibited from enforcing their own sales \n     and use tax laws on sales by out-of-state, catalog and online \n     sellers due to the 1992 Supreme Court decision Quill \n     Corporation v. North Dakota. Congress has been debating \n     solutions for more than a decade, and some States have been \n     forced to take action on their own leading to greater \n     confusion and further distorting the marketplace.\n       On November 9, 2011, five Democrats and five Republicans \n     introduced The Marketplace Fairness Act, which would give \n     states the right to decide for themselves whether to \n     collect--or not to collect--sales and use taxes on all remote \n     sales. Congressional action is necessary because the ruling \n     stated that the thousands of different state and local sales \n     tax rules were too complicated and onerous to require \n     businesses to collect sales taxes unless they have a physical \n     presence in the state.\n       Today, if an out-of-state retailer refuses to collect sales \n     and use taxes, the burden is on the consumer to report the \n     tax on an annual income tax return or a separate state tax \n     form. However, most consumers are unaware of this legal \n     requirement and very few comply with the law. Consumers can \n     be audited and charged with penalties for failing to pay \n     sales and use taxes.\n\n[[Page S2951]]\n\n       Across the country, states and local governments are losing \n     billions in tax revenue already owed. On average, States \n     depend on sales and use taxes for 20% of their annual \n     revenue.

Local retailers in our \n     communities are required to collect sales taxes, while online \n     and catalog retailers selling in the same state are not \n     required to collect any of these taxes. This creates a tax \n     loophole that subsidizes some taxpayers at the expense of \n     others and some businesses over others.\n       State and local governments, retailers, and taxation \n     experts from across the country are urging Congress to pass \n     The Marketplace Fairness Act because it gives states the \n     right to decide what works best for their local governments, \n     residents, and businesses. Given our fiscal constraints, we \n     should allow states to enforce their own tax laws and make \n     sure that state and local governments and businesses are not \n     left behind in tax reform discussions. The House Judiciary \n     Committee's hearing on this single issue on November 30, \n     2011, demonstrated the growing demand to close this loophole, \n     and your committee would provide the best public forum for an \n     open debate in the Senate on the merits of this important \n     policy issue.\n       The Finance Committee is in the best position to shape the \n     discussion on state and local taxation this year, \n     particularly on sales and use taxes on remote sales. We urge \n     the Committee to hold a hearing on the implications of The \n     Marketplace Fairness Act at the earliest date possible. Thank \n     you in advance for your consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n         Michael B. Enzi, Lamar Alexander; John Boozman; Roy \n           Blunt; Bob Corker; Jeff Bingaman; Richard Durbin; Tim \n           Johnson; Jack Reed; Sheldon Whitehouse; Mark Pryor; Ben \n           Cardin.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. These are letters from Senators to the leaders of the \nFinance Committee. The first letter is dated January 31, 2012, last \nyear, at the beginning of the year. It was from five Democrats and five \nRepublicans who introduced the Marketplace Fairness Act. It asks for a \nhearing, asks for the committee to act. That is the first letter.\n  The next letter came this year, on February 14, from 16 Senators, \nboth parties, to the Finance Committee, asking the Finance Committee to \nact on the Marketplace Fairness Act.\n  Then there is a letter to the leaders of the Finance Committee from \nthe National Governors Association, signed by the Democratic Governor \nof Washington and the Republican Governor of Tennessee, asking the \nFinance Committee, on behalf of the States, to consider this \nlegislation and act on it. The Finance Committee elected not to do \nthat.\n  This information will be part of the Record.\n  Finally, there is also a letter dated April 22 of this year from the \nNational Governors Association urging Senators Reid and McConnell to \npass this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                National Governors\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 11, 2012.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus and Senator Hatch: Never before has \n     the need for legislation to grant states the authority to \n     collect sales taxes on remote sales been greater. The \n     continued disparity between online retailers and Main Street \n     businesses is shuttering stores and undermining state \n     budgets. Congress has the opportunity to level the playing \n     field for all retailers this year by passing S. 1832, the \n     ``Marketplace Fairness Act.''\n       Years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that state sales tax \n     laws were too complex to require out-of-state sellers to \n     collect sales taxes on catalog sales. As a result, states are \n     unable to collect more than $23 billion in sales taxes owed \n     annually from remote sales made through catalogs over the \n     Internet. It also creates an artificial price disparity \n     between goods bought from the corner store and those bought \n     online. It is in essence an unwarranted yet growing subsidy \n     to Internet sellers at the expense of brick and mortar \n     stores.\n       Failure to act now will only exacerbate state losses and \n     harm local businesses that are losing sales to online \n     sellers. According to a leading Internet analytics firm, 2012 \n     holiday online sales are up 14 percent from last year. (Wall \n     Street Journal, Real-Time Economics, Dec. 5, 2012.) Cyber \n     Monday was the heaviest online spending day on record at \n     $1.47 billion. The firm attributes the growth to broad \n     strength in the e-commerce sector and the fact that more than \n     half of those who use the Internet have already made an \n     online purchase this holiday season.\n       The Marketplace Fairness Act restores fairness by providing \n     states the authority to collect if they are willing to \n     simplify their tax systems to make it easier to do business. \n     It also provides protection to truly small businesses in your \n     state through a small business exception. This common sense \n     approach will allow states to collect taxes they are owed, \n     help businesses comply with different state laws, and provide \n     fair competition between retailers that will benefit \n     consumers and protect jobs. Furthermore, passage of the bill \n     will serve as the equivalent of a $23 billion stimulus to \n     state and local governments helping to speed recovery and \n     grow the economy.\n       Best of all, the Marketplace Fairness Act will accomplish \n     these goals without raising taxes or increasing the federal \n     debt.\n       We understand that you would prefer to take up the \n     Marketplace Fairness Act next year in the context of wide-\n     ranging, comprehensive tax reform. Frankly, our Main Street \n     businesses and states cannot afford to wait. This is our best \n     chance to pass this important legislation and we urge your \n     support for enacting S. 1832 this year.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Chris Gregoire,\n       Washington.\n     Governor Bill Haslam,\n       Tennessee.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                National Governors\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 2013.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: On behalf of the \n     National Governors Association (NGA), we urge the Senate to \n     pass S. 743, known as the Marketplace Fairness Act (MFA), as \n     soon as possible.\n       Just last month, during Senate consideration of its FY14 \n     budget resolution, the Senate voted 75-24, in support of the \n     MFA. This overwhelming, bipartisan vote stands in stark \n     contrast to those who oppose this common-sense legislation.\n       Never before has the need for legislation to grant states \n     the authority to collect sales taxes on remote sales been \n     greater. The continued disparity between online retailers and \n     Main Street businesses is shuttering stores and undermining \n     state budgets. The Senate has the opportunity now to level \n     the playing field with 21st Century rules for all retailers.\n       Opponents call this legislation a new tax. Of course, this \n     is not a new tax, nor is it a tax on the Internet or on \n     business. It is merely a means of collecting taxes owed on \n     the sale of goods and services over the Internet.\n       From the viewpoint of the states, if a company is doing \n     business, selling goods and soliciting customers in their \n     state, that company should have to play by that state's \n     rules. If a state has a sales tax on specific goods, then \n     everybody selling those goods there should have to collect \n     and remit it. This philosophy is not only fair, it also \n     promotes competition, which is good for consumers, good for \n     tax equity, and good for business by leveling the playing \n     field and creating certainty--all accomplished without \n     affecting the federal budget.\n       NGA urges the Senate to take decisive bipartisan action and \n     pass S. 743.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Tom Corbett,\n       Chair, Economic Development and Commerce Committee.\n     Governor Steven Beshear,\n       Vice Chair, Economic Development and Commerce Committee.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Now, finally, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the names of the Governors and former Governors who \nsupport this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Robert Bentley, R-Alabama; Bob McDonnell, -R-Virginia; \n     Chris Christie, R-New Jersey; Nikki Haley, R-South Carolina; \n     Brain Sandoval, R-Nevada; Terry Branstad, R-Iowa; Dennis \n     Daugaard, R-South Dakota; Paul LePage, R-Maine; Tom Corbett, \n     R-Pennsylvania; Mike Pence, R-Indiana; Bill Haslam, R-\n     Tennessee; Rick Snyder, R-Michigan; C.L. ``Butch'' Otter, R-\n     Idaho; Jan Brewer, R-Arizona; Bobby Jindal, R-Louisiana; Rick \n     Scott, R-Florida; Nathan Deal, R-Georgia.\n       Lincoln Chafee, I-Rhode Island.\n       Steven Beshear, D-Kentucky; Neil Ambercrombie, D-Hawaii; \n     Mike Bebee, D-Arkansas; Jerry Brown, D-California; Mark \n     Dayton, D-Minnesota; John Hickenlooper, D-Colorado; Martin \n     O'Malley, D-Maryland;\n\n[[Page S2952]]\n\n     Dannell Malloy, D-Connecticut; Jay Nixon, D-Missouri; Deval \n     Patrick, D-Massachusetts; Patt Quinn, D-Illinois; Earl Ray \n     Tomblin, D-West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Former Governors-\n\n       Mitch Daniles, R-Indiana; Jeb Bush, R-Florida; Christine \n     Gregoire, D-Washington.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I do that with a little bit of obvious bias as a \nformer Governor. I think it is important that the country know what the \nGovernors think, because the legislation we are talking about today is \na States rights bill. It is an 11-page bill. It is a very simple, \nstraightforward bill. It simply says that Tennessee, Alabama, Virginia, \nNew Jersey, any State, has the right to decide for itself whether it \nwants to collect taxes that are already owed from some of the people \nwho owe the taxes or all of the people who owe the taxes. That is it. \nThat is it. That is all it does.\n  The Governors who supported it are the Governor of Alabama, Virginia, \nNew Jersey, South Carolina, Nevada, Iowa, South Dakota, Maine, \nPennsylvania, Indiana, Tennessee, Michigan, Governor Otter of Idaho, \nArizona, Louisiana, Florida, Georgia, Rhode Island, Kentucky, Hawaii.\n  I just read a bunch of Republican Governors. Now I am into the \nDemocrats: Kentucky, Hawaii, Arkansas, California, Minnesota, Colorado, \nMaryland, Connecticut, Missouri, Massachusetts, Illinois and West \nVirginia. The former Governors include Mitch Daniels, Jeb Bush, and the \nformer Democratic Governor of Washington.\n  Here we have a bill on the floor that we have voted on three times \nalready that has a majority of the Democratic Senators and a majority \nof the Republican Senators, and 75 votes three times--74 one time, 75 \ntwice. The bill also has the support of a long list of Republican \nGovernors--actually more Republican than Democratic Governors. Yet we \nhave got some people in Washington who say, we do not trust the States \nto make these decisions. I wonder if these people have ever read the \nConstitution of the United States? I wonder if they know what the 10th \nAmendment says? This was a very important part of the creation of this \ncountry.\n  Sovereign States had reserved to them their powers. They didn't \nexpect to come to Washington and play ``Mother May I'' to a bunch of \nSenators and Congressmen who fly here on airplanes and think they are \nsmarter than they were when they left Nashville, Memphis or wherever \ntheir hometown is. The purpose of this bill is to leave within the \nStates the responsibility for making decisions.\n  Some people up here think they know best. Maybe they do, maybe they \ndon't. Tennessee doesn't have an income tax. I would like for every \nState not to have an income tax, but I am not going to impose that from \nWashington just because I am a Senator.\n  Tennessee has a right-to-work law. I would like for every State to \nhave a right-to-work law, but I am not going to impose that from \nWashington. States have the right to be right, States have the right to \nbe wrong, and Washington has no business telling sovereign States what \nits tax structure ought to be. Washington certainly has no business \nstanding in the way of States stopping discrimination against taxpayers \nand businesses because that is exactly what we are doing if we don't \nact.\n  We are perpetuating discrimination. Most conservatives I know don't \nlike picking and choosing between winners and losers.\n  They don't like treating one taxpayer one way and one in a similar \nsituation another way, one business one way and another one another \nway. That is exactly what we are doing if we don't act.\n  We are discriminating against the shoestore in Wyoming, against the \nboot store in Nashville, and against the small store in Maryville, TN. \nWe are saying collect the tax when you sell something, but if your \ncompetitor from outside your State sells it, he or she does not have \nto. That is discrimination.\n  That is why the leading conservatives such as the chairman of the \nAmerican Conservative Union, William Buckley, before he died; and Art \nLaffer, the economist who helped President Reagan develop his ideas; \nand the Governors such as Mitch Daniels, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, and \nBill Haslam, that is why these conservatives say they support the bill.\n  We are not even deciding whether States will collect taxes from out-\nof-State sellers. We are just saying States have the right to do it. Of \ncourse they have the right to do it.\n  That is why I am including this list of Governors. I think it is part \nof our job as Senators to respect the sovereign States from where we \ncome, to respect the rights of the States to not think that just \nbecause we are in Washington we know better. Most Tennesseans don't \nlike that.\n  I know when I was Governor nothing used to make me madder than a \nbunch of legislators coming up with some bright idea in Washington, \npassing it, turning it into a law, holding a press conference, taking \nthe credit for it, and then sending the bill to me. The next thing you \nknow they would be home making a speech at the Lincoln Day Dinner or \nJefferson Day Dinner, if they were a Democrat, about local control. \nWell, it is about local control.\n  The idea that people in Washington would say we don't trust the \nStates to make decisions about how to spend money, look at our record. \nWe are running up trillion-dollar deficits every year, borrowing 26 \ncents out of every $1 we spend.\n  I come from a State that has no State debt on roads. It has to \nbalance the budget every year. It has a AAA bond rating. I would trust \nGovernor Haslam, Lieutenant Governor Ramsey, the Speaker of the House, \nand the Republican legislature a lot more than I do the Senate and \nCongress to make decisions about tax dollars.\n  I think I know pretty well what they will do if they have power to do \nit. I suspect they will say they are not going to pick and choose \nwinners and losers. I know they are going to say that because the \nGovernor and Lieutenant Governor told me. I expect what they will say \nis this will bring in more revenue so we will lower our tax rate \nbecause we will start collecting money from all the people who owe it \ninstead of some of the people who owe it.\n  It is correct that some Governors have already said that. We were \ntold today that in Ohio they have already said if this bill passes, \nthey will collect money from everybody who owes it and then they will \nlower their income taxes.\n  Art Laffer said in his column in the Wall Street Journal: That is \nprecisely what we ought to do to stimulate growth. He said: If we are \ngoing to have a tax, the best tax, said Mr. Laffer, is a tax that \ncovers the largest number of people at the lowest possible rate.\n  If that is the case, what we are perpetuating within action is the \nworst kind of tax, which is the tax that States are allowed to tax a \nsmaller range of people at a higher rate. This permits them to tax all \nthe people who are in a similarly situated place at a lower rate, if \nthat is what they choose to do.\n  The arrogance of those in Washington who would say they don't trust \nthe States to make those decisions, they need to go back to seventh \ngrade, read the U.S. Constitution and learn a little American history \nabout where this country came from.\n  I am very proud of this Senate for, on this important issue led by \nSenator Durbin and Senator Enzi, coming up with 75 and 74 votes 3 \nconsecutive times to say we believe in a two-word principle on this 11-\npage bill, States rights or 10th Amendment, that we will recognize the \npower of States to make their own decisions.\n  If we don't act, all these claims about what happened to the 9,600 \njurisdictions will come true. Some Governor--I know I would do it if I \nwere still there--the Senate didn't act on this, the Congress didn't \nact, I would go right back to the Supreme Court. I would bet that 20 \nyears after the Quill case that Senator Heitkamp brought, back before \nthere was an Internet, when the Court then said that requiring out-of-\nState sellers to collect the tax was burdensome, they would look at the \nInternet.\n  Those Justices know they can find out the weather in their hometowns \nby putting in the ZIP Code and putting in the name of the town. They \nknow that an out-of-State seller could figure out the sales tax from \nthe ZIP Code of the buyer. They know that.\n  I will predict that they would hold it is not an undue burden, and \nthen all\n\n[[Page S2953]]\n\nthe out-of-State sellers really would have 9,600 jurisdictions to deal \nwith. We are simplifying, and we are creating something that will work. \nWe are following a process that is well tried. There are a great many \nout-of-State catalog sellers and online sellers that today do exactly \nwhat the instate sellers do. They collect the sales tax. They do it \nthrough the ZIP Code over the Internet. We are saying everybody should \ndo that except those who sell less than $1 million a year. They don't \nhave to do anything under this law.\n  According to many economists, that takes 99 percent of the online \nsellers out of the effect of this bill. We have tried to bring this \nthrough regular order. We are down here trying right now. We have \nreceived substantial support. There have been hearings. There has been \na lot of work in the House, and there is broad support from the \nGovernors. I am hopeful we will move forward tomorrow, finish this \nlegislation, send it to the House, and take a step toward recognizing \nthe Constitutional framework of our country by honoring the sovereign \nStates rights to make decisions for themselves and stopping this \nattitude of requiring Governors and legislators to come to Washington \nand play ``Mother May I'' with responsibilities that ought to be \nclearly the responsibility of States.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I don't think it will take this long, \nbut I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for up to \n15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I come to the floor again to address \nclimate change, particularly today the change that carbon pollution is \nwreaking in our oceans.\n  Water temperatures are increasing, sea level is rising, ocean water \nis growing more acidic, and powerful storms are becoming more frequent \nand more intense. It is time to wake up to the threat to our oceans and \ncoasts posed by carbon pollution.\n  The rate at which carbon is now being dumped into the atmosphere and \nabsorbed by our oceans is unprecedented. NOAA estimates almost 1 \nmillion tons of the carbon dioxide we dump into the atmosphere is \nabsorbed into the oceans every hour--1 million tons every hour. We know \nwith scientific certainty that carbon pollution causes the ocean to \nbecome more acidic. Indeed, we measure that carbon pollution has caused \nthe global pH of the upper ocean to increase nearly 30 percent--by some \nmeasures nearly 40 percent--since preindustrial times.\n  In Rhode Island, the Ocean State, coastal activities define our \nheritage, our culture, and also our economy. Our coastal waters are \nspawning grounds, nurseries and shelters for fish and shellfish, which \nwe enjoy and from which we profit. Our shores and coastal ponds are \nbarriers that protect our coastal communities from ocean storms and \nthat naturally improve water quality. Our oceans and coasts make \ncoastal States such as ours who we are.\n  We will continue to take advantage of the ocean's bounty, as we \nshould. We will trade, we will fish, and we will sail. We will dispose \nof waste, we will extract fuel and harness the wind. We will work our \noceans. Navies and cruise ships, sailboats and supertankers will plow \ntheir surface. We cannot undo this part of our relationship with the \nsea. What we can change is what we do in return. If we use our best \nscience and judgment to plan for the uses of our oceans, we will \ncontinue to reap the value they provide.\n  Carbon-driven changes to our planet will continue and will \naccelerate. The faster you are driving, the better your headlights need \nto be. Our headlights in this area are scientific research and \nplanning. As we move ever faster into this uncharted territory, our \nheadlights had better be working to preserve the valuable ecosystems \nupon which our communities and economies rely.\n  The National Ocean Policy, signed by President Obama in 2010, \nprovides a commonsense framework for sensible research and planning and \npublic-private cooperation, as we face the significant challenges \nbearing down on our oceans and coasts--on both our ecosystems and our \nindustries.\n  Last week, the White House released the National Ocean Policy \nImplementation Plan, a blueprint for effective management of our oceans \nand the Great Lakes. It is not easy to balance the competing needs of \ncommerce, conservation, culture, and recreation. More than 20 Federal \nagencies oversee our marine industries, governing everything from \nfisheries to oil and gas leasing. The implementation plan takes this on \nand moves us toward better and more collaborative management of ocean \nresources.\n  The implementation plan gathered the thoughts of a wide range of key \nstakeholders: maritime and energy industries, conservation and \nrecreation interests, academic experts, and Federal, State, local, and \ntribal governments. The plan supports economic growth by streamlining \npermitting and approval processes, by improving mapping and ocean \nobserving, and by providing greater access to data and information. The \nplan lays out specific actions and timelines to protect and restore \ncoastal wetlands and reefs and to prevent economic losses and job \nlosses due to degraded shores and degraded waters.\n  Our coasts need immediate attention, so the plan could not come too \nsoon. It states:\n\n       Our nation lost nearly 60,000 acres of coastal wetlands \n     each year between 1998 and 2004. . . . Habitats are being \n     altered by invasive species that threaten native aquatic life \n     and cost billions of dollars per year in natural and \n     infrastructure damage.\n\n  The implementation process the administration is pursuing is all \nabout local needs and concerns. So the National Ocean Policy \nestablishes voluntary regional planning bodies. Local people can get \ntogether, layer together the relevant data, and promote greater and \nmore responsible use of their region's ocean resources.\n  In New England, we have seen the value of this cooperative ocean \nplanning. Rhode Island's Ocean Special Area Management Plan--a special \narea management plan is called a SAMP in the trade--has made ecosystem \nrestoration and industry interests advance simultaneously. I recently \nspent time at the Northeast Regional Planning Body meeting in Rhode \nIsland and I know our region is excited to move forward with a regional \nprocess.\n  So let's look at some of the practical results when you get the \ninformation and the affected people in the room together. In Rhode \nIsland, the wind energy industry, with its vast potential for \nmanufacturing and maintenance jobs, is rapidly developing wind farms \noff of our coasts. Thanks to the groundwork that was laid by the Rhode \nIsland SAMP, wind developers moved fairly smoothly through the \nregulatory thicket and they have avoided interference with marine \nhighways, critical fisheries, habitats, and naval training ranges.\n  There is actually quite a good report I commend to all my colleagues \non the ocean SAMP published by the Rhode Island Ocean Special Area \nManagement Plan. It is a practitioner's guide, and it is a very \neffective document that shows how well this worked.\n\n  In this process, local people were listened to and they were heard. \nWhen the Federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management announced this wind \nenergy area here off of the Rhode Island coast, there was an area named \nCoxes Ledge, and the fishermen were concerned. The floor of the ocean \nat Coxes Ledge made it particularly rich fishing grounds and they \ndidn't want it interfered with by having that area put up for wind farm \ndevelopment. Sure enough, when the map came out, the curve of Coxes \nLedge is going right through the middle of the wind farm area, \nprotected for the fishermen. They were listened to and they were heard.\n  So much of this is simple common sense. In Massachusetts, the \nendangered North Atlantic right whale, a population of about 450 of \nthem, feeds in the waters just off of Boston. The whale strikes between \nshipping and the\n\n[[Page S2954]]\n\nright whales were becoming a problem. And because the right whale is \nendangered, it was becoming a real risk for shipping going in and out \nof Boston Harbor. So they found data that showed where the whale \nstrikes were likely to be and they mapped that data. When they mapped \nthe data, they saw if they moved the shipping channel out of Boston \nHarbor up a little bit they could come through an area that was largely \nsafe from whale strikes. The cost to the industry was somewhere between \n9 and 22 minutes of extra transit time--virtually nothing--while the \nnumber of whale strikes has dropped significantly.\n  Here is another example from outside of Delaware. The green sort of \nneon-colored dots here track the signals coming off cargo ships going \nin and out of Delaware Bay. As you can see, there is a pretty solid \ntrack coming out of Delaware Bay right through here. When Delaware \nfirst proposed its wind energy areas, they proposed these light green \nblocks as wind energy areas. This one, as we can see here, was planned \nright on top of the main shipping channel heading southeast out of \nDelaware Bay.\n  Critics say these kinds of efforts to get the data and the people in \nthe room together ``zone'' the ocean. That is just plain factually \nwrong. The policy brings together people who use our ocean. In this \ncase, the case of Delaware Bay, simply putting everybody in the room \nallowed the wind energy areas to be modified to avoid the conflict. So \nthe southeastern area comes out and the turbine areas are beside it and \nthe problem has been solved. That is not zoning, that is what military \nofficers would call situational awareness; what the military would call \ndeconfliction. What it really is is common sense.\n  As Nancy Sutley, the Chair of the White House Council on \nEnvironmental Quality, said:\n\n       With increasing demands on our ocean, we must improve how \n     we work together, share information, and plan smartly to grow \n     our economy, keep our ocean healthy and enjoy the highest \n     benefits from our ocean resources, now and in the future.\n\n  Our ocean and coastal economy is important. Shoreline counties in \nthis country generate 41 percent of our gross domestic product. In \n2010, 2.8 million jobs were supported by maritime economic activities; \ncommercial ports supported 13 million jobs; energy and minerals \nproduction supported almost three-fourths of a million jobs. But all of \nthis activity creates opportunities for conflict.\n  The National Ocean Policy Implementation Plan is a blueprint to \nresolve those wasteful conflicts, to ``deconflict'' intelligently, and \nto streamline efforts across the Federal Government to keep our oceans \nand our ocean economy thriving. And it lets each region go forward at \nits own pace.\n  Michael Keyworth, recent head of our Rhode Island Marine Trades \nAssociation, helped develop the Rhode Island Ocean Special Area \nManagement Plan, SAMP, said this:\n\n       The National Ocean Policy Implementation Plan will enable \n     regions like New England to move ahead with this smart ocean \n     planning by engaging people like me, who live and work on the \n     water every day, while not forcing planning on other regions \n     that do not currently want to engage in the process.\n\n  Climate change is upon us, and its effects will only accelerate as we \ncontinue to spew megatons of carbon into our atmosphere. Changes are \noccurring fast in the oceans. That fact makes it all the more important \nthat Congress remain vigilant and that we put our full support behind \nthe commonsense framework of the national ocean policy.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Protecting Social Security\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, last month, the Senate approved a \nbudget that included a blueprint for balanced and responsible deficit \nreduction. That budget was skillfully managed by our Budget Committee \nchairman, Senator Murray. It would complete the deficit reduction \nneeded to stabilize our Nation's finances with a mix of smart spending \ncuts and revenue from closing wasteful tax loopholes. Top economists \nagree we need about $4 trillion of deficit reduction to make our \nfinances sustainable, and our budget gets us there. Together with the \ndeficit reduction enacted last Congress, the Senate budget would reduce \nthe deficit by $4.3 trillion through a nearly 2-to-1 mix of spending \ncuts and revenue.\n  House Republicans took a very different approach with their budget, \nmaking only cuts--drastic cuts--to education, law enforcement, medical \nresearch, and even ending Medicare as we know it for future retirees. \nThe House budget derives its deficit reduction from cuts that primarily \nhurt low-income and middle-class Americans, while refusing to touch a \nsingle tax giveaway to wealthy and well-connected special interests. \nSenate Democrats took a middle course; House Republicans produced an \nextremist tea party wish list.\n  In his own budget plan, President Obama included some smart \nprovisions such as investments in infrastructure and the Buffett rule \nfor tax fairness. I respect the President's outreach to a compromise \nwith Republicans, but I cannot support the cuts to Social Security \nbenefits in his plan. It is simply wrong to place the burden of deficit \nreduction on seniors and the disabled. Social Security--one of the \nfundamental pillars of the American middle class--has not contributed \nand will not contribute to our deficits. Social Security is fully \nfunded by its participants through payroll taxes and cannot by law add \nto the deficit.\n  Under current payroll tax levels, Social Security will have the funds \nto pay 100 percent of benefits until 2033. It is true we do need to \nmake some adjustments to ensure that full benefits can be paid beyond \nthat date, but that task has nothing to do with deficit reduction. Even \nif Congress did nothing before 2033, the projected shortfall would \nforce automatic benefit cuts, not deficit spending.\n  I do look forward to working with Senators of both parties to ensure \nthat Social Security remains fully solvent for generations to come, but \nthat discussion does not belong in the unrelated debate on our Nation's \nbudget deficits.\n  The Social Security cuts the President has proposed are not just in \nthe wrong discussion, they are wrong themselves. To reflect inflation, \nSocial Security recipients each year get cost-of-living adjustments, \nwhat we call COLAs. The President's proposal changes the formula used \nto make that determination, shifting to something called the chained \nConsumer Price Index or chained CPI. It sounds innocuous, but make no \nmistake, it is a benefit cut cloaked in technical jargon.\n  The argument for a chained CPI is that it is a more accurate measure \nof inflation--that it takes into account real-world decisions consumers \nmake to modify their buying habits as prices fluctuate. As the price of \napples goes up, we buy more bananas, so the overall effect on our \nbudget is moderated. The result is lower annual cost-of-living \nadjustments--about 0.3 percent each year. But let's take a look at how \nseniors fare under the existing COLA structure.\n  In 2010 and 2011, seniors received no cost-of-living adjustment \nwhatsoever--0.0 percent in 2010, 0.0 percent in 2011. But according to \nthe existing consumer price formula used by government accountants, \nprices didn't rise enough to justify COLAs. That is what the COLA \nformula says. But in real life, what did it look like?\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, seniors saw food prices \nrise 1.5 percent in 2010, medical costs increase 3.3 percent, and they \nsaw their gas and home heating oil go up by more than 13 percent each, \nand the COLA covered zero percent.\n  The next year, 2011, these costs increased again. Food prices jumped \n4.5 percent, medical care jumped 3.5 percent, gasoline jumped 9.9 \npercent, and fuel oil jumped 14.3 percent, and again the COLA for \nseniors was zero.\n  So 2010 and 2011 add together; they are not included in one another. \nSo food and beverage is a total of 6 percent, plus, allowing for \ncompounding, 6.8 percent for medical care, 23.7 percent for gasoline, \nand 27.8 percent for\n\n[[Page S2955]]\n\nfuel oil--all with a COLA of zero percent.\n  The numbers show what Rhode Island seniors know: The problem with the \nSocial Security COLA is that it is too low, that it doesn't meet the \nreal costs seniors experience in real life.\n  Why does this happen? The existing cost-of-living formula considers \nprices across the whole economy, including products seniors are not so \nlikely to buy, such as flat-screen TVs and smart phones and sporting \nequipment. Their prices may have fallen, but seniors don't benefit much \nfrom those lower prices.\n\n  The problem is that the current system fails to account for seniors' \ntrue costs in these areas. So my position is that we should move on to \na more accurate formula for seniors, one that focuses on food, medicine \nand heating oil and gas and the other things seniors actually buy. I \nhave been proud to support legislation to change the Social Security \nCOLA formula to one that is geared more toward seniors, and I will \ncontinue to fight for the adoption of that new formula.\n  Chained CPI takes us in the opposite direction. It assumes consumers \nwill alter the types of goods they buy as prices rise. But seniors on \nfixed incomes have little ability to shift their buying habits away \nfrom these basic expenses, things such as food, medical care, gasoline, \nand fuel oil. It is hard to shift away from those. The lower COLAs that \nchained CPI would produce will only cut into seniors' already tight \nbudgets, and force seniors to bear the burden of reducing deficits that \nSocial Security had no part in creating. A 0.3-percent reduction each \nyear might sound small, but over time the power of compound interest \nmakes those benefit cuts significant.\n  For people currently nearing retirement, these cuts would amount to \nannual benefit reductions of $658 by the time they reach age 75, $1,147 \nby the time they reach age 85, and $1,622 by the time they reach age \n95. That same power of compounding makes these cuts even larger for \nfuture generations of seniors. Perhaps $658 or $1,1622 doesn't sound \nlike much money to some folks around here, but to a senior in Rhode \nIsland living on Social Security, that is real money.\n  After getting no COLA for 2 years in a row, Bethany, a senior from \nSmithfield, RI, wrote to me:\n\n       My health is not the best and it's not easy trying to \n     survive on my Social Security and the increasing prices of \n     gas, food, etc. and co-pays for medical. . . . The COLA \n     calculation for Social Security doesn't work. We need an \n     increase yearly to stay even with rising premiums and \n     everyday expenses. Please continue to fight for Social \n     Security and Medicare.\n\n  Deanne from Coventry, RI, wrote to me in February:\n\n       I am 68 years old and retired. I cannot work even part time \n     because of severe Arthritis. My son lives with me who is \n     permanently disabled due to an accident when he was 9 years \n     old. He is now 44 years old. We just make ends meet with \n     Social Security as we have no other income. We wear sweat \n     shirts and pants to bed and coats in the house during the \n     winter because we can't pay the high prices of oil. If Social \n     Security gets cut, I don't know how we will make it. I have \n     worked all my adult life until the last two years. I NEED my \n     Social Security. . . . In the face of ever-increasing prices \n     for health care, home heating, prescription drugs and grocery \n     bills, asking seniors to give up more and more of their \n     Social Security benefit as they age when every dollar counts \n     is just plain wrong.\n\n  These are real-life experiences of people who are the kind of folks \nchained CPI would affect. Yes, we need to make additional sacrifices to \ncomplete the job of deficit reduction; no, those burdens should not \nfall on our elderly and disabled constituents. Our deficits come from \nunnecessary Bush-era tax cuts that virtually exclusively benefited the \nwealthy, they come from a decade of wars we didn't pay for, and they \ncome from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. They \nhave nothing to do with Social Security, so don't take it out on the \nseniors.\n  As the Senate budget shows, we can complete the task of stabilizing \nour Nation's finances in smart ways, in fair ways, in balanced ways, in \nways that don't put the burden on those who can least afford it.\n  When I ran for this office, I pledged to the people of Rhode Island \nthat I would oppose cuts to Social Security, and I will keep that \npromise.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

It is hard to mention all of \ntheir many achievements. As founder of the highly successful Green \nMountain Coffee Roasters, Bob continues to promote sustainable business \npractices through environmental and fair trade initiatives all over the \nworld.

Mr. President, 98 years ago today, the Ottoman Empire in \nTurkey launched one of the most horrific episodes in human history. The \ndetention and eventual execution of hundreds of members of Turkey's \nethnic Armenian minority launched a genocidal campaign of deportation \nand starvation in which more than 1.5 million people ultimately \nperished.\n  We mark Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day, first, because those who \nperished deserve to be remembered, but we also do so as a reminder: a \nreminder of the horrible violence that ethnic hatred can inflame; a \nreminder that too often, governments have employed those hatreds and \npassions; and a reminder that the world's silence in the face of one \nsuch episode of atrocity can embolden others who would seek to emulate \nit. It is often noted that Adolph Hitler, in justifying his invasion of \nPoland in 1939, told his commanders: ``Who, after all, speaks today of \nthe annihilation of the Armenians?'' Silence in the face of governments \nthat abuse and oppress their people simply enables the perpetrators of \nviolence and injustice.\n  I join the many members of the Armenian-American community and \nArmenians around the world in the hope that the Government of the \nRepublic of Turkey which we should remember played no role in the \nArmenian genocide can work together with the Government of Armenia to \nheal the divisions that remain nearly a century after this dark \nepisode. That should include an honest and forthright dialogue about \nthe nature of the events and the impact that it has had which is still \nwith us today. Already, the governments of these two nations have \nnegotiated an agreement to open the border between them, an agreement \nthat includes a pledge to establish an independent commission of \nhistorians to review and come to a common understanding of the events \nof a century ago. I am hopeful that this agreement can be ratified and \nimplemented.\n  It is also worth remembering that Turkey, a vital U.S. ally, is \nplaying an enormously important role in confronting a more recent \natrocity: the death of thousands of Syrian civilians at the hands of a \ndictatorial government seeking to hold on to power at any cost. More \nthan 75,000 Syrians have died in this strife, and more than 1 million \nof them are refugees. Many of those refugees have sought shelter in \nTurkey. I have joined with Senator McCain and others in calling for our \ngovernment to explore additional ways of supporting the Syrian people \nand of supporting the efforts of Turkey and other nations to protect \nSyria's people. That call is motivated, in part, by the memory of \nhistoric episodes in which the community of nations has failed to act \nwhen confronted by such evil.\n  Our remembrance of the Armenian genocide makes it incumbent upon us \nto bear witness to this and other modern atrocities against human and \ncivil rights. By our refusal to remain silent in the face of today's \nviolence and injustice, we honor the victims of the Armenian genocide \nand other atrocities against decency and humanity.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 98th \nanniversary of the Armenian genocide.\n  In 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations passed the \nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide \nbased in part on the horrific crimes perpetrated by the Ottoman Empire \nagainst the Armenian people in the early 20th Century.\n  Between 1915 and 1923, more than 1.5 million Armenians were marched \nto their deaths in the deserts of the Middle East, murdered in \nconcentration camps, drowned at sea, and forced to endure horrific acts \nof brutality at the hands of the Ottoman Empire.\n  Yet, in the 65 years that have passed since the Convention was \nadopted, successive U.S. administrations have refused to call the \ndeliberate massacre of the Armenians by its rightful name genocide.\n  For many years, I have urged both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations to finally acknowledge the truth. I do so again today. \nIt is long past time for our government to acknowledge, once and for \nall, that the Armenian genocide is a widely documented fact supported \nby an overwhelming body of historical evidence.\n  In fact, the Armenian genocide along with the Holocaust is one of the \nmost studied cases of genocide in history. Tragically, Adolf Hitler \neven used the Ottoman Empire's action against the Armenians to justify \nthe extermination of the Jews in the Holocaust, saying in 1939, ``Who, \nafter all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?''\n  A number of sovereign nations, ranging from Argentina to France, as \nwell as 43 out of 50 U.S. States have recognized what happened to the \nArmenians as genocide. Yet successive U.S. administrations continue \nonly to refer to the Armenian genocide as an annihilation, massacre, or \nmurder.\n  The entire Armenian community and the descendants of the victims of \nthe Armenian genocide continue to suffer prolonged pain each and every \nday that goes by without full acknowledgement by the United States.\n  I hope that this is the year that we finally right this terrible \nwrong because the United States cannot and does not turn a blind eye to \natrocities around the globe. In fact, the United States is often the \nfirst to speak out in the face of violence and unspeakable suffering \nand to urge other countries to respond. But sadly, our Nation is on the \nwrong side of history when it comes to the Armenian genocide.\n  So this April 24, as we pause to remember the victims and to \ncelebrate the many contributions Armenian Americans have made to our \ngreat country, I hope that the United States will finally and firmly \nstand on the right side of history and officially condemn the crimes of \n1915 to 1923 by their appropriate name.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/24/senate-section/article/S2956-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2956-S2957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        PLYMOUTH, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Ms. AYOTTE.

I am proud to join citizens across the Granite State \nin recognizing this historic event.\n  Plymouth was built at the convergence of the Pemigewasset and Baker \nrivers amid the beautiful White Mountains.\n  Plymouth was granted a charter by Gov. Benning Wentworth in 1763 and \nincorporated later that same year. It is named after the original \nPlymouth Colony in Massachusetts.\n  The population has grown to include over 7,000 residents. The \npatriotism and commitment of the people of Plymouth is reflected in \npart by their record of service in defense of our Nation.\n  Some of Plymouth's most notable residents include U.S. Senator and \nCongressman Henry W. Blair, Pulitzer Prize-winning authors Robert Frost \nand John Cheever, as well as Harl Pease. Mr. Pease was a World War II \npilot and recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n  New Hampshire native, and then attorney, Daniel Webster, who went on \nto become one of the Senate's great orators, tried and lost his first \ncriminal case in the Plymouth Courthouse.\n  Based in Plymouth, the Draper and Maynard Sporting Goods Company sold \ndirectly to the Boston Red Sox. Many early players would make the \njourney to Plymouth and select their equipment for the upcoming season.\n  Plymouth Normal School was founded in 1871 and became the State's \nfirst teachers college. This institution would subsequently become the \nPlymouth Teachers College, Plymouth State College, and is known today \nas Plymouth State University.\n  Plymouth is a place that has contributed much to the life and spirit \nof the State of New Hampshire. I am pleased to extend my warm regards \nto the people of Plymouth as they celebrate the town's 250th \nanniversary.\n\n[[Page S2957]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/24/senate-section/article/S2957-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         WARREN, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Warren, NH--a \ntown in Grafton County that is celebrating the 250th anniversary of its \nfounding. I am proud to join citizens across the Granite State in \nrecognizing this historic event. This area, drained by the Baker River \nand built in the shadow of Mount Moosilauke, exemplifies the beauty of \nthe surrounding White Mountain National Forest.\n  Warren was granted a charter by Governor Benning Wentworth in 1763 \nand incorporated by Governor John Wentworth in 1770. The town derives \nits name from British Admiral Sir Peter Warren and was first settled by \nJoseph Patch and John Page.\n  Since that time, the population has grown to include over 900 \nresidents. The patriotism and commitment of the people of Warren are \nreflected in part by their service in most of America's major \nconflicts, with over 60 serving in World War II alone.\n  Warren's most notable landmark is a Redstone Ballistic Missile, \ndedicated in honor of Warren's favorite son, Senator Norris Cotton. \nSenator Cotton represented New Hampshire in Washington, D.C., for \nalmost 30 years, including 8 years as a Congressman and over 20 as a \nSenator. The Federal building in Manchester and the Comprehensive \nCancer Center at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Hospital, both bear his name.\n  Another notable resident of Warren was Ira Morse. Mr. Morse was a \nsuccessful shoe retailer who traveled the world hunting big-game and \ncollecting cultural artifacts. In 1928, Ira Morse opened his collection \nto the public and established the Morse Museum.\n  Located in the village of Glencliff is the historic Glencliff Home. \nThis facility first provided relief and treatment for urban workers \nsuffering from breathing impairment. Although its mission has changed, \nthe home is still in operation and is currently administered by the New \nHampshire Department of Health and Human Services.\n  Warren is a place that has contributed much to the life and spirit of \nthe State of New Hampshire. I am pleased to extend my warm regards to \nthe people of Warren as they celebrate the town's 250th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/24/senate-section/article/S2957-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WELLSPRING REVIVAL MINISTRIES\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the \n15th anniversary of the founding of Wellspring Revival Ministries in \nFairbanks, AK. In 1998, Michael and Linda Setterberg recognized the \nneed for more youth activities in the Fairbanks area and set out to do \nsomething about it. In 1999, the Setterbergs opened Joel's Place, a \nplace for young people who needed somewhere to belong.\n  It began with a weekly youth group meeting but it grew to be \nsomething much bigger. Today, relying on volunteers, grants and \ncharitable contributions, Joel's Place is open 6 days a week with a \nconcert hall, a cafe, a garden, and sports activities including the \nonly indoor skate park in Alaska. Joel's Place works with local school \ncounselors and is a National Safe Place, offering shelter and \ncounseling.\n  Part of the success of Joel's Place is due to partnerships with other \nlocal nonprofits and national foundations, as well as State and local \ngovernments. Federal grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nprovide support for the organization's Summer Food Service Program and \nChild and Adult Care Food Program, which ensures that low-income \nchildren receive nutritious meals.\n  The power to keep the program going comes from the passion and \ndevotion of the founders of Joel's Place, the professionals who run it, \nthe board of directors who oversee the organization and the volunteers \nwho give their time. I give my congratulations to the people who make \nJoel's Place go, and I look forward to hearing about their continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/24/senate-section/article/S2957-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO LOREN DUKE ABDALLA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize the military service of Loren Duke Abdalla, the great \ngrandson of Yankton Sioux Tribe Chief Running Bull. Loren Duke Abdalla, \na native South Dakotan, fought valiantly as part of the U.S. Marine \nCorps in World War II.\n  Loren Duke Abdalla, or ``Duke'' as he was known by his fellow \nMarines, began his service to this Nation when he enlisted in the \nMarine Corps in 1943 at the age of 18. He completed his basic training \nat Camp Elliot in San Diego, CA, where he was trained as a rifleman and \nmachine gunner.\n  On September 15, 1944, Duke displayed his bravery at the Battle of \nPeleliu in the Pacific. In the struggle, three of his comrades were \nstruck down next to him, but Duke still carried on, despite injuries, \nthrough the 6-day battle. At the end, Duke survived as one of only 29 \nMarines left standing in his Battalion. Shrapnel left holes in both of \nhis legs, yet instead of returning home, he recovered in only a few \nmonths on the Island of Guadalcanal and returned to Pavuvu Island. He \nreceived a Purple Heart and was promoted to Corporal, and became squad \nleader of the 3rd Squad, 1st Platoon, A Company.\n  Duke returned to combat and quickly became a hero once again in the \nBattle of Okinawa. On May 5, 1945, he rescued 2nd squadron leader, Cpl \nJohn Brady, throwing him over his shoulder and carrying him to safety \nunder heavy fire. Duke immediately returned to the battle where he \nbegan neutralizing machine gun nests leading up a ridge along with his \n12-person squadron. When he reached the fourth nest, he realized he was \nalone. With his comrades killed or wounded, he forged on to take out \nthe last two nests by himself and reached the top of the ridge. In \ntaking the ridge, he allowed the First Marine Division to advance. \nAlthough many of his comrades were honored for their bravery on that \nday, Duke was not recognized for his action.\n  Duke ended his service with an honorable discharge on February 28, \n1947, ending 4 years of selfless sacrifice for our nation that will not \nsoon be forgotten. At the battles of Okinawa and Peleliu, some of the \nbloodiest battles in the Pacific Theater, Loren Duke Abdalla proved \ntime and again his courage, perseverance and ability to sacrifice, \npreventing many potential casualties. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing Corporal Loren Duke Abdalla for his exemplary service and \ndedication to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/24/senate-section/article/S2957-4", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2957-S2958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO GENE MURPHY\n\n MR. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \npay tribute to a tireless and inspirational advocate for veterans \nacross this Nation. Gene Murphy is retiring as adjutant of the South \nDakota chapter of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), just the latest \nin a number of State and national veterans organizational posts he has \nserved with distinction over the years.\n  Gene served in the United States Army in Vietnam. Just 30 days before \nhe was scheduled to return home to the United States, Gene was \nparalyzed by two gunshots to his right side. He holds the Purple Heart \nand the Bronze Star with V Device.\n  Shortly after his return to the States, Gene became a lifetime member \nof the Disabled American Veterans, embarking on a 45-year career of \nserving the Nation's veterans and their families. Gene has shown \ntireless advocacy and a strong commitment to ensuring veterans receive \nthe care and attention to their issues that they deserve and were \npromised.\n  Gene has been actively involved with the DAV at both the State and \nnational level. From 1987-1988 he served as the DAV National Commander. \nIn 1984, he was selected as the Nation's Outstanding Disabled Veteran \nof the Year. Gene served 20 years on the South Dakota Veterans \nCommission. He is a member of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, \nMilitary Order of The Purple Heart, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the \nSouth Dakota Veterans Council. In 1979, he was named South Dakota's \nHandicapped Citizen of the Year.\n  Gene has been a steadfast advocate for veterans, whether the issues \nincluded improving health care services, conditions and access to care \nwithin the Department of Veterans Affairs; expediting consideration and \ndecisions on claims for benefits; or shining the spotlight on the \nunique health care needs of veterans exposed to Agent Orange, who \nsuffer from post-traumatic\n\n[[Page S2958]]\n\nstress disorder, or who were victims of traumatic brain injuries. \nCountless veterans in South Dakota have been able to make it to their \nVA appointments because of the DAV's transportation network and Gene's \nefforts in this area. Gene has brought awareness and education to \nelected officials and the general public on veterans mental health \nissues. He is keenly aware that military service impacts family members \nof veterans as well and has been an advocate on their behalf, too. Gene \nhas also been instrumental in working to get the American Veterans' \nDisabled for Life Memorial built in Washington, DC, serving on the \nfoundation's board of directors and as the treasurer of the Disabled \nVeterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation, Inc.\n  The native South Dakotan has been hawkish on budget issues facing the \nVA, making sure that the voices of veterans--young and old--are heard. \nAny effort to minimize, decrease or eliminate services to veterans \nwould meet a stern challenge from Gene Murphy. He is aware of the \nfinancial impacts of increased copayments on indigent veterans. He \nremains steadfastly passionate that veterans, no matter what category \nor priority they are placed in, receive the full faith and commitment \nof their government when it comes to care and benefits.\n  I have always been impressed by Gene's passion and commitment to \nveterans, their families and their issues--whether it be a widow \nseeking benefits, a veteran seeking consideration of their overdue \nclaim, or an era of veterans seeking compensation due to chemical \nexposure in a war zone. I have always valued and appreciated Gene's \ninput on the plethora of issues impacting veterans. During my early \nyears in Congress, Gene was very helpful in providing me with a better \nunderstanding of the many important issues facing veterans and their \nfamilies, and I have relied upon Gene's insight on such issues \nthroughout my congressional career. Gene never sugar-coats his requests \nor his statements; it is always done with candor and frankness. Nobody \ncan second-guess Gene Murphy's passion for veterans.\n  Although Gene's term as adjutant of the South Dakota Disabled \nAmerican Veterans is scheduled to end with the South Dakota DAV's State \nconvention, and there are rumors that Gene may be stepping back from \nhis consistently full plate of activities on behalf of South Dakota's \nand the Nation's veterans, I cannot believe that Gene's voice will be \nsilent. I hope he will continue to provide me with advice and counsel \non veterans issues.\n  I commend the lifetime of work by Gene Murphy on behalf of the \nNation's veterans. I congratulate him on his numerous awards and the \nleadership roles he has held and taken for veterans over the past many \ndecades. Veterans and their families have a true advocate in Gene \nMurphy and are better off today because of him. I commend his work with \nthe DAV and other veterans organizations and wish Gene and his wife \nEldine well in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/24/senate-section/article/S2958-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               2013 NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY--PM 8\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit the 2013 National Drug Control Strategy, my \nAdministration's blueprint for reducing drug use and its consequences \nin the United States. As detailed in the pages that follow, my \nAdministration remains committed to a balanced public health and public \nsafety approach to drug policy. This approach is based on science, not \nideology--and scientific research suggests that we have made real \nprogress.\n  The rate of current cocaine use in the United States has dropped by \n50 percent since 2006, and methamphetamine use has declined by one-\nthird. New data released this year suggest that we are turning a corner \nin our efforts to address the epidemic of prescription drug abuse, with \nthe number of people abusing prescription drugs decreasing by nearly 13 \npercent--from 7 million in 2010 to 6.1 million in 2011. And the number \nof Americans reporting that they drove after using illicit drugs also \ndropped by 12 percent between 2010 and 2011.\n  While this progress is encouraging, we must sustain our commitment to \npreventing drug use before it starts--the most cost-effective way to \naddress the drug problem. The importance of prevention is becoming ever \nmore apparent. Despite positive trends in other areas, we continue to \nsee elevated rates of marijuana use among young people, likely driven \nby declines in perceptions of risk. We must continue to get the facts \nout about the health risks of drug use and support the positive \ninfluences in young people's lives that help them avoid risky \nbehaviors.\n  The Strategy that follows presents a sophisticated approach to a \ncomplicated problem, encompassing prevention, early intervention, \ntreatment, recovery support, criminal justice reform, effective law \nenforcement, and international cooperation.\n  I look forward to working with the Congress and stakeholders at all \nlevels in advancing this 21st century approach to drug policy.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, April 24, 2013.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/24/senate-section/article/S2958-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  The President pro tempore (Mr. LEAHY) announced that on today, April \n24, 2013, he had signed the following enrolled bill, previously signed \nby the Speaker of the House:\n\n       H.R. 1246.

A bill to prevent an increase in flight delays and \ncancellations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise this morning to introduce \nlegislation. The legislation is entitled the ``Dependable Air Service \nAct.'' It is a very simple, straightforward solution to the issue of \nthe furloughs of air traffic controllers, and I would like to take just \na few minutes to describe it.\n  This is bipartisan legislation. I would like to start out by thanking \nmy cosponsors. The lead cosponsor is Senator Amy Klobuchar of \nMinnesota, but other cosponsors are Senator John Cornyn of Texas, \nSenator Rob Portman of Ohio, Senator Kelly Ayotte, Senator Risch of \nIdaho, and also Senator Jean Shaheen of New Hampshire. As one can see, \nit is bipartisan legislation. These are original cosponsors on the bill \nwith me, and we will have more, as we are talking to others.\n  As I said, this is a very simple, straightforward solution to the \nissue we face of delays in our airports across the country because of \nthe furloughs to air traffic controllers. What the bill does is to say \nto the Administrator of the FAA--the Federal Aviation Administration, \nAdministrator Huerta--that he can use dollars within his budget, move \nthem around as he needs to move them around, and that is what he needs \nto do--to move dollars around within his budget so he does not have to \ntake $206 million out of the salary line of the air traffic \ncontrollers. He can then decide what reductions he can make in those \nsalaries and what level of furloughs he can make to air traffic \ncontrollers but still maintain air service on an on-time basis, so we \nhave dependable on-time air service across this country for our \ncitizens.\n  Further, it provides that if for any reason the FAA Administrator, \nwithin his budget, cannot fully accomplish that, then the Secretary of \nTransportation, Mr. LaHood, can work with him to utilize funds within \nthe budget of the Department of Transportation. It provides the \nauthority, quite simply, to move the dollars around within the budget \nof the DOT--Department of Transportation--and gives the Secretary that \nauthority to make sure they do not furlough more air traffic \ncontrollers than are needed to keep our air flights on time, to keep \nservice, of course, safe and dependable so the traveling public can be \nassured their flights are going to be on time.\n  The FAA has announced they are furloughing about 1,500 air traffic \ncontrollers, which is about 10 percent of their total air traffic \ncontroller workforce. They are doing this to save $206 million of the \nroughly $630 million to $640 million the FAA is reducing under \nsequestration. They have the authority to move 2 percent of their \noperating budget without congressional approval, and they have the \nauthority to move up to 5 percent of their operational budget around \nwith congressional approval, which means coming to the Appropriations \nCommittee and getting approval to move up to that 5 percent. But FAA \nAdministrator Huerta has said that is not a sufficient amount to make \nthe adjustments he needs to make within the FAA budget to address the \nfurlough issue.\n  So what this bill does, quite simply, is it says: Look, you can move \nthe dollars as you need to within your budget. You have the flexibility \nand the authority to do that. Do that. And if for any reason that isn't \nsufficient, then Secretary LaHood can backstop that through the \nDepartment of Transportation dollars.\n  To put this into perspective, the total budget for the Department of \nTransportation is $72 billion--$72 billion--and the total cuts \nthroughout DOT, which includes the FAA, under sequestration is about $1 \nbillion--$1 billion. The FAA is taking $637 million of that reduction. \nOf course, the real issue we are dealing with in terms of flight delays \nis that about $206 million comes out of the air traffic controller \nsalary line. So what we are saying is: Look, make some reductions, find \nsome economies, do what you can within the air traffic controller line, \njust as you are doing across the budget. We should all be doing that \nbecause the Federal Government has a huge deficit. We have a huge debt. \nWe have to find ways to reduce spending. So we are all in this together \nand we have to find sensible, commonsense ways to minimize the impact \nto the public. We have to, with that approach, find savings. So find \nthe savings you can in terms of how many air traffic controllers you \ncan truly furlough and then move the dollars you have to in order to be \nsure we do not impact the traveling public.\n  Again, this is a bipartisan bill. This is a simple--straightforward \nsolution to the issue, and we need to do it. We need to do it.\n  On Monday, reports were there were 1,200 flights delayed across the \ncountry. At airports in New York, in Dallas, and in Los Angeles, some \nof those flights were up to several hours. What the FAA has indicated \nis that up to 6,700 flights a day out of the roughly 23,000-plus \nflights a day may be delayed because of these air traffic controller \nfurloughs. There is no reason for that. So I want the public to know we \nare putting forth a simple, straightforward bipartisan solution that \nstill saves the dollars we need to save but gives the simple, \nstraightforward flexibility that is necessary--both within FAA and DOT, \nif necessary--to make the adjustments, to make sure those flights are \non time for the traveling public.\n\n  I called Secretary LaHood yesterday. I said: What do you think? He \nsaid: I think that will work fine. Great. Let's work together. Let's do \nit.\n  We talked to the airlines association. We talked to the FAA \nAdministrator and said: What do you think? The air traffic controllers \nunion: What do you think? They all seemed to say: Commonsense, simple, \nstraightforward. Let's do it.\n  Let's make sure we solve problems for the American public. They need \nto know that not only are their flights safe, they need to know they \nare dependable. They need to know when they show up at the airport that \nairplane is going to leave when they expect it to leave. It is \nimportant for our families, it is important for our businesses, it is \nimportant for the economy of this country, and it is easily solved. So \nlet's do it.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Kirk):\n  S. 796. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 302 East Green Street in Champaign, Illinois, as the \n``James R. Burgess Jr. Post Office Building''; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today along with my colleague Senator Mark \nKirk, I introduced a bill to name the United States Postal Service \nfacility at 302 East Green Street in Champaign, Illinois, as the James \nR. Burgess Jr. Post Office Building.\n  I am proud to introduce this measure to honor Mr. Burgess, an \naccomplished Illinois war veteran and public servant. Mr. Burgess \nserved his country honorably in World War II and after. At age 29, he \nled one of six companies in the 761st Tank Battalion, the first \nAfrican-American armored unit to enter battle in World War II. The \n761st served under General George Patton. After the war, he remained in \nthe military, serving in Army intelligence. As part of his training, \nMr. Burgess attended both German\n\n[[Page S2963]]\n\nand Russian language school. He retired from the Army in 1962 with a \n``top secret'' clearance.\n  After his military career, Mr. Burgess moved his wife and two sons to \nChampaign where he earned a law degree from the University of Illinois. \nAfter moving to Chicago for a time, the family eventually returned to \nChampaign where Mr. Burgess worked for the Champaign County State's \nAttorney. In 1972, he was elected to the post himself. He became the \nfirst and, to this day, the only African American elected to county-\nwide office in Champaign County.\n  In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed Mr. Burgess to be United \nStates Attorney for what was then the Eastern District of Illinois. He \nheld that position until 1982. Mr. Burgess passed away in 1997.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate \nto complete the effort long-undertaken by his loving son, Steve, and \nfamily to honor this worthy Illinoisan and patriotic American.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 796\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. JAMES R. BURGESS JR. POST OFFICE BUILDING.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal \n     Service located at 302 East Green Street in Champaign, \n     Illinois, shall be known and designated as the ``James R. \n     Burgess Jr. Post Office Building''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be \n     a reference to the ``James R. Burgess Jr. Post Office \n     Building''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S. 800. A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ensure \nthat the South Texas Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Center \nat Harlingen, located in Harlingen, Texas, includes a full-service \ninpatient health care facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nto redesignate such center, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 800\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Treto Garza Far South Texas \n     Veterans Inpatient Care Act of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INPATIENT HEALTH CARE FACILITY AT DEPARTMENT OF \n                   VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL FACILITY IN HARLINGEN, \n                   TEXAS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The current and future health care needs of veterans \n     residing in Far South Texas are not being fully met by the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs.\n       (2) According to recent census data, more than 108,000 \n     veterans reside in Far South Texas.\n       (3) Travel times for veterans from the Valley Coastal Bend \n     area from their homes to the nearest Department of Veterans \n     Affairs hospital for acute inpatient health care can exceed \n     six hours.\n       (4) Even with the significant travel times, veterans from \n     Far South Texas demonstrate a high demand for health care \n     services from the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n       (5) Ongoing overseas deployments of members of the Armed \n     Forces from Texas, including members of the Armed Forces on \n     active duty, members of the Texas National Guard, and members \n     of the other reserve components of the Armed Forces, will \n     continue to increase demand for medical services provided by \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n       (6) The Department of Veterans Affairs employs an annual \n     Strategic Capital Investment Planning process to ``enable the \n     VA to continually adapt to changes in demographics, medical \n     and information technology, and health care delivery'', which \n     results in the development of a multi-year investment plan \n     that determines where gaps in services exist or are projected \n     and develops an appropriate solution to meet those gaps.\n       (7) According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, final \n     approval of the Strategic Capital Investment Planning \n     priority list serves as the ``building block'' of the annual \n     budget request for the Department.\n       (8) Arturo ``Treto'' Garza, a veteran who served in the \n     Marine Corps, rose to the rank of Sergeant, and served two \n     tours in the Vietnam War, passed away on October 3, 2012.\n       (9) Treto Garza, who was also a former co-chairman of the \n     Veterans Alliance of the Rio Grande Valley, tirelessly fought \n     to improve health care services for veterans in the Rio \n     Grande Valley, with his efforts successfully leading to the \n     creation of the South Texas VA Health Care Center at \n     Harlingen, located in Harlingen, Texas.\n       (b) Redesignation of South Texas Department of Veterans \n     Affairs Health Care Center.--\n       (1) In general.--The South Texas Department of Veterans \n     Affairs Health Care Center at Harlingen, located in \n     Harlingen, Texas, is redesignated as the ``Treto Garza South \n     Texas Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Center''.\n       (2) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     medical facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     referred to in paragraph (1) shall be deemed to be a \n     reference to the ``Treto Garza South Texas Department of \n     Veterans Affairs Health Care Center''.\n       (c) Requirement of Full-service Inpatient Facility.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     ensure that the Treto Garza South Texas Department of \n     Veterans Affairs Health Care Center includes a full-service \n     inpatient health care facility of the Department and shall \n     modify the existing facility as necessary to meet that \n     requirement.\n       (2) Plan to expand facility capabilities.--The Secretary \n     shall include in the annual Strategic Capital Investment Plan \n     of the Department a project to expand the capabilities of the \n     Treto Garza South Texas Department of Veterans Affairs Health \n     Care Center by adding the following:\n       (A) Inpatient capability for 50 beds with appropriate \n     administrative, clinical, diagnostic, and ancillary services \n     needed for support.\n       (B) An urgent care center.\n       (C) The capability to provide a full range of services to \n     meet the needs of women veterans.\n       (d) Report to Congress.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit \n     to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives a report detailing a plan to implement the \n     requirements in subsection (c), including an estimate of the \n     cost of required actions and the time necessary for the \n     completion of those actions.\n       (e) Far South Texas Defined.--In this section, the term \n     ``Far South Texas'' means the following counties in Texas: \n     Aransas, Bee, Brooks, Calhoun, Cameron, DeWitt, Dimmit, \n     Duval, Goliad, Hidalgo, Jackson, Jim Hogg, Jim Wells, Kenedy, \n     Kleberg, Nueces, Refugio, San Patricio, Starr, Victoria, \n     Webb, Willacy, Zapata.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Manchin, Mr. Harkin, and \n        Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 805. A bill to improve compliance with mine and occupational \nsafety and health laws, and empower workers to raise safety concerns, \nprevent future mine and other workplace tragedies, and establish rights \nof families of victims of workplace accidents, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss mine safety, \na critical issue to my state and the tens of thousands of miners across \nthe Nation.\n  Earlier this month we observed the third anniversary of the Upper Big \nBranch mine disaster which killed twenty nine of our Nation's miners. \nThat disaster, the most deadly in decades, shocked the country and made \nus realize that we must aggressively and continually seek to make \nmining safer and we cannot rest--because no number of deaths or \naccidents is acceptable.\n  In the past 3 years we have seen some positive steps in our Nation's \nmine safety efforts.\n  As part of the Dodd-Frank bill we required publicly-traded mining \ncompanies to report safety information to their shareholders through \ntheir public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  Congress provided additional funds, $22 million, for MSHA and the \nFederal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission to reduce the appeals \nbacklog, enforce mine safety laws and investigate the Upper Big Branch \nDisaster.\n  MSHA has also pursued increased enforcement actions through their \nimpact inspections that target violations at unsafe mines with poor \ncompliance history or specific safety concerns. As of March 2013, the \nAdministration had conducted 579 impact inspections, resulting in \n10,036 citations, 946 orders, and 43 safeguards.\n  The administration has finalized rules to improve the broken \n``Pattern\n\n[[Page S2964]]\n\nof Violations'' process to better pursue repeat offenders.\n  While we have had these improvements we also know that 97 miners have \ndied on the job since this tragedy. That is 97 new grieving families. \nThat is unacceptable to me, and I think to most people.\n  So it is clear that we must do more.\n  That is why today I am reintroducing my comprehensive mine safety \nlegislation the Robert C. Byrd Mine and Workplace Safety and Health Act \nof 2013. We do incredibly important things in this bill including.\n  We give MSHA expanded authority to subpoena documents and testimony. \nCurrently, MSHA does not have the authority to subpoena documents or \ntestimony from operators outside the context of a formal, public \nhearing. MSHA should have this authority in the context of \ninvestigations and inspections as well as public hearings.\n  We provide for an independent investigation of the most serious \naccidents. The bill creates an independent panel, comprised of a team \nof independent experts, to investigate the actions of both the operator \nand MSHA for serious accidents, including any accident involving three \nor more deaths.\n  We strengthen whistleblower protections for miners who speak out \nabout unsafe conditions. This bill will require one hour annually of \n``miner's rights training'' to inform workers of the law's protections, \ngive miners an express right to refuse unsafe work, expand the time \nlimit for filing a complaint about retaliation from 60 to 180 days, and \nauthorize punitive damages and criminal penalties for retaliation \nagainst workers who raise safety concerns.\n  We increase maximum penalties. Currently, criminal violations of mine \nsafety laws are a misdemeanor for a first offense. To provide a strong \ndeterrent for such serious misconduct, the penalties for knowing \nviolations of safety standards will be raised to the felony level, \nincluding providing felony penalties for miners, operators, and \ngovernment officials who knowingly provide advance notice of \ninspections.\n  We also increase civil penalties for making unsafe ventilation \nchanges and violating mandatory health or safety standards for rock \ndusting or failing to keep the records required. These are areas of \nparticular concern that were highlighted by investigations conducted by \nthe Mine Safety and Health Administration, the United Mine Workers of \nAmerica, and the Governor's Independent Investigation.\n  We limit Miners' Exposure to Black Lung Disease. This debilitating \ndisease is on the rise among a new generation of coal miners. \nSpecifically, the provision would require that MSHA issue a rule within \n6 months, a rule that is long overdue, to lower exposure levels to \nrespirable dust which would provide the maximum feasible protection \nthat is achievable through environmental controls. It would also \nrequire that MSHA reexamine the incidence of black lung disease every 5 \nyears and, unless there is a decline in black lung, update the \nregulations again. More than 70 percent of the victims tested at Upper \nBig Branch were determined to have signs of black lung disease.\n  We improve Federal and State Coordination to Combat Safety \nViolations. The Governor's Independent Investigation Panel recommended \nthat Federal and State agencies immediately work together to address \nsafety problems at mines right after they are found out, and this \nprovision would strongly encourage such actions.\n  I want to be very clear that I will not give up on fighting for the \nsafety and health of our Nation's miners. Health and safety are issues \nthat people shouldn't have to compromise on. I will continue this fight \nfor West Virginia's miners and it is my hope that more of my colleagues \nwill join me in these efforts.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I strongly support the Robert C. Byrd Mine \nand Workplace Safety Act. This bill brings the Nation's mine health and \nsafety laws up to date, gives mine safety officials the ability to \neffectively investigate and shut down habitually dangerous mines, and \nholds mine operators accountable for putting their workers in \nunnecessary danger.\n  It has been over 3 years since April 5, 2010, when a massive \nexplosion ripped through Massey Energy's Upper Big Branch Mine in West \nVirginia, tragically killing 29 miners. As the son of a coal miner, I \ncontinue to feel these losses very deeply, on a very personal level. My \nheart goes out to the family and coworkers of every worker who is \nkilled or injured on the job. Too many of these tragedies are \npreventable, and we should not rest until the day comes when no hard-\nworking American has to sacrifice his or her life for a paycheck.\n  The Upper Big Branch catastrophe spurred numerous investigations, and \nthe resulting reports have yielded insight into specific ways that the \ngovernment can act to improve the health and safety of our Nation's \nminers. Under the leadership of Joe Main, the Mine and Safety Health \nAdministration has already taken many such important steps. One of \ntheir bold new safety initiatives that flowed from the Upper Big Branch \nexplosion was to overhaul the ``pattern of violations'' process, which \ntargets the worst actors in the mining industry. The pattern of \nviolations regulation addresses a root cause of the Upper Big Branch \ndisaster by strengthening worker protections at mines where operators \nare repeatedly and flagrantly disregarding safety rules. It is a \nsubstantial step forward that will help address the problems at our \nmost dangerous mines before disaster strikes. And MSHA has made similar \nprogress on other recommendations stemming from the Upper Big Branch \ndisaster. Indeed, according to a March 31, 2013, report from the Labor \nDepartment's Office of Inspector General, MSHA has already implemented \nor is on track to timely address all of the 100 recommendations with \ndeadlines from the investigative teams that studied the Upper Big \nBranch explosion.\n  I applaud these efforts wholeheartedly, and I am pleased to mark our \nNation's progress in mine safety reform. On-the-job deaths of miners \nreached a record low in 2012 of 35. But 35 deaths means 35 brothers, \nsons, uncles, and fathers were stolen away from their families last \nyear--a number that is still far too high. Catastrophes like the Upper \nBig Branch explosion make it clear that our work here is unfinished.\n  To prevent yet another disaster and more unnecessary deaths, Congress \nmust do its part. It is time for the Senate to take action and ensure \nthat a disaster like the Upper Big Branch explosion will never happen \nagain. We need to strengthen the oversight system for the most \ndangerous mines, fortify penalties for operators who willfully put \nminers at risk, and make sure miners are protected if they raise safety \nconcerns. And that is why I strongly support the Robert C. Byrd Mine \nand Workplace Safety Act of 2013. This bill is an important step in \nmaking good on an obligation we have to health and safety of our \ncourageous miners and their families.\n  This bill stands for some fundamental principles I believe are shared \nby all Americans.\n  We believe that every American deserves to go to work without fearing \nfor his or her life.\n  We believe that responsible businesses that put safety first \nshouldn't have to compete with businesses that prioritize a quick buck \nover the safety of their employees.\n  We believe that employers who put workers' lives at risk should face \nserious consequences that will force them to change their ways.\n  We believe that companies shouldn't be able to hide behind high \npriced lawyers and convoluted corporate structures to avoid being held \naccountable for their actions.\n  We believe that the critical agencies charged with protecting \nworkers' lives should have all the tools they need to get the job done.\n  We believe that whistleblowers are the first line of defense in safe \nworkplaces and deserve strong protection from discrimination and \nretaliation.\n  The Robert C. Byrd Mine and Workplace Safety Act of 2013 reflects \nthese core principles and includes effective policies to achieve them. \nIts passage would be a major step forward for workplace safety.\n  This legislation also makes common sense reforms to the Occupational \nSafety and Health Act, OSHA, which has not been significantly updated \nsince it was passed over 40 years ago. For example, whistleblower \nprotections under the OSH Act are toothless and unfairly tilted against \nworkers\n\n[[Page S2965]]\n\nwho risk their career to protect the public welfare. This bill makes \nessential changes to ensure that workers are protected, including \nlengthening OSHA's 30-day statute of limitation for whistleblowers, \nproviding for reinstatement while the legal process unfolds for cases \nwith an initial finding of merit and giving the worker the right to \nfile their own claim in court if the government does not investigate \nthe claim in a timely manner.\n  The bill also strengthens criminal and civil penalties that, at \npresent, are too weak to protect workers. Under current law, an \nemployer may be charged--at most--with a misdemeanor when a willful \nviolation of OSHA leads to a worker's death. Under the Robert C. Byrd \nMine and Workplace Safety Act of 2013, felony charges are available for \nan employer's repeated and willful violations of OSHA that result in a \nworker's death or serious injury. The bill also updates OSHA civil \npenalties--which have been unchanged since 1990--and sets a minimum \npenalty of $50,000 for a worker's death caused by a willful violation.\n  In addition to toughening sanctions for employers who needlessly \nexpose their employees to risk, the bill makes sure that the government \nis responsive to workers when investigating charges. It guarantees \nvictims the right to meet with the person investigating the claim, to \nbe notified of and receive copies of reports or citations issued in the \ninvestigation, and to be notified of and have the right to appear at \nproceedings related to their case. Victims of retaliation should not \nsuffer the double indignity of being ignored by government officials \ncharged with protecting them.\n  I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support the \nRobert C. Byrd Mine and Workplace Safety Act of 2013. This important \nbill would take a tremendous step forward for mine safety and could \nultimately save the lives of thousands of hard-working Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/24/senate-section/article/S2965-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 109--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n UNITED STATES SHOULD LEAVE NO MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES UNACCOUNTED \n            FOR DURING THE DRAWDOWN OF FORCES IN AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY (for himself, Mr. Casey, and Mr. McConnell) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Armed \nServices:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 15\n\n       Whereas the Social Security program was established more \n     than 77 years before the date of agreement to this resolution \n     and has provided economic security to generations of \n     Americans through benefits earned based on contributions made \n     over the lifetime of the worker;\n       Whereas the Social Security program continues to provide \n     modest benefits, averaging approximately $1,156 per month, to \n     more than 57,000,000 individuals, including 37,000,000 \n     retired workers in March 2013;\n       Whereas the Social Security program has no borrowing \n     authority, has accumulated assets of $2,700,000,000,000, and, \n     therefore, does not contribute to the Federal budget deficit;\n       Whereas the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and \n     Survivors Insurance Trust Fund projects that the Trust Fund \n     can pay full benefits through 2032;\n       Whereas the Social Security program is designed to ensure \n     that benefits keep pace with inflation through cost-of-living \n     adjustments (referred to in this preamble as ``COLAs'') that \n     are based upon the measured changes in prices of goods and \n     services purchased by consumers that is currently published \n     by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as the Consumer Price Index \n     for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W);\n       Whereas the Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a \n     supplemental measure of inflation, the Chained Consumer Price \n     Index for all Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U), or ``Chained CPI'', \n     which adjusts for projected changes in consumer behavior \n     resulting from price fluctuations known as the ``substitution \n     effect'';\n       Whereas the substitution effect occurs when consumers buy \n     more goods and services with prices that are rising slower \n     than average and fewer goods and services with prices that \n     are rising faster than average;\n       Whereas studies indicate that typical Social Security \n     beneficiaries spend a significantly higher percentage of \n     their budget than other consumers on health care, health care \n     prices have increased at higher than average rates, and \n     consumers, including seniors, may not be able to substitute \n     health care easily;\n       Whereas the current COLAs, based on the CPI-W, fail to \n     reflect that Social Security beneficiaries spend more of \n     their income proportionally on expenses such as health care \n     as compared to a regular wage earner, and therefore \n     underestimate increases in the cost of living of Social \n     Security beneficiaries;\n       Whereas the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that \n     using the Chained CPI to calculate Social Security COLAs \n     would reduce Social Security benefits by 0.25 percent per \n     year, resulting in a reduction in outlays of $127,000,000,000 \n     over the first decade;\n       Whereas reductions in Social Security benefits from using \n     the Chained CPI to calculate Social Security COLAs would \n     continue to compound over time, and the AARP Public Policy \n     Institute estimates that the reductions would grow to 3 \n     percent after 10 years and 8.5 percent after 30 years;\n       Whereas Social Security Works estimates that using the \n     Chained CPI to calculate Social Security COLAs would reduce \n     annual Social Security benefits of the average earner by $658 \n     at age 75, $1,147 at age 85, and $1,622 at age 95;\n       Whereas reductions in Social Security benefits would harm \n     some of the most vulnerable populations in the United States;\n       Whereas adopting the Chained CPI would cause tax brackets \n     and the standard deduction to rise more slowly, \n     disproportionately raising the tax burden on low- and middle-\n     income taxpayers;\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today along with my \ncolleague from Vermont to introduce a concurrent resolution expressing \nthe sense of Congress that the so-called chained CPI should not be used \nfor the purpose of calculating Social Security benefits or benefits for \ndisabled veterans.\n  As we work to reduce the deficit in a balanced and responsible \nmanner, many have discussed changing the measure of inflation used to \ncalculate the cost-of-living allowances to a measure of inflation \ncalled the chained CPI.\n  Now, some claim that the chained CPI is a more accurate measure of \ninflation because it takes into account the fact that consumers may \nchange their spending behavior and substitute items with lower priced \nincreases for items with higher priced increases. As a result of this \nfeature, the chained CPI results in a lower measure of inflation.\n  All of this may seem very technical, but the impact of requiring \nSocial Security or veterans disability COLAS--cost-of-living \nadjustments--to be based on the chained CPI is anything but technical. \nIt will have real and negative impacts on our seniors and those who \nbecome disabled as a result of service in the Armed Forces. In fact, \nthe most adversely impacted would be the oldest and the poorest. I do \nnot think anything could be more unfair or inappropriate or \nunnecessary.\n  As this first chart shows, the chained CPI is a real cut in Social \nSecurity benefits. According to Social Security Works, this policy \nwould reduce annual Social Security benefits for the average worker at \nage 75 by $658 a year, by age 85 by $1,147 a year, and by age 95 by \n$1,622 a year. Over on this side of the chart we see the cumulative \ncut; in other words, what would happen over the years. From age 65 to \n75 people would lose about $4,600, by age 85 they would lose $13,900, \nand by age 95 they would lose $28,000.\n  I think a couple things this chart shows is that people are penalized \nfor living longer--the longer they live, the more they are penalized.\n  Now, one might say: Well, $658 a year by the time you are age 75, \nthat does not sound like a lot. Yes, not to some of us, not to us with \nour incomes. Look at the kind of retirement programs we have. If you \nare in the upper quintile, of course, that does not seem like much. \nBut, again, if we look at a second chart I have, we will see who really \nkind of gets hurt, and it is the poorer you are.\n  Let's put it this way: Let's say you are 65, and your total income is \nless than $12,554 a year. That puts you below the poverty line. The \ntotal amount of your income that comes from Social Security is 84.3 \npercent. Well, you might think, if you are making less than that, \nwouldn't all your money come from Social Security? Well, the answer is \nyes, but--and I question people about this--if you are making that \nlittle amount of money, and you are over 65, you are probably working \nat some part-time job. Maybe you are baby-sitting, maybe you are \ncleaning houses, maybe you are a greeter at a store. You are probably \ndoing something to add to your income, but it would only amount to \nabout 16 percent. Most of it comes from Social Security.\n  We can see from this chart, even after you get up to $20,000 a year, \nit is about the same. About 84 percent of your money comes from Social \nSecurity. So if you take a cut in Social Security, and you are lower \nincome, that is where you get whacked the most.\n  Of course, when you get up here to the fifth quintile, you are making \nmore than $57,957 a year. Only 17 percent of your income comes from \nSocial Security. So you say, well, if you took $600-some a year from \nthat, yes, you can probably afford it. But even if you look at up to \n$57,000 a year in the fourth quintile, almost half--43.5 percent--of \nyour total income comes from Social Security. So even if you are making \n$30,000, $35,000 a year, after age 65 half of your income comes from \nSocial Security.\n  So, again, when you start making these kinds of cuts in the chained \nCPI, you might say: Well, it is only $658 a year. For someone in the \nlower quintiles, that is like a month's worth of food, perhaps 6 weeks' \nworth of food. Tell me that does not have an effect. Of course it has \nan effect.\n  If you are in the upper income, you probably do not have that much to \nworry about. That is why the pernicious effect of chained CPI is that \nthe longer you live, the more you are penalized; and the lower your \nincome, the bigger whack you are taking out of your total income. So, \nagain, as people get older, they are more likely to have depleted all \ntheir sources of retirement income, assuming they have any to begin \nwith.\n  So a couple of facts I think are pertinent: First, today only one in \nfive Americans has a defined benefit pension that will last until the \nday they die--one in five. When I first came to Congress it was one in \ntwo. One out of every two Americans had a defined\n\n[[Page S2968]]\n\nbenefit pension that would last them until the day they died. Now it is \none in five, and it is getting less all the time.\n  Second--and this startles a lot of people--50 percent of the American \npopulace have less than $10,000 in savings--less than $10,000. One out \nof every two Americans has less than $10,000 in savings. Well, you can \nsee, if you have that when you retire, that is going to be gone pretty \nsoon, so then you are going to rely, again, strictly on Social \nSecurity.\n  So when you put those two facts together--four out of five have no \npension, and half have less than $10,000 in savings--then you see that \nsoon after you retire, the only thing you have left is Social Security.\n  So it is already hard enough now for millions of people hoping to \nretire, but then you put chained CPI in there, and you really are \nhitting the oldest and the poorest.\n  So, again, I know people are saying: Well, we have to do something to \nsave Social Security for those in the future. Well, I agree with that. \nThat is why whenever I see an honest assessment of Social Security for \nthe future, an honest assessment that says Social Security cannot \ncontinue to exist as it is, well, I agree with that--as it is. But then \nthere are two approaches. Do you whack the benefits or do you increase \nthe revenues that come into Social Security?\n  Two different approaches. You do not have to cut the benefits. In \nfact, I would say that by talking about chained CPI, the signal you are \nsending to the younger generation is: Well, maybe when you get there we \nwill whack it some more.\n  A lot of young people are saying, I do not know if Social Security is \ngoing to be there for me when I get that age. When they hear people \ntalking about chained CPI and cutting this, they are right to be \nworried whether we are going to keep our promise to this next \ngeneration that we will have a Social Security system they can rely on \nand count on.\n  So what is to be done? Well, last year I introduced legislation that \nwould basically extend the life of the Social Security trust fund to \n2050 and give a $65-a-month increase to every Social Security \nrecipient, and yet extend the life of it for over 18 more years.\n  How do we do that? Very simply. We raise the wage cap for people who \npay into Social Security from $113,000 a year, which it is now. Over 10 \nyears we raise it and do away with it after 10 years.\n  There is another approach too. The National Academy of Social \nInsurance, NASI, did a poll earlier this year. They asked: Would you be \nwilling to go from 6.2 percent paying into Social Security to 7.2 \npercent, a 1-percent increase over 20 years, if that would help secure \nSocial Security? Seventy percent of Republicans and Democrats said yes. \nOver 20 years, a 1-percent increase, that is nothing.\n  But if you were to take that and raise the wage cap, you could \nincrease Social Security payments by $65 a month and secure Social \nSecurity for up to 75 years. It seems to me if you want to send a \nmessage to the young people about the sanctity and stability of Social \nSecurity, you would say that rather than we are going to cut, we are \ngoing to have this so-called chained CPI.\n  As I said, I know it sounds technical. But it is not technical at \nall. I once likened chained CPI to an anchor chain. If you are standing \non the boat and the anchor chain gets around your ankle and someone \nthrows the anchor overboard, where are you going? You are going down. \nThat is what chained CPI does. The older you get, the more you get hit \non. The poorer you are, the more you get hit.\n  So, again, this idea that we have got to somehow cut benefits, have \nthis chained CPI in order to save Social Security is wrong. It is \nwrong. There are other ways of doing it that would be widely, broadly \nsupported by the American people. Go out and ask any group, ask any \ngroup of seniors, do you think we ought to raise the wage cap so \nsomeone who is making $500,000 a year pays in at the same rate as \nsomeone who is making $50,000 a year? Well, of course. That is not the \ncase now. You make $50,000 a year, you pay into Social Security on \nevery dime you make. If you make $500,000 a year, you are only paying \nin on the first about 20 cents of every dollar you make. After that you \ndo not pay into Social Security.\n  I think the average American would say, that is not fair. What is \ngood for someone making $100,000 a year ought to be the same for \nsomeone making $1 million a year. So there are other ways of securing \nSocial Security. This chained CPI sends the wrong message to young \npeople. It exacerbates the concern young people have, is Social \nSecurity going to be there when I retire?\n  I always tell them: Do you believe the U.S. Government will exist \nwhen you retire? They say: Well, yes. I say: If that is the case, \nSocial Security will be there, because it is backed by the full faith \nand credit of the U.S. Government.\n  What are we supposed to do? Are we supposed to cut that full faith \nand credit, and tell the young people, it will be there but we may take \ncuts here and there may be cuts there? What is a young person to think? \nAm I going to have what I think I am going to be able to have and count \non Social Security?\n  This is a trust. My friend from Vermont is always talking about this \nis a trust fund. It is a trust. It does not add to the deficit. Think \nabout the word trust. Social Security trust fund. You have got to be \nable to trust it. Young people need to be able to trust it, that it \nwill be there for them. The best way to undermine that is to go to this \nchained CPI.\n  With that, I yield to my good friend who knows this issue better than \njust about anybody I know and who has fought so hard on behalf of \nSocial Security and keeping that trust fund and keeping the trust in \nSocial Security.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Sanders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I want to thank my colleague Senator Harkin not only for \nhis fight for seniors and disabled vets on this issue but for his long \ncareer in fighting for those people who often do not have a voice here \nin Washington. The time has come for the Senate to send a very loud and \nclear message to the American people. It is the message Senator Harkin \nhas just articulated, that is, we are not going to balance the budget \non the backs of the elderly, on the backs of disabled veterans, on the \nbacks of those people who are already, in the midst of this terrible \nrecession, hurting so much.\n  As chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, let me make it \nvery clear that I will do everything I can to make sure we are not \nbalancing the budget on the backs of disabled veterans, men and women \nwho have lost their arms, their legs, and their eyesight defending this \ncountry. That is morally unacceptable.\n  The chained CPI--and this is an important point to make. Sometimes \nyou hear the crescendo inside the beltway, and all of the lobbyists \ntalking: This is the right way to go. But as Senator Harkin mentioned, \ngo across America, from Iowa to Vermont, California to Maine, the \nAmerican people are saying in poll after poll: No, do not cut Social \nSecurity. Do not cut benefits for disabled vets.\n  The organizations that represent tens of millions of people are \nsaying the same thing. The American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign \nWars, the Disabled American Veterans, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans \nof America, the Gold Star Wives, the Disabled American Veterans, they \nare on record--and I have submitted their testimony into the \nCongressional Record--they are in opposition to this chained CPI.\n  But it is not just veterans organizations. The chained CPI is opposed \nby every major senior citizens group in this country--the AARP, the \nNational Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, the \nAlliance of Retired Americans, and other groups. The chained CPI is \nopposed by every major trade union in America, including the AFL-CIO. \nThe chained CPI is opposed by every major disability group in the \ncountry. It is opposed by the National Organization for Women because \nthey understand that cutting Social Security impacts women more than it \ndoes men.\n  Maybe once in a while the Senate might want to listen to ordinary \nAmericans, people who do not have well-paid lobbyists, people who do \nnot own the local newspapers, and do what is right for the American \npeople. There are\n\n[[Page S2969]]\n\nsome who believe that lowering cost-of-living adjustments, COLAs, \nthrough the adoption of a so-called chained CPI would be a minor tweak \nin benefits, hardly worth discussing.\n  But let's be clear. For millions of disabled veterans and seniors \nliving on fixed incomes, the chained CPI is not a minor tweak. It is a \nsignificant benefit cut that will make it harder for permanently \ndisabled veterans and the elderly to feed their families, heat their \nhomes, pay for their prescription drugs, and make ends meet. This \nmisguided proposal must be vigorously opposed.\n  What I find truly disturbing is that folks such as Treasury Secretary \nJack Lew and my Republican colleagues who refer to the chained CPI as \n``a more accurate measure of inflation.'' That is their argument.\n  Senator Harkin, when I speak to seniors in Vermont and I tell them \nthere are some people in Washington who think the current COLAs are too \ngenerous, do you know what invariably happens? They start laughing. \nThey should laugh. Two out of the last 4 years they got zero. I think \nthe last COLA was 1.7 percent. There are some in Washington who think \nthat is too generous.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement \nfrom 250 Ph.D. economists and 50 social insurance experts who wrote:\n\n       No empirical basis for reducing the Social Security COLA.\n\n  No empirical basis.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nEconomist and Social Insurance Expert Statement on Social Security COLA\n\n\n        No empirical basis for reducing the Social Security COLA\n\n       November 20, 2012--250 Ph.D. economists and more than 50 \n     social insurance experts with doctorates in related fields \n     oppose proposals to reduce the Social Security cost-of-living \n     adjustment by tying it to an index (the chained CPI-U) that \n     does not reflect the spending patterns of beneficiaries.\n       As economists and social insurance experts, we agree that \n     the annual Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) \n     should be based on the most accurate measure possible of the \n     impact of inflation on beneficiaries. For this reason, we \n     oppose proposals to reduce the Social Security COLA by tying \n     it to a chained consumer price index that does not directly \n     measure the actual expenditures of beneficiaries. Such a move \n     would lower the COLA by an estimated 0.3 percentage points \n     per year, translating into a 3 percent benefit cut after 10 \n     years and a 6 percent cut after 20 years. The oldest \n     beneficiaries, who are often the poorest beneficiaries, and \n     persons receiving disability benefits for more than 20 years \n     would see even larger cuts over time.\n       Arguments in favor of reducing the COLA are premised on the \n     assumption that the current COLA overcorrects for inflation. \n     However, it is just as likely that the current COLA fails to \n     keep up with rising costs confronting elderly and disabled \n     beneficiaries. For historical reasons, the current COLA is \n     based on a consumer price index for workers, excluding \n     retirees and other Social Security recipients who are not in \n     the labor force. It and other indices based on the spending \n     patterns of workers or the general population likely \n     understate the impact of cost increases faced by Social \n     Security beneficiaries because seniors and disabled people \n     spend a greater share of their incomes on out-of-pocket \n     medical expenses than do other consumers, and health costs \n     have risen faster than overall inflation in recent decades.\n       A chained price index is supposed to more fully reflect the \n     ability of consumers to substitute cheaper goods and services \n     in response to price changes. Whether or not such \n     substitution preserves consumers' standards of living, \n     different consumers have varying ability to make such \n     adjustments. Since elderly and disabled people spend a \n     greater share of their incomes on necessities such as health \n     care, rent, and utilities, and since this population is also \n     less mobile, a chained COLA based on the spending patterns of \n     workers or the general population may overestimate the \n     ability of Social Security beneficiaries to take advantage of \n     cheaper substitutes.\n       The actual spending patterns of Social Security \n     beneficiaries have not been comprehensively studied. However, \n     an experimental index computed by the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics suggests that the current COLA may not keep up \n     with seniors' costs of living. Until direct evidence is \n     gathered, there is no empirical basis for reducing the Social \n     Security COLA, which could exacerbate, rather than correct, \n     an existing problem.\n\n  MR. SANDERS. This is what these 250 economists write:\n  As economists and social insurance experts, we agree that the annual \nSocial Security cost of living adjustment should be based on the most \naccurate measure possible of the impact of inflation on beneficiaries. \nFor this reason, we oppose proposals to reduce the Social Security COLA \nby tying it to a chained consumer price index. Arguments in favor of \nreducing the COLA are premised on the assumption that current COLA \novercorrects for inflation. However, it is just as likely that the \ncurrent COLA fails to keep up with rising costs confronting elderly and \ndisabled beneficiaries.\n  The reason for that is pretty clear. If you are a senior citizen or \ndisabled vet, the likelihood is you are not buying iPads or flat-screen \nTVs or other types of things such as that. What are you buying? You are \nbuying health care, you are buying prescription drugs, you are trying \nto heat your home. For seniors' purchasing habits, in many ways \ninflation has been higher, not lower, than general inflation. Senator \nHarkin made reference to this.\n  Let's be very clear. There are millions and millions of seniors who \nare economically struggling, struggling to keep their heads above water \nto buy the prescription drugs they need, to pay for the health care \ncosts they need, to keep their homes warm in States such as Vermont or \nIowa in the winter.\n  Nearly one-quarter of seniors depend on Social Security benefits for \n100 percent of their income. Two-thirds depend on Social Security for a \nmajority of their income. We are talking, and I hear from the White \nHouse and elsewhere, they are going to protect the poorest of the poor. \nWell, to my mind, when someone in Vermont is trying to get by on \n$15,000 a year, that person needs protection. Anyone who thinks that is \na lot of money clearly does not have any sense of what is going on in \nthe real world.\n  According to the Social Security Administration, under the \nadministration's chained CPI proposal, average 65-year-old retirees \nwould lose $658 a year in Social Security benefits by their 75th \nbirthday, a cumulative loss of over $4,500. Once again, I understand \nthat people here go for lunch, take a few friends out, you can spend \n$600. But for senior citizens struggling on $14,000 or $15,000 a year, \n$658 dollars is a lot of money and means the loss, if you do not have \nthat money, of a very basic need.\n  For veterans, if we go in the route of the chained CPI, disability \nbenefits for veterans at age 30, they would have their benefits reduced \nby $1,425 a year; at age 45, $2,300 a year; at age 55, $3,200 a year; \nat age 65, benefits for surviving spouses, the wives who lost their \nhusbands in Iraq and Afghanistan, and their kids would also be cut.\n  I think as a Senate, as a Congress, we should take a deep, deep \nbreath, if we think we should be balancing the budget on those people \nwho have already given so much to this country.\n  Let me conclude by again making the point Senator Harkin so ably \nmade. Many of us want to make sure Social Security is strong not just \nfor the next 20 years in which it can pay out all benefits but for the \nnext 75 years. The way to do that is not to cut benefits; the way to do \nthat is exactly as Senator Harkin and I and many other people have \nsuggested--that is, understanding that there is something absurd when \nsomebody who makes $5 million a year contributes the same exact amount \nof money into the Social Security trust fund as somebody who makes \n$113,000 a year.\n  There are different ways to approach that issue, but by lifting the \ncap--and do it one way or the other--we can make Social Security \nsolvent for the next 75 years for our kids and for our grandchildren.\n  The last point--and Senator Harkin has been a leader on this issue--\npointing out about how many Americans have lost their pensions. We are \nprobably in worse shape than at any time in modern history for the \naverage person to go into retirement. Social Security is and has been \nthe pillar for those people. They have lost their pensions, and their \n401(k)s have also been troubled. Social Security has been there for the \nlast 75-plus years in good times and bad times. It paid out every \nnickel owed to every eligible American.\n  People are nervous about their retirements. Let's stand united and \nsay we are not going to cut Social Security benefits for seniors or \ndisabled vets. There are other ways to go forward and make sure Social \nSecurity is strong for the next 75 years.\n\n[[Page S2970]]\n\n  I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  First of all, I thank my colleague from Vermont for being a strong \nvoice on this issue and on so many issues that affect the elderly and \nespecially our veterans. The Senator is the chair of that committee.\n  I am always curious as to why it is that so many of the dark suits \nhere in Washington are always after Social Security. I don't say there \nis some ill spirit there, although I will say I think the Senator might \nagree that there are some who would like to privatize Social Security. \nWe know that. They have said that in the past--or partially privatize \nit.\n  It seems to me that so many people who get involved in this think it \nis just a little nick.\n  I saw a cartoon of a barber cutting somebody's hair. They had this \nhuge ball of hair, and they were snipping just a couple of little hairs \noff and saying: That is all we are doing with chained CPI.\n  They think it is such a small thing. It always occurred to me that \nthose people making the decisions, the dark suits, those are all people \nwho probably have good pensions, good retirement systems. They are \nnever going to want for anything. Yet somehow they just think, well, \n$658 bucks--that is not a big deal, up to 75. But, as the Senator \npointed out, $658 in 1 year to someone whose income is $15,000--that \ncould be a month's worth of food, 6 weeks' worth of food.\n  Mr. SANDERS. That is right.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is a big whack. I would ask the Senator, again, if \nhe has any thoughts----\n  Mr. SANDERS. I do.\n  Mr. HARKIN. On why is it that we can't listen to people and come up \nwith another approach on this rather than this chained CPI?\n  Mr. SANDERS. That is a very important question, and let me answer it \nin several ways. First thought: let's be clear, we have some colleagues \nin the House and Senate who believe not just that you should privatize \nSocial Security, not just that you should cut Social Security, they \nbelieve the concept of government assistance in terms of retirement or \ngovernment programs in terms of health care, they believe they are \nunconstitutional. They don't believe the government should be there. If \nyou are elderly and you have no health care, sorry, you are on your \nown. That is No. 1.\n  There is a philosophical belief on the part of some that what \ngovernment does should be very limited and that we should not be there \nto make sure that when the elderly people reach retirement age, they \nhave security.\n  The second point is about the consistently--and this has gone on for \nyears--the long-term opposition to Social Security. Does the Senator \nknow what it is about? It is because Social Security has worked so \nwell. If you hold the belief that the government is terrible, the \ngovernment is awful, and the government can't do anything, and if there \nis a program that for 77 years has paid every nickel owed to every \neligible American, has very modest administrative costs, and is very \npopular among the American people, and you don't believe in government, \nthat is a bad thing. They have to start cutting it and doing away with \nit.\n  The third point I would make--again, no secret here--is that we have \na significant deficit, and we have choices to make as to how we deal \nwith the deficit.\n  When we lose $100 billion every single year because corporations \nstash their money in the Cayman Islands and in other tax havens, maybe \nwe might want to ask them to start paying their fair share of taxes \nrather than cutting Social Security. But we have colleagues who are \nmuch more interested in the well-being and the profits of large \ncorporations than they are in the needs of seniors.\n  Those are some of my answers.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have a couple of thoughts. I would say to my friend \nfrom Vermont, to those who say it is unconstitutional to do those \nthings, I wonder if they ever read the preamble to the Constitution, \nwhich is, by the way, part of the Constitution of the United States?\n\n       We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more \n     perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic \n     Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the \n     general Welfare.\n\n  That is part of the Constitution of the United States.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Of course.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How we do that obviously can vary from time to time, \ngeneration to generation, but the idea that we are here to promote the \ngeneral welfare as a Federal Government is clearly in the Constitution \nof the United States.\n  Secondly, the Senator pointed out the idea that Social Security--that \nthis is really a trust fund. People pay into it, and they take out. \nNow, it has had its problems.\n  But I ask the Senator, if unemployment today were down to less than 5 \npercent--say, 4 percent--what would the Social Security trust fund look \nlike?\n  Mr. SANDERS. It would be much larger than it is right now because \nmore people would be paying into it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So the 2033 date--if we make no changes, they say Social \nSecurity will pay 100 percent out up until 2033. But if, in fact, we \nreduce unemployment to less than 5 percent, the Trust Fund will be able \nto pay full benefits for a longer period of time.\n  Mr. SANDERS. That is right. I think the point has to be made--and I \nsee Senator Durbin on the floor as well, and he has made this point--\nthat we can argue about how we go forward on Social Security, but we \nshould be clear: Social Security hasn't contributed a nickel to the \ndeficit because it is funded by the independent payroll tax.\n  So it is a reasonable question as to how we make Social Security \nsolvent for 75 years rather than just the next 20 years. That is a good \ndebate. The Senator and I have similar ideas on how we should tackle \nthat issue. But it should not be considered as part of the deficit \nreduction effort. And it disturbs me very much because the \nadministration has acknowledged that reality and we have heard them \nover the years say: Yes, we want to deal with Social Security but not \npart of deficit reduction. It bothers me that they have now injected \nSocial Security into the deficit reduction debate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There is one last thing I would say. The Senator \nmentioned that we have a deficit. We do. We have to address it. We all \nagree with that. The Senator pointed out that the offshore haven \nbusinesses are not paying their fair share of taxes.\n  I would like to ask Senator Sanders one other question. Isn't it a \nfact--well, the estimates vary; $1 trillion is not stretching the \ntruth--to say that the war in Iraq cost us somewhere close to $1 \ntrillion?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I would say that most estimates suggest that. If you \nlook at both Iraq and Afghanistan, it may be three times that number.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't know, but I have seen estimates up to $1 trillion \nfor Iraq only. That was all borrowed money, so that has to be paid \nback.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So are we going to make the elderly, the poor, the \nstudents, and the veterans pay for that?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I would say the Senator makes a very good point. And I \noften point out to my Republican friends that I think you are looking \nat yourself and me as some of the major deficit hawks.\n  Our friends today who want to cut Social Security in the name of \ndeficit reduction apparently didn't have a problem with the deficit \nwhen they went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan without paying for those \nwars and when they gave huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in \nthis country without offsetting those tax breaks.\n  The Senator's point is very well taken.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/24/senate-section/article/S2970-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2970-S2971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 741.

Mr. REID (for Mr. Enzi (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \nAlexander, and Ms. Heitkamp)) proposed an amendment to the bill S. 743, \nto restore States' sovereign rights to enforce State and local sales \nand use tax laws, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 2, line 10, strike ``if the Streamlined'' \n     and all that follows through page 11, line 5, and insert the \n     following:\n     if any changes to the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement \n     made after the date of the enactment of this Act are not in \n     conflict with the minimum simplification requirements in \n     subsection (b)(2). A State may exercise authority under this \n     Act beginning 180 days after the State publishes notice of \n     the State's intent to exercise the authority under this Act, \n     but no earlier than the first day of the calendar quarter \n     that is at least 180 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (b) Alternative.--A State that is not a Member State under \n     the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement is authorized \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law to require all \n     sellers not qualifying for the small seller exception \n     described in subsection (c) to collect and remit sales and \n     use taxes with respect to remote sales sourced to that State, \n     but only if the State adopts and implements the minimum \n     simplification requirements in paragraph (2). Such authority \n     shall commence beginning no earlier than the first day of the \n     calendar quarter that is at least 6 months after the date \n     that the State--\n       (1) enacts legislation to exercise the authority granted by \n     this Act--\n       (A) specifying the tax or taxes to which such authority and \n     the minimum simplification requirements in paragraph (2) \n     shall apply; and\n       (B) specifying the products and services otherwise subject \n     to the tax or taxes identified by the State under \n     subparagraph (A) to which the authority of this Act shall not \n     apply; and\n       (2) implements each of the following minimum simplification \n     requirements:\n       (A) Provide--\n       (i) a single entity within the State responsible for all \n     State and local sales and use tax administration, return \n     processing, and audits for remote sales sourced to the State;\n       (ii) a single audit of a remote seller for all State and \n     local taxing jurisdictions within that State; and\n       (iii) a single sales and use tax return to be used by \n     remote sellers to be filed with the single entity responsible \n     for tax administration.\n     A State may not require a remote seller to file sales and use \n     tax returns any more frequently than returns are required for \n     nonremote sellers or impose requirements on remote sellers \n     that the State does not impose on nonremote sellers with \n     respect to the collection of sales and use taxes under this \n     Act. No local jurisdiction may require a remote seller to \n     submit a sales and use tax return or to collect sales and use \n     taxes other than as provided by this paragraph.\n       (B) Provide a uniform sales and use tax base among the \n     State and the local taxing jurisdictions within the State \n     pursuant to paragraph (1).\n       (C) Source all remote sales in compliance with the sourcing \n     definition set forth in section 4(7).\n       (D) Provide--\n       (i) information indicating the taxability of products and \n     services along with any product and service exemptions from \n     sales and use tax in the State and a rates and boundary \n     database;\n       (ii) software free of charge for remote sellers that \n     calculates sales and use taxes due on each transaction at the \n     time the transaction is completed, that files sales and use \n     tax returns, and that is updated to reflect rate changes as \n     described in subparagraph (H); and\n       (iii) certification procedures for persons to be approved \n     as certified software providers.\n     For purposes of clause (iii), the software provided by \n     certified software providers shall be capable of calculating \n     and filing sales and use taxes in all States qualified under \n     this Act.\n       (E) Relieve remote sellers from liability to the State or \n     locality for the incorrect collection, remittance, or \n     noncollection of sales and use taxes, including any penalties \n     or interest, if the liability is the result of an error or \n     omission made by a certified software provider.\n       (F) Relieve certified software providers from liability to \n     the State or locality for the incorrect collection, \n     remittance, or noncollection of sales and use taxes, \n     including any penalties or interest, if the liability is the \n     result of misleading or inaccurate information provided by a \n     remote seller.\n       (G) Relieve remote sellers and certified software providers \n     from liability to the State or locality for incorrect \n     collection, remittance, or noncollection of sales and use \n     taxes, including any penalties or interest, if the liability \n     is the result of incorrect information or software provided \n     by the State.\n       (H) Provide remote sellers and certified software providers \n     with 90 days notice of a rate change by the State or any \n     locality in the State and update the information described in \n     subparagraph (D)(i) accordingly and relieve any remote seller \n     or certified software provider from liability for collecting \n     sales and use taxes at the immediately preceding effective \n     rate during the 90-day notice period if the required notice \n     is not provided.\n       (c) Small Seller Exception.--A State is authorized to \n     require a remote seller to collect sales and use taxes under \n     this Act only if the remote seller has gross annual receipts \n     in total remote sales in the United States in the preceding \n     calendar year exceeding $1,000,000. For purposes of \n     determining whether the threshold in this section is met, the \n     gross annual receipts from remote sales of 2 or more persons \n     shall be aggregated if--\n       (1) such persons are related to the remote seller within \n     the meaning of subsections (b) and (c) of section 267 or \n     section 707(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or\n       (2) such persons have 1 or more ownership relationships and \n     such relationships were designed with a principal purpose of \n     avoiding the application of these rules.\n\n[[Page S2972]]\n\n     SEC. 3.

CUSTOMER TAX ADDRESS.\n\n       (a) Seller Obligation.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to subsection (e)(2), a seller \n     shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining in the \n     ordinary course of business the customer tax address with \n     respect to the sale of a digital good or a digital service, \n     and shall be responsible for collecting and remitting the \n     correct amount of tax for the State and local jurisdictions \n     whose territorial limits encompass the customer tax address \n     if the State has the authority to require such collection and \n     remittance by the seller.\n       (2) Certain transactions.--When a customer tax address is \n     not a business location of the seller under clause (i) of \n     section 207(2)(A)--\n       (A) if the sale is a separate and discrete transaction, \n     then a seller shall use reasonable efforts to obtain a \n     customer tax address, as such efforts are described in \n     clauses (iii), (iv), and (v) of section 207(2)(A), before \n     resorting to using a customer tax address as\n\n[[Page S2976]]\n\n     determined by clause (vi) of such section 207(2)(A); and\n       (B) if the sale is not a separate and discrete transaction, \n     then a seller shall use reasonable efforts to obtain a \n     customer tax address, as such efforts are described in \n     clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v) of section 207(2)(A), \n     before resorting to using a customer tax address as \n     determined by clause (vi) of such section 207(2)(A).\n       (b) Reliance on Customer-provided Information.--A seller \n     that relies in good faith on information provided by a \n     customer to determine a customer tax address shall not be \n     held liable for any additional tax based on a different \n     determination of that customer tax address by a State or \n     local jurisdiction or court of competent jurisdiction, except \n     if and until binding notice is given as provided in \n     subsection (c).\n       (c) Address Correction.--If a State or local jurisdiction \n     is authorized under State law to administer a tax, and the \n     jurisdiction determines that the customer tax address \n     determined by a seller is not the customer tax address that \n     would have been determined under section 207(2)(A) if the \n     seller had the additional information provided by the State \n     or local jurisdiction, then the jurisdiction may give binding \n     notice to the seller to correct the customer tax address on a \n     prospective basis, effective not less than 45 days after the \n     date of such notice, if--\n       (1) when the determination is made by a local jurisdiction, \n     such local jurisdiction obtains the consent of all affected \n     local jurisdictions within the State before giving such \n     notice of determination;

and\n       (B) the digital good or digital service is delivered, \n     transferred, or provided electronically by means of mobile \n     telecommunications service that is deemed to be provided by \n     such home service provider under section 117 of such title,\n\n     then the home service provider and, if different, the seller \n     of the digital good or digital service, may presume that the \n     customer's place of primary use for such mobile \n     telecommunications service is the customer tax address \n     described in section 207(2)(B) with respect to the sale of \n     such digital good or digital service.\n       (2) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection, the \n     terms ``home service provider'', ``mobile telecommunications \n     service'', and ``place of primary use'' have the same \n     meanings as in section 124 of title 4, United States Code.\n       (e) Multiple Locations.--\n       (1) In general.--If a digital good or a digital service is \n     sold to a customer and available for use by the customer in \n     multiple locations simultaneously, the seller may determine \n     the customer tax addresses using a reasonable and consistent \n     method based on the addresses of use as provided by the \n     customer and determined in agreement with the customer at the \n     time of sale.\n       (2) Direct customer payment.--\n       (A) Establishment of direct payment procedures.--Each State \n     and local jurisdiction shall provide reasonable procedures \n     that permit the direct payment by a qualified customer, as \n     determined under procedures established by the State or local \n     jurisdiction, of taxes that are on the sale of digital goods \n     and digital services to multiple locations of the customer \n     and that would, absent such procedures, be required or \n     permitted by law to be collected from the customer by the \n     seller.\n       (B) Effect of customer compliance with direct payment \n     procedures.--When a qualified customer elects to pay tax \n     directly under the procedures established under subparagraph \n     (A), the seller shall--\n       (i) have no obligation to obtain the multiple customer tax \n     addresses under subsection (a); and\n       (ii) not be liable for such tax, provided the seller \n     follows the State and local procedures and maintains \n     appropriate documentation in its books and records.\n\n     SEC. 205. TREATMENT OF BUNDLED TRANSACTIONS AND DIGITAL \n                   CODES.\n\n       (a) Bundled Transaction.--If a charge for a distinct and \n     identifiable digital good or a digital service is aggregated \n     with and not separately stated from one or more charges for \n     other distinct and identifiable goods or services, which may \n     include other digital goods or digital services, and any part \n     of the aggregation is subject to taxation, then the entire \n     aggregation may be subject to taxation, except to the extent \n     that the seller can identify, by reasonable and verifiable \n     standards, one or more charges for the nontaxable goods or \n     services from its books and records kept in the ordinary \n     course of business.\n       (b) Digital Code.--The tax treatment of the sale of a \n     digital code shall be the same as the tax treatment of the \n     sale of the digital good or digital service to which the \n     digital code relates.\n       (c) Rule of Construction.--The sale of a digital code shall \n     be considered the sale transaction for purposes of this \n     title.\n\n     SEC. 206. NO INFERENCE.\n\n       (a) Customer Liability.--Subject to the prohibition \n     provided in section 202, nothing in this title modifies, \n     impairs, supersedes, or authorizes the modification, \n     impairment, or supersession of any law allowing a State or \n     local jurisdiction to impose tax on and collect tax directly \n     from a customer based upon use of a digital good or digital \n     service in such State.\n       (b) Non-tax Matters.--This title shall not be construed to \n     apply in, or to affect, any non-tax regulatory matter or \n     other context.\n       (c) State Tax Matters.--The definitions contained in this \n     title are intended to be used with respect to interpreting \n     this title. Nothing in this title shall prohibit a State or \n     local jurisdiction from adopting different nomenclature to \n     enforce the provisions set forth in this title.\n\n     SEC. 207.
