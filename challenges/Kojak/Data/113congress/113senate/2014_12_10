Mr. President, when the Senate convened for the first time \nin April of 1789, there was a lot to do--and that is an \nunderstatement--not the least of which was to establish a system of \nrules to govern proceedings in the U.S. Senate. The first few weeks and \nmonths were going to be difficult, as they tried to sort out the \nstructure and organization of this institution, but they had an idea. \nTwo days after achieving its first quorum, the Senate selected a \nSecretary to oversee the day-to-day operations of what would become the \nworld's greatest deliberative body.\n  The importance of this position can't be overstated. Senators and \ntheir staffs come and go, but the Secretary of the Senate provides much \nneeded stability and support. To put things into perspective, in the \nentire history of this country--225 years--we have only had 32 \nSecretaries of the Senate. By contrast, there have been almost 2,000 \nSenators who have served since its inception. That number will grow, of \ncourse, come January.\n  For the last 8 years, Nancy Erickson has served superbly as Secretary \nof the Senate. But to be quite honest, that is what we expected her to \ndo when she got this job.\n  I came to know Nancy when I was the assistant leader, and a friend \nand confidant of Senator Daschle. Every time I walked in that office, \nthere she was, always so very, very nice. She was a pleasant person. \nShe was always smiling. We had some big issues, but she was always \npleasant to everybody.\n  Her first job here in the Senate was with Tom Daschle. She became his \nscheduler. But given her abilities, she quickly assumed more \nresponsibility, eventually becoming deputy chief of staff. When Senator \nDaschle left the Senate, Nancy transitioned to the Sergeant-at-Arms \noffice, where she worked as a liaison to Democratic Senators and their \noffices.\n  Nancy is a native of Brandon, SD. She majored in history and \ngovernment at Augustana College in Sioux Falls. She moved to \nWashington, DC, in 1987. Her husband Tom is from Sioux Falls. John \nThune used to purchase suits from Nancy's father-in-law.\n  Nancy's first job here in the Senate, as I have indicated, was for \nSenator Daschle. In her current office, Nancy has a collection of South \nDakota maps hanging on the walls, one of the railroad tracks across \nSouth Dakota in 1886, one of Watertown, SD, and she has others. She \neven has a Rand McNally map of a long time ago that covers the entire \nState.\n  As I indicated, when Senator Daschle left the Senate, Nancy \ntransitioned to the Sergeant-at-Arms office where she worked as liaison \nto Democratic Senators and their offices. When I became leader and it \nwas time for selecting a new secretary, I didn't look very far. I urged \nher to consider the position. I am glad she did. I have not regretted \nthat decision, not for a second. She has proven herself to be an \nexcellent manager.\n  Nancy has 26 departments and about 250 employees directly under her \nsupervision, not to mention the other 6,500 Senate employees who depend \non her and her office. She has been faced with some difficult times \nduring her tenure as Secretary of the Senate. There has been a lot of \nroiling--sequestration, a new health care rollout, and, of course, last \nyear's shutdown. She has confronted each difficult obstacle with skill, \ncomposure, and that wonderful smile that she has.\n  Nancy's success as Secretary stems not only from her excellent \nabilities but also from her character. She is a genuinely good person \nand she is very thorough, very thoughtful--I have already said that; \nvery kind--I have already said that; very understanding--I have already \nsaid that; and something I haven't said, she is very fair.\n  Whether she walks the halls here or on the Senate floor, she always \nhas a smile every place she goes. I have said that many times. That is \nher legacy, and it is a good legacy. I have never--never might be an \nexaggeration, but extremely rarely--heard her criticize anyone.\n  Nancy's time as Secretary of the Senate is coming to an end and she \nwill be greatly missed. She has attended to the Senate's every need, \nday and night. She has earned a break, and I hope she takes one. I hope \nshe gets to spend some time with her husband Tom, her daughter Drew, \nand I can still see in my mind's eye that picture she has of little \nPatrick--that little tiny boy. She had that on her desk forever, and he \nkept getting bigger and bigger and became an athlete. We had many \nconversations--and I try not to boast about a lot of things, but I am \nalways anxious to boast about my youngest son, who was a stellar \nathlete and played on three national championship teams at the \nUniversity of Virginia--so I have watched Patrick become a college \nsoccer player.\n  There will never be another Nancy Erickson here in the Senate. People \nlike her don't come along very often. But she leaves a legacy, and it \nis one that will endure through the history of this great body.\n  So thank you, Nancy, for your service to the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6468-4", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6468-S6469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SHEILA DWYER\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when Secretary Erickson steps down, so does \nthe Assistant Secretary of the Senate Sheila Dwyer. Sheila has a long \nhistory in the U.S. Senate, but Sheila's time started long ago--and I \nam not going to talk about how long ago, but she was a Senate page \nduring the time, of course, when she was in high school. But after her \nsemester as a page, she, like all these young pages who are here for a \nsemester, returned home to Connecticut. She loves to boast about the \ngreat State of Connecticut, and I have listened to her do that for many \nyears. But her heart has always been with the Senate from the time she \nwas a page, and so she returned after her education.\n  Sheila got a degree from Suffolk University. She returned to the \nSenate in many different capacities, but we have had wonderful \nconversations about her time with Chuck Robb. She is a family friend of \nthe Robbs--and I mean a family friend--very close to them. She later \nworked for Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n  I talked to his widow within the past couple of weeks. What a unique \nman Senator Moynihan was. There is a new book out about him, and I have \nasked my staff to get a copy of it, which talks about this unusual man. \nI am anxious to read it because he was brilliant, but also he had a \nfew--he was eccentric in some ways. And Sheila loves to tell \nprivately--and I will not repeat here on the floor--some of the things \nhe did that would appear to a lot of us to be a little bit eccentric. \nBut that was part of his unique quality and she handled him so well--as \nwell as anyone could.\n  She worked for another man with a huge personality: Senator Fritz \nHollings. He would, even though he is over 90 years old, still be here \nin the Senate except his wife became ill. He is physically strong \ntoday, bright of mind, and I can hear this man's voice from where he \nstood. What a voice he had, a man who was the epitome of what a Senator\n\n[[Page S6469]]\n\nshould look like. He was a handsome man. I repeat, he had this great \nvoice, and he was very tall, stood very erect. I was always very \nenvious of how he could stand so tall, and he has such a sense of humor \nthat is quite remarkable. Sheila is his friend. She visits him in his \nhome in South Carolina now, and she has helped me keep in touch with \nFritz Hollings.\n  Then she worked for me. I was so fortunate. I was looking for someone \nto do my fundraising during a very difficult election I had before me. \nI knew who I wanted, but I didn't know that I could get her. Well, we \nworked things out. And it wasn't just because I offered her more money, \nit was because she wanted to work with me, and I am so happy that came \nto be.\n  For 14 years, she has been part of my team--and I mean part of my \nteam. During that entire time, she has done an incredible job doing my \nSenate business as a candidate. Doing Senate business here as the \nAssistant Secretary, she has been the best.\n  So after having worked for the Senators I have mentioned, including \nme, when the time came to fill the role of Assistant Secretary of the \nSenate, she was a perfect candidate, and in this position she has not \ndisappointed me once.\n  Everyone who has ever worked with Sheila knows she is a meticulous \nplanner. If you want something done--an event--and done right--and I \nmean done right: help setting up the program, what the flowers are \ngoing to look like, what the food is going to be, what time it should \nstart, what time it should end--and she is very, very precise on when \nit should start and when it should end--we learned that last night \nduring a farewell for a number of Democratic Senators--she really \nspares no effort, leaves no detail unattended.\n  Her time here in the Secretary's office has been a smashing success. \nIt is not easy to attend to the needs of 100 Senators--100 Senators--\nDemocrats, Republicans, Independents, their families and staffs, but \nSheila handles it with skill and with grace. That is why many call her \nthe ``Mayor of Capitol Hill,'' and for good reason.\n  Whether she is escorting the President's daughter to the inauguration \npodium in her bright pink coat, or planning a ceremonial dinner in \nStatuary Hall, Sheila does the job exceptionally well.\n  Just one example, 2 years ago the Senate hosted the screening of \nSteven Spielberg's now legendary film, ``Lincoln.'' There were some \nreal big-shots there. Spielberg, Daniel Day Lewis, the guy that wrote \nthe script--they were all there. So there were, frankly, a lot of prima \ndonnas there, including of course all the Senators. So it was an \nexceptionally difficult feat to pull off, coordinating attendance for \n100 Senators who all wanted to go to see these famous people.\n  She was preparing a panel discussion for the cast and crew, all while \nfollowing strict Capitol protocols as to who could go where and what we \ncould do in the places we went. But she had a secret weapon, and that \nwas she. She didn't know it, but that was the secret weapon. She took \ncare of every possible problem and coordinated every single detail, \neven down to a makeshift concession stand in the lobby. It was a \nwonderful event, a marvelous event, because for the briefest moment it \nbrought the Senate together in the spirit of unity that we haven't had \nin some time. It all happened because of her.\n  She is very devoted to her family, her mom Lois, about whom she has \ntalked endlessly, and of course her deceased father. I was trying to \nhelp in comforting her as I could when she lost her mom Lois. I can't \nimagine how proud her parents would be--and are, from wherever they \nare, looking down on us--at the work that Sheila has done in her life. \nI know how proud I am of her now, as she prepares to move on to her \nnext chapter of life, and I will do everything I can to help that \nchapter be a good one. I wish her the best.\n  I, along with the entire Senate, thank her for the steadfast diligent \nservice she has rendered as Assistant Secretary for the last 8 years.\n  Sheila has a dog she loves, little Ava, and I hope she takes that \nlittle dog on a trip to have a good time. I am sure she will.\n  On a personal note, I wish to say publicly how much she has meant to \nme. She has been really a part of my family the last 15 years. As most \neveryone knows, my wife was involved in a really bad accident. Who was \nthere? Sheila. Battling, as she did for 1\\1/2\\ years, ravaging breast \ncancer, who was there? I would come home after having been unable to do \nthe things around the house. I would have a refrigerator full of food. \nNot junk--it was wonderful food. She did that not once, not twice, but \nmany, many times. She is my friend--my forever friend.\n  She interacts with my children as if they were her siblings. She \nknows everything about them. So even though I will not see her at work \nevery day, as I have for 14 or 15 years, she will always be part of my \nlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6469-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Saxby Chambliss.\n  Saxby, as we all know, is the ultimate southern gentleman. He is a \nman of his word. He is blessed with the charm and the drawl only a \nGeorgian could possess, and he is far too modest. He shouldn't be. He \nhas a lot to be proud of as he looks back at a storied career here in \nCongress.\n  We are talking about one of our Nation's top experts on intelligence \nand national security. We are talking about a standout champion for the \nmen and women of our military. We are also talking about a Senator who \nbecame chair of the Agriculture Committee just 2 years into his first \nterm. That is really quite an accomplishment. But once you get to know \nSaxby, it isn't all that surprising.\n  Before he came to Congress, Saxby was a smalltown ag lawyer. He still \nlives in a rural area--a peanut and cotton-farming region far removed \nfrom the bright lights of Atlanta. Saxby has a feel for the issues that \ncould only be acquired from actual on-the-ground experience. He \nunderstands the real-world impact of what we discuss here in \nWashington, and he cares.\n  On top of that, he has the disciplined work ethic of a minister's \nson--which makes sense, because he is one. Saxby is usually the first \nguy to raise his hand when there is an assignment no one else wants. \nThat is what we saw for him on the Gang of 6, a politically difficult \nand work-intensive committee if there ever was one.\n  But Saxby came here to get things done--not to posture. He takes on \nprojects with the kind of drive and courage we don't often see.\n  How courageous is Saxby? Well, he accepted an invitation to go quail \nhunting with Vice President Cheney, and he lived to tell the tale. The \nsenior Senator from South Carolina remembers the trip very well. He had \nto be persuaded by Saxby to come. He still suspects that Saxby's real \nmotive was to give Cheney a second target.\n  It wasn't the only time Saxby cheated death with the Vice President. \nLindsey recalls a meeting in Baghdad with Saxby, Joe Biden, and the \nIraqi Prime Minister. Afterward, they boarded a plane and came under \nfire. Here is what Saxby said: ``I guess the meeting didn't go that \nwell.''\n  So Saxby is a comedian. But he is also courageous. He is also \npersuasive. He is really good at getting his way. It is kind of what we \nwould expect from a former door-to-door fruitcake salesman. After \nhawking loaves of spiced dough, there is not much Saxby can't sell at \nthis point.\n  We know he was persuasive enough to convince Julianne to marry him. \nSaxby and Julianne met at the University of Georgia. She was Sigma \nChi's pledge-class sweetheart--and she soon became Saxby's sweetheart. \nThe Chamblisses have been inseparable ever since.\n  Now, just in case Saxby ever becomes his own category on Jeopardy, \nhere is an interesting piece of trivia. The president of the same \npledge class became Saxby's Democrat challenger in 2008. The two \nfraternity brothers are still friendly. Here is how this gentleman \nremembered Saxby from college. He said he ``looked old.''\n\n[[Page S6470]]\n\n  Well, Julianne fell for him anyway, and it is a good thing she did. \nThis former schoolteacher is better than anyone at keeping him \ncentered, and she has even taught students who would go on to serve on \nSaxby's staff. So it is really quite a partnership. Saxby says that the \nmost significant moment of his life is when he met Julianne.\n  That is really something when we consider how much he loves golf. \nLast year, Saxby sank a hole in one squaring off against the leader of \nthe free world--that is, the President of the United States. He has a \nsigned flag to prove it.\n  But golf is more than just a hobby for Saxby. It is a way to get \nthings done. More than most people around here, he understands the \nvalue of relationships. He is good at whipping votes and picking up \nintel from both ends of the Capitol. He works across the aisle, and he \nis unafraid to stand up when something needs to be said.\n  That is the thing about Saxby. He doesn't say a lot, but when he \ndoes, you know it is significant. You know there is a lot of careful \nthought behind it.\n  Saxby is a serious legislator who approaches his role as vice \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee in that frame. Saxby learns \nthings on that committee that would keep anyone up at night. It is a \ngrave responsibility. But Saxby is perfectly suited to it. He has \nalways stood proudly in defense of our Nation.\n  We are going to miss his sharp wit, his integrity, and his judgment.\n  I know Saxby's staff is going to miss him, too. Some of them have \nbeen with him since his days in the House. Well, the Senate's loss is \nthe Chambliss family's gain.\n  I know Saxby is looking forward to spending more time with Julianne. \nI know he can't wait to trade the title of Senator for a new one--Big \nDaddy. It is what his grandkids call him. He can't wait to see more of \nthem. They are the reason he works so hard here--to build a better \nfuture for them, for the next generation.\n  Saxby will have plenty of stories to share when he leaves, such as \nwhen he hit that hole in one, when he threw out the first pitch for the \nBraves, and when he made the cover of Peanut Patriot Magazine.\n  So Saxby has obviously had a long and interesting career. He deserves \nsome time to focus on his family. We thank him for his dedication to \nthis body and to the people he represents, and we send him every wish \nfor a retirement filled with joy and happiness.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6470-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Inhofe, \nthe ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, to bring \nto the floor H.R. 3979. This is the agreement between the Armed \nServices Committees of the Senate and House on the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. The House of Representatives \npassed the bill last week by a vote of 300 to 119. If we succeed in the \nSenate, it will mark the 53rd year in a row that we have enacted this \nbill that is so essential to the defense of our Nation and to our men \nand women in uniform and their families.\n  I thank all the members of the staff of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, especially our subcommittee chairs for the hard work they \nhave done to get us to the finish line on this bill. I thank Senator \nInhofe for his close partnership. Before this Congress I had been \nfortunate to serve with a series of Republican chairmen and ranking \nmembers, including John McCain, John Warner, and Strom Thurmond. They \nunderstood and appreciated the traditions of our committee and the \nimportance of the legislation we enact every year for our men and women \nin uniform. That is what this is all about. Jim Inhofe, our ranking \nRepublican in this Congress, has upheld that tradition of \nbipartisanship and dedication to enacting this important legislation \nthrough particularly challenging circumstances.\n  Our bill includes hundreds of important provisions to authorize the \nactivities of the Department of Defense and to provide for the well-\nbeing of our men and women in uniform and their families. The bill will \nenable the military services to continue paying special pay and bonuses \nneeded for recruitment and retention of key personnel. It strengthens \nsurvivor benefits for disabled children of servicemembers and retirees. \nIt includes provisions addressing the employment of military spouses, \njob placement for veterans, and military child custody disputes. It \naddresses military hazing, military suicide, post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, and mental health problems in the military. It provides \ncontinuing impact to support military families and local school \ndistricts.\n  The bill includes 20 provisions to continue to build on the progress \nwe are starting to make in addressing the scourge of sexual assault in \nthe military. Key provisions will eliminate the so-called good soldier \ndefense, give victims a voice in whether their case is prosecuted in \nmilitary or civilian courts, give victims the right to challenge court-\nmartial rulings that violate their rights at the court of criminal \nappeals, and would strengthen the psychotherapist-patient privilege. \nLast week we received the welcome news that the number of incidents of \nunwanted sexual contact in the military is down and that more incidents \nare being reported so victims can receive the care and assistance they \nneed and perpetrators can be brought to justice. With the enactment of \nthe legislation before us and the commitment of military leaders, we \nhope to build on these trends.\n  The bill provides continued funding and authorities for ongoing \noperations in Afghanistan and for our forces conducting operations \nagainst the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria called ISIS.\n  As requested by the administration, it authorizes the Department of \nDefense to train and equip vetted members of the moderate Syrian \nopposition and to train and equip national and local forces who are \nactively fighting ISIS in Iraq. It establishes a counterterrorism \npartnership fund that provides the administration new flexibility in \naddressing emerging terrorist threats around the world. In addition, \nthe bill extends the Afghanistan Special Immigrant Visa Program, \nproviding for 4,000 new visas, and addresses a legal glitch that \nprecluded members of the ruling parties in Kurdistan from receiving \nvisas under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n  The authority provided in this bill to train and equip local forces \nin Iraq and Syria to take on ISIS is particularly important because our \nmilitary leaders and intelligence experts have uniformly told us \nairstrikes alone will not be sufficient to defeat ISIS. American air \npower has changed the momentum on the ground somewhat and given \nmoderates in the region an opportunity\n\n[[Page S6471]]\n\nto regroup, but ISIS cannot be defeated without an opposing force to \ntake the fight to it on the ground. To do that, our Arab and Muslim \npartners must be in the lead because the fight with ISIS is primarily a \nstruggle within Islam for the hearts and minds of Muslims. Training and \nequipping our moderate Muslim allies gives us a way to move beyond the \nuse of air power to support them in this fight.\n  Our bill takes steps to respond to Russian aggression in Ukraine by \nauthorizing $1 billion for a European Reassurance Initiative to enhance \nthe U.S. military presence in Europe and build partner capacity to \nrespond to security threats, of which no less than $75 million would be \ncommitted for activities and assistance to support Ukraine by requiring \na review of U.S. and NATO force posture, readiness and contingency \nplans in Europe and by expressing support for both nonprovocative \ndefense military assistance--both lethal and non lethal--to Ukraine.\n\n  The bill adds hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to improve \nthe readiness of our Armed Forces across all branches--Active, Guard, \nand Reserve--to help blunt some--and I emphasize some--of the negative \neffects of sequestration. It includes provisions increasing funding for \nscience and technology, providing women-owned small businesses the same \nsole-source contracting authority that is already available to other \ncategories of small businesses, expanding the No Contracting With the \nEnemy Act to all government agencies and requiring governmentwide \nreform of information technology acquisition. Although we were unable \nto bring the Senate-reported bill to the floor for amendment, we \nestablished an informal clearing process pursuant to which we were able \nto clear 44 Senate amendments--roughly an equal number of Democratic \nand Republican amendments--and include them in the new bill which is \nbefore us.\n  I am pleased the bill also includes a half dozen provisions to \naddress the growing cyber threat to critical information systems of the \nDepartment of Defense and the Nation. One provision which was added to \nthe bill was the Levin-McCain amendment, which requires the President \nto identify nations that engage in economic or industrial espionage \nagainst the United States through cyber space and provides authority to \nimpose trade sanctions on persons determined to be knowingly engaged in \nsuch espionage.\n  A second provision which arose out of a committee investigation of \ncyber threats to the Department of Defense requires the Secretary of \nDefense to establish procedures for identifying contractors that are \noperationally critical to mobilization, deployment or sustainment of \ncontingency operations and to ensure that such contractors report any \nsuccessful penetrations of their computer networks. Much more remains \nto be done, but these are important first steps as we begin to respond \nto the serious threat posed to U.S. interests by cyber attacks.\n  With regard to military compensation reform, we adopted a number of \nproposals to slow the growth of personnel costs in fiscal year 2015, as \nneeded to enable the Department of Defense to begin to address \nreadiness shortfalls in a fiscal environment constrained by \nsequestration-level budgets, while deferring further changes to be made \nin future years if sequestration is not adequately addressed.\n  In particular, the Department requested pay raises below the rate of \ninflation for 5 years. This bill provides a pay raise below the rate of \ninflation for fiscal year 2015, deferring decisions on future pay \nraises to later bills. The Department requested that we slow the growth \nof the basic allowance for housing by permitting adjustments below the \nrate of inflation for 3 years. This bill would slow the growth of the \nbasic allowance for housing for fiscal year 2015, deferring decisions \non future increases to later bills. The Department requested that we \ngradually increase copays for TRICARE pharmaceuticals over 10 years. \nThis bill includes a proportionate increase in copays for fiscal year \n2015, deferring decisions on future increases to later bills.\n\n  These are not steps any of us want to have to take; however, the \nBudget Control Act of 2011 cut $1 trillion from the planned Department \nof Defense budget over a 10-year period. Our senior military leaders \ntold us they simply cannot meet sequestration budget levels without \nstructural changes--canceling programs, retiring weapon systems, and \nreducing the growth in benefits--to reduce the size and cost of our \nmilitary.\n  A year and a half ago when sequestration was first triggered, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified that sequestration \n``will severely limit our ability to implement our defense strategy. It \nwill put the nation at greater risk of coercion, and it will break \nfaith with men and women in uniform.'' At a hearing this spring, he \ntold us that ``delaying adjustments to military compensation will cause \nadditional, disproportionate cuts to force structure, readiness, and \nmodernization.''\n  The Department of Defense budget proposal also proposed to retire \nseveral weapon systems in an effort to meet sequestration-level budget \nceilings. For example, the Department proposed to take half of the \nNavy's fleet of cruisers out of service and to retire the Army's entire \nfleet of scout and training helicopters. With regard to Navy cruisers, \nour bill allows the Navy to take two cruisers out of service this year, \ndeferring a decision on additional ships until next year's budget. With \nregard to Army helicopters, the National Guard objected to the plan to \nconsolidate Apache attack helicopters in the Active component so they \ncan operate at the higher operational tempo needed to both fill their \nown mission and replace the Kiowa mission. The Guard maintains that the \nArmy should be able to achieve needed savings and meet mission \nrequirements without transferring Apaches from the Reserve components \nto the Active Army.\n  Our bill establishes an independent commission on the future of the \nArmy to examine Army force structure and make recommendations as to the \nbest way forward for Army helicopters. Because the Army needs the \nsavings generated by the helicopter restructuring now, the bill would \nallow the transfer of 48 Apache helicopters--as called for in both the \nArmy plan and the alternative National Guard plan--before the \ncommission reports. Additional transfers would depend on the \nrecommendations of the commission and subsequent Department or \ncongressional action.\n  Sequestration is damaging enough to our military, but the damage will \nbe far worse if we insist that the Department conduct business as usual \nwithout regard to the changed budget circumstances. The budget caps \nimposed by sequestration mean that every dollar we choose to spend on a \nprogram that we refuse to cancel or reduce has to come from another \nhigher priority program. Our senior military leaders have told us that \nthis will mean planes that can't fly, ships that can't sail, and \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who are not properly trained and \nequipped for the mission we expect them to accomplish. As the Vice \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told us in January, sending \ntroops into harm's way without training, equipment, or the latest \ntechnology is a breach of trust with the troops and their families.\n  The painful measures included in this bill are just a downpayment on \nthe changes that will be needed if sequestration is not repealed. \nDelaying these changes will only make the pain worse later on while \ndamaging the readiness of our troops to carry out their missions when \nwe call upon them.\n  I am disappointed that we were unable to make further progress in \nthis bill toward the objective of closing the detention facility at \nGuantanamo, Cuba. The Senate committee-reported bill included a \nprovision that would have allowed the Department of Defense to bring \nGitmo detainees to the United States, subject to a series of legal \nprotections, for detention and trial. The provision also included an \namendment--this is the provision in the Senate committee-passed bill--\nwhich was offered by Senator Graham that would require the President, \nbefore authorizing the transfer of any detainees to the United States, \nto present a plan to Congress and that Congress would be afforded an \nopportunity to disapprove the plan using expedited procedures. It would \nhave been a joint resolution.\n  I continue to believe the Gitmo facility undermines our interests \naround the world and has made it more difficult to try to convict the \nterrorists\n\n[[Page S6472]]\n\nwho are detained there, and I am disappointed that the House leadership \nrefused to consider this provision even with the Graham amendment.\n  Finally, our bill includes a lands package that Senator Inhofe and I \nagreed to include based on the bipartisan, bicameral request of the \ncommittees of jurisdiction and the overwhelming support of our \ncolleagues. The contents of the lands package were worked out by the \nHouse Natural Resources Committee and the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, which will be managing that part of the bill on \nthe Senate floor. We have been assured that all provisions have been \ncleared and that the package has been cleared by the chairmen and \nranking minority members of the relevant committees.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a full list of the names \nof our majority and minority staff members, who have given so much of \nthemselves and their families, be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Peter K.

Walker, Security Officer.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, I have to say what a joy it is to \nwork with Senator Levin. I know the public thinks that no Republicans \nlike any Democrats and vice versa--at least those are the flames they \ntry to fan--and that is not true.\n  I can only think of two issues on which Senator Levin and I disagreed \nwith each other. He has been through 16 of the NDAAs as either chairman \nor ranking member. I am sure that is some kind of a record. But to work \nwith someone who you know will be totally honest with you even when you \nhave a difference of opinion is really a joy. I hope we can be an \nexample for some of the other committees that don't have that much joy \nwhen they are working on an issue.\n  The long history he has had here and the integrity he has expressed \nwill be sorely missed, I have to say to my good friend Senator Levin.\n  As Senator Levin said, we will have to get to the bill before we \nleave. This bill has passed for 52 consecutive years, and that really \nsays something. But each year there is always a problem.\n  The comment that was made on the land package--I think the process is \nwrong regardless of the merits of the bill. As was pointed out by \nSenator Levin, it was supported in a bipartisan way by all the \nappropriate committees; however, that is not us, that is them. The \nprocess should not allow others to come in on this bill, so I think it \nis flawed. I don't think it will happen again. I really don't.\n  I talked to the people who will be involved in next year's NDAA, \nwhich, by the way, we will start working on in February of next year.\n  I will go over a couple of other reasons why we have to get this bill \ndone. As I said, we have done this for 52 consecutive years, and I am \nsure we are going to be able to get this done.\n  We passed this bill out to the floor from our committee--the \ncommittee chaired by Senator Levin--on May 23, the day after it was \ndone in the House committee. So we were ready to do this way back in \nMay, and the problem was we could not get it on the floor.\n  I can remember coming down to the floor with Senator Levin and \nbegging people to bring amendments to us. We have to have amendments \ndown here because we can't expect the leader to bring this to the floor \nunless we know people will work with us on amendments. So eventually \nthey did bring amendments, and we responded. We had many amendments. I \ndon't remember exactly how many amendments were put forth, but I do \nremember we considered and put 47 amendments into this package--we did \nit through the big four method, which was the only thing left for us to \ndo--47 amendments divided almost equally between Republicans and \nDemocrats. We considered those amendments and put them in as a part of \nthe bill.\n  Of course, despite pushing for months that the NDAA be considered \nunder regular order, which we should have done, we find ourselves in \nthe unfortunate situation we are in today. It is reminiscent of last \nyear. Last year we went all the way up to December 26 before we finally \npassed it.\n  It would really be a disaster if we didn't pass it. People don't \nrealize that if we don't pass this bill--our last chance is this week \nbecause the House will be out of there. There will be no way to have \namendments or change anything now from the product we have. We already \nhave a lot of the amendments in, but we can't make changes to them. We \ncan't have another bill because we have run out of time. It will not \nhappen unless it happens with this bill. I know a lot of people would \nprefer to have something else, although I know this bill is going to \npass by a large margin. It is a good bill.\n  People wonder what would happen if we didn't pass this bill. It would \nbe a disaster. Enlistment bonuses--a lot of these kids have been over \nthere serving, and they have been told they will have certain things, \nand one of them is the bonuses. Well, all of a sudden, on December 31, \nif we don't have a bill, those expire and those kids will not have \nenlistment or reenlistment bonuses.\n  The incentives are important in order to keep troops with critical \nskills. We hear a lot about the SEALs and the great work they do. These \ncritical skills incentives will go away on December 31.\n  There is also incentive pay for pilots. I have researched this \nbecause there is a lot of competition out there for our pilots--pilots \nfor heavy vehicles, as well as strike fighters. Right now there is a \ncompetition with the airlines. Everyone wants to hire these guys, so \nthere is competition out there. All of a sudden the flight pay would \ncome out on December 31 if we don't pass this bill, and that means we \nwill lose some of these guys. It is a $25,000-a-year bonus for these \nguys over a 10-year period, so it is $250,000. However, for each one \nwho decides not to come back--to retrain someone to the status of an F-\n22 would cost about $17 million. We are looking at bonuses that might \nbe $25,000, but the alternative, if we don't get this done by December \n31, would cost $17 million for each pilot who needs to be trained. So \nthat is very significant. We have skill incentive pay and proficiency \nbonuses for all of those. So that singularly would be enough reason to \nsay we have to have it; we just can't do without it. Stopping all \nmilitary construction, which would be on December 31.\n\n  One of the areas where the chairman and I disagree is on Gitmo. We \nhave had a friendly and honest difference of opinion on that. I look at \nGitmo as one of the few resources we have that is a good deal for \ngovernment. We have had it since 1904 and it only costs us $4,000 and \nhalf the time Cuba forgets to charge us, so it is a pretty good deal. \nThere is no place else we can put, in my opinion, the combatants. \nPeople say bring them back to the United States. The problem is if we \nintermingle prisoners at Gitmo with the\n\n[[Page S6473]]\n\nprison population--these people at Gitmo are not criminals, they are \npeople who teach terrorists. So there are a lot of arguments against \nbringing Gitmo prisoners to the United States. That in itself would be \na 2-hour speech, so I will not get into it now.\n  There are some areas where the chairman and I disagree and there were \na lot of compromises because we knew we had to have the bill. If we \ndon't pass this bill, there will be no European Reassurance Initiative \nto stand up against Russian aggression. I shouldn't have done this \nbecause I was on the ballot this year for reelection, but for the week \nprior to our election, I went over to see what was happening in Ukraine \nbecause Ukraine was having their elections the week before we had our \nelections. Not many people are aware that in Ukraine, Poroshenko--what \nhappened in their election in Ukraine, a political party cannot have a \nseat in Parliament unless they get 5 percent of the vote. The vote took \nplace 1 week before our vote. This will be the first time in 96 years \nthat the Communist Party will not have one seat in Parliament. That is \namazing. We have to understand what is happening with Putin.\n  I also went to Lithuania and Estonia and Latvia and those areas in \nthe Baltics. That is another problem we have. They want to give us the \nassurance that it is not just Putin in Ukraine, but they are becoming \naggressive. I coined the term for what Putin is trying to do, ``de-\nReaganize'' Europe, to try to take out all the freedoms that were there \nand try to put a coalition together. That is a huge issue, and it is \naddressed in this bill in a very aggressive way with the reassurance \ninitiative.\n  Also, if we don't pass this bill, we would not have the \nCounterterrorism Partnership Fund, which I think we are all aware is so \nnecessary with ISIL on the rampage they are pursuing.\n  So we have a lot of provisions. I think the chairman did a good job \nof covering them. A couple of them perhaps might have been overlooked \nor that I might add for my own personal interests. One is the support \nof the Aircraft Modernization Program. Historically, we have always had \nthe best of everything, but now when we look at China and at Russia and \nwhat they are doing, it is a very difficult situation for us. We had \nthe F-22; the President terminated that program his first year in \noffice. So now we have all of our eggs in the basket in terms of the \nstrike vehicles and the F-35. A lot of people don't like the F-35, but \nthat is what we have to have and that is in this bill to continue with \nthat.\n  The E-2D surveillance aircraft is one very few people know about. It \nis one of the ugliest airplanes in the sky, but it is one that is \nnecessary for surveillance and other functions of government.\n  We have the KC-46 tanker aircraft. We have been using the KC-135 now \nfor decades and we have to go toward a more modern vehicle, and we do \nhave on the books that we will continue to do that, working with the \nKC-46. So several others--some improvements to the workhorse of the \nmilitary, the C-130 aircraft, and other vehicles.\n  Without this bill, we are going to have to stop some of these \nprojects, so think about the cost. We are in the midst of contracts \nright now that we could be in jeopardy of losing.\n  The construction on military and family housing is there. It is very \nsignificant.\n  So I think all of these pieces--and one piece I think people are \ninterested in is this will end the reliance on Russian-made rocket \nengines. We hear a lot about that. This bill includes a timeframe for \nwhen the current contracts run out, so that we are going to be \ndeveloping our own rocket engine. I have heard from a lot of outside \nexperts. Tom Stafford is one of the famous astronauts from Oklahoma. He \nand I have talked at length about what we are going to be able to do \nwith some of these rocket engines. So I think this is enough reason why \nwe have to do this, and I think everyone realizes that.\n  We have heard a lot of talk that frankly is not true. Unfortunately, \nthere are some groups that are kind of antimilitary groups that came \nout with some statements that weren't true and some of the talk show \nhosts I admire were given information that wasn't quite as accurate as \nit should have been.\n  Right now, if we can think of no other single major reason to pass \nthis bill, it is to take care of those individuals who are in the field \nright now who are fighting. We have the exact count, to make sure we \nuse accurate figures. As of today, 1,779,343 troops in the field or \nenlisted personnel. These are the ones who can be affected, 1.8 million \nof them. We would be reneging on the commitments we have made to them.\n  We have heard criticism that we are somehow cutting their benefits to \nput in a land package. That just isn't true. We don't need to talk \nabout this because that is not our committee. That is the committee \nreferred to by the chairman in his remarks--the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committees of the House and the Senate. But it is \nbudget neutral. Over a 10-year period, the CBO says it is budget \nneutral. So there is no legitimate argument that we are using any of \nthe funds that would otherwise go to the military on the land package.\n\n  I have to say the process was wrong. We have done this in the past \nand we are not going to do it again. We shouldn't have had a land \npackage come in that has nothing to do with defense, but nonetheless it \nis there. I was offended by the process. Frankly--I have to confess, \nand it is good for the soul, I guess--I thought after reading it, it \nwas a pretty good bill. If it would have been brought up outside of \nthis bill, I would have still voted for it. But the process is wrong, \nand I think we all understand that. We did the best we could.\n  We have these things that are going on right now, and I think we \ncan't take a chance on not having or, for the first time in 53 years, \nnot passing an NDAA bill by the end of the year. It would be a crisis. \nThe system could be criticized for the way it happened. Considering \nthat we passed our bill out of the committee on May 23, we should have \nhad it on the floor. We should have had it done in regular order. We \nwill do everything we can in the future to try to make that happen. For \ntwo consecutive years now we have not been able to do that. We have had \nto go through the system of what they call the Big Four--the chairman \nand ranking member of the House and the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Senate--to pass this bill. I think in this case we have come up \nwith a good bill. We have been able to incorporate 47 of the amendments \nthat have come from those that were filed to be added on the floor. So \nwe have done the best we can. There is no other alternative now when we \nconsider what will happen if for some unknown reason this would be the \nfirst year in 53 years that we don't have an NDAA bill.\n  I will just repeat what I started off with; that is, what a joy it \nhas been to work with Carl Levin over these years in the capacity of \neither the chairman or the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. He will be sorely missed. Oddly enough, we also have the \nsame situation happening over on the House side with Buck McKeon. I \nserved with him when I served in the House. He is going to be retiring \nafter this year as well. So we have two retiring chairmen of what I \nconsider to be the most significant committees in Washington.\n  We are going to continue to work together for the rest of this bill. \nWe have a good bill, and we are going to uphold our obligation to the \n1,779,343 enlisted personnel in the field. We are not going to let them \ndown.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me thank Senator Inhofe for his \nfriendship, most importantly, but also for the great partnership we \nhave enjoyed. It has been a real pleasure working with the Senator from \nOklahoma. I should perhaps also say we are confident our successors \nwill carry on this tradition as well. Senator McCain, the new chairman, \nand Senator Jack Reed will be the new ranking member and they will be \ncarrying on this tradition that we have done everything we know how to \ndo to maintain.\n  I wish to again thank my good friend Jim Inhofe and his staff who \nworked so well with the staff on this side. We talk about this side of \nthe aisle and that side of the aisle. In this bill obviously there will \nbe differences--very rarely,\n\n[[Page S6474]]\n\nby the way, on a partisan basis, even when there are differences. But \nthe aisle sort of disappears when it comes to the Defense authorization \nbill, and that is the way it should be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me reclaim my time just to make one \nother comment. The two people who are sitting here, Peter Levine on \nyour side and John Bonsell on our side, their compatibility in working \ntogether is also unprecedented. It doesn't happen very often. I can't \nspeak for the Senator from Michigan, but I can speak for myself, to say \nthat without these two working together I sure could not have \nparticipated in a meaningful way. So I thank them as well.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Oklahoma is speaking for both of us, I \ncan assure him, with his comments and so many other comments he made.\n  I will yield to the Senator from Colorado, but first I wish to thank \nhim for the great contribution he has made to our committee. I think he \nis planning on speaking on a different subject. He has played a major \nrole on the Intelligence Committee. I look forward to reading, if not \nhearing, his remarks on the subject on which I know he has spent a good \ndeal of time. Although he has had perhaps more visibility in terms of \nthe Intelligence Committee, he has been a major contributor on the \nArmed Services Committee. I can't say we will miss him because I will \nnot be here, but they will miss the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, before I start my remarks on \nthe historic day which was yesterday--when it comes to the publication \nof our long-in-the-making report on the CIA's torture program--I wish \nto thank the chairman for his leadership, his mentorship, and his \nfriendship. I also am proud obviously to be a part of the Armed \nServices Committee and to have chaired the Strategic Forces \nSubcommittee. Again, I extend my thanks to the good men and women in \nuniform, as did my good friend from Oklahoma. The NDAA bill is a \ncrucial task in front of us. I look forward to one of my last votes as \na Senator from the great State of Colorado, and I look forward to \ncasting a vote in favor of the Defense authorization bill.\n  Again, I wish to thank my two friends who have mentored me and who \nhave led our committee with great elan and intelligence.\n\n\n      SSCI Study of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program\n\n  Yesterday was a historic day. Almost 6 years after the Senate \nIntelligence Committee voted to conduct a study of the CIA's detention \nand interrogation program and nearly 2 years after approving the \nreport, the American people will finally know the truth about a very \ndark chapter in our Nation's history.\n  My goal from the start has been twofold. First, I have been committed \nto correcting the public record on the CIA's multiple \nmisrepresentations to the American people, to other agencies in the \nexecutive branch, the White House, and to Congress. Second, my goal has \nbeen to ensure that the full truth comes out about this grim time in \nthe history of the CIA and of our Nation so that neither the CIA nor \nany future administration repeats the grievous mistakes this important \noversight work reveals.\n  The process of compiling, drafting, redacting, and now releasing this \nreport has been much harder than it needed to be. It brings no one joy \nto discuss the CIA's brutal and appalling use of torture or the \nunprecedented actions that some in the intelligence community and \nadministration have taken in order to cover up the truth.\n  A number of my colleagues who have come to the floor over the past 24 \nhours and discussed this report have referred to 9/11. I, too, will \nnever forget the fear, the pain, and the anger we all felt on that day \nand in the days that followed. Americans were demanding action from our \ngovernment to keep us safe. Everyone, myself included, wanted to go to \nthe ends of the Earth to hunt down the terrorists who attacked our \nNation and to make every effort to prevent another attack. Although we \nall shared that goal, this report reveals how the CIA crossed a line \nand took our country to a place where we violated our moral and legal \nobligations in the name of keeping us safe. As we know now, this was a \nfalse choice. Torture didn't keep us safer after all. By releasing the \nIntelligence Committee's landmark report, we reaffirm we are a nation \nthat does not hide from its past but must learn from it and that an \nhonest examination of our shortcomings is not a sign of weakness but \nthe strength of our great Republic.\n\n  From the heavily redacted version of the executive summary first \ndelivered to the committee by the CIA in August, we made significant \nprogress in clearing away the thick, obfuscating fog these redactions \nrepresented.\n  As Chairwoman Feinstein has said, our committee chipped away at over \n400 areas of disagreement with the administration on redactions down to \njust a few.\n  We didn't make all the progress we wanted to and the redaction \nprocess itself is filled with unwarranted and completely unnecessary \nobstacles. Unfortunately, at the end of the day, what began as a \nbipartisan effort on the committee did not end as such, even after my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle were repeatedly urged to \nparticipate with us as partners.\n  As my friends in the Senate know, I am a legislator who goes out of \nhis way to form bipartisan consensus. However, it became clear that was \nnot possible here and that is regrettable.\n  But all told, after reviewing this final version of the committee's \nstudy, I believe it accomplishes the goals I laid out and it tells the \nstory that needs to be told.\n  It also represents a significant and essential step for restoring \nfaith in the crucial role of Congress to conduct oversight. \nCongressional oversight is important to all of government's activities, \nbut it is especially important for those parts of the government that \noperate in secret, as the Church Committee discovered decades ago. The \nchallenge the Church Committee members discovered are still with us \ntoday: how to ensure that secret government actions are conducted \nwithin the confines of the law. The release of this executive summary \nis testament to the power of oversight and the determination of \nChairman Feinstein and the members of this committee to doggedly beat \nback obstacle after obstacle in order to reveal the truth.\n  There are a number of thank-yous that are in order. I start by \nthanking the chairman for her courage and persistence. I also thank the \ncommittee staff director, David Grannis; the staff lead for the study, \nDan Jones; and his core study team, Evan Gottesman and Chad Tanner. \nThey toiled for nearly 6 years to complete this report. They then \nshepherded it through the redaction process, all the while giving up \ntheir nights, weekends, vacations, and precious time with family and \nfriends in an effort to get to the truth of this secret program for the \nmembers of the committee, the Senate, and now the American people.\n  They have been assisted by other dedicated staff, including my \ndesignee on the committee, Jennifer Barrett. We would not be where we \nare today without them. I am grateful, beyond words, for their service \nand dedication. I want them to know our country is grateful too.\n  Let me turn to the study itself. Much has been written about the \nsignificance of the study. This is the study. It is a summary of the \nCIA's detention and interrogation program. I want to start by saying I \nbelieve the vast majority of CIA officers welcome oversight and believe \nin the checks and balances that form the very core of our Constitution.\n  I believe many rank-and-file CIA officers have fought internally for \nand supported the release of this report. Unfortunately, again and \nagain, these hard-working public servants have been poorly served by \nthe CIA's leadership. Too many CIA leaders and senior officials have \nfought to bury the truth while using a redaction pen to further hide \nthis dark chapter of the Agency's history.\n  The document we released yesterday is the definitive, official \nhistory of what happened in the CIA's detention and interrogation \nprogram. It is based on more than 6 million pages of CIA and other \ndocuments, emails, cables, and interviews. This 500-page study, this \ndocument, encapsulates the facts drawn from the 6,700-page report, \nwhich is backed up by 38,000 footnotes.\n\n[[Page S6475]]\n\n  This is a documentary that tells of the program's history based on \nthe CIA's own internal records. Its prose is dry and spare, as you will \nsoon see for yourself. It was put together methodically, without \nexaggeration or embellishment. This study by itself--using the CIA's \nown words--brings the truth to light, and that is what it was intended \nto do.\n\n  The study looked carefully at the CIA's own claims--most notably that \nthe so-called enhanced interrogation techniques used on detainees \nelicited unique, otherwise unobtainable intelligence that disrupted \nterrorist plots and saved lives. It debunks those claims conclusively.\n  The CIA repeatedly claimed that using these enhanced interrogation \ntechniques against detainees was the only way to yield critical \ninformation about terrorist plotting. But when asked to describe this \ncritical information and detail which plots were thwarted, the CIA \nprovided exaggerated versions of plots and misattributed information \nthat was obtained from traditional intelligence collection, claiming it \ncame from the use of interrogation techniques that are clearly torture.\n  This study shows that torture was not effective, that it led to \nfabricated information, and its use--even in secret--undermined our \nsecurity and our country more broadly. Our use of torture and I believe \nthe failure to truly acknowledge it continues to impair America's moral \nleadership and influence around the world, creates distrust among our \npartners, puts Americans abroad in danger, and helps our enemies' \nrecruitment efforts.\n  Senior CIA leaders would have you believe their version of the \ntruth--promoted in CIA-cleared memoirs by former CIA Directors and \nother CIA and White House officials--that while there was some excesses \nin its detention and interrogation program, the CIA did not torture. \nTheir version would have you believe that the CIA's program was \nprofessionally conducted, employing trained interrogators to use so-\ncalled enhanced interrogation techniques on only the most hardened and \ndangerous terrorists.\n  But as Professor Darius Rejali writes in his book ``Torture and \nDemocracy,'' ``To think professionalism is a guard against causing \nexcessive pain is an illusion. Instead, torture breaks down \nprofessionalism'' and corrupts the organizations that use it.\n  This is exactly what happened with the CIA's detention and \ninterrogation program. Without proper acknowledgement of these truths \nby the CIA and the White House, it could well happen again.\n  In light of the President's early Executive order disavowing torture, \nhis own recent acknowledgement that ``we tortured some folks'' and the \nAssistant Secretary of State Malinowski's statements last month to the \nU.N. Committee Against Torture that ``we hope to lead by example'' in \ncorrecting our mistakes, one would think this administration is leading \nthe efforts to right the wrongs of the past and ensure the American \npeople learn the truth about the CIA's torture program. Not so.\n  In fact, it has been nearly a 6-year struggle--in a Democratic \nadministration no less--to get this study out. Why has it been so hard \nfor this document to finally see the light of day? Why have we had to \nfight tooth and nail every step of the way? The answer is simple: \nBecause the study says things that former and current CIA and other \ngovernment officials don't want the American public to know. For a \nwhile I worried that this administration would succeed in keeping this \nstudy entirely under wraps.\n  While the study clearly shows that the CIA's detention and \ninterrogation program itself was deeply flawed, the deeper, more \nendemic problem lies in the CIA, assisted by a White House that \ncontinues to try to cover up the truth. It is this deeper problem that \nillustrates the challenge we face today: reforming an agency that \nrefuses to even acknowledge what it has done. This is a continuing \nchallenge that the CIA's oversight committees need to take on in a \nbipartisan way. Those who criticize the committee's study for overly \nfocusing on the past should understand that its findings directly \nrelate to how the CIA operates today.\n  For an example of how the CIA has repeated its same past mistakes in \nmore recent years, look at the section of the executive summary \nreleased yesterday that deals with the intelligence on the courier that \nled to Osama bin Laden. That operation took place under this \nadministration in May of 2011. After it was over, the CIA coordinated \nto provide misinformation to the White House and its oversight \ncommittees suggesting the CIA torture program was the tipoff \ninformation for the courier. That is 100 percent wrong and signifies \nthe Agency leadership's persistent and entrenched culture of \nmisrepresenting the truth to Congress and the American people. This \nexample also illustrates again the dangers of not reckoning with the \npast. So while I agree with my colleagues on the committee who argue \nthat doing oversight in real time is critical, I believe we cannot turn \na blind eye to the past when the same problems are staring us in the \nface in the present. Oversight by willful ignorance is not oversight at \nall.\n  In Chairman Feinstein's landmark floor speech earlier this year, she \nlaid out how the CIA pushed back on our committee's oversight efforts. \nThanks to her speech, we know about the history of the CIA's \ndestruction of interrogation videotapes and about what motivated her \nand her colleagues to begin the broader committee study in 2009. We \nknow about the CIA's insistence on providing documents to the committee \nin a CIA-leased facility and the millions of dollars the CIA spent on \ncontractors hired to read, multiple times, each of the 6 million pages \nof documents produced before providing them to the committee staff. We \nknow about the nearly 1,000 documents that the CIA electronically \nremoved from the committee's dedicated database on two occasions in \n2010, which the CIA claimed its personnel did at the direction of the \nWhite House. Of course we know about the Panetta review.\n  I turn to the Panetta review. I have provided more information on the \nevents that led up to the revelation included in the Panetta review in \na set of additional views that I submitted for the committee's \nexecutive summary, but I will summarize them.\n  From the beginning of his term as CIA Director, John Brennan was \nopenly hostile toward and dismissive of the committee's oversight and \nits efforts to review the detention and interrogation program. During \nhis confirmation hearing, I obtained a promise from John Brennan that \nhe would meet with committee staff on the study once confirmed. After \nhis confirmation, he changed his mind.\n  In December 2012, when the classified study was approved in a \nbipartisan vote, the committee asked the White House to coordinate any \nexecutive branch comments prior to declassification. The White House \nprovided no comment. Instead, the CIA responded for the executive \nbranch nearly 7 months later, on June 27, 2013.\n  The CIA's formal response to the study under Director Brennan clings \nto false narratives about the CIA's effectiveness when it comes to the \nCIA's detention and interrogation program. It includes many factual \ninaccuracies, defends the use of torture, and attacks the committee's \noversight and findings. I believe its flippant and dismissive tone \nrepresents the CIA's approach to oversight--and the White House's \nwillingness to let the CIA do whatever it likes--even if its efforts \nare armed at actively undermining the President's stated policies.\n  It would be a significant disservice to let the Brennan response \nspeak for the CIA. Thankfully, it does not have to. There are some CIA \nofficials and officers willing to tell it straight. In late 2013, then-\nCIA General Counsel Stephen Preston answered a series of questions that \nI asked about his thoughts on the Brennan response as part of his Armed \nServices Committee nomination hearing to be General Counsel of the \nDefense Department.\n  His answers to the questions about the program contrasted sharply \nwith the Brennan response. For instance, he stated matter of factly \nthat from his review of the facts, the CIA provided the committee with \ninaccurate information regarding the detention and interrogation \nprogram. I have posted on line my questions to Mr. Preston, along with \nhis answers.\n  Stephen Preston was not alone in having the moral courage to speak \nfrankly and truthfully about the CIA's\n\n[[Page S6476]]\n\ntorture program. There were also other CIA officers willing to document \nthe truth. In March 2009, then-CIA Director Leon Panetta announced the \nformation of a Director's review group to look at the agency's \ndetention and interrogation program. As he stated at the time, ``The \nsafety of the American people depends on our ability to learn lessons \nfrom the past while staying focused on the threats of today and \ntomorrow.''\n  The Director's review group looked at the same CIA documents that \nwere being provided to our committee. They produced a series of \ndocuments that became the Panetta review. As I discussed in late 2013, \nthe Panetta review corroborates many of the significant findings of the \ncommittee's study. Moreover, the Panetta review frankly acknowledges \nsignificant problems and errors made in the CIA's detention and \ninterrogation program. Many of these same errors are denied or \nminimized in the Brennan response.\n  As Chairman Feinstein so eloquently outlined in her floor speech on \nMarch 11 of this year, drafts of the Panetta review have been provided \nby the CIA unknowingly to our committee staff years before within the 6 \nmillion pages of documents it had provided.\n  So when the committee received the Brennan response, I expected a \nrecognition of errors and a clear plan to ensure that the mistakes \nidentified would not be repeated again. Instead--this is a crucial \npoint--instead, the CIA continued not only to defend the program and \ndeny any wrongdoing but also to deny its own conclusions to the \ncontrary found in the Panetta review.\n  In light of those clear factual disparities between the Brennan \nresponse and the Panetta review, committee staff grew concerned that \nthe CIA was knowingly providing inaccurate information to the committee \nin the present day, which is a serious offense, and a deeply troubling \nmatter for the committee, the Congress, the White House, and our \ncountry.\n  The Panetta review was evidence of that potential offense. So to \npreserve that evidence, committee staff securely transported a printed \nportion of the Panetta review from the CIA-leased facility to the \ncommittee's secure offices in the Senate. This was the proper and right \nthing to do, not only because of the seriousness of the potential \ncrime, but also in light of the fact that the CIA had previously \ndestroyed interrogation videotapes without authorization and over \nobjections of officials in the Bush White House.\n  In my view, the Panetta review is a smoking gun. It raises \nfundamental questions about why a review the CIA conducted internally \nyears ago and never provided to the committee is so different from the \nofficial Brennan response and so different from the public statements \nof former CIA officials. That is why I asked for a complete copy of the \nPanetta review at a December 2013 Intelligence Committee hearing.\n  Although the committee now has a portion of the review already in its \npossession, I believed then, as I do now, that it is important to make \npublic its existence and to obtain a full copy of the report. That is \nwhy I am here today, to disclose some of its key findings and \nconclusions on the Senate floor for the public record, which fly \ndirectly in the face of claims made by senior CIA officials past and \npresent.\n  For example, as I mentioned earlier, on a number of key matters, the \nPanetta review directly refutes information in the Brennan response. In \nthe few instances in which the Brennan response acknowledges \nimprecision or mischaracterization relative to the detention \ninterrogation program, the Panetta review is refreshingly free of \nexcuses, qualifications, or caveats.\n  The Panetta review found that the CIA repeatedly provided inaccurate \ninformation to the Congress, the President, and the public on the \nefficacy of its coercive techniques. The Brennan response, in contrast, \ncontinues to insist the CIA's interrogations produced unique \nintelligence that saved lives. Yet the Panetta review identified dozens \nof documents that include inaccurate information used to justify the \nuse of torture and indicates that the inaccuracies it identifies do not \nrepresent an exhaustive list. The Panetta review further describes how \ndetainees provided intelligence prior to the use of torture against \nthem.\n  It describes how the CIA, contrary to its own representations, often \ntortured detainees before trying any other approach. It describes how \nthe CIA tortured detainees, even when less coercive methods were \nyielding intelligence. The Panetta review further identifies cases in \nwhich the CIA used coercive techniques when it had no basis for \ndetermining whether a detainee had critical intelligence at all.\n  In other words, CIA personnel tortured detainees to confirm they did \nnot have intelligence, not because they thought they did. Again, while \na small portion of this review is preserved in our committee spaces, I \nhave requested the full document. Our request has been denied by \nDirector Brennan. I will tell you, the Panetta review is much more than \na ``summary'' and ``incomplete drafts,'' which is the way Mr. Brennan \nand former CIA officials have characterized it, in order to minimize \nits significance. I have reviewed this document. It is as significant \nand relevant as it gets.\n  The refusal to provide the full Panetta review and the refusal to \nacknowledge facts detailed in both the committee study and the Panetta \nreview lead to one disturbing finding: Director Brennan and the CIA \ntoday are continuing to willfully provide inaccurate information and \nmisrepresent the efficacy of torture. In other words, the CIA is lying. \nThis is not a problem of the past but a problem that needs to be dealt \nwith today.\n  Let me turn to the search of the Intelligence Committee's computers. \nClearly the present leadership of the CIA agrees with me that the \nPanetta review is a smoking gun. That is the only explanation for the \nCIA's unauthorized search of the committee's dedicated computers in \nJanuary. The CIA 's illegal search was conducted out of concern that \nthe committee staff was provided with the Panetta review. It \ndemonstrates how far the CIA will go to keep its secrets safe. Instead \nof asking the committee if it had access to the Panetta review, the CIA \nsearched, without authorization or notification, the committee \ncomputers that the agency had agreed were off limits.\n\n  In so doing, the agency might have violated multiple provisions of \nthe Constitution as well as Federal criminal statutes and Executive \nOrder 12333.\n  More troubling, despite admitting behind closed doors to the \ncommittee that the CIA conducted the search, Director Brennan publicly \nreferred to ``spurious allegations about CIA actions that are wholly \nunsupported by the facts.''\n  He even said such allegations of computer hacking were beyond ``the \nscope of reason.'' The CIA then made a criminal referral to the \nDepartment of Justice against the committee staff who were working on \nthe study. Chairman Feinstein believed these actions were an effort to \nintimidate the committee staff, the very staff charged with CIA \noversight. I strongly agree with her point of view.\n  The CIA's inspector general subsequently opened an investigation into \nthe CIA's unauthorized search and found, contrary to Director Brennan's \npublic protestations, that a number of CIA employees did, in fact, \nimproperly access the committee's dedicated computers. The \ninvestigation found no basis for the criminal referral on the committee \nstaff. The IG also found that the CIA personnel involved demonstrated a \n``lack of candor'' about their activities to the inspector general.\n  However, only a 1-page unclassified summary of the IG's report is \npublicly available. The longer classified version was only provided \nbriefly to Members when it was first released. I had to push hard to \nget the CIA to provide a copy for the committee to keep in its own \nrecords. Even the copy in committee records is restricted to committee \nmembers and only two staff members, not including my staff member.\n  After having reviewed the IG report myself again recently, I believe \neven more strongly that the full report should be declassified and \npublicly released, in part because Director Brennan still refuses to \nanswer the committee's questions about the search.\n  In March, the committee voted unanimously to request responses from \nDirector Brennan about the computer search. The chairman and vice \nchairman wrote a letter to Director Brennan, who promised a thorough \nresponse\n\n[[Page S6477]]\n\nto their questions after the Justice Department and CIA IG reviews were \ncomplete. The Chair and Vice Chair then wrote two more letters, to no \navail. The Director has refused to answer any questions on this topic \nand has again deferred his answers, this time until after the CIA's \ninternal accountability board review is completed, if it ever is.\n  So from March until December, for almost 9 months, Director Brennan \nhas flat out refused to answer basic questions about the computer \nsearch; whether he suggested a search or approved it; if not, who did. \nHe has refused to explain why the search was conducted, its legal \nbasis, or whether he was even aware of the agreement between the \ncommittee and the CIA laying out protections of the committee's \ndedicated computer system. He has refused to say whether the computers \nwere searched more than once, whether the CIA monitored committee staff \nat the CIA-leased facility, whether the agency ever entered the \ncommittee's secure room at the facility, and who at the CIA knew about \nthe search both before and after it occurred.\n  I want to turn at this point to the White House. To date, there has \nbeen no accountability for the CIA's actions or for Director Brennan's \nfailure of leadership. Despite the facts presented, the President has \nexpressed full confidence in Director Brennan and demonstrated that \ntrust by making no effort at all to rein him in.\n  The President stated it was not appropriate for him to weigh into \nthese issues that exist between the committee and the CIA. As I said at \nthe time, the committee should be able to do its oversight work \nconsistent with our constitutional principle of the separation of \npowers, without the CIA posing impediments or obstacles as it has and \nas it continues to do today. For the White House not to have recognized \nthis principle and the gravity of the CIA's actions deeply troubles me \ntoday and continues to trouble me.\n\n  Far from being a disinterested observer in the committee-CIA battles, \nthe White House has played a central role from the start. If former CIA \nDirector Panetta's memoir is to be believed, the President was unhappy \nabout Director Panetta's initial agreement in 2009 to allow staff \naccess to operation cables and other sensitive documents about the \ntorture program.\n  Assuming its accuracy, Mr. Panetta's account describes then-\nCounterterrorism Adviser John Brennan and current Chief of Staff Denis \nMcDonough--both of whom have been deeply involved in the study \nredaction process--as also deeply unhappy about this expanded \noversight.\n  There are more questions that need answers about the role of the \nWhite House in the committee's study.\n  For example, there are the 9,400 documents that were withheld from \nthe committee by the White House in the course of the review of the \nmillions of documents, despite the fact that these documents are \ndirectly responsive to the committee's document request. The White \nHouse has never made a formal claim of executive privilege over the \ndocuments, yet it has failed to respond to the chairman's request to \nthe documents or to compromise proposals she has offered to review a \nsummary listing of them. When I asked CIA General Counsel Stephen \nPreston about the documents, he noted that ``the Agency has deferred to \nthe White House and has not been substantially involved in subsequent \ndiscussions about the disposition of these documents.''\n  If the documents are privileged, the White House should assert that \nclaim. But if they are not, White House officials need to explain why \nthey pulled back documents that the CIA believed were relevant to the \ncommittee's investigation and responsive to our direct request.\n  The White House has not led on this issue in the manner we expected \nwhen we heard the President's campaign speeches in 2008 and read the \nExecutive order he issued in January 2009. To CIA employees in April \n2009, President Obama said:\n\n       What makes the United States special, and what makes you \n     special, is precisely the fact that we are willing to uphold \n     our values and ideals even when it's hard--not just when it's \n     easy; even when we are afraid and under threat--not just when \n     it's expedient to do so. That's what makes us different.\n\n  This tough, principled talk set an important tone from the beginning \nof his Presidency. However, let's fast forward to this year, after so \nmuch has come to light about the CIA's barbaric programs, and President \nObama's response was that we ``crossed a line'' as a nation and that \n``hopefully, we don't do it again in the future.''\n  That is not good enough. We need to be better than that. There can be \nno coverup. There can be no excuses. If there is no moral leadership \nfrom the White House helping the public to understand that the CIA's \ntorture program wasn't necessary and didn't save lives or disrupt \nterrorist plots, then what is to stop the next White House and CIA \nDirector from supporting torture.\n  Finally, the White House has not led on transparency, as then Senator \nObama promised in 2007. He said then this:\n\n       We'll protect sources and methods, but we won't use sources \n     and methods as pretexts to hide the truth. Our history \n     doesn't belong to Washington, it belongs to America.\n\n  In 2009 consistent with this promise, President Obama issued \nExecutive Order 13526, which clarified that information should be \nclassified to protect sources and methods but not to obscure key facts \nor cover up embarrassing or illegal acts.\n  But actions speak louder than words. This administration, like so \nmany before, has released information only when forced to by a leak or \nby a court order or by an oversight committee.\n  The redactions to the committee's executive summary on the CIA's \ndetention and interrogation program have been a case study in its \nrefusal to be open. Despite requests that both the chairman and I made \nfor the White House alone to lead the declassification process, it was \ngiven by the White House to the CIA--the same Agency that is the focus \nof this report. Predictably, the redacted version that came back to the \ncommittee in August obscured key facts and undermined key findings and \nconclusions of the study.\n  The CIA also included unnecessary redactions to previously \nacknowledged and otherwise unclassified information. Why? Presumably, \nto make it more difficult for the public to understand the study's \nfindings. Content that the CIA has attempted to redact includes \ninformation in the official, declassified report of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, other executive branch declassified official \ndocuments, information in books and speeches delivered by former CIA \nofficers who were approved by the CIA's Publication Review Board, news \narticles, and other public reports.\n  It is true that through negotiations between the committee, the CIA, \nand the White House, many of these issues were resolved. However, at \nthe end of the day, the White House and CIA would not agree to include \nany pseudonyms in the study to disguise the names of CIA officers. In \n2009 the CIA and the committee had agreed to use CIA-provided \npseudonyms for CIA officials, but in the summary's final version, the \nCIA insisted that even the pseudonyms should be redacted.\n  For an agency concerned about morale, this is the wrong approach to \ntake, in my view. By making it less possible to follow a narrative \nthreat throughout the summary, this approach effectively throws many \nCIA personnel under the bus. It tars all of the CIA personnel by making \nit appear that the CIA writ large was responsible for developing, \nimplementing, and representing the truth about the CIA's detention and \ninterrogation program. In fact, a small number of CIA officers were \nlargely responsible.\n\n  Further, there is no question that the identities of undercover \nagents must be protected, but it is unprecedented for the CIA to \ndemand--and the White House to agree--that every CIA officer's \npseudonym in the study be blacked out. U.S. Government agencies have \nused pseudonyms to protect officers' identities in any number of past \nreports, including the 9/11 Commission report, the investigation of the \nAbu Ghraib detention facility, and the report of the Iran-Contra \naffair.\n  We asked the CIA to identify any influences in the summary wherein a \nCIA official mentioned by pseudonym would result in the outing of any \nCIA undercover officer, and they could not provide any such examples.\n  Why do I focus on this? The CIA's insistence on blacking out even the \nfake\n\n[[Page S6478]]\n\nnames of its officers is problematic because the study is less readable \nand has lost some of its narrative thread.\n  But as the chairman has said, we will find ways to bridge that gap. \nThe tougher problem to solve is how to ensure that this and future \nadministrations follow President Obama's pledge not to use sources and \nmethods as pretexts to hide the truth.\n  What needs to be done? Chairman Feinstein predicted in March--at the \nheight of the frenzy over the CIA's spying on committee-dedicated \ncomputers--that ``our oversight will prevail,'' and generally speaking, \nit has. Much of the truth is out, thanks to the chairman's persistence \nand the dedicated staff involved in this effort. It is, indeed, a \nhistoric event.\n  But there is still no accountability, and despite Director Brennan's \npledges to me in January 2013, there is still no correction of the \npublic record of the inaccurate information the CIA has spread for \nyears and continues to stand behind. The CIA has lied to its overseers \nand the public, destroyed and tried to hold back evidence, spied on the \nSenate, made false charges against our staff, and lied about torture \nand the results of torture. And no one has been held to account.\n  Torture just didn't happen, after all. Contrary to the President's \nrecent statement, ``we'' didn't torture some folks. Real actual people \nengaged in torture. Some of these people are still employed by the CIA \nand the U.S. Government. There are, right now, people serving in high-\nlevel positions at the Agency who approved, directed or committed acts \nrelated to the CIA's detention and interrogation program. It is bad \nenough not to prosecute these officials, but to reward or promote them \nand risk the integrity of the U.S. Government to protect them is \nincomprehensible.\n  The President needs to purge his administration of high-level \nofficials who were instrumental to the development and running of this \nprogram. He needs to force a cultural change at the CIA.\n  The President also should support legislation limiting interrogation \nto noncoercive techniques--to ensure that his own Executive order is \ncodified and to prevent a future administration from developing its own \ntorture program.\n  The President must ensure the Panetta review is declassified and \npublicly released.\n  The full 6,800-page study of the CIA's detention and interrogation \nprogram should be declassified and released.\n  There also needs to be accountability for the CIA spying on its \noversight committee, and the CIA inspector general's report needs to be \ndeclassified and released to the public.\n  A key lesson I have learned from my experience with the study is the \nimportance of the role of Congress in overseeing the intelligence \ncommunity. It is always easier to accept what we are told at face value \nthan it is to ask tough questions. If we rely on others to tell us what \nis behind their own curtain instead of taking a look for ourselves, we \ncan't know for certain what is there.\n  This isn't at all to say that what the committee found in its study \nis a culture and behavior we should ascribe to all employees of the CIA \nor to the intelligence community. The intelligence community is made up \nof thousands of hard-working patriotic Americans. These women and men \nare consummate professionals who risk their lives every day to keep us \nsafe and to provide the their best assessments regardless of political \nand policy considerations.\n  But it is incumbent on government leaders--it is incumbent on us--to \nlive up to the dedication of these employees and to make them proud of \nthe institutions they work for. It gives me no pleasure to say this, \nbut as I have said before, for Director Brennan that means resigning. \nFor the next CIA director that means immediately correcting the false \nrecord and instituting the necessary reforms to restore the CIA's \nreputation for integrity and analytical rigor.\n  The CIA cannot not be its best until it faces its serious and \ngrievous mistakes of the detention and interrogation program. For \nPresident Obama, that means taking real action to live up to the \npledges he made early in his Presidency.\n  Serving on the Senate Intelligence Committee for the past 4 years \nopened my eyes and gave me a much deeper appreciation of the importance \nof our role in the balancing of power in our great government. It also \nhelped me understand that all Members of Congress, not only \nIntelligence Committee members, have an opportunity and an obligation \nto exercise their oversight powers.\n  Members who do not serve on the Intelligence Committee can ask to \nread classified documents, call for classified briefings, and submit \nclassified questions.\n  This is my challenge today to the American people. Urge your Member \nof Congress to be engaged, to get classified briefings, and to help \nkeep the intelligence community accountable. This is the only way that \nsecret government and democracy can coexist.\n  We have so much to be proud of in our great Nation, and one of those \nmatters of pride is our commitment to admit mistakes, correct past \nactions, and move forward knowing that we are made stronger when we \nrefuse to be bound by the past.\n  We have always been a forward-looking Nation, but to be so we must be \nmindful of our own history. That is what this study is all about. So I \nhave no doubt that we will emerge from a dark episode with our \ndemocracy strengthened and our future made brighter.\n  It has been an honor to serve on this committee, and I will miss \ndoing its important work more than I can say.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                         Farewell to the Senate\n\n  Mr. WALSH. Madam President, I rise today to speak to this body and my \nfellow Montanans about service.\n  In preparing to leave the Senate, I add my voice to the voices of \nmany other departing Members who have called for a return to civility \nin Washington, DC. Politics today is too full of pettiness. Public \nservants--you and I, as well as those elected to serve in the next \nCongress--should set the standard with better words and better actions, \nbut we should also lead from the front. I am not saying anything that \nhasn't already been said, but more of us need to say it. If we are \nlucky, which we are, we are even blessed to stand in this room and do \nwhat we do on behalf of our fellow citizens.\n  Everyone in this Chamber has a unique story about their roots and \ntheir path to public service. Mine began in Butte, MT. I was the son of \na union pipefitter in a struggling blue-collar town, and my path led to \nthe military. I enlisted out of high school in the Montana National \nGuard and soon found a career serving my neighbors and family.\n  The National Guard--the great citizen wing of our Armed Forces--was a \nhome for me. Leading my fellow soldiers into combat in Iraq in 2004-\n2005 was a defining experience in my life. Overseeing two successful \nelections for the Iraqis added a new perspective to my view on \ndemocracy. Fighting insurgents drove home how fortunate we are to live \nin the United States of America and to enjoy the freedoms we often take \nfor granted.\n  The men of Task Force GRIZ who unfortunately didn't come home with me \nand the men and women who came back with visible and invisible wounds \nhave truly defined the cost of war for me, and they remind me every \nsingle day of the cost of public servants getting it wrong when it \ncomes to our national defense. I have devoted much of my professional \nlife since returning home to accounting for the true cost of war.\n  Today, from my perspective, the debts are stacked against the \ndemocratic process in America in many ways. There is too much money, \ntoo much noise, and too little commitment to finding common ground. \nAnonymous money masquerading as free speech can poison campaigns. It \nsilences the voices of the majority of American citizens. The \nconcentration of wealth in fewer hands is bad for our society, just as \nthe ability for a handful of the wealthy to carry the loudest \nmegaphones in our elections is bad for our democracy. Elections are \nstarting to look much like auctions. Dark money and circus politics \nshouldn't prevent the U.S. Senate from honorably living up to the power \nwe have been given.\n  Growing up in a little house that shook twice a day from the dynamite\n\n[[Page S6479]]\n\nblasts at the copper mine nearby, I never thought I would be involved \nin public service. I aspired to have a decent job. I aspired to get an \neducation. I aspired to having the time to fish the lakes and streams I \nfished with my father. Just the normal stuff. And that normal stuff is \nwhat I think most Americans still want today and too often can't \nachieve.\n  Public service--becoming a soldier--was my ticket to a better life: a \njob and a college education. After only a small taste, I discovered \nthat I loved public service. I loved being devoted to something bigger \nthan myself.\n  We should all remember that Congress can always use more Americans \nfrom more walks of life who have discovered public service through \nunlikely means.\n  It is the privilege of my life to serve the people of Montana in the \nseat of Senators Lee Metcalf and Max Baucus. Lee, along with Mike \nMansfield, was my Senator while I was growing up in Butte, MT. The \ngreat citizen conservationist Cecil Garland said:\n\n       It was typical of Lee to fight to give the little guy a \n     voice in government decisions.\n\n  In my time in this Chamber, I have tried to follow Lee's example.\n  The people who need a voice in this Chamber are the ranchers and \nhardware store owners like Cecil in towns like Lincoln and Dillon. The \nperson who needs a voice in this Chamber is the mother in Troy, MT, who \nbecame the primary bread winner when her husband lost his job cutting \ntimber. The person who needs a voice here is the young woman in Shelby, \nMT, who has done everything right--studied hard and earned her degree--\nonly to be squeezed by too much student debt and too few opportunities. \nThe people who need voices are the servicemembers from Laurel and Great \nFalls, MT, who returned from the war in Afghanistan and Iraq with \ndelayed onset PTSD and have fallen through the cracks at the VA. They \nare the entrepreneurs in Big Fork and Bozeman, MT, who have opened \nsmall distilleries and faced the tangle of redtape. They are the \ncommitted couples across Montana--your neighbors, my family, my \nfriends--who are treated like second-class citizens because of whom \nthey love.\n  So today I urge my colleagues to lend people like this in each of \nyour States your voice as a Senator in this Chamber.\n  I am humbled by the number of challenges that face the next Congress. \nI urge my colleagues to continue to fight to protect Americans' civil \nliberties. I leave the Senate dismayed by the scope of government \nsurveillance in our everyday life. Congress must always--and I \nemphasize always--protect the privacy of our citizens.\n  I remain deeply concerned about the National Security Agency's \nunconstitutional spying on Americans' communications, the secret \nbackdoors into the Department of Commerce encryption standards, and the \ngag orders under the FBI national security letter program.\n  I urge my colleagues to continue fighting for rural America. We need \nstronger voting rights and more jobs in Indian Country to promote \ntribal sovereignty and prosperity. We need to keep our farm safety net \nstrong and address brucellosis to protect the livestock industry. We \nneed a stronger commitment to fund and reform the Payment in Lieu of \nTaxes Program and its sister programs. Small county budgets, schools, \nand roads depend on them. These same rural communities need better \nmanagement of our national forests--something Congress and the Forest \nService need to focus on.\n\n  We need an honest conversation and urgent solutions to the incredible \nchallenge posed by climate change. As I said earlier from this same \npodium, we cannot put our heads in the sand and continue with business \nas usual.\n  Members of Congress should be taking responsibility and upholding the \noaths we all swore. We should agree with science--climate change is a \nclear enemy, and Congress must take steps to stop it.\n  The next Congress should be thoughtful about women and families--from \nhealth care decisions to paycheck fairness.\n  Finally, I implore all of Congress, all of you, to redouble your \nattention to the crisis of suicide among our veterans. Yesterday the \nHouse of Representatives passed the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for \nAmerican Veterans Act. That bill now sits before this body, and we have \nan opportunity to act. We have an opportunity to pass it. I mentioned \nthe invisible wounds of war already, but if this country were losing 22 \nservicemembers a day on the battlefield, Americans would be on the \nstreets protesting. Congress would be demanding action. But that is \nexactly the number of veterans who die by suicide each and every day \nfrom across our country. Veteran suicide is an urgent crisis facing our \ncommunities, and congressional action is long overdue.\n  I believe extending the eligibility for combat veterans at the VA is \none essential way to address delayed-onset PTSD and reduce the suicide \nrate among our veterans. This simple fix and other solutions that \nimprove access to mental health for veterans should continue to be a \ntop priority for the next Congress.\n  It is fitting that in the last days of the 113th Congress, the Senate \nis sending the President a bill that carries on the public lands legacy \nof Senators Lee Metcalf and Max Baucus and the thousands of Montanans \nwho worked together to find common ground.\n  In the words of Randolph Jennings, Senator Rockefeller's predecessor \nfrom West Virginia, Lee ``was a tireless champion of preserving and \nprotecting our nation's natural heritage for succeeding generations to \nuse and enjoy.''\n  After Lee's death, Max and the rest of the Montana delegation carried \non his legacy by passing wilderness designations for the Absaroka-\nBeartooth, Great Bear, and the Lee Metcalf wilderness areas. In the \nsame spirit, I am honored to join Senator Jon Tester and Senator-elect \nSteve Daines in carrying on their legacy by passing the North Fork \nWatershed Protection Act and the Rocky Mountain Front Heritage Act. We \ntook a page from Montanans. We sat down together, and we worked out an \nagreement that protected almost 700,000 acres of the Crown of the \nContinent. This is how democracy should work.\n  Forty-two years after the first citizen-driven wilderness, this week \nCongress is expanding the Scapegoat and Bob Marshall Wilderness areas \nin Montana. Thirty-eight years after the Flathead River was protected \nfrom schemes to dam it and divert it, this week Congress is protecting \nthe Flathead and Glacier National Park forever from efforts to mine it \nand drill it. Montanans came together. Farmers, ranchers, small \nbusiness owners, conservationists, hunters, anglers--all worked \ntogether to find common ground. Montanans went there first, and their \nrepresentatives in Congress followed.\n  When Congress rewards the work of citizens who collaborate, when we \nfinally reach the critical mass in this Chamber to be responsive, that \nis the day we earn the title of ``public servant.'' Montanans can be \nhopeful today that government by them and for them still works. They \ncan still effect change. The Senate still listens and serves.\n  When President Eisenhower left office in 1961, Congress passed \nlegislation at his request that restored his military title. He wanted \nto be remembered as a career soldier rather than the Commander in \nChief.\n  My 33 years in uniform defined my life. I will always be a soldier. \nAs a soldier, as a husband to my wonderful wife Janet, who has been my \npartner for 31 years, and as the proud dad of Michael and Taylor, as \nthe father-in-law to my wonderful daughter-in-law April, and as the \ngrandfather of a little girl named Kennedy, who will inherit this great \nNation, I will return to civilian life with great hope for the United \nStates Senate and for the United States of America.\n  I, along with millions of others, will be watching closely and \nimploring Members in this Chamber to check politics at the door and \ninstead focus on the future. Honor veterans and their families who \nsacrifice so much. Honor seniors who have heard promises from you. \nHonor the most vulnerable amongst us. They are who we always should \nfight for.\n  Madam President, I am forever grateful to have served the people of \nMontana in this building standing side by side with each and every one \nof you. God bless each and every one of you, and may God continue to \nbless the United States of America.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n\n[[Page S6480]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6480-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6480-S6481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEARS 2015 AND 2016\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am about to ask for unanimous consent \nto pass a substitute amendment to the Coast Guard bill. Senator Vitter \nand I hope to get into a bit of a colloquy over it, but first I want to \nexplain what we are doing here.\n  The Coast Guard bill includes the text of S. 2963, a bill that I \nintroduced to permanently eliminate the requirement that small fishing \nboats obtain a permit for discharges incidental to normal operation.\n  This is really important for our small boat fishermen. The bill has \n14 cosponsors. I am very happy that Senator Murkowski is now a \ncosponsor of that important legislation.\n  This substitute that is at the desk includes that permanent fix so \nthat never again do small fishermen have to worry about being subjected \nto these permits.\n  It exempts commercial vessels less than 79 feet from having to get \nthis discharge permit.\n  We first enacted a moratorium on permits in 2008. We have extended it \ntwice. The current moratorium expires next week. If we don't act, these \nsmall vessels will require a permit for the first time. So instead of \nkicking the can down the road again with these moratoria, I think it is \ntime to say, once and for all, these small vessels do not and will \nnever need a permit. I think a temporary moratorium leaves thousands of \nthe boat operators and the fishermen in limbo instead of giving them \npermanent certainty.\n  They are different from large ships that discharge ballast water and \nintroduce harmful invasive species into our coastal waters. That is why \na broad array of groups, including the American Sport Fishing \nAssociation, Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, Marine Retailers \nAssociation of America, the National Marine Manufacturers Association, \nand many others, support this permanent exemption for our small boats.\n  I hope colleagues will support this, but I understand there is \nanother proposal coming forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Commerce Committee be discharged \nfrom further consideration of S. 2444; the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration; that the substitute amendment containing a \npermanent exemption for discharges from small commercial vessels and \nfishing vessels--and that is at the desk--be agreed to; the bill, as \namended, be read three times and passed; the title amendment be agreed \nto; and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  I appreciate the comments of the Senator from California and want to \nwork with her toward a common goal. In that spirit, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator modify her request and agree to the substitute \namendment, which is also at the desk, which includes a 3-year extension \nof the vessel discharge moratorium.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from California so modify her \nrequest?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I reserve the right to object, but I do not intend to \nobject.\n  I wish to say I am going to agree to this 3-year moratorium but I am \na little stunned as to why we are doing this again. We could give these \nsmall boats a permanent exemption. It is an important economic issue.\n  I don't like this approach, but it is the best we can do. I want the \nAmerican people and the fishermen to know we tried so hard to get this \nfixed permanently. But I am glad we have a 3-year moratorium. It is \nbetter than nothing, and I will therefore agree to the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request, as \nmodified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The amendment (No. 3997) in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The bill (S. 2444), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n  The title amendment (No. 3998) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                     (Purpose: To amend the title)\n\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``A bill to authorize \n     appropriations for the Coast Guard for fiscal year 2015, and \n     for other purposes.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I wish to weigh in on this issue, \nbecause it is a critically important issue for my State--for all \ncoastal States, or any State that has commercial fishermen, as my \ncolleague from California and as my colleague from Louisiana know.\n  I appreciate the fact that we have come to a place where we are going \nto save these small fishermen from the potential burden of reporting to \nEPA for any incidental discharge from their vessels for the next 3 \nyears.\n  I need to acknowledge the good work of my friend from California. She \nhas recognized that we began this years ago, back in 2008, when we had \nto work together at that time to get a short-term extension to ensure \nthat our small-vessel owners would not be subjected to these EPA \nrequirements that most people would say: What is this reporting all \nabout?\n  For those who need a little more graphic detail as to what we are \ntalking about, when you take a commercial fishing vessel out, a 45-foot \ncommercial fishing vessel, and you have a good day fishing, there are \nsome salmon guts on the deck, a little bit of slime, and you hose it \noff. That would be an incidental discharge that would be reportable to \nthe EPA. And if you fail to report, you could be subject to civil \npenalties. That is not what we are talking about here.\n  I think it is important to note that we have two leaders here in the \nSenate who perhaps approach some of the EPA issues from a different \nangle. Senator Boxer has been a staunch advocate for making sure that \nwhen we are talking about clean air and clean water, we are complying \nwith those regulations. Senator Vitter has also been a staunch advocate \nfor making sure our small businesses, our jobs, and our economic \nopportunities aren't stymied by these regulations.\n  So the fact that we have two Members coming together to acknowledge \nwe have to do something to ensure these regulations do not impede the \nability of our small fishermen, of our commercial operators in the \nwater--those vessels below 79 feet--that we are not harming them.\n  In my home State of Alaska, we are talking about 8,500 commercial \nfishermen who were most anxious that 8 days from now they were going to \nbe put in a position where they were effectively violating EPA \nregulations, subject to civil penalties, for the simple act of runoff \noff of their decks.\n  So I concur with Senator Boxer, this is something we don't need to be \ngoing from year to year to year to address. We don't need to inject \nthis uncertainty into the operations of our hard-working fishing \nfamilies. We need to have a permanent solution. I want to work with \nthat permanent solution. Senator Vitter has clearly indicated he is \nwilling to help us with that. Senator Thune in Commerce has made that \nclear. We know we have to address the ballast issues. We will do that. \nAnd I am looking forward to being engaged with that in the 114th \nCongress.\n  But for now, I think it is critically important that consensus has \nbeen reached. I acknowledge the good work of both the Senator from \nLouisiana and the Senator from California, and Senator Thune, for \ngetting us to this point where we can take the pressure off of our \nsmall commercial operators and ensure that they can do what they do so \nvery well.\n  I look forward to the next Congress where we are making this \npermanent and, again, where we are dealing with so many of the other \nissues. But I thank my colleagues today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n[[Page S6481]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I want to make sure I thank Senator \nMurkowski and Senator Begich. When I started this, Senator Begich was \nmy first cosponsor and Senator Murkowski made this bipartisan.\n  I think the important thing was that we could have done it \npermanently and I just don't want that lost. We could have done it \npermanently, and we didn't, and that is sad. There are reasons for \nthat. I wasn't born yesterday, as most of you can tell.\n  I know why it wasn't done. People are going to use this as the little \nengine that could to drive some other stuff behind it which is not good \nstuff. I want to see that we can protect our small boats, and I am \ngoing to continue to do that. I hope we will work together as we move \nforward in this new Senate, run by--in the case of the committee I \nproudly chair--Senator Inhofe, who I think will be very good on this \nissue; Senator Thune, who we know is good on this issue.\n  So we have the pieces in place. And whatever objections there were, I \ndon't think they are really objections to the permanency, they are \npolitical objections to try and use this to get some other bad stuff \nattached to it, and I am not going to let that happen, let me tell you \nright now, no way, no how. So whatever someone has in their mind that \nthey are going to connect to this little baby, it isn't going to \nhappen, because we can't do that. We can't take one good thing and \ndestroy it. I am not going to let that happen.\n  Right now we have a 3-year deal put in place. We can breathe easy. If \nI am someone contemplating buying a small boat, this is one less worry \nI have. I could have had it permanently; I have it for 3 years. It is \ntoo bad, but at least I have it, and that is good.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6481-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY AND COMMUNICATIONS INTEGRATION CENTER ACT OF \n                                  2014\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6487-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6487-S6517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PROTECTING VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS ACT OF \n                            2014--Continued\n\n\n                       Coast Guard Authorization\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I will be brief, but I want to thank \nboth Senators on the floor, Senators Boxer and Vitter, for working on \nthis issue. It was critical for Alaska's fishermen and really for \nfishermen across the country. More importantly this will resolve the \nissue with the Coast Guard bill, which is critical to get done for many \nother reasons.\n  First, on the discharge issue, as stated earlier, this is an \nimportant waiver for our fishermen in Alaska. This will ensure that a \nregulation that wasn't going to have any positive impact with regards \nto what they were attempting to do but would have a negative impact in \nregards to our fishermen--giving them a 3-year waiver is exceptional \nbecause every year we would have a 1-year waiver. So a 3-year waiver is \nfantastic, but I agree with Senator Boxer that this should be \npermanent. I would like to watch from the outside in to see how this \ndevelops over the years.\n  The Coast Guard authorization bill was critical to get done. This has \nmany important provisions. As the chair of the committee that dealt \nwith the Coast Guard bill, not only this year but 2 years ago, we have \nbeen successful now at least since I have been chair to ensure the bill \npassed by unanimous consent and not to have big fights over working out \nthe differences. Again, I thank Senator Vitter for his effort, making \nsure we move forward on this piece of legislation.\n  The issue I want to highlight--and then I will close--is that the \nCoast Guard bill is not only important for our fishermen in Alaska, the \n79 feet and under ships, but also many other things. It ensures \nadditional resources for the Arctic and Antarctic and ensures ice-\nbreaking capabilities, including extending the service life of the \ncurrently idled Polar Sea. It enhances vessel safety information \nregarding ice and weather conditions and improves the oil spill \nprevention and response capabilities. It also ensures availability of \nquality childcare for our Coast Guard personnel. We require Coast Guard \npersonnel to go all over this country. Part of it is their families are \nobviously with them and making sure they have quality of life aspects \nthat are important for us to continue to recruit and get the best of \nthe best. It also creates educational and portable career opportunities \nfor Active-Duty Coast Guard spouses and eases the transition for Coast \nGuard personnel into postservice life. It provides inflation adjustment \nfor funding levels for something very important to us in Alaska, the \nCook Inlet Regional Citizens Advisory Committee. This group of citizens \nis involved in ensuring that the community at Cook Inlet--there is a \nlot of oil activity and fishing activity and other types of activities \nthat are in that region--and citizens are engaged in their input. It is \nnot just industry, but it is industry and citizens working together. \nThis ensures that their funding continues and is inflation adjusted for \nthe future. That is important.\n  Lastly, a small item, but it allows the Commandant to issue leases on \ntidelands and submerged lands. That is important because there are \nparcels of property that the Coast Guard controls that are adjacent to \ncommunities, and we need to make sure that there is flexibility for \nthem to do the work they need to do. This piece of legislation was \ncosponsored by Senator Rockefeller, Senators Thune, Rubio, Maria \nCantwell and many others. This truly is a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation and an example of what we do best when we work together.\n  Imagine a piece of legislation such as this, an authorization \nlegislation for one of our large agencies, the Coast Guard, now the \nsecond time happening without a big fight on the floor, without this \nback and forth between the House and Senate, but actually getting the \nwork done so our Coast Guard personnel know they have a budget that \nimproves upon their quality of life issues and in my case in Alaska, \nmaking sure the Arctic is taken care of. We also increased and made \nsure the Coast Guard ongoing replacement programs are there, with $1.5 \nbillion to continue to increase and improve the Coast Guard programs \nfor our country, which is also very important.\n  Again, I want to thank the body, thank the folks on both sides of the \naisle. As chair of the committee, it was my honor to be able to move \nthis forward, but also I want to give a special thanks to all my staff \nmembers who worked on this because without the Senate staff who \nparticipated in this work, we could not have gotten the work done. I \nappreciate that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Madam President. I rise today to express \nstrong concern and opposition to President Obama's Executive amnesty, \nwhich I think is clearly, flat-out illegal and unconstitutional.\n  I announce that because of that I will be voting ``no'' on the \nconfirmation of Loretta Lynch to become Attorney General--because she \nwould directly\n\n[[Page S6488]]\n\nhelp President Obama execute that illegal Executive amnesty, and she \nwould be actively giving him legal cover, if you will--bad legal \nreasoning--used for PR purposes to further that illegal Executive \norder. I urge all my colleagues who share my concern about this illegal \nExecutive amnesty to do the same.\n  I strongly oppose President Obama's recent action for two reasons. \nThe first is I think it is a horrible policy that is going to take a \ndesperate situation of illegal immigration into this country--\na situation that has truly reached crisis proportions, including over \nthe last several months with these new waves, for instance, of illegal \nminors--and make that desperate situation much worse.\n\n  Why do I say that? Well, it is common sense. If you take a big action \nthat is going to reward folks who have participated in that illegal \ncrossing, what do you think you are going to get--more of it or less of \nit? If you reward behavior, you are going to get more of it; if you \npunish or stop behavior, you will get less of it. So on policy grounds, \nthis Executive action--this illegal Executive amnesty for about 5 \nmillion illegal aliens in our country--is going to reward that behavior \nand produce more of it.\n  As we have proved, we don't have adequate protections at the border--\nan adequate system of enforcement in place either at the border or just \nas importantly at the workplace. It is horrible policy that is going to \nmake the situation worse.\n  But the second concern I have is much more fundamental, and it goes \nto the constitutional authority of the President and the fact that this \nis clearly beyond his authority because he is acting contrary to \nstatutory law. The Congress and the President have acted together in \nthe past and laid out statutory law about immigration. This is clearly \ndirectly contrary to statutory law because the President through this \nExecutive action is not simply saying: I am going to refuse to \nprosecute this case or that case or even a broad category of cases. He \nis going even further and saying: I am going to issue work permits to \naffirmatively say that these people can work legally in our country, to \naffirmatively say that employers can hire these people, even though \nthat is directly contrary to all sorts of statutory law on the books \nnow.\n  Every President in the United States has significant powers, \nobviously, and Presidents have the power to fill in the details of \nlegislation when those details are not clear and when they need to do \nso to properly execute the law. But that is completely different from \ndoing something contrary to statutory law, and that is what President \nObama is doing here.\n  Several people directly involved in this--including the Supreme \nCourt, including President Obama, ironically--have made this clear: The \nSupreme Court in the past has recognized that ``over no conceivable \nsubject is the power of Congress more complete'' than over immigration. \nSo the Supreme Court has said that in all subject matters of law across \nthe board, immigration is squarely in the hands of Congress under the \nConstitution.\n  As I said, even more interesting, President Obama in the past, before \nthis illegal Executive order, has said he doesn't have this power. He \nhas repeatedly acknowledged that in the past before he took this \naction. He said: ``This notion that somehow I can just change the laws \nunilaterally is just not true.''\n  Furthermore he said: ``For me to simply, through Executive order \nignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my \nappropriate role as President.''\n  That is what he said when he was defending not taking action before, \nand he was right. Now he has done exactly what he correctly said before \nhe did not have the power to do.\n  As I suggested at the beginning of my remarks, the Attorney General \nis directly related to this immigration issue and this legal \nconstitutional issue. The Attorney General is the top law enforcement \nofficer of the United States. The Attorney General is the top legal \nexpert for the President and for the Federal Government. So I think if \nwe truly believe--as I do and as certainly my Republican colleagues and \nas several Democrats do, based on their public statements--that this \nExecutive action is wrong, is unconstitutional, is illegal, then we \nshould not confirm an Attorney General who is going to further that \nillegal unconstitutional course of action. To me that is very \nstraightforward. This is not just grabbing someone out of the blue. The \nAttorney General is directly--directly--related to these issues of the \nconstitutional bounds of law, the constitutional lines between the \nexecutive and the legislative--and immigration enforcement. Based on \nthat, I will vote no, and I will strongly push against the confirmation \nof Loretta Lynch as attorney general, and I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n\n  If you believe that President Obama's actions are illegal or \nunconstitutional through executive amnesty, then I think you need to \nreach the same conclusion, but the attorney general is directly related \nto these issues of both immigration enforcement and the Constitution.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                            Financial System\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I come to the floor today to ask a \nfundamental question: Who does Congress work for? Does it work for the \nmillionaires, the billionaires, the giant companies with their armies \nof lobbyists and lawyers, or does it work for all the people?\n  People are frustrated with Congress and part of the reason, of \ncourse, is gridlock, but mostly it is because they see a Congress that \nworks just fine for the big guys, but it won't lift a finger to help \nthem. If big companies can deploy armies of lobbyists and lawyers to \nget the Congress to vote for special deals that benefit themselves, \nthen we simply confirm the view of the American people that the system \nis rigged.\n  Now the House of Representatives is about to show us the worst of \ngovernment for the rich and powerful. The House is about to vote on a \nbudget deal--a deal negotiated behind closed doors--that slips in a \nprovision that would let derivative traders on Wall Street gamble with \ntaxpayer money and get bailed out by the government when their risky \nbets threaten to blow up our financial system. These are the same banks \nthat nearly broke the economy in 2008 and destroyed millions of jobs, \nthe same banks that got bailed out by taxpayers and are now raking in \nrecord profits, the same banks that are spending a whole lot of time \nand money trying to influence Congress to bend the rules in their \nfavor.\n  You will hear a lot of folks say that the rule that will be repealed \nin the omnibus is technical and complicated and you shouldn't worry \nabout it because smart people who know more than you do about financial \nissues say it is no big deal. Well, don't believe them. Actually, this \nrule is pretty simple. Here is what it is called--the rule the House is \nabout to repeal, and I am quoting from the text of Dodd-Frank, is \nentitled ``Prohibition Against Federal Government Bailouts of Swaps \nEntities.''\n  What does it do? The provision that is about to be repealed requires \nthe banks to keep separate a key part of their risky Wall Street \nspeculation so there is no government insurance for that part of their \nbusiness. As the New York Times has explained, ``the goal was to \nisolate risky trading and to prevent government bailouts'' because \nthese sorts of risky trades, called derivatives trades, were ``a main \nculprit in the 2008 financial crisis.''\n  We put these rules in place after the collapse of the financial \nsystem because we wanted to reduce the risk that reckless gambling on \nWall Street could ever again threaten jobs and livelihoods on Main \nStreet. We put this rule in place because people of all political \npersuasions were disgusted at the idea of future bailouts. And now, no \ndebate, no discussion, Republicans in the House of Representatives are \nthreatening to shut down the government if they don't get a chance to \nrepeal it.\n  That raises a simple question: Why? If this rule brings more \nstability to our financial system and helps prevent future government \nbailouts, why in the world would anyone want to repeal it, let alone \nhold the entire government hostage in order to ram through this appeal? \nThe reason, unfortunately, is\n\n[[Page S6489]]\n\nsimple--it is about money and power. Because while this legal change \ncould pose serious risks to our entire economy, it will also make a lot \nof money for Wall Street banks.\n  According to Americans for Financial Reform, this change will be a \nhuge boon to a handful of our biggest banks--Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, \nand Bank of America.\n  Wall Street spends a lot of time and money on Congress. Public \nCitizen and the Center for Responsive Politics found that in the runup \nto Dodd-Frank, the financial services sector employed 1,447 former \nFederal employees to carry out their lobbying efforts, including 73 \nformer Members of Congress.\n  According to a report by the Institute for America's Future, by 2010, \nthe six biggest banks and their trade associations employed 243 \nlobbyists who once worked in the Federal Government, including 33 who \nworked as chiefs of staff for Members of Congress and 54 who worked as \nstaffers for the banking oversight committees in the House and Senate. \nThat is a lot of former government employees and Senators and \nCongressmen pounding on Congress to make sure that the big banks get \nheard.\n  It is no surprise that the financial industry spent more than $1 \nmillion a day lobbying Congress on financial reform, and that is a lot \nof money that went to former elected officials and government \nemployees. Now we see the fruits of those investments.\n  This provision is all about goosing the profits of the big banks. \nWall Street is not subtle about this one. According to documents \nreviewed by the New York Times, the original bill that is being \nincorporated into the House spending legislation today was literally \nwritten by Citigroup lobbyists who ``redrafted'' the legislation, \n``striking out certain phrases and inserting others.'' It has been \nopposed by current and former leaders of the FDIC, including Sheila \nBair, a Republican who formerly chaired the agency, and Thomas Hoenig, \nthe current vice chairman of the agency. For those who are keeping \nscore, this is the agency that will be responsible for bailing out Wall \nStreet when their risky bets go south.\n\n  I know that House and Senate negotiators from both parties have \nworked long and hard to come to an agreement on the omnibus spending \nlegislation, and Senate leaders deserve great credit for preventing the \nHouse from carrying out some of their more aggressive fantasies about \ndismantling even more pieces of financial reform, but this provision \ngoes too far. Citigroup is large and powerful, but it is a single, \nprivate company. It should not get to hold the entire government \nhostage to threaten a government shutdown in order to roll back \nimportant protections that keep our economy safe. This is a democracy, \nand the American people didn't elect us to stand up for Citigroup, they \nelected us to stand up for all the people.\n  I urge my colleagues in the House--particularly my Democratic \ncolleagues whose votes are essential to moving this package forward--to \nwithhold support from it until this risky giveaway is removed from the \nlegislation. We all need to stand and fight this giveaway to the most \npowerful banks in this country.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                        Criminal Justice System\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I rise today to discuss an issue that I \nbelieve should be discussed and worked on so much more in Congress. It \ndemands an urgency of action, a dedication, and a focus to address our \nshortfalls as a nation to live up to our ideals, liberty and justice \nfor all. Equal justice under the law is written on the Supreme Court, \nand is a theme of our Nation.\n  It is the source of anguish that I believe is driving protests all \nover our country right now. From Ferguson to Staten Island, from New \nJersey to Oakland, citizens of all races and all backgrounds--Americans \nare joining together to call for change, and to have this idea that our \nlegal system really should be a justice system.\n  Now this is an anguish that is not simply the result and the reaction \nto specific incidents. Yes, there is much discussion about those \nspecific incidents in places such as Staten Island, but it is a \nreflection of a deeper anguish, an unfinished American business that \nhas lasted for decades.\n  I feel in my own personal life this sense of gratitude for my unique \nupbringing. As a young man in 1969, my parents literally had to get a \nwhite couple to pose as them to buy the house I grew up in in New \nJersey. They literally had to go through the indignity of trying to \nbreak barriers of race to move into a town that was all white at the \ntime.\n  I stand here to tell you I grew up in the greatest place. The \ncitizens of Harrington Park, NJ, are why I am standing here right now. \nThe love and caring that exists in my State is remarkable.\n  I am also here today because of a city that is a majority Black city, \nNewark, NJ, that embraced me as a young professional, and where I \neventually became mayor.\n  Through my unique position, I have to say I am able to understand all \ncorners of this country. In an intimate way, I see this anguish that I \nspeak of with so many of my friends and colleagues. I heard it here in \nthe Senate. I have had security guards pull me aside to talk to me \nabout their anguish and frustrations about the criminal justice system. \nI have had the people who do the work in this body--those who clean our \nfloors or tend to the needs of our Senators--and they feel this \nfrustration about an American legal system that is falling short of \nAmerican ideals and is not a justice system.\n  I saw it with my own parents who, with agony and pain, talked to me \nabout not having a margin of error when it comes to dealing with police \nofficers. They would coach me on how I should speak and talk and what I \nshould do with my hands because of the fears they had of the treatment \nI might have that would be different than other Americans.\n  I stand today because this cannot simply be reduced to a racial \nissue. This is the larger questions of justice in our country. This \ncalls to the consciousness of all Americans, and it is sourced by the \nrealities we face in this country where we lead the globe in areas that \nno American who believes in freedom and liberty should want to lead.\n  We have had over the last decades of my lifetime an explosion in \nincarceration that belies the truth of who we are. This Nation has seen \nthis country have an 800-percent increase in the Federal prison \npopulation over the last 30 years. Think about that--an 800-percent \nincrease. We now have the very ignominious distinction on the globe for \nleading the planet Earth in a country that incarcerates its own \ncitizens. In fact, America is just 5 percent of the globe's population, \nbut we have 25 percent of the world's imprisoned people, and I tell you \nthat is not because Americans have a greater proclivity for \ncriminality, it is because our legal system is not a justice system.\n  This overincarceration and overcriminality anguishes this Nation, \naggravates divisions, undermines freedom and liberty and costs \ntaxpayers so much more money. It is an unnecessary burden and expense \nthat is a self-inflicted wound in this Nation that undermines our \nprosperity and our success. We spend $\\1/4\\ trillion a year locking \npeople up, and the majority of those people are nonviolent offenders.\n\n  In fact, over the last decade, right now in America there are more \npeople in prison for drug offenses than all of the people in prison in \nthe 1970s. It is an extraordinary fact. Whether you are Black or White, \nif you get arrested and charged with a felony crime for doing some \nthings that the last three Presidents of the United States admitted to \ndoing, and then tried and convicted--I say ``tried'' with hesitancy \nbecause the majority of them are plea bargains. As the President knows, \nif you get convicted of that felony offense, the nondrug violent \noffense, the collateral consequences to your life are horrendous.\n  We now live in a nation where the collateral consequences are \nprofound. We now know that time behind bars, even for these nonviolent \noffenders, reduces people's hourly wages by 11 percent, their annual \nemployment by 9 weeks, their annual earnings by 40 percent. It has a \npowerful economic impact.\n  If a person is convicted for possession of controlled substances use, \nthey become ineligible for so many benefits that we would often think \nwe would want these very people to have. They\n\n[[Page S6490]]\n\ncan't get Federal education grants such as a Pell grant. They can't get \nloans or work assistance. They become ineligible for business licenses, \noutrageously so. A person convicted of a felony will be denied public \nhousing, even the ability to visit their family in public housing. They \ncould be kicked out of their current housing arrangements. Former \ninmates can't get jobs, shelter, or loans. They often feel that no \noption exists other than going back to that slippery slope toward more \ncrime. That is for all the people within the criminal system.\n  But what is anguishing so many is the clear and undeniable \napplications of this criminal justice system and the applications of \nthis legal system in unequal ways to different portions of our \npopulation.\n  In my life I have seen that firsthand--how the usage of drugs in \ndifferent communities where there is no difference between Blacks and \nWhites is treated differently based upon their race or their \nsocioeconomic status.\n  Let me be clear. These issues are American issues, not simply race \nissues. They affect us all because we are a nation with a profound \ndeclaration of independence, but the truth of our country speaks also \nto an interdependence. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice \neverywhere.\n  I point out these facts to let you understand why we have to have \nsuch an urgency. African Americans and Whites have no difference in \ndrug usage whatsoever, but an African American who chooses to use \nmarijuana is 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for that usage than \nsomeone who is White.\n  In fact, between 2007 and 2009, drug sentences for African-American \nmen were 13.1 percent longer than those for White men. Usage has no \ndifference, but arrest rates are dramatically higher for African-\nAmerican men. In fact, for all crimes, when you start breaking the \nactual data down, you see patterns of discriminatory impact that are \nunacceptable in a nation this great.\n  Even for police violence, we have to understand that today nearly 2.5 \ntimes more Whites are arrested than Blacks for crimes that are violent \nand nonviolent--2.5 times more arrests for Whites than Blacks, but \nsomehow African Americans are 21 more times more likely to be shot dead \nby a police officer.\n  This is data that should not shock us along racial lines but shock us \nalong American lines. We are the Nation of liberty and justice for all. \nWe are the country of equal protection under the law. African Americans \nmake up just 13 percent of our population but 40 percent of the prison \npopulation.\n  In New Jersey, African Americans are 13.7 percent of New Jersey's \npopulation but 62 percent of New Jersey's prison population. Much of \nthat, as clearly the data shows, has come about through the persecution \nof the American drug policy that is applied to different groups and \ndifferent effects. The reality for minorities is punishing. By the age \nof 23, 44 percent of Latino youth will be arrested. We know the sad \nreality that 1 in 3 black males born in America today can expect, if we \nmake no changes, to be incarcerated at some point in their lives \ncompared to 1 in 87 White males, ages 18 to 64, incarcerated, while 1 \nin every 12 Blacks is.\n  I struggled with these issues my whole life. As a mayor of a city \nconstantly working to fight to protect citizens, I know how complicated \nthese problems can be. My police department, ourselves, we dug into the \ndata. We saw that our practices had to be changed, that we had to find \nbetter ways of keeping our community safe, but we also knew something \ndeeper. I will never forget when I sat with the head of the FBI in \nNewark, and I asked him about the violent crime problem: How are we \ngoing to solve this problem?\n  He looked at me and said: You don't understand, Mayor. We--meaning \nlaw enforcement--are not going to solve this problem. What has to be \ndone are changes greater than this.\n  I watched how young kids get arrested for breaking the law, for \nsmoking marijuana or being caught with possession. Teenagers find \nthemselves--because they have marijuana on them of a certain amount and \nweight so the charges increase, to being in a school zone which is \nevery place in many cities--now facing mandatory minimums of upwards of \n5 years. These teenagers are scared, afraid, knowing they broke the \nlaw, but other folks like the last three Presidents have gotten away \nwith it. They get offered it by the prosecutor, overworked, trying hard \nto serve the public and keep people safe. The prosecutor doesn't give \nthem the mandatory minimum, they give them a deal: Just take time \nserved or a month or 6 months, but they find themselves with a felony \nconviction. Now they find themselves in a world where they think they \nhave no options. They can't get jobs. They can't get education grants. \nThey can't get hope.\n\n  Hopelessness is a toxic state of being, and those kids then often get \ncaught up again into the underground economy, back into the world of \ndrugs.\n  What we saw in my time as mayor is that so many of the people who \nultimately end up being violent criminals started as kids who felt all \ntheir options closed in on them because they got caught up in this \nworld of drugs.\n  One of the worst collateral consequences of the way we are going \nabout prosecuting our criminal legal system is the violence we are \nseeing from people who think they have no options but to do what they \nare doing.\n  I say this all to simply say we must find a way out. If we are \nAmerica, a system that believes in elevating human potential and \nbelieves in ideas of liberty and freedom and deplores this concept that \ngovernment should take people's liberty for no good means, we have to \ndo something about this issue.\n  We who believe in freedom, who tell the world to look at our light \nand our torch and our promise, should evidence something better than \nleading the globe in incarcerating our own citizens. We, this country, \nwhere generation after generation has conquered discrimination against \nIrish, has conquered discrimination against Italians, has beat back \ndiscrimination against Catholics, has stood up to discrimination \nagainst Jews, has fought against Jim Crow and slavery; advancing not \ntoward Black ideals or Jewish ideals or Irish ideals, but the common \nideals that bind us as brothers and sisters of justice, of freedom, of \nequality--we have to do better than lead the globe in incarceration, to \nhave a legal system that subjects more of its people and minorities \ntoward search and scrutiny than seizure and arrest. This we cannot \ntolerate.\n  Why I stand so confidently with a faith in my Nation that we can do \nbetter does not just stem from this hallowed history. It also stems \nfrom the President. Right now in America there are States doing \nincredible things, incredible things, to change away this reality.\n  I am proud of my State. We have gone far but not far enough. In New \nJersey, between 1999 and 2012, we reduced our prison population 26 \npercent. Guess what. During that same period of time, New Jersey saw a \n30-percent reduction in violent crime. We showed to America that we are \nbetter than this. We can give more liberty to people, lowering our \nprison population, having a disproportionate effect on minorities, and \nactually drive down crime as well.\n  We are not the only State. New York's prison population is down 24 \npercent from the late 1990s. This is due almost entirely to reforms of \nthe Rockefeller drug laws, policies that sent thousands of people to \nprison often serving sentences for low-level crimes. Over that same \nperiod, New York reduced its crime by more than half, lowering prison \npopulations, disproportionately affecting African Americans and Latinos \nand lowering crimes.\n  Texas reduced its prison population in 2013 dramatically and has seen \ndecreases in both crime and recidivism rates. All of these States can \ndo more, but why has the Federal Government done little to nothing to \nfollow suit?\n  I am proud of what is going on in the Senate with many of my \ncolleagues. I came and joined this body when people pulled together to \nbegin legislation such as the Smarter Sentencing Act or, more recently, \nthe REDEEM Act I did in partnership with Rand Paul.\n  I am so proud that this issue cuts across political sides, that we \nhave Democrats and Republicans, red States and blue States, all \nbeginning to say we can do better. I am here today to end my remarks \nwith that call to the consciousness of our country. If we\n\n[[Page S6491]]\n\nhave an injustice in our midst with a legal system that is so far away \nfrom the justice system to which we should aspire, we have to do \nbetter.\n  I was raised to believe that injustice anywhere is a threat to \njustice everywhere. In the words of Langston Hughes: ``There's a dream \nin this land with its back against the wall; to save the dream for one, \nwe must save the dream for all.''\n  I know in my heart that with anguish of millions of Americans being \npunished by a legal system that has gone way out of control, affecting \nBlacks and Whites, young people of all backgrounds, a legal system that \npatently has a discriminatory impact on minorities, a legal system that \nsteals the people's liberty, we can do better than this. We can save \ntaxpayer money. We can lower our prison incarceration rates. We can \nelevate the promise of so many now denied their promise, and we can \ncelebrate our American ideals. We need to lead this globe, not in \nincarceration, by telling the truth of who we are; that America is a \nland of freedom, of justice, where there truly is liberty and justice \nfor all.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                            EPA Regulations\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I want to talk a little bit about \nregulation today. We end this Congress failing once again for the \nCongress to take more responsibility for regulation. Items such as the \nREINS Act, which I have sponsored with Senator Paul and others and \nwhich would require Members of Congress to vote on regulations that had \nsignificant economic impact did not get done.\n  A bill that I introduced with Senator King from Maine that would \ncreate a regulatory review process that got great reviews in every \neconomic and many other papers and magazines did not get done. But what \nI am seeing in Missouri and around the country is more and more concern \nthat begins to focus on the Congress not doing what it needs to do to \nkeep the regulators under control--legislation that would routinely put \nan end date on every regulation so that regulation has to be reviewed \nand regulation has to come up again and be looked at. Frankly, if you \ncombined that with the requirement for the Senate and the House to vote \non that regulation, it would be very unlikely that regulations that no \nlonger made sense would be presented another time--having to look at \nthis in a way that makes sense for our economy.\n  One of the generally used estimates is that $2 trillion is spent \nevery year in the United States complying with regulations. Well, let's \nassume that maybe as much as half of that--it could be more--is either \nduplicative or simply unnecessary. What would happen in our economy if \nwe had $1 trillion chasing the future rather than trying to needlessly \ncomply with things that no longer make sense.\n  We have to take more responsibility for that because frankly there is \nno other way to get our hands on the regulators. The regulators are \noften out of control and almost always unaccountable. Frankly, they are \nmore unaccountable in the second term of a President than they are in \nthe first term because nobody in the chain of command ever has to go \nback and answer to the people we work for about the cost of these \nregulations.\n  I know in my State of Missouri, people are really concerned about a \ncouple of regulations out there now that are dealing with energy policy \nand water policy, regulations the EPA has imposed that really do not \nmake sense when you look at the cost of those regulations versus what \nwould be gained by the regulations if they were even possible to comply \nwith.\n  I think a clear message was sent in November to the next Congress \nthat people want the government to be more responsive, that people want \nthe government to--when you have a cost-benefit analysis of something \nthe government has done, make it a realistic analysis, make it an \nanalysis that would stand the straight-face test, when you say, oh, \nthis is not the emotional cost of worrying about some societal problem \nthat you really cannot quite define, this is what it really costs \nAmerican families in terms of, for instance, their utility bill.\n  We look at these regulations that frankly go beyond the capacity of \nthe regulators. I am not suggesting that the Congress is the right \nplace to draft most regulations. I would say that the process of \npassing a law and saying that we want this agency to figure out how to \nimplement the law is, in fact, the right way to do that. But I would \nalso suggest that then that agency has to come back to the Congress and \nsay: Here is the regulation that we think is the proper implementation. \nNow you have to vote yes or no. This regulation is the way to go \nforward with this law.\n  I think often the regulators now are well beyond what the law allows \nthem to do. There is a case in point I am going to talk about in a \nminute, the water rule that is out there, where a navigable water was \nused as a definition of where the EPA had some jurisdiction. Well, I \nthink their view right now is well beyond ``navigable.'' So what would \nwe do about that? There is the ENFORCE the Law Act that I introduced in \nthe Senate and that the House passed months ago with a bipartisan vote, \nwhere the Congress would have standing in court to be able to go to \ncourt if either House of the Congress thought the President was not \nenforcing the law as intended, so that the Congress--which now cannot \ngo to court and say that we want a third party to step in right now and \ndefine this principle--could go to court and say that we want to know \nright now what ``navigable'' meant in 1972 when it was put into law, in \nthe early 1970s, what it meant in 1899 when it was used for the first \ntime, and what it means today.\n  There is no reason to have a couple of years of trying to comply with \na regulation when eventually the Supreme Court will say, as they did a \nhandful of times last year, that the Federal Government does not have \njurisdiction to do this or that people were appointed illegally to a \nboard or commission and that all of the actions they took had to be set \naside. This is not a hypothetical case. This is what the Court decided \njust last year. The ENFORCE the Law Act would give us the capacity not \nto require a citizen to have to bear the burden of looking at a \nregulation that is outside the law or does not make sense and would \nallow the Congress to actually participate in that process at a much \nearlier time. So I hope in the next Congress we will do in the Senate \nwhat the House did and pass something like the ENFORCE the Law Act. I \ncertainly intend to introduce that legislation again, put it on the \nPresident's desk, and have that discussion.\n  The administration recently took the opportunity to roll out a new \nrule on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. This was an estimate of--\nthis was a rule on air matter, ozone. A new ozone rule came out the \nWednesday before Thanksgiving. Believe me, if you have a rule that you \nthink people are going to like, you do not put it out the Wednesday \nafternoon before Thanksgiving. This is like the--we always watch late \nFriday afternoon what comes out because that is what whoever is \nannouncing it did not want to announce on Monday. Even a bigger day is \nthe Wednesday before Thanksgiving. We have an air rule now that we have \nnot achieved. We have made great strides in the right direction, but \nlooking at where we are now on this rule and mercury in the air and the \nquality of the air, we would have to have at least 75- to 85-percent \nattainment in counties all over America before you could then raise the \nbar one more time.\n  This would take the 75-percent standard, or the 75 standard that we \nhave now for particulate matter--the so-called MACT Standards--and \nreduce it even further. We are not in attainment with the first rule \nyet. In fact, the EPA just recently, years after the rule, put out the \nguidelines you would need that were helpful to try to achieve the rule. \nBut as soon as you get the guidelines for the last rule, the EPA wants \nto say: Oh, here we want to talk about the next rule, even though we \njust now told you how to begin to think about complying with the last \nrule. Even though there are nonattainment areas all over the country, \nwe want to move right beyond that and go to the next rule.\n\n  That is the kind of thing that should not be allowed to happen. \nPeople are still looking for good-paying jobs. They are still looking \nat a utility bill they want to make sense of. I hope the Congress can \nbe a part of that. The EPA has another rule they have been asking\n\n[[Page S6492]]\n\nfor comment on, the so-called clean powerplant. Well now, who is \nopposed to that? Nobody. There is nobody who does not want clean power. \nIn fact, the standards for utility powerplants have moved in a very \npositive direction in the last 10 years.\n  We have made great gains. The question is, are the next gains worth \nthe economic cost, if the next gains are worth people having utility \nbills they cannot pay or if the next gains are worth people not having \njobs they would otherwise have. That is a discussion we need to have. \nYou know, the wrong utility policies produce an absolute lose-lose. A \nutility bill goes up, we lose jobs that we otherwise would have, and \nthey go to places that care a whole lot less about what comes out of \nthe smokestack than we do.\n  So the problem gets better, we lose jobs, and the country that has \nmade the most positive strides in recent years is the country that pays \nthe price for rules that no longer make sense. The rule that is out \nnow--our State is largely coal dependent. We are the fifth most coal-\ndependent State. We are about 82-percent coal dependent. Of the 1 \nmillion comments that have been made on the rule, 305,000 of them came \nfrom Missouri families.\n  There are 1 million comments of people talking about why this rule \ndoes not make sense for them. We need to be sure that we do the things \nthat not only meet the legal standard but also meet the commonsense \nstandard as we move forward. The Wall Street Journal recently ran an \nop-ed--an opinion editorial piece--by Harvard Professor Laurence Tribe, \nwho happened to be one of President Obama's law school professors and \nwho is more often a witness for the left side of an argument than for \nthe right side of an argument.\n  He joined the world's largest private coal company, Peabody Energy, \nto criticize the executive overreach in what the EPA is proposing as \nthey propose to regulate carbon emissions from existing powerplants. \nThere is a big difference if you have a rule that talks about what you \ndo in the future for the utility companies than regulating what people \nhave previously decided to do under the old rules.\n  There is a bill out there that I am a cosponsor of that really tries \nto use the great resource we have through coal in a most effective way. \nWe do not produce any coal in Missouri any more, but we used to. We do \nnot have any coal mines left in our State. But we have coal-fueled \npower plants. It is not really a war on coal as far as Missourians are \nconcerned; it is a war on coal-fired plants.\n  If you built a plant under the old rules and, in fact, it has better \nair quality than any powerplant has ever had up until this time, as all \nof our recent plants have had, and you still have life in that plant, \nbut the EPA comes in and says that now you have to meet a new standard \nwith the plant you just built or you built 5 years ago, somebody has to \npay that bill.\n  There is this mythical view that well, it is big industry or it is \nmanufacturing. The most laughable of all is that somehow the utility \ncompanies are going to pay the bill. The utility companies do not pay \nthe bill. People that get a utility bill pay the bill. The people that \nare most impacted by that are the people who are having a hard time \npaying their utility bill now.\n  These are bad policies. I am committed that as a Congress we should \ndo more than we have been doing to accept responsibility for these \nagencies we fund, for some overall law, that no matter how much they \nare abusing it by stretching it beyond what the Congress intended, the \nCongress would have passed--nobody is out there issuing a rule and \nsaying: By the way, we do not have any legal authority to do this. So \ndefining that authority, being sure the rules make sense is important.\n  On the power rule, on December 2 I filed comments urging that this \nrule be withdrawn and we think more carefully about the impact it has \non jobs that have good take-home pay and about families who have a hard \ntime paying their utility bill now--our retired individuals, our single \nmoms or others who have a hard time paying their utility bill now. We \nneed to continue to look at that.\n  One other rule I want to talk about, as my time comes to a conclusion \nhere, is the so-called waters of the United States rule. The EPA was \ngiven the authority under the Clean Water Act, as I said earlier, to \nhave some authority over navigable waters. Navigable water, beginning \nin the 1890s, was used in Federal law as a constitutional explanation \nof why the Federal Government would be involved in water policy, \nbecause the Federal Government under the Constitution is involved in \ncommerce.\n  Navigable and commerce come together. Navigable actually means you \ncan navigate with some sort of vessel that can carry a commercial load. \nWell, the EPA has now decided, or is in the process of proposing, at \nleast, that navigable waters means any water that can run into any \nwater that could run into any water that can be navigable. I am \nconfident that is not what the Congress intended.\n  Now, if they want to propose that, that is fine. Through the \nPresident and the administration, the EPA can come to Congress and say: \nWe think we ought to control all the water everywhere; let's have a \ndebate about that. And the Congress would not give the EPA that \nauthority.\n  I hope the next Congress sets as a priority taking responsibility for \nwhat the Federal Government does, taking responsibility for these \nregulators and regulations, being sure we have regulations where we \nneed them that make sense, and that we push back and don't have \nregulations where all they do is hurt families, hurt jobs, and don't \nsolve the bigger problem. I hope we see that happen, and I hope the \nnext Congress will be more focused on doing that job than this Congress \nwas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Udall of New Mexico pertaining to the submission \nof S. Res. 596 are printed in today's Record under ``Submitted \nResolutions.'')\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise today in support of the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. I commend the work of \nmy colleagues on the Armed Services Committee--especially the chairman, \nSenator Carl Levin of Michigan--on reaching an agreement with the House \nto complete this important legislation.\n  It is also appropriate that this legislation be named in honor of \nboth Senator Carl Levin and Congressman Buck McKeon, the chairmen of \ntheir respective committees who this year are retiring after \nextraordinary service and dedication to the Nation and particularly to \nthe men and women of the armed services. It is another reason why this \nbill is particularly special--because it represents the culmination of \nthe work of these two extraordinary gentlemen.\n  For over 50 consecutive years this Senate has passed a defense \nauthorization bill. I hope we will be able to send the bill before us \nto the President for his signature. We owe it to our servicemembers to \npass a law that will support them and enable the DOD to execute this \nyear's budget efficiently and effectively.\n  This year, once again we have had to make very difficult decisions, \nespecially because of the economic circumstances we face as a nation, \nthe resources, and the threats which are challenging at this moment in \nour history. But this bill will allow the Department of Defense to \ncombat these current threats, plan for future threats, and provide for \nthe welfare of our brave servicemembers and their families.\n  While it is disappointing that we are not able to bring this bill to \nthe floor for amendments in regular order because time really is \nrunning out, this is a very good bill which is based on the principle \nof compromise between many parties. It is critical at this moment that \nwe pass it for the men and women in uniform for the United States.\n  I wish to point out a few highlights of the bill.\n  First, it authorizes a 1-percent across-the-board pay raise and \nreauthorizes over 30 types of bonuses and\n\n[[Page S6493]]\n\nspecial pays for our men and women in uniform.\n  It includes numerous provisions that build on the reforms we passed \nlast year to further strengthen and improve sexual assault prevention \nand response programs. It is unacceptable and it is completely \nantithetical to the ethic of the military that anyone in uniform would \nbe a predator. To be a soldier, to be a marine, to be a sailor, to be \nan airmen--it is about your subordinates, your comrades, helping them \nand sacrificing for them, not using them. So we can do more, and we \nmust do more, but I am pleased to see that we have taken important \nsteps and we are following through on these steps.\n  The legislation in general improves the ability of the Armed Forces \nto counter emerging and nontraditional threats, particularly cyber \nwarfare. This is a new dimension of warfare. It is one we are coping \nwith, but I don't think anyone should feel we have the technology, the \ntechniques, the operations, and the insights to feel fully competent. \nThis legislation will help us move in that direction.\n  The legislation also authorizes the full request of $4.1 billion for \nthe Afghanistan Security Forces Fund to sustain the Afghan National \nSecurity Forces as the U.S. and coalition forces shift our mission to \ntraining, advising, and assisting these forces, letting them take the \nlead in combat operations. It is very essential.\n  It also authorizes several train-and-equip programs to assist foreign \nmilitaries conducting counterterrorism and counternarcotics operations. \nOf particular note are programs and resources that will go to Iraq and \nSyria, where we face serious challenges, where we have to provide the \nkind of support that is indicated in this legislation.\n  This year I once again had the honor of serving as the chairman of \nthe Seapower Subcommittee alongside Senator John McCain, the ranking \nmember. Our subcommittee focused on the needs of the Navy, Marine \nCorps, and strategic mobility forces. We put particular emphasis on \nsupporting Marine and Navy forces engaged in combat operations, \nimproving efficiencies, and applying the savings to higher priority \nprograms. Specifically, the bill includes the required funding for two \nVirginia-class submarines and a moored training ship and approves other \nmajor shipbuilding programs, including funding for two DDG-51 \ndestroyers, the aircraft carrier replacement program, and three \nlittoral combat ship vessels, and it permits incremental funding for \nanother amphibious transport dock ship.\n  I am particularly pleased about the funding for the Virginia-class \nsubmarines and the DDG-1000 destroyers. So many Rhode Islanders build \nthem, design them, and they are an incredible part of our national \nsecurity. So we are reinforcing shipbuilding programs that are not only \nunder budget and ahead of schedule but are vitally important to the \nsecurity of the United States.\n\n  Along these same lines, I am pleased to note that the bill \nestablishes the National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund to provide resources \nand to manage the construction of the Ohio-class replacement ballistic \nmissile submarine program. According to testimony provided to the Armed \nServices Committee, the Ohio-class replacement is the Navy's highest \npriority program. We are currently constructing attack submarines. \nThese submarines are designed to go against other submarines, to \ndeliver special operations troops, and to conduct fire missions from \nthe sea.\n  The Ohio class will replace our ballistic missile submarines, which \nare part of our deterrence forces. These submarines have nuclear \nweapons and are part of our triad, our architecture to deter the use of \nnuclear weapons; we have to replace them. It cannot be done just with \nNavy resources because it is not just a Navy program, it is a national \nsecurity program embracing our nuclear deterrence. This fund is a good \nstarting point for that process, and I am very pleased to see it in the \nlegislation.\n  Working together with Senator McCain, particularly following Senator \nMcCain's lead, this bill increases accountability for the taxpayers' \ndollars spent on several major Navy programs. For example, the bill \nincludes a provision to require the Director of Operational Test and \nEvaluation to submit a report of the current LCS test and evaluation \nmaster plan for seaframes and mission modules. The report would provide \nan assessment of whether completion of the test and evaluation master \nplan will demonstrate operational effectiveness and operational \nsuitability for both seaframes and each mission module.\n  This is a very important program. We want to make sure we get it \nright. We want to make sure we build in efficiencies where we can, and \nthe Director of Operational Test and Evaluation will help us do that.\n  The bill also includes language that will continue support of and \nadvance planning for the refueling of the USS George Washington \naircraft carrier and preclude the Navy from spending any funds to \ninactivate this ship. Again, this goes to the congressional mandate of \nhaving a specified number of aircraft carrier battle groups, and \nwithout refueling the Washington, we will not meet that legislative \nmandate. So we hope we will go forward this year and provide the \nrequisite funding to complete the refueling, but at least we are moving \nin the right direction. I think that is important.\n\n  I particularly want to voice my thanks to Senator McCain and other \nmembers of the Seapower Subcommittee for their diligence, for their \nleadership, for their assistance in not only giving what our Navy and \nMarines need, but also making sure that the taxpayers are protected as \nbest we can. And, frankly, we have to do more with respect to \nefficiencies, economies, and being wise in our allocation of resources.\n  Before I conclude with my remarks regarding the traditional defense \nprograms, I want to touch on two other aspects of the legislation, one \nin particular with respect to the Defense act. I am pleased that it \nincludes the HAVEN Act. This is bipartisan legislation that I \nintroduced with Senator Johanns to help more veterans with critical \nrepairs and modifications for their homes so they are safer and more \naccessible.\n  This program is directed at our disabled and low income veterans. \nThey find themselves out of the service, they have benefits, but they \nhave needs to fix their homes and this program will help them do that. \nIt establishes a competitive pilot program allowing nonprofit \norganizations throughout the country to apply for grants administrated \nby the Department of Housing and Urban Development to help make key \nimprovements to the houses of veterans with disabilities, or low-income \nveterans.\n  It is fitting we take this step to give back to those who have made a \npersonal sacrifice for our Nation, and I am particularly delighted I \nwas able to work with Senator Johanns. As I noted in my remarks \nyesterday, he is retiring, but his decency, integrity, intelligence, \nand commitment to his constituents and also to the men and women of the \nArmed Forces will be missed here.\n  I am also glad that, on a topic not usually found in the defense \nauthorization bill, we reached a bipartisan agreement on a package of \npublic land bills, including two longstanding priorities for my State. \nFor years, I have supported the preservation and renewed development of \nthe Blackstone River Valley and have led the effort to designate parts \nof that area as a national park, which the bill before us will finally \nestablish.\n  In 1793, Samuel Slater began the American industrial revolution in \nRhode Island when he built his historic mill on the Blackstone River--\nreally the first industrial-scale operation in the United States--and \nfrom that, much has ensued. Today, the mills and villages throughout \nwhat is now known as the John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley \nNational Heritage Corridor in Rhode Island and Massachusetts stand as \nwitness to this important era of our history.\n  Much credit has to go to Senator John H. Chafee, who picked up the \nball from those who preceded him. In fact, I was told last weekend that \nthis attempt to get recognition goes back as far as a letter to Lady \nBird Johnson in the 1960s, asking if she could help get land in the \nBlackstone Valley preserved. So it has been a long and winding road, \nand John Chafee was a key person in that process.\n\n[[Page S6494]]\n\n  Creating a national historic park within the existing corridor would \npreserve the industrial, natural, and cultural heritage of the \nBlackstone Valley for future generations. It will improve the use and \nenjoyment of the natural resources, including outdoor education for \nyoung people; it will assist local communities while providing economic \ndevelopment opportunities; and it will increase the protection of the \nmost important and nationally significant cultural and natural resource \nof the Blackstone River Valley.\n  I can recall last year inviting Secretary of the Interior Sally \nJewell to Rhode Island, and we kayaked along the Blackstone River. When \nI was young, in the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of going into the \nBlackstone River, which was then frankly an industrial waste zone, \nwould have been ridiculous. Today, we not only use the Blackstone River \nfor recreation but, with this national park designation, we will be \nable to do so much more.\n  The public lands package also includes legislation to authorize the \nNational Park Service to look at another river system in Rhode Island \nand adjacent Connecticut--specifically rivers within the Wood-Pawcatuck \nWatershed--for potential inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic \nRivers System. These rivers are, again, so important to Rhode Island.\n  One of the things you discover as you go around Rhode Island, \nparticularly after a storm when you can see the true power of these \nrivers, is that development during the industrial revolution was \ncentered around rivers because water was a source of energy. As a \nresult, many of our communities are clustered around the rivers and \nhave great historic, cultural, recreational, and environmental value.\n  So let me thank not only my colleagues here but in the House, \nCongressmen David Cicilline and Jim Langevin, for their great effort; \nalso the Members of the Massachusetts delegation, because the \nBlackstone runs into Massachusetts; and I particularly want to thank \nSheldon Whitehouse, a stalwart when it comes to all these issues--\nanything to do with the environment, particularly Rhode Island's \nenvironment. His leadership and his support were absolutely critical in \ngetting this measure today included in this bill. I would also like to \nthank the countless number of stakeholders in Rhode Island and \nMassachusetts who have tirelessly advocated for the preservation of the \nBlackstone River Valley all these years.\n  We have a good national defense authorization bill before the Senate, \nand I urge all of my colleagues to support it. I look forward to being \nable to witness, even remotely, the signing of the Levin-McKeon \nnational defense authorization.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, earlier today the former Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, said there was a way to \nfix ObamaCare. She said: Change the name. She said: Change the name. \nThat was her solution.\n  Now that is not something she just told a friend. It is something she \ntold many, as she was participating in Politico's ``Lessons From \nLeaders'' events. Well, leaders don't blame the failure of a bad \nproduct on a name. You can blame it on a lot of things, but the name is \nnot it. After all, the President said he was fond of the name \nObamaCare. Apparently, Kathleen Sebelius is taking a page from the \nplaybook of Professor Gruber about underestimating the intelligence of \nthe American people.\n  This law isn't unpopular because it was named after the President. \nThe law is unpopular because it doesn't work. It is unpopular because \nit doesn't deliver what the President promised the American people it \nwould. So Democrats can rename this health care system whatever they \nwant and people all across the country are still going to know that the \nlaw is failing them.\n  People have been hit by higher costs--higher copays, higher premiums, \nhigher deductibles. Many of them can't continue to see the doctor who \ntreated them in the past. So no matter what the Democrats and Kathleen \nSebelius want to call it, the law remains very unpopular because it is \nunworkable and it is unaffordable.\n  As we head into the middle of December, next week, December 15, is \nthe deadline for people to sign up on Healthcare.gov if they want to \nhave their health insurance coverage starting next January--January 1--\njust a few weeks from now.\n  That is for people living in the 37 States that use the Federal \nhealth care exchange. A lot of people still haven't signed up, and they \nmay learn over the next few days if they do go to the Web site to sign \nup that their health care and their insurance premiums are actually \nmore expensive next year than they were this year. That is what people \ncontinue to see: Health care rates going up in spite of the President's \npromise.\n  When President Obama was selling his health care law to the American \npeople, he promised them they would save money. He actually went so far \nas to say people would save $2,500 per year, per family, under his \nplan. And Nancy Pelosi, the former Speaker of the House, actually went \non ``Meet the Press'' and at one point said: Everyone's rates would go \ndown. Everyone's rates, she said, would go down.\n  Well, that didn't happen. Now the Obama administration finally admits \nthat people are paying more, not less. Americans buying health \ninsurance through the Federal exchange will see their premiums go up \nand the administration finally admits it. And that is according to a \nnew report by the Department of Health and Human Services which came \nout last Thursday.\n  Democrats said prices would go down, the President promised they \nwould go down, and Nancy Pelosi said they would down for everyone. \nInstead, the prices keep going up.\n  Here is what one person in Syracuse, NY, wrote to his local newspaper \nlast week. Lawrence Petty wrote to the Syracuse Post-Standard last \nMonday, December 1. He wrote that he has a plan he bought through the \nState ObamaCare exchange. This year, the cost was about $664 a month \nfor the couple. Next year, going on the exchange, the rate for the same \nplan--the same plan, because the President said if you like your plan \nyou can keep it--the same plan is going up from $664 a month to $773 a \nmonth. That is over $1,300 extra per year. Mr. Petty asked the \nnewspaper in Syracuse, NY: ``So what gives?''\n  The average increase across the country is less than that, but this \nman in Syracuse, NY, is looking at a price hike of more than 17 \npercent. Every Democrat in the Senate voted for the President's health \ncare law--every one of them. The Democratic Senator from New York voted \nfor the health care law--the very State where this man is writing to \nhis newspaper in Syracuse, NY. What do they have to say to this man in \nSyracuse whose insurance premiums are going up 17 percent next year? \nHow do they respond to this man who is writing to the paper in New York \nasking ``what gives''?\n  Maybe his question has something to do with what the senior Senator \nfrom New York said a couple of weeks ago at the National Press Club, \nwhen he admitted that the health care law, in his words, ``wasn't the \nchange we were hired to make.''\n  It is not just premiums. They are not the only problem here. The \nhealth care law has added so many Washington mandates, so many things \npeople didn't want, can't afford, aren't interested in, don't need, \nthat other costs have gone up as well. That includes the money people \nhave to pay out of pocket for things such as copays, their deductibles. \nSome people have actually had to delay their medical care because of \nall these additional expenses. According to a new Gallup poll last \nmonth, 33 percent of Americans say that over the past year they have \nput off getting medical treatment because of the cost.\n  Gallup has been asking this same question all the way since 2001, \nwell before the health care law was passed. And this year it is the \nhighest number ever. This is after the President's health care law has \nbeen signed into law and has taken effect and the exchanges are in \neffect--the highest number ever of people not getting care because of \nthe cost.\n  Two-thirds of these people say they have put off treatment for a \nserious condition. One of them is a woman\n\n[[Page S6495]]\n\nnamed Patricia Wanderlich. She is 61 years old, and she works part time \nat a landscaping company outside of Chicago, in the President's home \nState. She told the New York Times that she has a small brain aneurysm \nthat needs monitoring.\n  She tells her story in an article the New York Times published on \nOctober 17 under the headline ``Unable to Meet the Deductible Or the \nDoctor.'' Patricia has a health insurance plan through ObamaCare that \nhas an annual deductible of $6,000, so she has to pay for most of her \nmedical expenses up to that amount. Because of that, she says she is \nskipping this year's brain scan and hoping for the best. She says: ``A \n$6,000 deductible--that's just staggering.''\n  This is the kind of person ObamaCare was supposed to help. And \nchanging the name of ObamaCare, as Kathleen Sebelius has recommended \ntoday, isn't going to solve the problems for this patient with the \n$6,000 deductible. She got the insurance, she got the coverage, but she \nstill cannot get care, and that is a fundamental problem with this \nhealth care law.\n  The other thing this New York Times article points out is that people \ncan't meet their deductibles, and they also can't meet their doctor. \nPatricia told the newspaper that if she switches to a policy with a \nlower deductible next year, she will get a smaller network of doctors, \nwhich means she will lose access to the specialists taking care of her.\n  A lot of people are finding that they are in the same situation--\nlosing access to their doctors. Sometimes it is because the insurance \nhas these narrow networks of health care providers. Sometimes it is \njust because the doctors are so overburdened that you can't get an \nappointment.\n  There was an Associated Press report that came out over the weekend, \nthe title was: ``Health Law Impacts Primary Care Doc Shortage.'' We \nalready knew there was a shortage of primary care doctors in the \ncountry, also a shortage of specialists, also a shortage of nurses. The \nPresident's health care law has made it worse.\n  The Associated Press article quoted an insurance agent in California \nnamed Anthony Halby, who says he has clients tell him that their \nObamaCare plan made it extremely difficult for them to find primary \ncare doctors. As he says, ``Coverage does not equal access.''\n  He is advising his clients to skip ObamaCare next year and pay more \nfor insurance with a broader network so they can at least see the \ndoctors they want, the doctors they choose, the doctors they need.\n  He tells people:\n\n       The premiums are going to be higher because there's no \n     subsidy. However, I'm going to guarantee you can [actually] \n     keep your doctor.\n\n  So people are finding they are paying more, when they were promised \nby President Obama, by the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi that they \nwould pay less. But she is the same one who said: First you have to \npass it before you get to find out what is in it.\n  So people are having to put off care they need because Washington \nsays they have to pay for things they don't want, they don't need, and \nthey can't afford. People are finding out that coverage isn't the same \nas care, and millions of people are finding out they can't meet their \ndeductible or their doctor.\n  That is not what the American people wanted from health care reform. \nPeople wanted access to the care they need, from a doctor they choose, \nat lower cost. That is what they wanted. Instead, what they got are all \nthese new Washington mandates, all these new expenses, all these new \nproblems.\n  What was the President's solution to that? He said: Put more people \non Medicaid. He told Governors around the country to expand the \nMedicaid Program--make sure people have gotten on Medicaid.\n  We know that is a system that has been broken for a long time. The \nquestion we continue to ask is: Can somebody who has gotten a Medicaid \ncard printed up and given to them or sent to them, can they actually \nsee a doctor?\n  The Department of Health and Human Services says: Don't worry about \nthat. What did the inspector general say this week? Yesterday in the \nNew York Times: ``Half of Doctors Listed as Serving Medicaid Patients \nAre Unavailable, Investigation Finds.''\n  Who did the investigation? The inspector general of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services.\n  So even though Health and Human Services says all of these doctors \nare available to take care of Medicaid patients, their own inspector \ngeneral of the Department says not true--not true. Only half of the \ndoctors listed as serving Medicaid patients are available.\n  This is what we are dealing with. That is why Republicans are going \nto vote to repeal the entire health care law. Meanwhile, we will also \nvote to strip away the worst and most destructive parts of the law: \nthings such as the arbitrary 30-hour workweek which has been damaging \nto part-time workers across the country; things such as the unfair \nmedical device tax that sends American jobs overseas, threatens \nlifesaving innovation.\n  The Republicans are going to talk about finally giving people \nchoices. That is what people want with health care. They want choices. \nThey want availability. They want affordability. That is what they are \nlooking for--available, affordable care and choices, not more \nWashington mandates--and, finally, giving access to the health care \npeople wanted all along.\n  Kathleen Sebelius may come out and give a lecture on lessons of \nleadership. Changing the name of this health care law from ObamaCare to \nanything else isn't going to make it any better for the people across \nthis country who are finding out that the President's promises were \nempty promises; that they have been intentionally deceived as to the \nway this health care law was presented and passed, and now they find \nout their insurance is less affordable, their costs of care are going \nup, the availability of that care is going down, and they have lost \ntheir choices.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, the bill before the Senate today at once \nrepresents the best of our Nation and some of the worst of Washington. \nOn the one hand, the primary purpose of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, or NDAA, represents the best of America. In past \nyears it has been one of the few very consistently bipartisan pieces of \nlegislation considered by the Senate, and it usually has been afforded \nlengthy debate and open and transparent amendment process on the floor. \nThat is because it is one of the most important and solemn duties of \nCongress to provide for our national defense.\n  The United States of America has the best armed services the world \nhas ever seen, not just because of what they do, but because of who \nthey are: honest, courageous, selfless patriots who love our country \nand have dedicated themselves to protecting and defending our way of \nlife.\n  Of all the bills that come before Congress, the NDAA deserves to be \ntreated with the kind of integrity and respect with which our military \npersonnel approach their jobs. And yet the process that has unfolded \nthis year in connection with the NDAA has fallen fall short of the \nstandard that our armed personnel have set forth. Congress has waited \nuntil the last minute to conduct our most important business, using the \nholidays to fabricate a false sense of urgency. The Senate majority \nleader has refused to allow an open and transparent debate, shutting \ndown our ability to offer amendments on the Senate floor to this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  Finally, only a privileged few Members of Congress have a hand in \ndrafting this bill, which was cobbled together with numerous extraneous \nprovisions behind closed doors.\n  What used to be an exception to the typical legislative process, the \ntypical legislative sausage making for which Washington has become \nfamous, has been subsumed by the status quo, and it is exactly what is \nwrong with Washington today.\n  Each one of us as Members of Congress is here for just one reason: We\n\n[[Page S6496]]\n\nhave been elected to represent and serve the American people. \nUnfortunately, the twisted, tainted process that has produced this bill \nprevents all of us from carrying out this responsibility, and it \nthreatens our obligation to do what is right for our men and women in \nuniform.\n  As the title suggests, the National Defense Authorization Act is \nsupposed to be a relatively straightforward, largely noncontroversial \nbill. It is the primary legislative instrument for Congress to exercise \nits constitutional power granted in article 1, section 8 of the \nConstitution which is to provide for the common defense. But that is \nnot what we are voting on today; that is not what we are considering in \nconnection with this bill.\n  This bill, the NDAA for fiscal year 2015, is a legislative hodgepodge \nthat includes those straightforward noncontroversial items that almost \nall of us support, but also numerous other provisions that are entirely \nunrelated to national defense.\n  Most egregiously, the drafters secretly added 68 unrelated bills \npertaining to the use of Federal lands--the so-called lands package \nportion of this bill. They put that into this bill without any \nopportunity for debate or for a vote on any of those 68 independent \nbills. None of these bills were included in the version of the NDAA \nthat the Senate Armed Services Committee debated and voted on in May of \nthis year, because had any Member tried to include them in the normal \nprocess of our committee, they clearly would have been ruled out of the \ncommittee's jurisdiction.\n  Another outlier in this legislative grab bag is a provision \nreauthorizing a Defense Department program to train and equip \n``moderate'' Syrian rebels for the next 2 years.\n  Now we have testimony from some of America's top military leaders \nwarning us of the immense risks involved in this program. They have \ntold us there is no way to guarantee these efforts won't backfire, \nfurther embroiling the U.S. military in volatile and unpredictable \nparts of the world--in the Middle East, in conflicts in that part of \nthe world. Yet here we are, forced to reauthorize this risky program in \norder to provide for our troops and the Defense Department.\n  The authority for this program was first added to the NDAA in the \nclosed committee markup process in May and then later attached to the \nmust-pass spending bill in September, giving Senators the all-or-\nnothing choice of either approving this controversial program or voting \nagainst all other government spending. This is not how Congress is \nsupposed to work.\n  Congress is supposed to evaluate, debate, and amend individual pieces \nof legislation based on their own merits, with enough time to inform \nand educate the American people about what their representatives are \ndoing. Instead, it is politics as usual in Washington. Rather than an \nopen, transparent, and inclusive process, several extraneous and \nsometimes controversial provisions were added to the NDAA at the last \nminute by a select few operating entirely behind closed doors.\n  As we have come to expect from the outgoing majority in the Senate, \nonce the bill appears from behind those closed doors, the American \npeople are denied any real debate or even a chance to read, let alone \nunderstand, the bill.\n  This is a shame, because there are good bipartisan amendments out \nthere, such as the Due Process Guarantee Act, an amendment that Senator \nFeinstein and I attempted to offer for the Senate's consideration, \nwhich would improve the 2015 NDAA by prohibiting the indefinite \ndetention of U.S. persons. Even though the Due Process Guarantee Act \nreceived 67 votes of support in the last Congress, it continues to be \nblocked by these privileged few who cobbled together this bill.\n  Now at the eleventh hour we are told we have to vote for everything \nin this legislative medley or vote for none of it. After deliberately \nallowing time to expire, up to the final moments before the holiday, \nthe Senate majority leader has told the American people that the only \nway to support our soldiers is to support a distorted legislative \nprocess and controversial items that have never been debated in public. \nOur soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, and others who serve us in \nthe pursuit of our national security interests deserve better.\n  Many of my colleagues have said that this is a ``must-pass'' bill. I \nwould put it slightly differently. I would say we must pass legislation \nwithout political gimmicks or procedural games that enable men and \nwomen serving our Defense Department to fulfill their missions. We \nabsolutely must pay our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, and \nauthorize our national defense budget as a matter of constitutional \nresponsibility, national security, and moral duty. We must do these \nthings. But not like this. I fear that we in the Senate have perhaps \nbecome far too comfortable with the idea that the most important issues \nsuch as paying our troops, funding our Defense Department, sending our \nsons and daughters halfway around the world into harm's way--that it is \nsomehow OK to bend the rules to a breaking point and we allow our \ncolleagues to hijack funding for our men and women in uniform to pass \ntheir unrelated political priorities.\n  There is no doubt that it is easier this way--easier, that is, for \nSenators. It is easier to outsource our representative duties to a \nselect few and to avoid debate on the tough topics that come up along \nthe way. But that doesn't make it right. As our courageous \nservicemembers and their families know, easier is rarely best.\n  The rules governing how a bill becomes a law are not optional. They \nare not arbitrary, either. They exist for a good reason: to ensure that \nthe will of the American people is heard and followed. If we fail to \nadhere to the rules, then we fail in the duties we were elected to \ncarry out, and we fail to be a truly representative democracy. But \nthese rules are not self-enforcing. Writing them down doesn't make them \nso. Unless we hold them true in our hearts and in our minds and in our \nactions, they will be nothing more than words on paper, mere parchment \nbarriers, as James Madison put it.\n  If we as an institution can accept a legislative process driven by \nbackroom deals rather than fair and inclusive debate when we are \ndealing with the most important issues, then when are we ever going to \ndo things the right way?\n  We can do better. The American people and especially those serving in \nuniform deserve better; and as we saw in the recent elections, the \nAmerican people demand we do better. I think we can and we must.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The majority whip.\n\n\n      SSCI Study of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, many people think that Congress is \nirrelevant, unimportant, and wastes time with the floor speeches that \ngo nowhere. Yesterday on the floor of the Senate something historic \noccurred. Standing right back here, the senior Senator from California, \nSenator Dianne Feinstein, delivered to Congress and to the Nation a \nreport on the use of torture by the United States of America. Seated on \nthis side was Senator Jay Rockefeller who, as the predecessor and \nchairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, initiated this \ninvestigation into the use of torture. Her speech, which lasted about \nan hour, was followed by Senator John McCain, who stood up and \napplauded her for releasing this report.\n  It is worthy of note that what happened on the floor of this Senate \nyesterday was an assertion of constitutional principles that goes back \nto the founding of this country. It was an assertion of the three \nbranches of government and their authority, and the authority of \nCongress to oversee the executive branch of government, and it got down \nto basics. Let's remember how we reached the point where this report \nwas put together and delivered to the American people.\n  I will say at the outset that before I came to this job, I used to \npractice law and occasionally I would go into a courtroom. I really \nwaited for that moment when I could turn to the jury and say: I want to \nlet you know that my opponent in this case destroyed evidence, and I \nwant to let you know why my opponent destroyed evidence--because what \nwas in that evidence was so terrible they would rather leave it to your \nspeculation of how bad it was than actually to let you read it. That is \nwhat started this debate which led to\n\n[[Page S6497]]\n\nthe report. What happened was the Central Intelligence Agency destroyed \nvideotapes of the interrogation of prisoners. After it was discovered \nthat they destroyed them, the Senate Intelligence Committee asked: Why \ndid you destroy those videotapes? They said: Because Congress never \nasked for them. The Intelligence Committee said: We didn't know they \nexisted.\n  At that point the Central Intelligence Agency said to the Senate \nIntelligence Committee: We did nothing wrong, and we invite you, \nthrough your staff and members of the committee, to review the cables \nand emails within the Central Intelligence Agency which prove our case. \nIt proves we did nothing wrong.\n  I think the CIA was surprised and shocked when the Senate \nIntelligence Committee took up their invitation. It meant, I \nunderstand, 5 years of work. They reviewed some 6 million pages of \ninformation. Two staffers from the Senate Intelligence Committee sat in \nwhat they call the cave day after day after day, poring through emails \nand cables to try to reconstruct what happened after 9/11 when the \nCentral Intelligence Agency was interrogating prisoners. It wasn't an \neasy task. It was made even more difficult when we came to learn that \nthe Central Intelligence Agency hacked into the computers of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee. It was a tough confrontation between two \nbranches of government, and it is one that resulted, I think, in the \nright ending when Senator Feinstein, and the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, following the lead of Senator Rockefeller, stepped forward \nand produced this report.\n  I will reflect for a minute on how we reached this point, but first I \nwill tell you that this report concluded that the CIA repeatedly misled \nsenior officials in the Bush and Obama White Houses about detention and \ninterrogation programs. The report said the CIA falsely told the \nJustice Department that techniques such as waterboarding helped to \nobtain lifesaving information that kept our country safe.\n  The report said the CIA detained more individuals and subjected more \nindividuals to abusive interrogation techniques than it ever disclosed \nto Congress or the President. The CIA did not disclose the use of \nbrutal interrogation techniques that went way beyond what even the \ntorture memo of the previous administration had authorized.\n  It is worth noting what brought us to this point, and of course, it \nwas the tragic, horrible events of September 11. After that occurrence, \nthe Bush administration unilaterally decided to set aside treaties and \nlaws that have served us in the past. President Bush's then-White House \ncounsel, Alberto Gonzales, recommended to President Bush that the \nPresident ignore the requirements of the Geneva Conventions. The Geneva \nConventions were treaties that grew out of World War II and established \nrules of warfare to protect soldiers and civilians. These treaties were \nratified by the United States of America. They are and were the law of \nthe land.\n  Colin Powell, who was Secretary of State under President Bush, \nobjected to Alberto Gonzales's recommendation. He argued that we could \ncomply with the Geneva Conventions, fight terrorism, and still keep \nAmerica safe.\n  Here is what Secretary Powell said at the time about setting aside \nthe Geneva Conventions. This ``will reverse over a century of U.S. \npolicy and practice . . . undermine the protections of the law of war \nfor our own troops. . . . It will undermine public support among \ncritical allies, making military cooperation more difficult to \nmaintain.''\n  Today, Secretary Powell's words seem prophetic. Unfortunately, \nPresident Bush rejected Secretary Powell's advice and instead followed \nAlberto Gonzales's recommendations to set aside the Geneva Conventions.\n  Then in August 2002, the Department of Justice issued the infamous \ntorture memo. The memo said abuse only rises to the level of torture if \nit causes pain equivalent to organ failure or death. The memo also \nconcluded the President has the authority to order the use of torture \neven though that torture would be a crime under U.S. law.\n\n  The Justice Department of the United States also signed off on the \nuse of torture techniques such as waterboarding. This was in August of \n2002. Thanks to the Intelligence Committee report, we now know that the \nJustice Department's legal advice was based on false information given \nto them by the CIA.\n  I have a long history with this issue. It was almost 10 years ago \nthat I stood at this very desk and read into the Record a graphic \ndescription of an FBI agent's record of abuse of interrogation that she \nwitnessed at Guantanamo Bay. At the time I was criticized by members of \nthe Bush-Cheney administration, but we now know that the description by \nthis FBI agent was accurate, and what she described was authorized by \nthe Bush administration based on false information provided by the CIA.\n  It was 10 years ago when I first authored legislation to ban cruel, \ninhuman, and degrading treatment of detainees. In June of 2004 America \nwas shocked by the revelations about what had occurred at Abu Ghraib \nprison. The Bush administration told us these were rogue actions of a \nfew bad players. I introduced my torture legislation in 2004. I wanted \nto make it clear that America condemned the abuses at Abu Ghraib and \nstood by our commitment to the humane treatment of prisoners. But what \nwe didn't know was that the administration had approved the use of \nabusive interrogation techniques in CIA facilities and at Guantanamo \nBay. A Defense Department investigation later concluded that these \ntechniques migrated to Abu Ghraib.\n  I offered my legislation as an amendment to the defense authorization \nbill. I expected it to be noncontroversial. It was adopted unanimously \nhere in the Senate; however, the Bush administration had it removed in \nconference.\n  In the fall of 2004, I tried again. I offered the same amendment to \nthe 9/11 commission intelligence reform legislation. Again, my \namendment was adopted unanimously by the Senate, and again in \nconference negotiations the Bush administration removed it. I didn't \nunderstand their opposition to my amendment because the United States \nratified the torture convention, a treaty that prohibits cruel, \ninhuman, and degrading treatment, the same thing my amendment said.\n  A few months later, I had an opportunity to get to the bottom of \nthis. Alberto Gonzales, President Bush's White House counsel, was \nnominated to be Attorney General. During his confirmation hearings in \nJanuary 2005, Mr. Gonzales told me the administration believed they had \nlegal authority to subject detainees to cruel, inhuman, and degrading \ntreatment. That was the first time that a Bush administration official \nhad acknowledged this legal loophole. The Washington Post called that \ntestimony ``a gross distortion of the law'' and cited it as a key \nreason for opposing the Gonzales nomination to be Attorney General.\n  After this revelation, Senator McCain asked me if he could take the \nlead on legislation that I had written to ban cruel, inhuman, and \ndegrading treatment. I agreed. There was no better person than John \nMcCain, who in service to the United States of America was a prisoner \nof war in Vietnam for more than 5 years. He had been subjected to \ntorture because of his service on behalf of our Nation. It became known \nas the McCain torture amendment. Despite a veto threat from President \nBush, the Senate passed the McCain torture amendment in December of \n2005 by an overwhelming bipartisan 90-to-9 vote. When the President \nsigned the amendment into law, he issued a signing statement reserving \nthe right to ignore it if he chose.\n  In June 2006, in the Hamdan decision, the Supreme Court held that the \nadministration was required to follow the Geneva Conventions in its \ntreatment of detainees. The Court took the same position as Secretary \nColin Powell had argued years before when President Bush had first \ndecided to disregard the Geneva Conventions.\n  In September 2006 President Bush publicly acknowledged the CIA \ndetention and interrogation program for the very first time.\n  In July 2007 President Bush signed an Executive order stating the \nCIA's detention and interrogation program ``fully complies with the \nobligations of the United States'' under the Geneva Conventions and \nauthorizing the use of certain interrogation techniques. Again, the \nadministration twisted the law to justify the use of abusive tactics\n\n[[Page S6498]]\n\nbased on false information provided by the CIA.\n  In October 2007 the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on the \nnomination of Michael Mukasey to be Attorney General. The hearings were \ngoing smoothly until I asked Mr. Mukasey to condemn waterboarding as \ntorture. He refused. That became the focal point of the debate on his \nconfirmation.\n\n  On December 6, 2007, the New York Times reported that in November \n2005 the CIA had destroyed videotapes showing the CIA's use of abusive \ninterrogation techniques. The next day I sent a letter to Attorney \nGeneral Mukasey asking the Justice Department to open a criminal \ninvestigation into the destruction of CIA interrogation video evidence. \nI was the only Member of Congress to call for that investigation. In \nJanuary the Attorney General opened the investigation. The CIA's \ndestruction of these videotapes is what led to this Intelligence \nCommittee report.\n  Then-CIA Director Hayden suggested that the Intelligence Committee \nstaff review the operational cables and emails. The Intelligence \nCommittee study was authorized by an overwhelming 14-to-1 bipartisan \nvote after the SSCI, the Select Committee on Intelligence, found that \nthe cables detailed detention conditions and interrogations far worse \nthan what the CIA had previously described to the committee.\n  The investigation led to the production of a report that is more than \n6,700 pages long, including nearly 38,000 footnotes. It is based on a \nreview of more than 6 million pages of CIA records.\n  In December 2012 the Intelligence Committee approved this report with \na 9-to-6 bipartisan vote. Two months later, in February 2013, I \nreceived a briefing on this report before it was redacted. I was so \ndisturbed by what I heard that I personally spoke with the President, \nthen-Secretary of Defense Panetta, and John Brennan, to urge each of \nthem to do everything possible to be briefed on its findings and \nsupport its declassification.\n  In March 2014 I sent a letter to CIA Director Brennan raising serious \nconcerns about the CIA's hacking of Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence computers and again urging declassification of the report.\n  In April 2014 the Intelligence Committee approved the \ndeclassification and the public release by an 11-to-3 bipartisan vote.\n  It is critically important that this has been declassified so the \nAmerican people can understand what has been done in their name. It was \ninconsistent with American values. It didn't make us safer, and it must \nnever be repeated again.\n  Yesterday Senator McCain came to the floor to support Senator \nFeinstein's disclosure. During the course of his statement on the \nfloor, he said: Our enemies are acting without conscience. America \ncannot act without conscience. We are called to a higher standard than \nsome because we believe in basic human values and in basic principles, \nand it may mean that some of the tactics used by our worst enemies are \nout of bounds for us, as they should be.\n  What happened with this disclosure is an important reaffirmation of \nour separation of powers and our constitutional responsibility.\n  I wish to congratulate Senator Feinstein, Senator Rockefeller, and \nevery member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, but \nparticularly those who voted to go forward time and time again. They \nwere under immense pressure not to do so.\n  The fact they have held the CIA accountable to the American people, \nto Congress, and to the President is part of our constitutional \nresponsibility. It reminds people that in a democracy the people govern \nand the people have a right to know what this government is doing in \ntheir name.\n  There has been a lot of debate since the release of this report, and \nI assume it will continue. But if it ends with the report in the press, \nwe have not done enough. We have to reform our processes, and let me \nstart with Congress.\n  I served on the Senate Intelligence Committee for 4 years. It was a \ndaunting assignment. Virtually every hearing is behind closed doors and \nclassified. No one knows here even at the Select Committee on \nIntelligence unless you tell them afterwards. Testimony before us isn't \navailable to the public. Most of the time, the professionals from the \nintelligence agencies come before us and speak in the acronyms of their \nagencies to the point you can't even follow what they are saying. It \ntook me 2 years of sitting there puzzling over what they were saying to \nfinally get an insight into what the committee and its responsibility \nwere all about. That is not right.\n  We need to make sure that congressional oversight of our intelligence \nfunction is up to the job and up to the Constitution. That means more \nresources put in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. When I \nserved, members of the committee shared a staffer. We each shared a \nstaffer. We didn't even have one staff person working for each of us on \nthese subjects. The amount of money that is being spent, tens of \nmillions of dollars in covert activities and the like, needs to be \ncarefully monitored. As the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee \non Defense, I have that responsibility to look at the overall budget on \nintelligence. There is not enough oversight. We need to make certain \nthat our branch of government is up to that challenge so we can \nguarantee to the American people that we are doing our job, so that we \ncan be held accountable as we hold the intelligence agencies \naccountable as well.\n  I think what happened yesterday is going to be part of the history of \nthe Senate, an important, positive part. I hope it is just the \nbeginning where both political parties come together and accept their \nconstitutional responsibility.\n\n\n                     Tributes to Departing Senators\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have some tributes here for my colleagues who are \nretiring, leaving the Senate. It is a lengthy list of tributes.\n\n\n                               Tom Harkin\n\n  To Senator Tom Harkin, neighboring State of Iowa, whom I worked with \nover many years on so many important topics, I want to salute him for \nhis service. The highlights of his service include the Americans With \nDisabilities Act and, of course, the Affordable Care Act. His work on \neducation and medical research is legendary. There was a time when Tom \nHarkin and Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania at that time, set \nout to double the medical research budget at the National Institutes of \nHealth and they did it. Lives have been saved, people have been spared \nsuffering because they had the political determination and courage to \nachieve it. I am going to miss Tom Harkin.\n  I have served in Congress for a number of years and I have heard an \nawful lot of speeches. One of the most powerful speeches I ever \nwitnessed in this Senate was delivered by Tom Harkin in 1990. He gave \nhis speech without uttering a single word. He delivered it entirely in \nAmerican Sign Language--a language he knows from years of communicating \nwith his brother Frank, who was deaf. In that historic speech in sign \nlanguage--a first for this body--Tom Harkin was urging the United \nStates Senate to pass the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  The ADA is one of the great civil rights laws of the 20th century. It \nis often called ``the Emancipation Proclamation for Americans with \ndisabilities.'' It is a landmark achievement in America's ongoing \nefforts to create a more perfect union. No one worked harder for its \npassage than the senior Senator from Iowa, Tom Harkin. He is often and \nrightly referred to as ``the father of the ADA.''\n\n  That speech in 1990 was unique in its use of sign language. In \nanother way, however, it was like nearly every speech Tom Harkin has \ngiven because he was speaking for people whose voices too often are not \nheard in Congress.\n  In his 40 years in Congress, Tom Harkin has been a passionate, often \nfiery and relentless voice for good people who have often been dealt a \nbad hand by life. He has been a champion for men like his father, a \ncoal miner with black lung disease, and others who desperately need \nhealth care. He has been a champion for people with disabilities--in \nAmerica and around the world. He has been a champion of children in \nforeign lands who are trapped in the worst forms of forced labor.\n\n[[Page S6499]]\n\n  Tom Harkin has been a champion of working men and women in this \ncountry--and of their constitutionally protected right to organize and \nbargain for decent pay and safe working conditions.\n  Tom Harkin has been a leader in safeguarding Medicare and Social \nSecurity, and moving people from welfare to work.\n  The senior Senator from Iowa and I were both very lucky. We are \nfirst-generation Americans. Senator Harkin's mother came to this \ncountry from Slovenia; my mother came from Lithuania.\n  He knows from his own family's experience the love and gratitude that \nso many immigrants feel for the freedoms and opportunities America has \ngiven them and their children. So he has fought for immigration laws \nthat protect America's security at the same time they honor our \nheritage as a nation of immigrants.\n  I want him to know that we will continue our efforts to pass such \nlaws until we succeed--just as we will continue to push for adoption by \nthis Senate of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities until we pass that important treaty.\n  As are so many others, Tom Harkin was inspired to public service by \nthe example of President John Kennedy. After working his way through \ncollege, Senator Harkin spent 5 years as a Navy pilot in the 1960s. He \nhad applied to become a pilot for a commercial airline when he received \na more compelling offer. In 1969, an Iowa Congressman invited Tom \nHarkin to join his Washington, DC staff. He said yes. He also used his \nGI Bill benefits to earn a law degree from Catholic University.\n  Tom went back home to Iowa--and then he returned to Washington in \n1974, not as a staffer, but as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives. A decade later, Iowa voters elected him to the U.S. \nSenate. And in 1990 he became the first Democrat ever to be re-elected \nto the U.S. Senate by Iowa voters. They must have thought that was a \ngood idea because they re-elected him three more times after that.\n  Today, 40 years after his first election, Tom Harkin is grayer and \nwiser. But he has never forgotten where he came from. He is a proud \nMidwestern progressive who has never forgotten the hope and dignity \nthat smart, compassionate government gave his family when they needed \nit. And he has never tired of working to make sure that other families \nhave the same chances his family had.\n  I wish Tom and Ruth, their daughters and grandchildren all the best.\n  Tom Harkin leaves a legacy of achievement and compassion. I will miss \nhis presence in this Senate but he and Ruth will always be a part of \nour Senate family.\n\n\n                               Kay Hagan\n\n  Kay Hagan, my colleague from North Carolina, has done an amazing job. \nIn her one term in the Senate, she really made a name for herself when \nit came to public service. She stepped up time and again and took tough \nvotes. I know it because as whip I asked her to take on some important \nissues that would made this a better and stronger nation.\n  When Kay entered the Senate in those perilous days, America was in \ncrisis. The economy was in freefall. Millions had lost their homes to \nforeclosure. America was fighting two wars--and though our military is \nthe finest in the world, many of its members were exhausted from \nmultiple deployments.\n  Six years later, we have made progress in all of these areas. \nHistorians will record that Senator Kay Hagan helped to make America \nstronger and better.\n  Senator Kay Hagan comes from a family that knows a great deal about \nserving and sacrificing for America. Her maternal uncle, Lawton Chiles, \nwas a Korean War veteran who represented Florida in the U.S. House and \nSenate and served as Florida's governor. Her father-in-law was a two-\nstar Marine general, her brother and father both served in the Navy, \nand her husband is a Vietnam veteran who used the GI Bill to help pay \nfor law school.\n  Senator Hagan first learned the ups-and-downs of Congress--\nliterally--by operating the Senators-only elevator while interning for \nher uncle.\n  Senator Hagan is a former ballet dancer--a discipline that demands \ngreat discipline and hard work. As a Senator, she has used those same \nqualities to benefit her State and our Nation.\n  She served 10 years in the North Carolina State Senate and in those \n10 years, she earned a reputation as a commonsense hard-worker \ninterested in results, not partisan fighting. As co-chair of the State \nBudget Committee, she increased the State's ``Rainy Day'' fund and \nbalanced five straight budgets. You heard that right--five straight \nbudgets. She also helped make record investments in education, raised \nteacher pay, and increased the minimum wage.\n  Here in the U.S. Senate, she has continued to be a leader on \neducation issues, most notably helping to lead a group of Senators to \nstart fixing No Child Left Behind. With her family's military \nbackground, it is no surprise that Senator Hagan has fought hard for \nmilitary families and veterans. She introduced another bill that is \nclose to my heart and that I will continue to work for. It would \nprohibit for-profit colleges from using the phrase ``GI Bill'' in \naggressive marketing efforts aimed at separating veterans and \nservicemembers from their hard-earned education benefits. And she led \nthe successful effort to provide health care to those affected by water \ncontamination at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, the largest Marine \nCorps base on the East Coast.\n  Kay Hagan will leave this Senate with a proud record of dauntless \naccomplishment and I am proud to have had the privilege to call her \ncolleague. I thank her for her friendship and service, and I wish her \nthe best in all her future endeavors.\n\n\n                              Mark Begich\n\n  I can't imagine how the Senator from Alaska handles that commute back \nand forth, but he did it. I said the other day when we spoke about his \nservice that many people don't realize his father was a Congressman \nbefore him and he died in a plane crash with Hale Boggs when they were \nflying back to Alaska to appear at an event. That plane was lost and \nnever recovered. When Mark Begich came from Alaska to serve the United \nStates, he completed the journey his father never could complete. His 6 \nyears of service to Alaska have been extraordinary.\n  Before he got into politics, though, Mark was a whiz kid \nentrepreneur. When he was just 16 years old, he got a business license \nand he and his brother opened two businesses: a nightclub for teens and \na vending-machine operation. The business world's loss was our gain.\n  Senator Begich started his political career working as an aide to \nthen-Anchorage Mayor Tony Knowles. At 26, he was elected to the \nAnchorage Assembly, or city council. And in 2003, he became the first \nnative-born Alaskan to serve as mayor of Anchorage.\n  In 2008, he dared to take on an Alaska legend: Senator Ted Stevens. \nWhen the votes were counted, Mark had become the first Democrat since \nMike Gravel in 1981 to represent Alaska in the U.S. Senate.\n  As a Senator, Mark Begich has been a voice for working families in \nAlaska and across America. He has diligently and doggedly pursued \ncommon-sense, bipartisan solutions to big challenges. In all things, \nMark's heart is always with Alaska. He has helped to protect Alaska \nfisheries, promoted renewable energy development in the State, and made \nsure Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson remains strong and active.\n  Here is something about Mark my colleagues may not know. In 2011 he \nwas part of a four-man team in the Hotline's live annual trivia \ncontest. His teammates were three House members: Dennis Ross, Tom \nDavis, and Martin Frost. They were up against a formidable team that \nincluded Chuck Todd and Amy Walters. No one gave Mark's team a prayer \nof winning. But once again, Mark Begich scored an upset victory. He is \nto DC political trivia what Ken Jennings is to Jeopardy: A memorable \nchampion.\n  But the actions for which he will be remembered are very far from \ntrivial. When Mark Begich and others in the Class of 2008 arrived in \nthe Senate America's economy was in freefall. Millions of families had \nlost their homes to foreclosure--the worst foreclosure crisis in \nAmerica since the Great Depression. America was fighting two wars. Our \nmilitary is the finest in the world. Many of its members were\n\n[[Page S6500]]\n\nexhausted from multiple deployments. On top of that, an outdated policy \nof ``don't ask, don't tell'' forced some servicemembers to lie about \nwho they were in order to serve the Nation they love. Time after time, \nSenator Mark Begich took brave and principled votes that have made \nAmerica better and stronger--militarily, economically, and socially.\n  This son of one of Alaska's great families has well earned--and will \nalways hold--a place in our Senate family.\n\n\n                              Tim Johnson\n\n  Tim Johnson and I came to the Senate together, Tim from South Dakota. \nHe eventually became chairman of the banking committee after he faced \none of the toughest physical challenges any Senator has ever faced, a \ndebilitating brain injury that left him physically limited but never \nlimited in spirit and intelligence. Thank God, with Barb at his side, \nhe continued in public service to serve the State of South Dakota.\n  I am going to miss my great friend Tim Johnson.\n  He and I go back quite a ways. We served together in the House--and \nwe came to the Senate together in 1996. That year, Tim Johnson was the \nonly Senate candidate to defeat an incumbent U.S. Senator in a general \nelection.\n  He won that first Senate election the old-fashioned way--with \ndedication, hard work, and a lot of shoe leather. I think he knocked on \nevery door in South Dakota--twice. Dedication, humility, and \nunbelievable hard work--those are the values Tim learned as a fourth-\ngeneration South Dakotan. And they are the values that have exemplified \nhis entire career.\n  In 1986, Tim Johnson was a semi-obscure state legislator from \nVermillion, SD when he decided to run for his State's only seat in the \nU.S. House of Representatives. Tim might have been the only person who \nthought he had a chance of winning that race, but he surprised people. \nHe did win--and he has never lost an election since. Eight consecutive \nstatewide victories and zero losses. That is quite an accomplishment.\n  Here is another interesting fact about Tim Johnson: During his first \nterm in the House, he was responsible for passing more legislation than \nany of the other 50 first-term Members.\n  In his 36 years of public service, Tim Johnson has been a strong \nvoice for family farmers and ranchers in South Dakota and across \nAmerica. He is a longtime advocate of Federal support for renewable \nenergy--especially ethanol and wind energy. He helped lead the effort \nto pass the Country of Origin Label Act--the COOL Act, for short--to \nlet consumers know if the meat they feed their families was raised in \nAmerica.\n  Senator Johnson has been a leading advocate for Native Americans. He \nhas fought especially hard for the members of the Lakota and Dakota \ntribes--descendants of the legendary Indian leaders Sitting Bull and \nCrazy Horse--who call South Dakota home.\n  Tim Johnson has fought for a livable minimum wage. He helped \nstrengthen America's health safety net by voting to create the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program and to expand Medicaid to those who \nneed it. He voted for the Affordable Care Act, which passed this Senate \nwithout a vote to spare. That was a difficult vote for many but I \nbelieve that history will show it was the right vote for America, and \nTim Johnson was on the right side of history.\n  As chairman of the Senate Banking Committee these last 3 years, Tim \nJohnson has played an historic role in helping to implement the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street reform law and prevent a repeat of the kinds of \nabuses that nearly crashed our economy in 2008. He has moved forward \ndespite intense opposition to reform from both inside and outside of \nCongress.\n  One of the most important of the Dodd-Frank reforms was the creation \nof a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Chairman Johnson pressed \nsuccessfully for Senate confirmation of Richard Cordray to head that \nnew bureau so it would have a strong leader at the helm.\n  While he is justifiably proud of the legislative victories that bear \nhis imprint, Tim Johnson may be even more proud of the constituent \nservices he and his staff have given the people of South Dakota. \nHelping a veteran secure a proper disability rating or helping a senior \ncitizen receive the Social Security and Medicare coverage he or she is \ndue may not make headlines, but it makes a huge difference in the lives \nof individuals. Tim Johnson and his staff understand that.\n  I will never forget seeing Tim Johnson walk onto the Senate floor on \nSeptember 5, 2007--less than a year after a brain hemorrhage nearly \nkilled him. The courage and strength it took to come back from such a \ntrauma is hard to imagine. Senator Mark Kirk, my partner from Illinois, \ntold me that during his own recovery from a stroke, if he ever felt \nlike giving up, he would ask himself: ``What would Tim Johnson do?''\n  Dedication to public service is a family trait in the Johnson Family. \nBarb's work on behalf of children and families has made life better for \nso many. Kelsey is an advocate for breast cancer awareness and \nresearch. Brendan is the U.S. Attorney for the District of South \nDakota. And Brooks is in the National Guard following Army service in \nBosnia, Kosovo, South Korea, Afghanistan, and Iraq.\n  Some time ago, the chief and people of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe \nhonored Senator Johnson by bestowing on him a Lakota name. His Lakota \nname is Wacante Ognake. In English, it means ``holds the people in his \nheart.''\n  That is the spirit that has guided Tim Johnson throughout his public \nlife.\n  I wish Tim and Barb the very best in all their future endeavors.\n\n\n             Saxby Chambliss, Tom Coburn, and Mike Johanns\n\n  I want to say a word about three others on the other side of the \naisle who are retiring: Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, Tom Coburn of \nOklahoma, and Mike Johanns of Nebraska. I got to know them when I \ngathered with one of these gangs, as they call them around here, to \ntalk about deficit reduction. We spent more time together trying to \nexplore the Federal budget in ways to reduce our deficit in a \nthoughtful manner so that we really got to know one another and respect \none another.\n  There is a world of difference in our political values and \nphilosophies, but each of them in their own way made a positive \ncontribution toward making this a stronger nation.\n  I remember well the day Senator Chambliss announced that he would not \nlet Grover Norquist and Grover's ``no tax increases ever'' demand \ndictate the terms of a deficit-reduction plan. That needed to be said, \nand it took political courage. Although Senator Chambliss will not be \nwith us when the Senate convenes in January, I hope his example will be \nwith us. And I wish him the best in his future endeavors.\n  Senator Tom Coburn and I come from different parts of the country and \ndifferent ends of the political spectrum, but we found there is a lot \nwe agree on. I have always believed, as Senators Paul Douglas and Paul \nSimon said, that being a liberal doesn't mean you have to be a \n``wastrel.'' Senator Coburn knows that being a conservative and \nprotecting America's economy demands more than blind budget-cutting. \nHis nickname is ``Doctor No,'' but when it comes to wishing him well as \nhe steps down from the Senate, my colleagues join me in a resounding \n``yes.''\n  Finally, here is a suggestion for when you have watched all of the \n``shouting head'' political TV talk shows you can take: Listen to \nSenator Mike Johanns. Mike's quiet, reasonable approach was a real \nasset not only to the Gang of Eight negotiations, but to the entire \nSenate. We will miss his calm demeanor and his good-faith efforts to \nfind smart, fair solutions to tough challenges.\n  None of them is running for re-election so I can't hurt them \npolitically by saying that I regard each of these Senators as friends. \nThey showed political courage when partisanship would have been easier.\n  I wish them the best in all their future endeavors.\n\n\n                               Carl Levin\n\n  Last night it was my honor to salute Carl Levin of Michigan for his \n36 years of service in the U.S. Senate. He has done so many things so \nwell. As chairman of the Armed Services Committee, he has produced this \ncontentious and challenging bill year after year, both as ranking \nmember and as chairman. As chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, he really raised that subcommittee to a new\n\n[[Page S6501]]\n\nlevel. He tackled some of the most complex issues of our day, \nparticularly when it came to corporate abuse. He spent the time to get \nthe facts right. When he had a hearing, he made an extraordinary \ncontribution to the public dialogue about reforming our law and making \nthis a better nation.\n  When I was first elected to the Senate, people back home said to me: \nWell, now that you have been in the Senate a year or two, which \nSenators do you respect the most?\n  I said then, and I will repeat it today, if I had a tough, important \ndecision, one I was wrestling over, an issue or a vote, and I could \nonly reach out to a couple of Senators at the time, one would be Paul \nSarbanes of Maryland, now retired, and the other is Carl Levin. That is \nstill a fact.\n  Long before Carl Levin was elected to the U.S. Senate it was clear \nthat he had a gift for politics. Picture this--true story: At Central \nHigh School in Detroit, Carl Levin was elected class president. He won \nthat race after, as he tells it, ``running around with a piece of \nmatzoh telling other students: `This is what happens to bread without \nLevin.' ``How's that for a slogan?\n  As much as I hate to think about it, soon we will have a United \nStates Senate without Levin--for the first time in 36 years. Our only \nconsolation is that Carl Levin leaves a legacy of good and important \nlaws. He also leaves a powerful example of what can be achieved when we \nchoose integrity over ideology . . . and our common good over \nconfrontation.\n  A Jewish publication in Detroit wrote a while back that Carl Levin \nand his brother, Congressman Sandy Levin, both deserve ``honorable \nmenschen awards''--with the accent on ``mensch''--for their historic \nservice to our Nation. I agree wholeheartedly. Senator Levin's keen \nintellect, honesty and fair-mindedness--his decency and unfailing \ncivility--have earned him the respect of Senators on both sides of the \naisle.\n  Many years ago I was an intern for a great Senator, Senator Paul \nDouglas of Illinois. Every year now, the University of Illinois \npresents a ``Paul Douglas Ethics in Government Award'' to an elected \nleader who shares Senator Douglas' deep commitment to social and \neconomic justice, and efficient government. The recipient of the Paul \nDouglas Ethics in Government Award in 2006 was Senator Carl Levin. Paul \nDouglas would have approved that choice heartily.\n  As was Paul Douglas, Carl Levin has been a foot soldier for justice. \nPaul Douglas was a leader in the effort to pass a strong Federal Civil \nRights Act. In 1964, the year that law finally passed, Carl Levin was \nappointed the first general counsel for the Michigan Civil Rights \nCommission.\n  Paul Douglas believed in government and he hated government waste. He \nused to say: ``You don't have to be a wastrel to be a liberal.'' Carl \nLevin reminds us that: ``There are some things that only government can \ndo, so we need government. But we don't need an inefficient, wasteful, \narrogant government.''\n  Carl Levin was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1978. Before that, he \nwas active for 15 years in Detroit and Michigan State politics. He \ntaught law before he entered politics. He also held some other \ninteresting jobs--including driving a cab in Detroit and working on a \nDeSoto assembly line.\n  He showed up in Washington in 1979 driving a 1974 Dodge Dart with a \nhole in the floorboard. He was still driving that same car to the \nCapitol 10 years later. That tells us something about Carl Levin's \ndevotion to the US auto industry, its workers and unions.\n  When General Motors and Chrysler faced potential collapse in 2008, he \npressed Congress and a new president to support the companies with \nbillions of dollars in loans.\n  Those loans have since been repaid and Chrysler and GM are not only \nsolvent, they are making a profit. The U.S. auto industry is in the \nmidst of its fastest expansion since 1950.\n  Carl Levin is a champion as well of America's military, military \nfamilies and veterans. He has served on the Armed Services Committee \nsince coming to the Senate 36 years ago. He is one of Congress's most \nrespected voices on national security and military issues.\n  Some years back he used his power on the Armed Services Committee to \nquestion the procurement practices of the military. He asked: Why was \nthe Pentagon spending thousands of dollars apiece for things like \ntoilet seats and hammers? He said: We need more money for soldiers and \nless wasteful spending for contractors. With the world growing more \nvolatile and complex and increasing pressure to reduce defense budgets, \nthose are questions we must all be willing to ask.\n  As a ranking member and then chair of the Senate's Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, Senator Levin's piercing intellect and \nhis patient mastery of complex issues helped, over and over, to expose \nand correct serious wrongdoing.\n  As PSI chairman in 2002, he led a probe of the activities of Enron \nCorp; the investigation resulted in legislation to improve the accuracy \nand reliability of corporate disclosures.\n  From white collar crime, to money laundering, abusive tax shelters, \nand gasoline and crude oil price-gouging, he has pursued the subjects \nof every investigation with nonpartisan vigor, seeking results, not \nspotlights.\n  The list of laws bearing his imprint is long and historic: The \nCompetition in Contracting Act of 1984; Social Security Disability \nBenefits Reform, 1984; The Anti-Kickback Enforcement Act, 1986; The \nWhistleblower Protection Act, 1989; The Ethics Reform Act in 1989; The \nLobbying Disclosure Act in 1995--the first major lobbying reform in 50 \nyears.\n  The list goes on and on. Senator Levin voted: To repeal ``Don't Ask, \nDon't Tell''; to protect voting rights; and to limit the influence of \nprivate-interest money in elections.\n  He has voted to support American manufacturing--and stop giving tax \nbreaks to corporations to ship American jobs overseas.\n  He supported my efforts to change bankruptcy laws to allow deserving \nhomeowners to save their homes in foreclosures.\n  He voted to regulate tobacco as a drug--another issue that is \npersonal for me.\n  I will always remember Senator Levin's vote on the Iraq war \nresolution. For years before 9/11, he warned anyone who would listen \nthat America was threatened by terrorism. When the horrific attacks \ncame, he supported pursuing the attackers in Afghanistan.\n  A year later, he and I were among just 23 Senators to vote against \nthe Iraq War. He voted no, even though he was then chair of the Armed \nServices Committee. That took extraordinary moral and political \ncourage, and history has shown he was right.\n  Carl Levin is the longest-serving Senator in Michigan history, \nsurpassing another Senate legend, Arthur Vandenberg. As he proved long \nago when he was elected president of his high school council, he is a \nnatural-born politician. But like Senator Vandenberg, he is more than a \npolitician; he is a statesman.\n  I will miss his presence in this Senate and I wish him, and his wife \nBarbara, all the best in the future.\n\n\n                               Mark Udall\n\n  Mark Udall, my friend from Colorado and the Presiding Officer's \ncolleague. As I said last night, I served with his dad. His dad may \nhave been the funniest public servant I ever served with. What a wit, \nwhat a sense of humor. He once said: If you have politics in your \nbloodstream, only embalming fluid will replace it.\n  Thank goodness the Udalls have politics in their bloodstream. Mo \nUdall served in the House of Representatives, candidate for President; \nMark Udall's uncle, Stewart Udall, who was Secretary of Interior under \nPresident John Kennedy; Tom Udall, Mark's cousin, the son of Stewart \nUdall, serves as Senator of New Mexico; Mark Udall himself, what a \ngreat person.\n  I can remember so many things about his public service, but I \nremembered, especially last night, when he lost his brother and came \nbefore our caucus lunch and talked about the love he had for that man \nand what that loss meant to him. It touched the heart of everyone in \nthe room. It gave us an insight into the heart of Mark Udall as a \nperson.\n  He was committed to a number of causes. His wife Maggie and he have \ngiven so much time to the environment and preserving our national \nheritage, but he also showed great courage when it came to his service \non the Senate Intelligence Committee. Even as a new\n\n[[Page S6502]]\n\nmember of that committee, he stepped up for principles and values, and \nI am glad he did, preserving our rights and liberties as American \ncitizens and fully supporting the disclosure that Senator Feinstein \nmade yesterday with her report.\n  Mark has fought to protect Americans' privacy rights with thoughtful \nreforms of the NSA and the PATRIOT Act.\n  In keeping with his family's tradition, he has made protecting our \nenvironment and our precious natural resources a top priority. He has \nbeen a leader in addressing climate change as a growing threat to our \nnational security. He organized support in the Senate for legislation \nthat would require 15 percent of electricity to be generated from \nrenewable sources by 2021.\n  And in the 2013 Defense Authorization Act, Mark Udall led the effort \nto allow the Pentagon to continue to develop and use renewable energy\n  During his one term, Mark Udall made more dauntless decisions and \nachieved more good for America than many Senators who have served far \nlonger.\n  He supported a recovery act that helped turn the tide against the \nworst economic downturn since the Great Depression. He voted for the \nmost far-reaching financial reform since the Great Depression and he \nsupported one of the biggest investments in college affordability since \nthe GI Bill. Millions of Americans are back at work and millions of \nAmericans know the security that comes with affordable health care, in \npart, because of his courage.\n  The famed explorer Edmund Hillary once said, ``Human life is far more \nimportant than just getting to the top of a mountain.''\n  For Mark Udall, being a U.S. Senator has been about something more \nimportant than acquiring power. It has been about using that power to \npreserve our precious natural treasures and make life better for \nothers.\n  Mo Udall would be proud of the U.S. Senator his son has become, and I \nam certainly proud to have worked with him.\n  I have been in the Senate now for 18 years, and I have seen many come \nand go. But we have lost, sadly, in this departure of these Members \nsome of our best.\n\n\n                             Mary Landrieu\n\n  I will close by mentioning the one whose fate was determined the \nlast, and that was Mary Landrieu of Louisiana. She has been a great \nSenator for Louisiana. She worked harder and achieved more for that \nState than, obviously, the people of that State realized. There wasn't \nan issue that came before us that Mary didn't stand up and say: Now let \nme tell you how that affects Louisiana, and usually make an ask which \nwas fulfilled.\n  Let me add one other grace note when it comes to her personal and \npublic life. Mary and her husband have adopted two children. They are \nthe light of their lives. Her dedication to the cause of adopted \nchildren has really made a difference not just to the United States but \nin the world. I am sure she didn't get a lot of political reward for \nit, but thank goodness she put a big part of her life and her public \nlife into standing up for the rights of adopted children and adoptive \nparents, encouraging more and more, so the kids would have a loving \nhome as part of their lives. It was just one of the things that Mary \nworked on, but it was one of the things I will remember. I am going to \nmiss her and her service to the U.S. Senate.\n  Mary bleeds Louisiana. Her father is the legendary statesmen Moon \nLandrieu, former New Orleans mayor, HUD Secretary under President Jimmy \nCarter, and Judge of Louisiana's 4th Circuit Court. Her brother, Mitch, \nis the current Mayor of New Orleans.\n  Mary--the eldest of the eight siblings--learned important political \nlessons early. She was taunted in early grade school about her father's \npro civil rights stands in the 1960s. Those experiences taught her that \ntaking the right position sometimes makes you unpopular--but you do it \nanyway.\n  Mary was only 23 when she entered the Louisiana House of \nRepresentatives in 1980. She went on to serve as a member of her \nState's senate.\n  Mary is a formidable fighter for Louisiana. In her State's darkest \nhours, during Hurricane Katrina and in the aftermath of that terrible \ncatastrophe, she stood strong. She was exactly the right person for \nLouisiana. More than any other single official, she deserves the credit \nfor directing billions of dollars in relief and rebuilding money to her \nhometown and home State.\n  Governor Bobby Jindal's Secretary of Administration had this to say \nabout Mary Landrieu: ``She's relentless; once she starts, she will not \nstop. And once she's on your side, she's on your side.''\n  This is what St. Tammany Parish Sheriff Jack Strain remembers about \nKatrina: ``The very first federal representative we had on the ground \nafter Katrina was Mary Landrieu . . . when water was still in our \nhouses and neighborhoods. . . . She spoke to my deputies and offered \nassistance to them.''\n  Perhaps the best description of Mary Landrieu was offered by her \nmentor, former Senator John Breaux, who calls her ``a pit bull with \nLouisiana charm.''\n  In 2009, when Hurricane Katrina was just a dim, bad memory for some, \nSenator Landrieu made sure the stimulus bill included a provision that \nended up allowing the state to rebuild Charity Hospital, the \ncornerstone of health care for many low-income New Orleans families.\n  Senator Landrieu has been a champion of the energy industry--so \ncrucial to the economy of her State and her Nation. She has fought to \npreserve Social Security and Medicare and other safety net programs \nthat provide dignity and security for so many. She has fought to defend \nvoting rights, women's right, and children's right. She has earned a \nspot in heaven with her work to promote adoption. She provided a \ncrucial vote to pass the Affordable Care Act, knowing full well that it \nwould cost her politically. If that doesn't earn her a spot in heaven, \nit will at least earn her a place in history as a profile in courage.\n  With her political genes and determination, I know that Mary Landrieu \nwill continue to be a force in Louisiana and American politics for \nyears to come. And while I will miss seeing her every day in this \nSenate, I look forward to seeing her fight for what is right for many, \nmany more years. It has been an honor to serve with her.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Tax Extenders and Omnibus\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, as we come to the close of the 113th \nCongress, I wish to speak for a few minutes about why I think we should \nbe optimistic about the future and what we can and must do to take \nadvantage of the opportunities that lie ahead.\n  Despite economic slowdowns throughout much of the world among \ndeveloping and developed Nations alike, America's economy continues to \nsteadily grow. Just last Friday we got great news that our economy \ncreated more than 300,000 jobs in the month of November. That marks 57 \nstraight months, or nearly 5 years, of positive job growth numbers. For \nthe first time since Bill Clinton was President of this Nation, we have \naveraged more than 200,000 new jobs per month for 10 straight months.\n  Particularly in the economy is an area of growth and opportunity that \nI have focused on in my time before coming into public service and in \nmy 4 years here. That is American manufacturing, an industry about \nwhich I have spoken at length here on the Senate floor and have worked \nwith my colleagues to craft and assemble a group of bipartisan bills \nthat can help move American manufacturing forward.\n  The news this last month was good, as it has been for months, for \nyears now, about American manufacturing, which continues to grow as \nwell. There were 28,000 new American manufacturing jobs last month, \nwhich continued this steady climb. It has now created more than 750,000 \nnew jobs over the last 4 years. Manufacturing jobs are great jobs. They \ntypically are higher wage and higher skill and have higher benefits \nthan jobs in any other sector. They are good, middle-class jobs\n\n[[Page S6503]]\n\nyou can raise a family on. They deal with one of the biggest ongoing \nremnants of the great recession, which is the lack of real wage growth \nin our economy. So I am excited to see that manufacturing jobs continue \nto grow in our economy and to talk about the things we can and should \ndo to help sustain this growth in manufacturing.\n  We have reason to be optimistic, but we cannot be complacent. As much \nas we built momentum over the last year since the recession, and \nespecially this year, there is, of course, no natural law, no economic \nfundamental principle that says it will not turn back around. We need \nto sustain our positive direction, particularly in this sector, \nparticularly as we move toward the 114th Congress.\n  I am proud that Congress last year passed a 2-year budget to create \nsome stability and some certainty for our country and economy. We have \ngotten out of the way and allowed our businesses and workers to do what \nthey do best, to move our economy forward. In the next few days we will \nhave chances to do the same when we vote on a number of bills, one \nthat, most importantly, will keep our government running, not for a few \ndays or weeks or months, but the overwhelming majority of this \ngovernment will be authorized and funded through next September.\n  The funding bills that are included in this omnibus continue \ninvestments in innovation and continue to move our country forward. \nThere is a whole rash of bills that I have been interested in and \nengaged in as a member of the Appropriations Committee that are \nvaluable programs, that will strengthen manufacturing--for example, the \nManufacturing Extension Partnership, which has done amazing work on the \nground in Delaware, helping small and medium manufacturers to be \ncompetitive, to train their workforce in current skills, to grow into \nthe spaces of the world economy where we have real opportunity. This \nbill will help sustain the funding for the Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership nationally.\n  There are several other programs related to innovation in the \nDepartment of Energy. For example, sustained funding for the ARPA-E, \nfor an innovative model that helps fund cutting-edge, category-\nredefining research and investment in energy and in clean energy \nmanufacturing and in technology deployment.\n  There are also opportunities for us to continue to put Americans to \nwork through investments in infrastructure. As someone who lives on \nAmtrak 16 hours a week, I am thrilled with the outcomes for both the \nAmtrak budget and for the TIGER grant programs, a tool used by the \nDepartment of Transportation to help incentivize innovative \ntransportation projects that break through bottlenecks and help put \nAmericans back to work.\n  There are so many different ways that the work of this bipartisan \ncommittee, the Appropriations Committee, helped move our economy \nforward that at times are not focused on here on the floor or in the \ngeneral press coverage. It is such a large and comprehensive bill, the \nomnibus. But I wanted to take a moment and highlight a few ways in \nwhich the omnibus invests in innovation, in competitiveness, and in \nmoving our economy forward. I am also grateful, in some ways most \nimportantly, that it includes emergency funding to respond to Ebola, \nboth at home and abroad, which will be critical to helping stamp out \nthis deadly virus at its origin in West Africa and in protecting \nAmericans here at home and others around the world.\n  The appropriations bills that were shepherded through the dozen \nsubcommittees give us reason to be optimistic about the future because \nthe Chair, Senator Mikulski, and the Vice Chair, Senator Shelby, have \ndone a laudable job of listening to each other, of working together, \nand of crafting a bipartisan bill here in the Senate, which I hope the \nMembers of this body will study, consider, and move forward and adopt.\n  As we move to complete the business of funding the government, we \nwould be remiss if we did not also take stock of the opportunities in \nfront of us we have not yet grasped. There is unfinished work to be \ndone. This week we will also almost certainly pass a 1-year tax \nextenders bill, which will carry forward certain temporary tax credits \nand deductions, but for just the 1 year.\n\n  Although the extension for many businesses and many sectors is better \nthan nothing, it signifies a missed opportunity on our part. Much of \nwhat has made me optimistic over the last year is how much our economy \nhas begun to thrive in a stable fiscal environment, in a more \npredictable regulatory environment. Yet, this 1-year extension does not \ndo much to give businesses the certainty they need to predict and plan \nfor the future.\n  I have worked hard with Democrats and Republicans alike to expand and \nmake permanent the research and development tax credit, which is \nparticularly relevant to manufacturing, because manufacturing is the \nmost R sector in the American economy. Manufacturers invest \nmore in R than any other part of the American landscape. This 1-year \nextension misses an opportunity to either make the R tax credit \npermanent, or to make it more accessible.\n  I was excited to have the opportunity early on here to team up with \ntwo Republican Senators, Mike Enzi of Wyoming and Pat Roberts of \nKansas, to find ways to make the R tax credit more accessible to \nearly-stage and startup companies, companies with high growth \npotential, but because of the way the R tax credit has been \nstructured and used for decades, do not have the opportunity to access \nit.\n  The Startup Innovation Credit Act, which I introduced with Senator \nEnzi, would have further expanded the access to the R credit for \nstartups. The bipartisan Innovators Job Creation Act, which I \nintroduced with Senator Roberts, would have expanded the credit to \ninnovative small businesses as well. Both of those bills passed on a \nbipartisan basis out of the Finance Committee and were part of a \npackage being advanced here in the Senate but will not be part of the \nultimate 1-year extenders considered later this week.\n  I wanted to highlight that as we look forward there are opportunities \nstill in front of us for us to tackle the challenges and to seize the \nopportunities, to take things that are important to manufacturing and \nto move them forward. There are lots of other bills in the mix that \nwill be adopted this week, either by unanimous consent or as part of \nlarger packages, and a number of them relate to manufacturing. I am \noptimistic that we will adopt a national manufacturing strategy bill \nthat I have worked hard on with Republican Senator Mark Kirk of \nIllinois. I am optimistic that a bipartisan manufacturing hubs bill \nthat Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri \nhave worked hard together to craft and to hone and to get to a place \nwhere it is ready to be passed--that they both will make it across the \nfinish line to the President's desk.\n  But just this past week, I stood on this floor with Senator Kelly \nAyotte of New Hampshire and we spoke about a bill that is not yet ready \nfor adoption, but we will take up next year, the Manufacturing Skills \nAct, which helps to focus and prioritize the investments in \nmanufacturing skills training at the State and municipal level all over \nthe country in partnership with the Federal Government.\n  What I wanted to do today was to simply highlight a few perhaps \nunderappreciated, underrecognized areas of legislative action on a \nbipartisan basis in this Chamber that helped put some lift under the \nsteady forward progress of the manufacturing sector in our country and \nto express my hope that we can find ways to continue to work together \non a bipartisan basis to keep our economic momentum going in the year \nand the Congress ahead.\n\n\n                     Tribute to Departing Senators\n\n  As I close, I would also like to thank those of our colleagues who \nwill be leaving the Senate after the New Year.\n  It is an incredible privilege to work in this Chamber and to \nrepresent the people. Every day I am awed by the dedication and talent \nof many of my colleagues, public servants who come to work to fight for \ntheir States and their government.\n  To those who are ending their service in the Senate, know that I \nvalue your friendship and partnership. It has been an honor to work \nwith you, and I thank you for all you have done for our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S6504]]\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of some of the \npublic lands provisions that were included in this year's National \nDefense Authorization Act. Before I do so, I wish to recognize the work \nSenators Levin and Inhofe have put into this bill and their dedication \nto reach an agreement with the House so that this bill could move \nforward on time, as it has done over the past 50 years.\n  As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I hear every day \nabout the sacrifice our servicemembers make to protect our country. \nPassing the authorization bill that helps ensure they have the \nequipment they need and the resources required to meet the mission they \nare tasked with is very important.\n  While I am pleased the Senate will be moving forward on this bill, I \nwish to note that the bill's reduction in servicemembers' benefits \nconcerns me. I do believe Members should have had the chance and the \nright to debate and amend it, and I hope the Senate will have the \nopportunity to do so in the future.\n  This year the final Defense bill includes several Nevada public land \npriorities that will spur economic development and job creation in our \nState while enhancing U.S. national security. I have been working on \nmany of those proposals since I was first elected to Congress in 2006.\n  I thank incoming Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee chair \nLisa Murkowski for her leadership and work on this public lands \npackage. We have been working together for many years on many of the \nbills included in the package, and I am pleased to see they are finally \ngetting across the finish line.\n  Let me first clarify that just because some of these bills are \nrelated to public lands does not mean they have a direct relationship \nto defense and protecting our national security. My Nevada Copper bill \nwill protect domestic production of copper--the second most used \nmineral at the Department of Defense--as well as directly benefit two \nbases that are located in the State of Nevada.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, roughly 85 percent of the land in \nNevada is controlled by the Federal Government. This presents our local \nand State governments with many unique challenges. Our communities' \neconomies are directly tied to the way the Federal Government manages \nthose lands. They often work closely with me to develop legislative \nsolutions to their problems.\n  Whereas out East local governments can acquire land on their own to \nbuild public works projects, out West, unfortunately, we have to get \nthe permission of Congress. That is why reducing the Federal estate and \nincreasing access to our public lands has been one of my top priorities \nin Congress, and this package goes a long way toward accomplishing \nthese goals. It resolves over 60 of these types of issues throughout \nthe West. In total, over 110,000 acres of land will be removed from \nFederal ownership and utilized for mineral production, timber \nproduction, infrastructure projects, and other community development. \nIn addition, it releases approximately 26,000 acres of current \nwilderness study areas, which unlocks lands to be used for multiple \nuse.\n  It is very important to discuss the eight Nevada provisions today to \nshow my colleagues in the Senate the many hoops our western communities \nhave to go through to take the same steps many eastern communities can \naccomplish in a single day.\n  The Lyon County Economic Development and Conservation Act is a jobs \nbill I first introduced while in the House, but it has been held up by \nthe Senate for many years because of gridlock.\n  This bill allows the city of Erring to partner with Nevada Copper to \ndevelop roughly 12,500 acres of land surrounding the Nevada Copper \nPumpkin Hollow Project site to be used for mining activities, \nindustrial and renewable energy development, and recreation.\n  Senate passage is the final hurdle to more than 1,000 new jobs at an \naverage wage of over $85,000 per year. The mine will contribute nearly \n$25 million in property and net proceeds taxes per year that would be \ndistributed to the State, to Lyon County, their schools, the hospital \ndistrict, and the Mason Valley Fire Protection District.\n  In addition, Nevada Copper plans to invest $80 million in \ninfrastructure for the mine and processing facilities that can be \nutilized to support other land uses and economic development.\n  This bill will transform the local economy of one of the counties in \nour Nation that are struggling most during this recent economic \ndownturn.\n  As I said before, copper is the second most used mineral at the \nDepartment of Defense and is considered an essential mineral for \nweapons production. Copper is also the primary mineral from which other \nstrategic and critical metals, such as rhenium, are derived. A domestic \nsupply of this important resource greatly benefits our national \nsecurity.\n\n  Second, there is a provision in this package that will allow Naval \nAir Station Fallon to acquire over 400 acres of BLM land for a safety \narc for an explosive ordnance-handling facility and to construct much \nneeded family housing at the station. Both of these plans will greatly \nbenefit mission operations and the quality of life for our brave \nservicemembers serving there. The station first asked for these lands \nover 20 years ago. I am pleased their wait can finally come to an end.\n  Third, the package includes the Pine Forest Recreation Enhancement \nAct--a proposal that has been in the works in Humboldt County for \nnearly a decade. Just north of the Black Rock Desert, the Pine Forest \noffers a diverse landscape of sagebrush, aspen, and rock formations. \nScenic lakes and reservoirs offer world-class trout fisheries. From the \nranchers who make their livelihood on grazing allotments to \nconservationists intent on preserving a rugged landscape, anyone \nfamiliar with the place agrees it is special.\n  In addition to conserving these areas, the bill releases areas from \nwilderness that needs watershed restoration and treatment due to a high \nwildfire threat. It also provides for the construction of additional \ncampsites and accommodations for motorized camping.\n  The initial work on the Pine Forest bill was grassroots-driven, \ntransparent, and ultimately supported unanimously by all stakeholders \nand local governments in this county.\n  Fourth, the package includes the Elko Motocross and Tribal Conveyance \nAct--another bill I first introduced in the 111th Congress as a Member \nof the House. The commonsense bill conveys 275 acres of BLM lands to \nElko County for a public motocross park. Additionally, it provides 373 \nacres to the Elko Band of Te-Moak Tribe for housing and tribal economic \ndevelopment.\n  Outdoor recreation and tourism are such important parts of life in \nNevada. Opening up this land will benefit the residents of northern \nNevada for years to come.\n  Fifth, this land package also includes the Las Vegas Valley Public \nLand and Tule Springs Fossil Beds National Monument Act, which is the \nculmination of several years of effort to conserve the ancient Tule \nSprings fossil beds while providing job-creation opportunities and \ncritical civilian and military infrastructure that will be necessary to \nmeet the needs of the Las Vegas Valley.\n  After working with stakeholders at every level, I am pleased that we \ncan navigate a path forward for southern Nevada.\n  While serving in the House, I also introduced legislation in both the \n110th and 111th Congresses to convey parcels of BLM land to the Nellis \nAir Force Base to create an off-highway vehicle park in the Nellis \nDunes and to convey land to the Nevada System of Higher Education to \nexpand educational opportunities for southern Nevadans.\n  Those smaller bills were ultimately included in S. 973 in this \nCongress, so I am pleased that 6 years of work on this Tule Springs \nlegislation will finally become a reality.\n  The final three Nevada bills included in the lands package are newer \nproposals but achieve long-term economic development objectives that \nthe affected communities have long asked for.\n  The Fernley Economic Self-Determination Act provides Fernley the \nopportunity to purchase up to 9,114 acres of Federal land within the \ncity boundaries for the purpose of economic development.\n  Fernley was incorporated in 2001. Since incorporation, the city has \nbeen\n\n[[Page S6505]]\n\nworking with private business partners and State and Federal regional \nagencies to develop a long-term economic development plan. These \nparcels have significant potential for commercial and industrial \ndevelopment, agricultural activities, and the expansion of community \nevents.\n  Similarly, the Carlin Economic Self-Determination Act allows Carlin \nto purchase up to 1,329 acres of BLM lands. This city, located in Elko \nCounty, is completely landlocked by the Federal Government. Without \nthis legislation, it would be impossible for their leaders to meet the \ndemands for the expansion of their growing population needs.\n  Finally, the Storey County provision conveys over 1,700 acres of BLM \nlands to Virginia City. These properties have been occupied for decades \nby individuals who purchased them or acquired them legally; yet their \ncontinued residency is trespass, according to the Federal Government.\n  It is a very burdensome oversight by the Federal Government that must \nbe resolved for the sake of my constituents. They have struggled for \nyears, haunted by this error that is the result through no fault of \ntheir own.\n  These small public lands proposals are going to make a major impact \non Nevada's economy. They have been developed at the local level and \nsigned off on by the local communities.\n  I understand my colleagues' concerns that they would have liked the \nopportunity to debate and vote on more amendments to this bill. I, too, \nfiled a number of amendments that I wished to see considered, and I \nwill continue pushing those priorities next year. But right now \nCongress has a rare opportunity to pass this public lands package that \nenables important mining, energy development, ranching, and timber work \nto go forward, generating economic and employment opportunities for my \nState, other States, and local residents.\n  Let's get the government off these Nevadans' backs and allow them to \ndo what they do best; that is, create jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                             Appropriations\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor today during the \nconsideration of the national defense authorization to bring my \ncolleagues up to date on the appropriations bill.\n  As we know, the continuing resolution expires on Thursday at \nmidnight, but I am here to talk about some good news. The \nAppropriations Committee on both sides of the dome--the House \nAppropriations Committee and the Senate, working in a conference \ncommittee--has completed its work. This legislation is now as we speak \nheading to the Rules Committee and to the House. Hopefully it will head \nto the House for tomorrow, on to the Senate tomorrow night and into \nFriday. This means no government shutdown, no government on auto pilot, \nand we fund the government through the rest of the fiscal year for \n2015, except Homeland Security, which will be a continuing resolution.\n  What we are talking about here is a monumental achievement. It is a \nmonumental achievement showing how we can work together, we can govern, \nand we can get the job done.\n  Working on a bipartisan basis in the Senate, we worked in our \nsubcommittees, and we held our hearings. We held 60 hearings in 60 days \nand did a good bit of our markups. We were able to work on our Senate \nappropriations. Over in the House, they did the same thing. But then, \nalas, when we got to September, we had to go on a continuing resolution \nuntil December 11.\n  I, as a rule, don't like continuing resolutions. We have 12 \nsubcommittees, and I had hoped, under the time I chaired the committee \nand held the gavel, that we could consider one bill at a time and bring \nit to the Senate floor. Alas, partisan politics, gridlock, deadlock, \ngamesmanship, and showmanship prevented all of that.\n  But you know what, we on the Appropriations Committee, working with \nour vice chair, Senator Shelby of Alabama, kept ourselves on track. \nThen we met in the conference committee, first our subcommittee chairs \nand then Chairman Rogers, Senator Shelby, Congresswoman Lowey, and \nmyself. We worked together on a $1 trillion spending bill. That number \nis breathtaking, but we need to remember that over $550 billion is in \nnational defense. The rest is in domestic discretionary. That means \neverything from veterans, to foreign aid, to school aid, and also \nfunding innovation.\n  I will talk more explicitly about the bill when it comes to the \nSenate floor. But for today I wanted everyone to know we are keeping \nthe process going. We actually made the process work. We showed that we \ncould govern. We worked across the aisle. We worked across the dome. We \npracticed civility. We argued. We debated. We fought. You know, \nsometimes you give a little, you take a little, but you stand for them \nall. And I want everyone to know we were able to concentrate and \ncompromise what I call capitulation on principle.\n  So I wanted to say to my colleagues: Stay steady, stay strong. We \nexpect that the House will pass its rule sometime after 3 o'clock \ntoday. That is the framework that enables them to go to the floor \ntomorrow. They will follow their own rule and hopefully that bill will \npass. If it does pass, it will come to the Senate, and we will \nimmediately take it up under the rules the two leaders will have worked \non and established. So we look forward to completing the job on the \nAppropriations Committee within the next 72 hours.\n  I hope this update is of value to my colleagues as they plan their \nschedule and wish to participate in the debate and in the discussion. \nBut it is not whether it is of value to us, it is whether it is of \nvalue to the Nation. I think what the voters in the last election said \nwas: We have lost confidence in your ability to govern.\n  I hope over the next 72 hours, by the way we will bring this bill to \nthe floor, we will take a significant step in regaining that confidence \nand getting out of this whole game of government by crisis, government \nby artificially imposed deadlines, where all it is, is more drama than \ndebate.\n  We would like to get back to the regular order. Hopefully, though, we \nnow can move forward on our bill.\n  I thank the Chair for his attention, and I yield the floor. I note \nthe Senator from Arizona is on the floor so I will not ask for a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Tom Coburn\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Today, I would like to offer words of tribute to my \ndeparting colleague, Senator Tom Coburn, whose service exemplifies \nstandards of purposefulness, integrity, and decency, to which we should \nall aspire and whose example ought to inspire the service of new and \nreturning Senators alike.\n  I am going to miss an awful lot our colleague from Oklahoma. I have \nalways admired Tom for the strength of his convictions and the courage \nand candor with which he expresses them day after day. ``The No. 1 \nthing people should do in Congress,'' Tom once said, ``is stay true to \ntheir heart.'' No one in the history of this institution has ever \nfollowed that injunction more faithfully than Tom Coburn has.\n  Tom Coburn has an unshakable faith in the goodness of America, and he \nhas worked diligently with others when he could and alone, if \nnecessary, to make sure government respects the people we serve--\nrespects their hopes and aspirations, their concerns and sacrifices. He \nhas never forgotten he is the people's servant first and last, and they \nhave never had a more genuine and determined champion.\n  I think Tom has often acted as the conscience of the Senate. He can \nbe unmovable on matters of principle when to do otherwise would harm or \ndo no good for the country. Tom Coburn is sometimes called ``Dr. No,'' \naffectionately most, if not all, of the time. He has held up more \nlegislation that he thought ill served the public interest than any \nother Member of this body. He even placed a hold on one of his own \nbills that he thought no longer met his high standard of accountability \nafter it was reported out of committee. I don't think the American \ntaxpayer has ever had a greater defender than Tom Coburn.\n  I like to think I have taken a few principled stands when the \nsituation has warranted it, and I have made myself an occasional \nnuisance in service to what I thought was a good cause. But I have \nnever been so conscientious that I felt obliged to defeat my own \nlegislation. That is a pretty high\n\n[[Page S6506]]\n\nstandard of personal responsibility to meet and a character test of the \nfirst order. I am not sure many of us would pass it. I wouldn't. But \nthen, as all his colleagues can attest, Tom Coburn is a person of the \nvery highest character. He possesses the highest virtues--courage, \nhumility, compassion--in an abundance. It has been an honor to serve \nwith him.\n  As principled as he is, as unwavering as he can be when he believes \nit necessary, he has also been a brave and determined proponent of \ncompromise when he believed it served the public interest, when it \nwould help build a more prosperous and secure society with more \nopportunities for more people and brighter futures for our children.\n  We always have detractors. It comes with the job. Whether Tom was \nstanding on principle or seeking a principled compromise, he stood up \nto criticism. He stood up to pressure. He stood up to threats and \ninsults and whatever negative personal consequences he might suffer. He \nstood up to whatever came his way to do what was right for his country. \nHe stood up for the American people, no matter how difficult it was. \nWhat better can you say about a public servant?\n  Tom and I worked together on a lot of things. We fought together to \nend earmarks and opposed other forms of wasteful spending. We worked \ntogether on oversight projects for the stimulus bill and highway trust \nfund spending. We also fought for a long time to let veterans decide \nwhere they could best receive health care. We made good progress on \nsome issues and not enough on others, but Tom Coburn was always an \nexample and an inspiration to me.\n  If I could speak more personally, Tom has been more than a paragon to \nme and to other Members of the Senate. He is first and foremost a kind, \nconsiderate, and loyal friend--a friend in good times and bad, a friend \nwho brings out the best in you because he believes in the best part of \nyou. I said earlier Tom Coburn sees the innate goodness in the American \npeople. He also sees it in his colleagues, even when it isn't apparent \nto other observers.\n  We have shared happy times together, Tom and I, but Tom has the \ninstinct and the kindness to be the kind of friend who is there when \nyou need him--when you need him most, in moments that aren't so happy.\n  We all lead pretty good lives here. We get the chance to serve the \ngreatest country in the world and, on occasion, to make history. We are \nhonored and feted and praised more than we deserve. But as all human \nbeings do, we have moments of worry and doubt and disappointment. Tom \nalways has the knack for showing up when I need cheering up. He has \nmade the point over the years of being company when you most need it.\n  Friendship is a virtue to Tom, and he means to live a virtuous life. \nYou could be working on something with him or opposing each other on an \nissue, it doesn't matter. If you need him, he will be there for you \nwith a kind word, a piece of advice, a little encouragement or just \ngood company. There are too few people like that in anyone's life not \nto cherish the hell out of those who are. I cherish my friendship with \nTom Coburn, and I always will.\n  The Senate will be a poorer place without Tom Coburn to set an \nexample of public service for the rest of us. But in gratitude to him \nfor his leadership and friendship, I will try a little harder to live \nup to his standards, and I hope he will let me know when I fall short.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Tax Code\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, there was an opportunity this session to \nwork together in a bipartisan way to provide certainty around the Tax \nCode for families and farmers and businesses, at least for 2014 and \n2015. There may still be a small window of opportunity to get things \ndone. I certainly support doing that, if we can. But I want to speak to \nthe importance of having some certainty, at least through the end of \n2015, as it relates to our tax policy for investing, for the economy, \nand for homeowners to make decisions.\n  Back in April, thanks to the leadership of Chairman Wyden and Ranking \nMember Hatch, those of us on the Senate Finance Committee worked \ntogether closely and passed the EXPIRE Act, a bipartisan bill that \nwould renew tax provisions for 2014 and 2015 so that again people could \nplan, businesses, and farmers, at least through that 2-year period. It \nwould give businesses and families across the country the certainty \nthey desperately need.\n  Unbelievably, back at the time when we brought it to the floor, after \na bipartisan effort, Republicans in the Senate filibustered it and we \ncould not move it forward. So we have been trying to get this 2-year \nbill done as the first year has been ticking away. We are now at the \nend of the first year of the tax bill, and, unfortunately, instead of \nhaving a 2-year bill, we now have a bill from the House that contains \nwhat we call tax extenders--extending tax policy for the economy, from \nresearch and development to homeowners to depreciation for investments \nand jobs. We have something that is only extended to the end of this \nyear. As our chairman has said, it is a 3-week bill. By the time we get \ndone, it will probably be a 2-week bill.\n\n  We need to do more. The chairman, ranking member, and many of us are \nstill trying to do everything we can to get the House to agree to \nsomething with more certainty than 2 or 3 weeks. I think it is an \nembarrassment for the Congress that we are not able to come together \nand pass the EXPIRE Act to be able to give more certainty.\n  There is a glimmer of hope though on a piece of tax reform I wish to \nmention. Frankly, there is disagreement on this on our side of the \naisle, and I respectfully disagree with those in the White House on \nthis as well. But there is a bill I hope will move on the suspension \ncalendar in the House around charitable giving.\n  I can't imagine at this time of year of charitable giving, as we come \nup to the end of the year and people are making decisions about where \nto place their dollars, what kinds of causes and so on, that we \ncouldn't come together on a bipartisan bill to deal with donations to \nfood banks and conservation easements that protect our land for the \nfuture, that make sure we are not plowing up our land and putting more \nCO2 into the air right at the time we are trying to deal \nwith climate issues--land protection, forestry protection for the \nfuture; dealing with investments in our research institutions, dealing \nwith investments in important areas near and dear to my heart--such as \nthe city of Detroit, where our foundations are playing such a critical \nrole in making the investments, whether it is in transportation \ninfrastructure, whether it is job training, whether it is rebuilding \nthe neighborhoods to be able to turn Detroit around. I believe we are \ngoing to be able to do that. I know we are going to be able to do that. \nBut a major reason has been the foundations--the Kresge Foundation, the \nKeller Foundation. There are so many that have been there.\n  So we have an opportunity prior to going into a larger debate on tax \nreform to actually take a piece of this, which normally would be, on \nits substance, very bipartisan, and actually be able to get that done. \nI am hopeful we will be able to do that before the end of the year \nbecause of the important provisions in it.\n  I go back to though the broader tax bill being sent as a 1-year \nrenewal from the House of Representatives and, as I said, at most is a \n3-week bill. By the time it is done, it may end up being a 2-week bill \nat this point in time. I can't believe people honestly, with a straight \nface, are calling this tax policy to be able to do this.\n  There are homeowners who lost their job during the recession and can \nno longer afford their mortgage payments. They have had their homes \nforeclosed on or maybe they have been able to do a short sale with \ntheir mortgage lender or the bank. For the past year--11 months and 10 \ndays--these families have had no way to know whether we were going to \nrenew the mortgage forgiveness tax relief bill, which I was proud to \nauthor as a bipartisan bill back in 2007, which we have continued to \nrenew because we still have families\n\n[[Page S6507]]\n\nstruggling from the recession in terms of their loan.\n  If we can renew this bill, it will spare families from having to pay \nincome tax on the difference between their mortgage and the value of \ntheir home. So if in fact they get loan forgiveness or can work \nsomething out with the bank--and if in fact $20,000 is forgiven on the \nmortgage or $30,000 or $40,000--they don't end up paying taxes on that \nas income, which is what will happen if we don't get something done.\n  But we are looking at the fact that these folks, going into 2015, at \na time when they are trying to decide what to do on their homes--\nwhether they can keep their mortgage--will be right back in the same \nsituation of not knowing whether they are going to owe thousands of \ndollars' worth of tax going into next year.\n  We are seeing a lot of folks trying to keep their homes who had to \ncut corners in every which way--parents stopped paying toward their \nkids' college fund or they put off buying new clothes or they canceled \nvacations or plans to visit their relatives while they are trying to \nfigure out how to keep a roof over their head. Obviously there are many \nthings that need to be done to support families, but one piece of tax \npolicy that has given them some ability to plan has been this mortgage \ntax forgiveness bill.\n  What we are saying is: OK. For 2 weeks you can know that you can \nrefinance with the bank--not next year. We kept you hanging for all of \n2014, but for 2 weeks or 3 weeks we will give you some certainty.\n  So next year more families are going to be stuck with the same \nwrenching decisions they have this year if we can't at least get a 2-\nyear bill.\n  When we look at other areas where folks will be left hanging, we have \na very important area of the economy creating jobs every day in wind \nenergy. There is a huge supply chain--as the Presiding Officer knows, \nas someone who cares deeply about manufacturing--from the making of \nturbines to the installation in the field, to the operations, to the \nmaintenance, all of these are connected to American jobs, good-paying \njobs. In fact, one of the big turbines has 8,000 parts in it. Somebody \nis making those parts. I would suggest to everyone that we can make \nevery one of those in Michigan. I am sure we can make them in other \nplaces as well, although we would love to make them in Michigan. But \nwhat the industry doesn't know is whether the production tax credit \nwhich they depend on will be renewed for more than 3 weeks at the end \nof the year.\n  In fact, what the House did say is: You have 3 weeks to make business \ndecisions about hiring new people, growing your business, building more \nparts for the winter. You have 3 weeks. Go get them--in 3 weeks. So \nthey can't make business decisions, and they are going to have to cut.\n  In the meantime, that means layoffs, similar to the 30,000 workers \nwho were laid off when Congress waited to the very last minute in 2012; \n30,000 people were laid off when the same thing happened in 2012 when \nthe production tax credit renewed at the last minute. Even if this bill \npasses, extending the production tax credit this week through the end \nof the year may be too late for 30,000 people, right before the \nholidays. Merry Christmas. Thirty thousand people not being able to \nhave their job extended, people who could help us lead the world in \nclean energy production, who could help us develop energy here to be \nless dependent on foreign oil, but because we don't have the fortitude \nto extend this even after we had a bipartisan bill--the EXPIRE Act--\ncome out of the Finance Committee last spring, they are looking at job \nlosses.\n  So 30,000 families are putting holiday gifts on their credit card not \nknowing whether they are going to be able to make payments when the \nbills arrive.\n  Businesses in the wind power industry make investment decisions on \nwhat their taxes will be, similar to any other business, 5 years, 10 \nyears, 15 years into the future.\n  There have been, by the way, tax breaks for Big Oil for almost 100 \nyears; the first one in 1916 embedded in the Tax Code, never having to \nbe renewed so long-term business decisions can be made. But for their \ncompetitors to create jobs and bring prices down through things such as \nwind or solar or biofuel, it is a slog every year, every 2 years to try \nto keep these industries going.\n  Is that fair? It is absolutely not fair. We ought to have the same \nkind of tax policy. If we are embedding the Tax Code provisions to \nsupport oil production, we should be doing the same for wind, the same \nfor solar, the same for biofuels.\n  What Republicans are doing when they force us into a situation where \nit is only a 3-week extension is they are basically telling Americans \nbusinesses: Don't invest. Don't hire people. We don't want competition \nto bring prices down on gasoline or prices in electricity. We don't \nwant you to do that. We are unwilling to commit to something that will \ncreate jobs beyond somebody we have been fighting to protect for almost \n100 years.\n  So this is a great concern to me. In the process, Americans deserve \nbetter. Our businesses and our innovators deserve better. We go out and \nsay we want new innovation to create new kinds of jobs. That is \nhappening. Then the doors are shut over and over again or it takes \nforever to pry open the door: You have 3 weeks, the door is open, and \nthen it shuts.\n  Let me talk about another area I am deeply concerned about where \npeople will be hurt if we do not pass the 2-year EXPIRE Act that we put \ntogether in the Finance Committee in a bipartisan way; that is, \nsalaried workers such as those at Delphi auto parts manufacturer--which \nused to be a part of General Motors. During the 2008 rescue of the auto \nindustry, somehow the salaried workers slipped through the cracks in \nterms of losing portions of their pensions, their health care coverage, \nand their insurance, and it is not fair.\n  One woman who worked at Delphi for over 30 years lost nearly half her \npension and all of her health care coverage, which she needed for her \nhusband who suffers from chronic pain.\n  A manager who worked at a Delphi facility in Michigan was so devoted \nto the people he supervised that he volunteered to retire rather than \nlay off some workers. Then 4 months after his retirement, he found out \nhe was losing 40 percent of his pension and all of his health care \ncoverage. Most of what was left out of his pension will go toward \npaying the cost of his health care, and it was devastating to him and \nhis family.\n  So we have in this extenders bill, this EXPIRE Act, the health \ncoverage tax credit which was created for people such as these people. \nI am proud to be a coauthor with Senator Brown, who has been a real \nleader on this for people who have lost their benefits that were \nsupposedly guaranteed to them. It does not restore their pension, but \nthis credit pays 72.5 percent of their health care premiums, making it \npossible for retirees to afford coverage similar to what they could \nhave earned when they were working. It frankly helps people who can't \nget help in other ways, who fell through the cracks.\n  The credit expired at the end of 2013, and the bipartisan bill we \npassed in the spring, in April, renewed that credit. I was very pleased \nwe were able to put this in the bill and thought we were on our way \nagain to help people throughout this year who have been waiting and \nwaiting.\n  Again, when we passed this in April it was filibustered on the floor \nby the Republicans. Now we are at 3 weeks left before the end of the \nyear and what we get from the House is a bill that is retroactive for \n2014, but it does not even include the health coverage tax credit. So \neven though this is retroactive for 2014, the people involved--the \nsalaried workers who lost pensions who have been getting some help for \ntheir health care at least--will not even get that for this year. There \nare 20,000 Delphi retirees not only in Michigan and Ohio, but \nPennsylvania, Indiana, Wisconsin and Illinois, all who are watching \nright now this process in the Senate and the House to see what will \nhappen, and are reaching out to their House Members and Senate \nMembers--Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Wisconsin, and \nIllinois.\n\n  To renew all the other tax provisions but cancel the HCTC is a cruel \ntrick to play on families and certainly is underscored in terms of the \nholiday season we are getting into now. It is time for our colleagues \nacross the aisle to stop forcing Americans to play a guessing game \nabout their future taxes or their health care.\n\n[[Page S6508]]\n\n  I regret that the clock has been ticking and running out and left us \nwith no time at this point to get the fairness in the Tax Code that we \nneed. There is still time if we wanted to to pass this EXPIRE Act and \nsend it back to the House, and I am all for it, and I know our \nchairman, Senator Wyden, has been working night and day with colleagues \nacross the aisle to try to make that happen. If it is too late for this \nyear, if the clock runs out, shamefully, and we return next year with \nour Republican colleagues in the majority, I would suggest a New Year's \nresolution to stop doing retroactive extensions--stop doing retroactive \nextensions when it involves investments that people have to make that \nthey are not going to be able to do retroactively or decisions about \nhealth care or decisions about a home. Start getting serious about \nmaking long-term economic decisions.\n  I know the Presiding Officer agrees with me on this and has spoken \nwith me frequently on this.\n  Whether it is tax policy, health care policy, infrastructure policy, \nwe need to make long-term decisions and support policies so that \nbusinesses can make long-term decisions.\n  Finally, we need to deliver certainty for families, for small \nbusinesses, for manufacturers, for those in alternative energy, for all \nwho are working hard to invest in America across this country. Stop \ndoing retroactive extensions, start working seriously on long-term tax \npolicy and deliver certainty for families and businesses across the \ncountry. I think there is still time, if we wanted, to at least give \nthe certainty of next year. Shame on the Congress if that does not \nhappen. But I hope that we will at least commit ourselves that this is \nthe last time this is done this way.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Decline of the Middle Class\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the American people must make some very \nfundamental decisions in the coming years, and the most important of \nthem is whether we continue the status quo of American society, and \nthat is in terms of our economics and our politics which includes a 40-\nyear decline of our middle class. Let me repeat that.\n  We are not just talking about what is happening today. We are not \ntalking about the Wall Street crash of 2008. We are talking about a 40-\nyear decline of the American middle class and an ongoing and growing \ngap between the very wealthy and everybody else. That is the reality of \nAmerica now.\n  We can continue the same old, same old, or we can develop a bold \neconomic agenda that begins the process of creating the millions of \njobs we desperately need, an agenda which raises wages so that most of \nthe new jobs being created are not low wage or part time, an agenda \nwhich protects our environment, and an agenda which enables us to join \nthe rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all \npeople as a right. That is the issue of our time. Do we continue the \nstatus quo, continue the disappearance of the middle class, continue \nthe growing gap between the very rich and everybody else, or do we have \nthe courage to come up with an agenda that stands for working families \nand raises wages and provides for our kids and our seniors?\n  As part of that decision in my view is the reality that we cannot go \nforward unless we deal with another very important question, and that \nis, do we as a nation have the courage to take on the enormous economic \nand political power of the billionaire class? I know many of my \ncolleagues don't like to talk about it. We talk about this and we talk \nabout that, but most Americans in their gut understand that our \neconomic and political life are controlled by a small number of very \nwealthy people and institutions, including but not limited to Wall \nStreet, the oil companies, the insurance companies, the drug companies, \nthe military-industrial complex, et cetera, and all of their lobbyists \nwho flood Capitol Hill--trying to get this or that provision in tax \nbills and everyplace else--and, of course, their power in terms of \ncampaign contributions, and especially since this disastrous Supreme \nCourt Citizens United decision. It means the billionaire class can put \nunlimited sums of money into electing candidates who represent their \ninterests.\n  Those are the most important questions of our time. Do we have the \ncourage to take on the handful of billionaire special interests who \nwield so much economic and political power? Do we have the will to push \nforward an economic agenda that works for working families and not just \nfor the very wealthy?\n  The long-term deterioration of the middle class, accelerated by the \nWall Street crash of 2008, has not been a pretty sight. Today we have \nmore wealth and income inequality than any major country on Earth and \nthe gap between the very rich and everybody else is growing wider. The \ntop 1 percent now owns about 41 percent of the financial wealth of our \ncountry, while the bottom 60 percent owns all of 1.7 percent. The top 1 \npercent owns 41 percent of the financial wealth, the bottom 60 percent \nowns 1.7 percent. In fact, amazingly enough, the top one-tenth of 1 \npercent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent of the \nAmerican people. Does anyone believe that is what America is supposed \nto be about, where the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns as much wealth \nas the bottom 90 percent?\n  Today we have the absurd situation, the obscene situation, where one \nfamily, the Walton family, the owners of Walmart, are worth about $148 \nbillion. That is more wealth in that one family than the bottom 40 \npercent of the American people.\n  Today in the United States we have the highest rate of childhood \npoverty of any major country on Earth. About one-quarter of our kids \nget nutrition through food stamps, and we are the only industrialized \ncountry--major country--that does not guarantee health care to all \npeople as a right.\n  We once led the world in terms of the percentage of our people who \ngraduated college, but today in a highly competitive global economy we \nare now in 12th place.\n  In terms of infrastructure, the United States used to have the \nfinest, most envied infrastructure in the world. Today, as I think \nevery citizen of this country knows, our infrastructure, our roads, our \nbridges, rail, water systems, airports, dams are virtually collapsing. \nThe American Society of Civil Engineers tells us that we need to spend \n$3 trillion just to bring our infrastructure up to par. But with \ninfrastructure spending now at its lowest level since 1947, we rank \n16th in the world in terms of infrastructure according to the World \nEconomic Forum.\n  So once we led the world in terms of the numbers of percentages of \npeople graduating college; today we are 12th. Once we led the world in \nterms of the strength of our infrastructure; today we are the 16th. But \nwe do have the dubious distinction of being first in terms of childhood \npoverty of any major country.\n  Real unemployment today is not what the official unemployment states \nof 5.8 percent; it is over 11 percent when you include those people who \nhave given up looking for work or are working part time. Youth \nunemployment is over 18 percent.\n  We hear a lot about Ferguson, MO, and that is a very important issue, \nbut we don't hear enough about the reality that African-American youth \nunemployment is over 30 percent.\n  Today in this country millions of Americans are working longer hours \nfor lower wages. In inflation-adjusted-for dollars, the median male \nworker--listen to this; this is really quite unbelievable and it tells \nus a little bit as to why the American people are angry. The median \nmale worker--that worker right in the middle of the economy--last year \nearned $783 less than he made 41 years ago--$783 less than he made 41 \nyears ago in inflation-accounted-for dollars. In the explosion of \ntechnology, the great global economy, all of the great free trade \nagreements, and that male worker today is earning over $700 less than \nhe made in real dollars 41 years ago. The median female worker made \n$1337 less last year than she earned in 2007.\n  Since 1999, the median middle-class family has seen its income go \ndown by\n\n[[Page S6509]]\n\nalmost $5,000 after adjusting for inflation, now earning less this year \nthan a family earned 25 years ago. Are we better off today than we were \n6 years ago when Bush left office and we were hemorrhaging 700,000 jobs \na month and the financial system was on the verge of collapse with a \n$1.3 trillion deficit? Of course we are. But if you look at the trends \nover the last 40 years, the reality is, the middle class in this \ncountry is disappearing and almost all new income and wealth is going \nto the people on top.\n  The American people must demand that Congress and the White House \nstart protecting the interests of working families, not just wealthy \ncampaign contributors. We need Federal legislation to put the \nunemployed back to work, raise wages, and make certain that all \nAmericans have health care and education in order to live healthy and \nproductive lives.\n  We can spend hours dissecting and analyzing the problems of American \nsociety, and in my view, they are worse today than at any time since \nthe Great Depression, and if you throw in the planetary crisis of \nclimate change, we may have more problems today facing our Nation than \nat any time in a very long period.\n  But what I wish to do today is very briefly throw out and discuss 12 \ninitiatives that I believe, if enacted by the Congress, could begin to \naddress the collapse of the middle class and rebuild our economy. I \nwill just touch on them briefly.\n  No. 1, as I mentioned earlier, our infrastructure is collapsing--our \nroads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, airports, railroads, \nand older schools. We spent $3 trillion--or when we take care of the \nlast veteran, we have spent $3 trillion fighting a war in Iraq that we \nnever should have fought in the first place.\n  If over a period of years we were to invest $1 trillion in rebuilding \nour infrastructure, we could create 13 million decent-paying jobs, and \nthat is exactly what we have to do. Think of what America would look \nlike if you went around the country and saw work being done on roads, \nbridges, and cutting-edge technology for our water plants and \nwastewater plants. We would become more productive and efficient. We \nwould put people back to work.\n  No. 2, in my view--and I know many of my Republican colleagues don't \nagree, but the scientific community is united when they say climate \nchange is real, it is caused by human activity, and if we do not \nreverse and substantially cut back carbon emissions, this planet will \nbecome increasingly uninhabitable for our kids and our grandchildren. \nIn my view, we must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels \nand into energy efficiency and sustainable energy, such as wind, solar, \ngeothermal, et cetera.\n  When we address energy efficiency and sustainable energy, not only do \nwe lead the world in transforming our energy system and reversing \nclimate change, but we also create a significant number of meaningful \nand important jobs.\n  No. 3, in my view, instead of giving tax breaks to large corporations \nwhich shut down in America and go to China, we want to invest in new \neconomic models to increase job creation and productivity, and that is \ngiving workers the opportunity to own their own businesses. We have \nsome of that in Vermont, and I know in Ohio there are worker-owned \nbusinesses where workers are more productive and feel better about \ntheir jobs. I would rather invest in that than in corporations that \nwill shut down in this country and move abroad.\n  No. 4, I think most people understand that when you have a union to \nnegotiate and engage in collective bargaining, wages are higher and \nworking conditions are better. Today corporate opposition to union \norganizing makes it extremely difficult for workers to join a union. We \nneed legislation which makes it clear that when a majority of workers \nsigns cards in support of a union, they can have that union.\n  No. 5, the Federal minimum wage today is a starvation wage of $7.25 \nan hour. We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. People who \nwork 40 hours a week should not live in poverty.\n  No. 6, women workers today earn about 78 cents on the dollar to what \ntheir male counterparts earn doing the same work. That is not \nacceptable. We need equal pay for equal work. We need pay equity in our \ncountry, and we have to pass that legislation.\n  No. 7, an issue that we don't talk about enough, and, in fact, has \nhad bipartisan support for many decades, is our disastrous trade \npolicy, NAFTA, CAFTA, and permanent normal trade relations with China. \nThe simple fact is these trade policies have been a disaster for the \nAmerican worker. Since 2001, we have lost more than 60,000 factories in \nthis country and more than 4.9 million decent-paying manufacturing \njobs. Not all of that is attributable to bad trade policies, but a lot \nof it is. We need to rethink our trade policies and demand that \ncorporate America invest in the United States of America and not in \nChina.\n  I know that is a radical idea. Imagine going shopping in a department \nstore where we can actually purchase products made in America and not \nin China, but I think we should be doing that.\n  No. 8, we are not going to be a successful economy unless our young \npeople have the ability to get the college education they need \nregardless of the income of their families. Right now it is \nincreasingly difficult for working families to afford college. Many of \nour young people are coming out of college deeply in debt. In this area \nwe are moving in exactly the wrong direction. Forty, fifty years ago, \ntuition was virtually free at some of the great public universities in \nAmerica, such as the University of California, New York City, and State \ncolleges around country. Today it is unaffordable.\n  We need to radically rethink higher education in this country. Our \ngoal is that everyone, regardless of income, should be able to get a \nquality college education and not come out in debt.\n  No. 9, I think everybody understands the enormous stranglehold that \nWall Street has on our economy. Banking is supposed to be the \nfacilitator to get money out in the productive economy where companies \nare producing products and services and not see Wall Street or \nfinancial institutions as an end in itself, but that is exactly what we \nhave right now. We have six financial institutions in this country that \nhave assets equivalent to over 60 percent of the GDP of the United \nStates of America. That is too big, and it gives them too much economic \nand political power. In my view, they must be broken up and we must \nbring about a more competitive financial system where money is getting \nout to the real economy so businesses can create real jobs.\n  No. 10, and many people don't know this, but the United States is the \nonly major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all \npeople as a right. Yet we end up spending almost twice as much per \ncapita on health care as any other Nation. In my strong opinion, if we \nwant health care for all and we want to do it in a cost-effective way, \nwe need to move toward a Medicare for all, single-payer system.\n  No. 11, today in this great Nation, millions of seniors are living in \npoverty, and that number is growing, and we have the highest rate of \nchildhood poverty of any major country. We must strengthen the social \nsafety net, not weaken it. Instead of talking about cutting Social \nSecurity or cutting Medicare or cutting Medicaid or cutting nutrition \nprograms, we should be expanding those programs. This is a great \ncountry, and we should not have millions of people wondering how they \nare going to be able to buy medicine for their illness or heat their \nhomes in the wintertime. We have to expand the social safety net for \nour kids, our seniors, and our vulnerable populations.\n\n  Last, but certainly not least, at a time of massive wealth and income \ninequality, we need a progressive tax system in this country which is \nbased on ability to pay. It is not acceptable that major profitable \ncorporations have paid nothing in recent years in Federal income taxes \nand that corporate CEOs in this country often enjoy an effective tax \nrate which is lower than their secretaries'.\n  We are losing about $100 billion a year from companies that stash \ntheir profits in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and other tax havens. We \nneed real tax reform. We need to end all of these corporate tax \nloopholes so we have the revenue we need to do the important tasks in \nfront of us to rebuild this country.\n\n[[Page S6510]]\n\n  With that, I think the American people have some fundamental choices \nto make. Do we continue the status quo from an economic perspective and \npolitical perspective or do we demand that Congress start listening to \nthe pain of the middle class and working families of this country and \nstart producing legislation which rebuilds our crumbling middle class?\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks, of up \nto 10 minutes, that Senator Manchin be recognized for his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Financial Institutions\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, every year about this time--actually every \nfew months, or maybe every month--there are attempts by Wall Street to \nagain change the rules, cut back consumer protection laws, and change \nthe regulations that protect the American public against Wall Street \ngreed.\n  It happens almost weekly, it seems, in the Financial Services \nCommittee in the House of Representatives. There are attempts in the \nAgriculture Committee, beaten back by Senator Stabenow, to her credit, \nand attempts in the banking committee, beaten back by Chairman Johnson, \nto his credit.\n  Almost every week, it seems, there are efforts by Wall Street to \nundermine the protections that we were able to build in under the Dodd-\nFrank bill to stop Wall Street from doing to the economy what it did in \n2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008. September of 2008 had been preceded by a \ndecade of deregulation of the financial industry, decades of lobbying \nby very effective lobbyists for the six biggest Wall Street banks. \nRisky behavior was rewarded with gargantuan profits for the firms and \nmultimillion-dollar bonuses for the executives.\n  The CEO of one of the largest megabanks in the history of the world--\nnot just in our country--said: As long as the music is playing, you \nhave got to get up and dance. There is a lot of money to be made on \nWall Street, and they have to take advantage of every loophole, \nparticularly those loopholes that their lobbyists create.\n  This unmitigated greed led to 8 million people losing their jobs, 7 \nmillion losing their homes after being foreclosed on because the \nfinancial system lacked the necessary safeguards to protect Wall \nStreet. Dodd-Frank was supposed to end all of that. It has made \nprogress by preventing taxpayer bailouts for banks. Risky derivatives \ntrading was one of the central goals of Dodd-Frank. An amendment by \nSenator Lincoln, then the Chair of the Agriculture Committee, brought \nforward an amendment in 2009. Dodd-Frank went through the process.\n  The day that President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank bill to protect \nAmericans from Wall Street greed, the chief lobbyists for the chief \nfinancial trade association in this town said: Now it is half-time. \nWhat does ``now it is half-time'' mean? Well, the bill passed, and Wall \nStreet financiers and lobbyists said, we don't like that, but now we \ncan go to the regulatory agencies and weaken the rules, delay their \nimplementation, sometimes stop some of the rulemaking, and we can go \nback to Congress and continue to lobby and weaken these rules.\n  To give you an example of what has happened, in 1995, the 6 largest \nbanks in the United States had assets equal to 18 percent of the GDP. I \ndon't want to bore people with numbers, but in 1995, the 6 largest \nbanks had assets equal to 18 percent of GDP. Today they make up 64 \npercent of GDP. The largest six Wall Street banks--everybody knows \ntheir names--are getting larger and larger, increasing their economic \npower, and as we see almost every day in this Congress and especially \nin the House of Representatives dominated by tea party Republicans and \npeople at the beck and call of Wall Street, we see their political \npower growing.\n  Under the accounting rules applied by the rest of the world, the \nderivatives holdings of the 6 largest banks--basically insurance policy \non top of insurance policy on top of insurance policy as financial \ninstruments--are 39 percent larger than we think they are, which is a \ndifference of about $4 trillion.\n  Derivatives were described by Warren Buffett as timebombs--financial \nweapons of mass destruction carrying dangers that are potentially \nlethal. Senator Levin, who is about to retire from the Senate after 36 \nyears, calls these derivatives nuclear weapons.\n  According to the New York Times, bank lobbyists wrote provisions \ndealing with derivatives that will repeal--not to get too technical--\nthe Lincoln language. And here is what the language in section 716 \nsays: Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal assistance \nmay be provided to any swaps entity with respect to any swaps, \nsecurity-based swap, or other activity of the swaps entity.\n  This is the language that is now Federal law. This language says no \nmore bailouts.\n  However, the legislation likely to be in front of us, the omnibus we \nwill be facing, because of Wall Street lobbyists, because of Republican \nfinancial services members caving to special interests, this provision \nthat says ``no more bailouts'' is done with. We will see language now \nstripped out of Federal law that says ``no more bailouts.''\n  The public needs to understand that if this language passes to strip \nthis language out, if this bill passes, that again bailouts can be \nimminent--bailouts brought on by Wall Street greed, bailouts brought on \nby risky trading, now protected by taxpayers. So, in other words, it is \nheads I win, tails you lose. If I make big bets on derivatives and I am \na Wall Street banker, I make tens of millions of dollars. However, if I \nmake big bets and something bad happens, taxpayers get to pay for it. \nThat is the problem with stripping out section 716.\n  I am not the only one who thinks this. Tom Hoenig, Leader McConnell's \nselection to the FDIC board, supports keeping 716 in the law. Sheila \nBair--once Senator Bob Dole's chief of staff, President Bush's \nappointment, and then President Obama kept her on as a major Federal \nregulator--she is opposed to repeal, as has the White House opposed the \nrepeal.\n  Mark Stefanski, a friend of mine from Third Federal in my \nneighborhood in Cleveland, in Slovak Village, which is about an $11 \nbillion bank on the southeast side of Cleveland. That is a bank which \nmakes mortgages. It does not trade in exotic derivatives. He told me: \nYou know, banking should be boring. It is not about taking excessive \nrisks, especially when those excessive risks are underwritten by \ntaxpayers.\n  That is what abolishing 716--that is what the repeal of the 716 \nlanguage does. It puts taxpayers on the hook in the form of a future \nbailout. It is a subsidy today for the six largest banks. It puts \ntaxpayers on the hook in the future, gives all kinds of additional \nincentives for Wall Street bankers to engage in more risky derivatives \ntrading, and puts us all again under the possibility of a bank bailout.\n  It simply does not make sense. We have the opportunity to reject this \npart of this legislation. We owe it to the families in my State, to \nfamilies in Virginia, to families in Delaware, to families in Georgia, \nand all over this country. That is why we cannot support a measure that \nvalues corporate greed over working America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, first I thank my colleague for giving me \nthis time, and I acknowledge the hard work he has done.\n\n\n                            Weiss Nomination\n\n  I represent the great State of West Virginia. It is a rural State \nwhere we believe in commonsense solutions and values. In the Mountain \nState, we understand the importance of leveling the playing field for \ncommunity institutions and helping small businesses create and keep \njobs. As a Senator from West Virginia, I was sent here to represent the \npeople of Main Street. For those reasons, I rise today to explain why I \nmust oppose the nomination of Wall Street investment banker Antonio \nWeiss to be Under Secretary for Domestic Finance at the Department of \nthe Treasury.\n  I cannot and will not support his nomination because I do not believe \nhe possesses the characteristics and the background we need in an Under \nSecretary to push for strong Wall Street oversight and to protect our \nsmall\n\n[[Page S6511]]\n\nbusinesses and financial institutions on Main Streets all across \nAmerica.\n  The position to which Mr. Weiss has been nominated is one that would \nput him at the head of the Treasury's decisionmaking on issues of \ndomestic finance, fiscal policy, government liability, and other \nrelated domestic matters. He would oversee critical issues such as Wall \nStreet reform, financing the national debt, housing finance reform, and \nsmall business credit. I have serious doubts that Mr. Weiss has the \nright experience to take on such a role.\n  It is clear that as the global head of investment banking at Lazard, \nMr. Weiss is very talented and experienced in working in financial \nmarkets and economic institutions, but as an investment banker on Wall \nStreet, he does not have the experience for this particular oversight \nposition. He has dealt almost entirely with European investment \nbanking, not domestic finance or community banking or regulatory issues \nof any kind, all of which fall under the jurisdiction of this important \nposition.\n  Besides not having the right background for the job, the fact that \nMr. Weiss is a top corporate dealmaker with a specialization in \ninternational financing is in itself troubling to me. He has spent a \ngood deal of his professional career working on mergers and \nacquisitions for the world's largest corporations. He has spent time in \nParis running the firm's European division. There is not a thing wrong \nwith that, but this fits the administration's pattern of choosing Wall \nStreet insiders for senior policy positions instead of those with \nstrong consumer protection or community bank and credit union \nexperience, plain-spoken people who have worked on Main Street.\n  To make matters worse, the substantial compensation Lazard plans to \noffer Mr. Weiss upon his confirmation is another reason to be very \nskeptical. The financial giant is planning to pay him $20 million if he \ncan win confirmation and come into government service. This kind of \narrangement and human nature suggests he will be especially sympathetic \nto Lazard's lobbying efforts. Public service is a noble cause. A $20 \nmillion golden parachute makes it very hard to gain the public's trust.\n  With that being said, I do not believe Mr. Weiss can fulfill the \nduties of Under Secretary of the Treasury Department.\n  Since joining the Senate banking committee, I have tried to make our \nbanking and financial system work better for small businesses, banks, \nand middle-class West Virginians and Americans. I will continue to do \nso. That is why I cannot support this nomination. Mr. Weiss does not \nhave the experience for this particular job.\n  It is important to send a message that we will no longer allow Wall \nStreet to exclusively make our fiscal policy decisions, especially when \nthey affect so many around this country on Main Street. Economic and \nbanking policies have too often been made without the input of our \nNation's midsized banks, community banks, and credit unions. We must \nstrive to have a balanced view of engaging voices on all sides of these \nimportant issues. By confirming Mr. Weiss as the Under Secretary, we \nare putting Wall Street before Main Street. We have already seen from \nthe 2008 crisis how that harmed the Nation as a whole. We do not need \nto repeat that picture again.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Saxby Chambliss\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wanted to rise very briefly because I \nknow Senator Chambliss is about to give his farewell speech. I commend \nmy dear good friend the Senator from Georgia for his service. I am \ngoing to stay through his speech, but I know there will be others who \nwill probably rise afterwards to give accolades, and I wanted to be \nfirst in line to salute him for his service, his friendship to so many \nof us in this body, and my personal good wishes for his future. I know \nthere will be others later; I thought for a change I would get a word \nin first.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                         Farewell to the Senate\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, as my service in the Senate comes to an \nend, I rise today to say thank you to some of the wonderful people who \nhave been part of a great ride for over 20 years.\n  We as Americans are fortunate to live in the greatest country in the \nworld; a country where the American dream is still alive and well; a \ncountry where, in spite of all of our problems, we are the envy of the \nfree world; a country where a preacher's kid from rural southern \nGeorgia can rise to be elected to the House of Representatives and then \nto the Senate.\n  We as Members of the Senate are fortunate to have the opportunity to \nserve. We are blessed to be able to work in such a historic venue as we \nare in this afternoon. As we come into our offices and into this \nbuilding every day, there are some things we take for granted. So to \nthe entire Capitol Hill workforce, from those who clean our offices, to \nthose who change the lightbulbs, provide our food, maintain our \nsubways, keep us safe and secure, and to all of those in between, I say \nthank you. You are very professional in what you do, and you always do \nit with a smile.\n  To the floor staff and the cloakroom staff for both the majority and \nthe minority, thanks for putting in the long hours, listening to often \nboring speeches, reminding us when we have not voted, scheduling floor \ntime, reminding us of the rules, and making sure our mistakes are at a \nminimum.\n  I am fortunate to have been surrounded by great staff during all of \nmy 20 years in the House and Senate, mostly young people from varied \nbackgrounds who are the brightest minds my State and my country have to \noffer. They are committed patriots and loyal to the core. To those \ncurrent and former members of my staff, thank you for your service to \nme and to the State of Georgia.\n  I have been served by four chiefs of staff: Rob Leebern, Krister \nHolladay, Charlie Harman, and Camila Knowles. Every office plan that \neach one of them put together starts with providing better constituent \nservice than any other Member of the House or the Senate. I am \nextremely proud that our record shows we achieve the goal of doing just \nthat. I have even had government agency personnel call my office asking \nfor guidance on cases from other offices.\n  I have often said that my greatest satisfaction from this job comes \nnot from negotiating major pieces of legislation but from being able to \nhelp Georgians with difficulties they are experiencing and having a \npositive impact on their lives.\n  I am particularly blessed to have three members of my staff who have \nbeen with me for all 20 years. My deputy chief Teresa Ervin, Debbie \nCannon, and Bill Stembridge have walked every mile with me and have \nbeen so valuable. Thanks, guys.\n  My greatest support comes from my family. My wife Julianne, my \ndaughter Lia and her husband Joe, my son Bo and his wife Bess, along \nwith our grandchildren--John, Parker, Jay, Kimbrough, Anderson, and \nEllie--have all been somehow involved on the campaign trial.\n  Come the 28th day of this month, Julianne and I will have been \nmarried for 48 years, having met at the University of Georgia a couple \nof years before that. For tolerating a husband who had a 24/7 job for \n20 years, for being a single mom part of that time, and for \nunderstanding why I could not get home until Christmas Eve some years, \nI say thank you, sweetheart.\n  I am privileged today to represent almost 10 million Georgians who \nare the most wonderful people God ever put on this earth. I lost my \nfirst primary election and went on to win each of my next seven races. \nI won every one of those seven races because I shared the values of my \nconstituents, I outworked each of my opponents, and I had better ideas \nand the best advisers and staff. Thanks, Tom and Paige.\n  Thanks to Senators Nunn and Miller for their regular advice and \ncounsel. Thanks to my three leaders, Senator Lott, Senator Frist, and \nSenator McConnell, each of whom provided me with strong leadership and \nalways listened to me even when I had ideas that might have been \ndifferent from their ideas.\n  I am often asked what I will miss most about the Senate. The answer \nis very easy. I will miss my friends and the relationships we have \ndeveloped over the years. Senator Isakson and I\n\n[[Page S6512]]\n\nentered the University of Georgia 52 years ago in September and became \nfriends immediately. We have been the dearest of friends ever since. He \nis without question the most trusted friend and adviser I have. I will \nmiss our daily conversations.\n  My three best buddies from my House days, Speaker John Boehner, \nCongressman Tom Latham, and Senator Richard Burr, along with Senator \nTom Coburn, have been the legislative collaborators, dinner partners, \ngolfing buddies, confidants, and numerous other things that should not \nbe mentioned on the floor of the Senate.\n  Senator Lindsey Graham is like a member of my family. We have \ntraveled the world together many times, hearing a lot. I have no plans \nto write a book, but if I did, Lindsey Graham's anecdotes would fill a \nchapter.\n  Senator Feinstein has been a great chairman and partner on the \nIntelligence Committee. I will miss her leadership, her wisdom, her \nfriendship, and those late-afternoon glasses of California wine.\n  My most productive time in the Senate has been spent with my dear \nfriend Senator Mark Warner. Our work with the Gang of 6, which included \nSenators Durbin, Conrad, Coburn, Crapo, and then later Senators Johanns \nand Bennet, represents the very best of everything about the Senate. We \nspent, literally, hundreds of hours together debating ideas and trying \nto solve major problems, and we came very close. Senator Warner's \ninsight, his wanting to solve problems, and his political inspiration \nare lessons that I will carry with me forever.\n  As the Senate now goes forward under new leadership, I have two \ncomments. First, the Senate should return to regular order. Senator \nMcConnell has indicated that will be the case, and it should be.\n  The rule change by the current majority changed the institution of \nthe Senate in a negative way. I hope the rule is changed back to \nrequire 60 votes on all issues, including judges and nominees. Some of \nthose most vocal favoring the rules change lost their elections, and \nwhile the rules change did not cost them their election, it is very \nclear that the American people wanted a change in the leadership that \nchanged the rule. Regular order will help in restoring trust and \nconfidence to the world's most deliberative body.\n  Second, it is imperative that the issue of the debt of this country \nbe addressed. Just last week our total debt surpassed $18 trillion. We \ncannot leave the astronomical debt our policies have generated for our \nchildren and grandchildren to fix. It is not rocket science; it is what \nmust be done.\n  Cutting spending alone--for example, sequestration--is not the \nsolution. Raising taxes is not the solution. As Simpson-Bowles, \nDomenici-Rivlin and the Gang of 6 all agreed, it will take a \ncombination of spending reduction, entitlement reform, and tax reform \nto stimulate more revenue. Hard and tough votes will have to be taken, \nbut that is why we get elected to the Senate. The world is waiting for \nAmerica to lead on this issue. If we do, the U.S. economy will respond \nin a very robust way. The Gang of 6 laid the foundation for this \nproblem to be solved, and it is my hope that we do not leave the \nsolution for the next generation.\n  I close with what I have enjoyed most about Congress, and that is the \nopportunity that I have had to spend with the men and women in uniform \nand those in the intelligence world, all of whom are willing to put \ntheir lives in harm's way for the sake of our freedom.\n  Whether it was Robins Air Force Base, Kabul, Ramadi, Jalalabad, \nKhowst or Dubai, I always get emotional telling the men and women how \nproud I am of them and how blessed we as Americans are to have them \nprotecting us. They are special people who sacrificed much for the sake \nof all 300 million Americans.\n  Let us also remember and be thankful for the families of those \nmilitary and civilian personnel who likewise make a commitment to \nAmerica. As we head into another Christmas season, many of those \nfamilies will not have at home their spouse, their parent, their son or \ntheir daughter.\n  May God bless them. May God bless this great institution, and may God \ncontinue to bless our great country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                      Tributes to Saxby Chambliss\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Senator Chambliss, my remarks are personal. We worked \ntogether for the past 8 years on the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence. For 4 years we have worked as chair and cochair. We have \nexchanged views, we have negotiated bills, and we have shared \ninformation. We have been there through very tough times and some very \npleasant times. It is very hard for me to see you go.\n  I have learned to trust you. I respect you. We have worked together. \nThe committee put together a Benghazi report. We worked very hard. We \nfound areas of agreement.\n  Senator Collins of the committee is here, and Senator Warner is here. \nAm I missing anyone else from the committee? There is Senator Burr, who \nwill be the new chairman, and Senator Coats, Senator Coburn. We were \nable to come together and put together a report unanimously, and it was \nreally because of your leadership.\n  As I watched, what became very apparent is that maybe your side isn't \nas fractious as my side is. You were able to say yes, we can do this or \nno, we can't do that, and you reflected your Members. That made it very \neasy for me, and I am very grateful.\n  Yesterday we disagreed. You have never taken a cheap shot. We worked \ntogether at the same time to move our intelligence authorization bill. \nThere was one last glitch which you worked out, and that bill passed \nunanimously last night.\n  Together we have worked to put together an information-sharing bill \nfor what is probably our No. 1 defensive issue, which is cyber and the \nattacks that have taken 97 percent of our businesses into difficulties.\n  You have compromised, and I have compromised. Unfortunately, on our \nside, we have some unsolved issues. So, hopefully, I will be able to \npick up with Senator Burr where we left off, and we will be able to get \nthat job done next year.\n  What I want you to know--and I said this to you in another way--that \nit was such a wonderful experience for me to work with you. This is the \nhard part. We are only here for an instant in eternity, and the only \nthing that matters is what we do with that instant.\n  What I want you to know is you have really done yeoman's work in that \ninstant, and I am very grateful to have the pleasure of working with \nyou. I have learned from you, and I wish you all good things.\n  Thank you very much, Senator Chambliss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I rise to pay tribute to my friend, Saxby Chambliss.\n  I will admit to you this is a speech I never wanted to make. I never \nwanted to make it because we have had a wonderful relationship in this \nbody for the past 10 years. We have done everything together.\n  He has had my back, and I have had his back. He is a great friend, \nand I will miss him. But I am not a selfish guy. He married one of the \nfinest women I have ever known, Julianne Chambliss, who is one of the \nbest friends my wife has.\n  Although he is leaving us and I will miss the crutch I have used for \nso long, Julianne is getting her Saxby back. For Julianne, her family, \nand those grandkids he loves so much, that is exactly what Saxby wants \nto do.\n  Georgia has had some great Senators: Richard Russell, who was really \nthe master of the Senate; Zell Miller, a former Governor of Georgia, a \ngreat friend of mine and a great mentor of our State; and Sam Nunn, one \nof the finest in national defense and foreign policy our State ever \noffered. Saxby will be the fourth on the Mount Rushmore of Georgia \nSenators who have served Georgia with distinction and with class.\n  I want to tell Saxby this in person. For 10 years we have done joint \nconferences. We have messed up twice. When I messed up he covered my \nback and when he messed up I covered his.\n  In 2008 when he almost lost a race and got into a runoff in December \nin Georgia, I rode a bus for 21 straight days introducing him three \ntimes a day and eating barbecue every single day\n\n[[Page S6513]]\n\nfor dinner and for lunch. That is a price to pay that only friendship \nwill bring out.\n  He is a dear friend, a trusted person. I love him very much and I \nlove his family very much.\n  I could talk all day, but I wanted to open and close by saying, \nSaxby, I love you. The State is going to love having you back. This \ncountry is going to miss you, but my grandchildren are safer, my State \nis better, and our relationship has never been stronger.\n  May God bless you and your family in every endeavor you undertake, \nand may God bless the United States of America.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. First, I would say I have only been in the Senate for 4 \nyears. When I came, let's just say it was not what I expected. For \nthat, you look for a little bit of respite, if you will.\n\n  I looked at my colleagues and my friends on the Republican side. I \ndidn't come to the Senate looking at what side you were on. I looked at \nbasically the person I was dealing with.\n  There was a person who befriended me almost from my first day, \nknowing that the transition was a challenge. He stepped up to the plate \nwith a few of my other friends over there--I see Senator Coburn behind \nhim--and basically took me under the wing and said: Listen, we can all \nwork together and get along. What we do here is bigger and for the \ngreater good than what we do for ourself.\n  Saxby not only showed me, but basically I was able to follow and \nwatch what he did. This Chamber should be filled right now--it really \nshould be from all sides--but the bottom line is the Senator is loved \nby everybody. I never heard an ill word said about Saxby Chambliss, the \ndistinction he carries as far as the Senate and as a human being.\n  I say to the Senator, your family and your priorities are correct. \nYour moral compass is working and working well. I can only tell you \nthank you. As someone from the other side of the aisle and as a fellow \ncolleague and a fellow American, you are an inspiration to us all.\n  Saxby, there will not be another Saxby, but I am glad they gave you \nto me for this short period of time of 4 years. Some of you--I look at \nJohnny, and I envy Johnny. For 52 years he has been your close friend.\n  There is your partner in crime back there, Senator Burr. We hope he \ndoesn't tell it all when he gets up.\n  But with that being said, there are so many people who have a \nrelationship that is unmatched and that is because of you.\n  I say, my dear friend, my hat is off to you. Thank you, and God bless \nyou for what you have done for the United States of America, for \nGeorgia, but most importantly for all of us. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from North Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, this moment is bittersweet for me.\n  I spent more time with Saxby than I have with my own wife for the \npast 20 years. We have done everything together. Those vacation spots \nhe mentioned--Kabul, Baghdad--I was right beside him.\n  We traveled to areas of the world that others wouldn't venture to, \nand there was a reason he was there. He was concerned about America's \nfuture, he was concerned about his children's future, and he was in a \nposition to have an impact on it to make it better for them in the \nfuture. That is why he served. It is obvious to all of our colleagues \nthat he is a lot older than I am, but he has worked just as hard as the \nyoungest Member of this institution.\n  Even though we have seen each other's children grow up, and now we \nhave seen them all married off, he deserves the time to go home and \nspend some time with his grandchildren and, more importantly, to get to \nknow his wife again.\n  I want to say, Senator Feinstein, I like red wine just as much as \nSaxby does. I probably can't be bought as cheaply as he could, but I do \nlook forward to continuing to work with you and, more importantly, to \ncontinue to do the work on the Intelligence Committee that really does \nbuild on what Saxby started in the year 2000 as we went on the House \nIntelligence Committee together.\n  There is only one way to sum up Saxby Chambliss. He is a true \nsouthern gentleman. He is absolutely a statesman, but what everybody \nwho meets Saxby understands is this. He is a great American, he loves \nthis country, he loves this institution, and some piece of him will \nremain here when he leaves at the end of this year. He will have an \nimpact on what happens even though his presence may not be here.\n  We wish him Godspeed in life after.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am a bit out of order here. I was waiting \nfor some of my colleagues who have spent a bit more time here than I to \nspeak, but I wanted to take this opportunity to add my sincere thanks \nto Saxby Chambliss for the kind of person he is and the kind of \nleadership he has provided and the kind of example he has set during \nhis time in Congress and in the Senate.\n  I was privileged to be able to come back to the Senate and join the \ngroup of people who shared the same deep concerns I had shared. The \nreason I did come back was due to the threats to our country from \nabroad and the fiscal plunge into debt that is going to affect our \ncountry dramatically in the future if we don't deal with it. But having \nthe privilege of being with the people who have set such an example has \nbeen a great privilege for me.\n  If I were a producer and director of a movie I was going to have come \nout about the Senate, I would want Saxby to be the leading man. First \nof all, he looks like a Senator, and he has that southern calm presence \nthat most of us envy and he just seems to fit the profile. The next \nchoice would have to be for the leading lady, and you couldn't find a \nmore gracious, beautiful, supportive leading lady than Julianne \nChambliss. Together, they just make a stunning couple.\n  I have had the privilege of traveling with them and seeing them in \ndifferent places and in different situations, and what a tremendous \ngift it is to be with the both of them. So the Senate and many of us \nhere will dearly miss Saxby Chambliss. He comes from a line of \ndistinguished Senators representing the State of Georgia, and as \nSenator Burr said, he fits right into that long list of people whose \ntenure here has been remembered for decades and will continue to be \nremembered for decades.\n  His commitment to our men and women in uniform, his service to the \nagriculture community but particularly, in my experience, his \nleadership of the Intelligence Committee has been leadership this \ncountry has needed in a time of dire circumstances. His work with \nChairman Feinstein in dealing with the daily pressures and weight of \nresponsibility that falls on the leadership--and all of us who serve on \nthe committee but particularly the leadership of the Intelligence \nCommittee--has probably been as great in the last several years as any \ntime in our history. Very difficult decisions have had to be made.\n  I know I sometimes stagger out of that committee thinking, this is \nmore than I can get my mind around. This is more than I can get my arms \naround in terms of how do we deal with some of these threats and some \nof these challenges that have popped up all over the world in various \nmanifestations. Yet the solid leadership on the Republican side with \nSaxby Chambliss has united us in a way that has forged a real bond and \na desire to work in a nonpartisan basis to live up to our \nresponsibility to provide oversight for the intelligence community and \nto be a part of helping make those decisions that are so important and \nso formative in terms of how we deal with these particular issues.\n  So I thank Saxby for the person he has been, the person he is, and \nthe person he will continue to be, for the example he has set, for his \nfriendship, and for his extraordinary leadership. I know the \nrefrigerator will be stocked with Coca Cola, there will be Georgia \npeanuts in his pocket, maybe a little bit of bourbon in a drawer \nsomewhere, and he will have a tee time at Augusta just about any time \nhe wants. I wish him the very best as he and Julianne go forward with \ntheir life. He has left his mark here and certainly he has left his \nmark on me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S6514]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, a lot has been said about Saxby already, \nbut I have an observation I have noticed over the last 10 years since I \nhave been here, and it is about leadership. We see elected leadership \non both sides, but then we see real leadership. We see the person \npeople go to for advice. We see the person people go to for counsel. We \nsee the person whom people go to for wisdom and judgment. That is what \nI have noticed the last 10 years.\n  More than anybody in this body, whether it is from the other side of \nthe aisle or this side of the aisle, the person whose counsel is most \nsought is that of Saxby Chambliss. That is real leadership that is \nearned, and it needs to be recognized and honored for what it is. \nBecause what it says is his leadership comes without judgment on the \nperson asking the question, without condemnation of a position that may \nbe different than his. It is giving of himself for the benefit of the \nrest of us.\n  Hear, hear, my friend from Georgia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, it is an honor for me to stand and pay \ntribute to Saxby Chambliss. I think the first time I got to work around \nSaxby was when I was nominated as the Secretary of Agriculture, and I \nthink the first hearing Saxby chaired as chairman of the Senate ag \ncommittee might have been that hearing.\n  I arrived in Washington, and I was scared to death. I had no idea \nwhat to expect. But I met with Saxby, and I knew immediately that when \nI was in that hearing I was going to be treated with dignity and with \nrespect because he wouldn't have it any other way. That is the way he \ndid business.\n  Fortunately, I was confirmed, and that started our working \nrelationship. In those years, I would not try to argue that we agreed \non every nuance of farm policy. I am positive there were times when \nSaxby was convinced I didn't understand a thing about southern \nagriculture. But he was patient and he was determined to represent all \nof agriculture, whether it was the South, the Midwest or the West. His \ngoal was to be a chairman of the ag committee for all of agriculture. \nIt was during that time the farm bill was written, and he was a tough \nnegotiator. He had a mind in terms of where he was headed and he was \ngoing to stand up for his people and I came to respect him so much.\n  It was in the Senate though where I truly began to understand his \ntalent. I can't tell you how many times we have been in a caucus \nmeeting and somebody would ask the most intricate, difficult question \nrelating to intelligence and national security, and invariably we would \nturn to Saxby. Saxby would stand and, in that quiet but forceful way he \nhas, he would walk us through the intricacies of the issues. On \nwhatever the topic was, he would explain it in a way that literally \neverybody in the room understood. They got it. Watch out. You had \nbetter be prepared to be Senators with the information he had given us.\n  What has impressed me so much, and I know I speak for my colleagues \nwhen I say this, is he could do the same thing with the most intricate \nissues relative to farm policy or ag policy or finance or the Federal \nbudget. The breadth of his knowledge is absolutely unbelievable.\n  I thank you, Saxby, for the many times you probably disagreed with me \nimmensely but treated me thoughtfully and respectfully and listened to \nmy opinion. I saw you do that with other Members in this body. I thank \nyou for your service. As one of the retiring Members, I will look \nforward to the opportunity to spend more time with you. I hope our \npaths cross many times in the future because I know I will be the \nbetter for it.\n  God bless you, my friend, and best wishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. The junior Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Your words.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Look. I am so proud to be here to say a couple of words \nabout my friend Saxby. As you have heard from my colleagues, he is \nbeloved. By the way, two of those who spoke are Senators who are also \nchoosing to leave us. Tom Coburn talked about leadership. I will tell \nyou, they are leaving a huge void.\n  I got to know Saxby when he came to the House of Representatives. I \nwas there in the early 1990s, and we became friends. Although I am from \nOhio and he is a son of the South, he and Julianne embraced me and \nJane, and I got to know his son Bo--such a great family.\n  But I didn't truly get to know him until I was the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative and my job was to try to open markets for U.S. \nagricultural products around the world. That required looking at \nsomething called subsidies--agriculture subsidies. This is a dangerous \narea in terms of politics, and Mike Johanns is very well aware of this \nas an ex-Secretary of Agriculture, having been at my side during some \nof these negotiations.\n  My job was to come to the Senate ag committee and talk about what we \nwere up to and try to find out how much flexibility there was for us to \nget these markets open that were so important for our farmers and \nranchers but entailed considerable political risk. I learned a new \nSaxby Chambliss there. That is when I saw the leadership that was \ntalked about earlier.\n  Saxby was willing to not just be constructive but to take that risk \nand to be totally discreet and confidential in dealing with very \nsensitive issues. I came away with a whole new level of understanding \nabout Saxby and therefore a new respect for him, his character, and his \nwillingness to do what was right.\n  More recently, of course, we have seen his leadership on other \nissues: standing up for our men and women in uniform. My colleagues, to \nme, he has been the guardian at the gate, giving us all comfort as \nranking member of the Intelligence Committee. We live in a dangerous, \nvolatile world, and knowing Saxby was there, clear-eyed, disciplined, \ndiscreet, and able to tell it like it was and tell it like it is today, \nI think has given not just us but our families and all Americans \nconsiderable comfort. So I appreciate his service there.\n  Finally, I admire his willingness to step up on this issue of our \nnational debt. This is again not an easy issue, and he joined with some \ncolleagues to promote some proposals. Again, my colleagues who are \nleaving know this, Tom Coburn, in particular; Mike Johanns, whom I will \nalways have a great deal of respect for the way he has handled that \nissue as well.\n  Despite everything we have heard about him today though, perhaps his \ngreatest accomplishment has yet to be mentioned; that is, the fact that \nhe played golf with the President of the United States and managed to \nget a hole in one. The press report from that day says two things that \nare very interesting. First, it says he hit the hole in one on the \nsouth course. The son of the South chose to use the south course, of \ncourse, for his hole in one, but, second, it says ``he was choking up \non a 5-iron.''\n  Taking nothing away from his hole in one--and it sounds like it \nwasn't as long a shot as he explained to me it might have been--but \nchoking up on a 5-iron makes no sense to me. There is nobody more \npoised, more smooth. I have never seen him choke on anything.\n  Saxby, we are sad to see you leave but happy to see you spend more \ntime with Julianne, the kids, and the beloved Bulldogs. Godspeed, my \nfriend.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise to thank my friend Saxby Chambliss. \nSenator Coburn spoke about leadership. We are very much going to miss \nSenator Coburn, Senator Johanns, and Senator Chambliss in this body.\n  But what he said is very true; because as someone who has only served \nhere for 4 years, one of the people who has been most welcoming to me \nand a mentor and role model and someone from whom I have sought advice \nis Saxby Chambliss.\n  As we look at this body and people whom we can emulate as role \nmodels, Saxby Chambliss is one of those role models. Not only is he \nincredibly knowledgeable on the issues that are so important to this \nNation--and I can say, having served with him on the Armed Services \nCommittee, he is one of the most knowledgeable people in this country, \nnot only on what we need to do to keep the country safe because\n\n[[Page S6515]]\n\nof his role on the Intelligence Committee, but also what we need to \nensure that our men and women in uniform have the very best to keep our \ncountry safe. Saxby has a deep understanding and very much loves our \nmen and women in uniform, and has stood up for them in ensuring that \nthey have gotten what they need to keep this country safe.\n  From my perspective, he is someone who is going to be so missed in \nthis body, because he has understood that you can stand on principle, \nas he has, for the important challenges facing this Nation--whether it \nis keeping us safe, or addressing the national debt that threatens not \nonly our security but the prosperity of America; but he has also done \nit in a way that he has been able to build relationships--relationships \nwithin our own conference in the Republican Caucus, where he is a go-to \nleader, where people like me seek his advice on how to get things \ndone--but also, as we can see here, relationships across the aisle.\n  As we go into the new Congress, I hope as Saxby goes on to do other \nimportant things with his lovely family and Julianne and his children \nand grandchildren, that we will follow the example of Saxby Chambliss \nof what it means to work together, of what it means to be respectful of \neach other to get things done for this country, and to address the \ngreat challenges that Saxby has done so much important work on--\nincluding keeping our Nation safe and making sure that America remains \nstrong.\n  Saxby, I want to thank you for being so welcoming to me, for being a \nrole model, and for being someone who I think is an example of what it \nmeans to serve this country with distinction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                     Tribute to Departing Senators\n\n             Saxby chambliss, Tom Coburn, and Mike Johanns\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, in the new Congress we will welcome 12 new \nRepublican Senators, and that is wonderful. They are great people. They \nare excited. They are enthusiastic. I think they are going to do \nwonderful things. So there are 12 new Republican Members coming into \nthe new Senate, and I am looking and we are going to lose 3 of our \nRepublican colleagues. I am thinking, maybe that is about the right \nratio; it is about 4 to 1.\n  But these are three individuals who are unbelievable in what they \nhave been able to do in the relationships they built, the friendships, \nand the work they have done on behalf of the American people. So I am \nlooking at that statistic and I am thinking: Wow, these are three great \npeople who have done the work of many, and I think they have laid the \nfoundation in many ways for us to get to a majority: Senator Johanns, \nSenator Coburn, and Senator Chambliss. I think they have done a lot of \nthat work required for us to get to majority.\n  We have heard about the great Senator from Georgia. But I think the \nthings I am going to talk about for a minute in regard to Saxby \nChambliss apply to the two individuals sitting here with him. They are \ncut from the same cloth: Senator Coburn, Senator Johanns, true public \nservants. People who ran for the right reason; people who serve for the \nright reason. I think we could ask anybody in this body on either side \nof the aisle, and they would tell us that these three individuals \nserved for the right reasons, and served to the very best of their \nability the American people--not just the people of their State, but \nthe American people. They will be remembered long after they are gone. \nThey will be remembered because of the great, wonderful people they \nare, for the relationships they have built, and for that service. So I \necho Senator Ayotte's comments.\n  Senator Coburn touched on it, too. One of the first people I looked \nto as a mentor when I came here 4 years ago was Saxby Chambliss. Now, \nthat doesn't seem intuitively like something I would do--I am from \nNorth Dakota, he is from Georgia. Mike Johanns has been a mentor of \nmine since Governor days, so for more than a decade. But one of the \nfirst people I looked to as a mentor was Saxby Chambliss, and I don't \neven know why. It was one of those things that immediately you like the \nguy. But as you listened to him a little bit, you respected the guy. \nYou thought: This guy has something to say. He knows what he is doing. \nBut then, it is that relationship thing--that thing where he goes out \nof his way to work with you, to help you, to understand what you are \ntrying to do in a friendly way, with great humor, and he does it \nnaturally. It is just who he is. It is automatic. I think Senator \nIsakson really put his finger on it: It is just the way he is. You are \nnaturally drawn to him.\n\n  I think we could talk to any of our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle and they would tell you the same thing: integrity, honesty, \nintelligence; somebody you can work with, somebody who cares, somebody \nwho always has the best interests of the American people at heart.\n  I had the opportunity to work with him on the farm bill, and I was \ncounting on Senator Coburn to kind of jump in there and do it with him, \nbut that didn't happen right away. I am kidding a little bit. But we \ncouldn't have had a farm bill without Senator Chambliss.\n  When I think how difficult it is to move legislation like that, \nparticularly over the course of the past year, and realize that a farm \nbill really isn't so much Republican/Democratic--it really isn't. If \nyou look at how a farm bill works, that is not the makeup. It comes \ndown to people who know and understand agriculture, who understand the \nimportance of a good farm bill for our farmers and ranchers, but \nunderstand also that our farmers and ranchers across the country create \nthe highest quality, lowest cost food supply in the world. It is not \nperfect, but every American benefits every day from the highest \nquality, lowest cost food supply in the world.\n  So when I think of my State of North Dakota, or Senator Coburn's \ngreat State of Oklahoma, or Senator Johanns' State of Nebraska--we all \nproduce all of these different ag products. We raise all these crops, \nwe raise all these animals. And there are so many people out there, so \nmany farmers and ranchers--they don't know Saxby Chambliss. But I will \ntell you what: They owe him a great big thank you. They really do, \nbecause without him we wouldn't have a good farm plan for this country.\n  The reality is it is not just the farmers and ranchers. It is true \nfor so many people across this country: They may not know Saxby \nChambliss, but they owe him a lot. He is somebody who epitomizes the \nvery best of this institution.\n  I know his wife Julianne is here. I have to admit, when I first met \nher I thought it was his daughter because she is so young and \nbeautiful. I am teasing him a little. But she is fantastic. And the \nsame thing--she was immediately a friend and a mentor to my wife Mikey.\n  When we talk about Saxby Chambliss, Tom Coburn, Mike Johanns, it \ndoesn't get any better than that. We will miss them a lot.\n  I wish all three of them Godspeed, and may God bless you in your next \ncareer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                    Second Anniversary of Sandy Hook\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I add my congratulations to Senator \nChambliss. It is strange, coming here in the last 2 years and getting \nto serve only 2 years with giants in the Senate like Saxby, like Tom \nHarkin, and like Senator Rockefeller, whose legacies will live on.\n  Knowing what a good soul Senator Chambliss is, I bet he would enjoy \nthe Newtown Labor Day parade. I have a picture of it here.\n  We had the 53rd annual Newtown Labor Day parade this last year. This \nis the biggest event that happens in Connecticut on Labor Day. It is a \ncelebration of the town. There are 120 different groups that make up \nthe parade. There is the Newtown High School marching band. This year \nGrand Marshall Sydney Eddison was proudly marching at the front. The \nLitchfield Hills Pipe Band and newer groups such as the Marching Cobras \nof New York were there this year. It is a must-stop if you are a \nSenator, Governor, or Congressperson. We all march together at the \nfront of the parade regardless of party. It is a really fantastic and \nwonderful place.\n  This year there were marchers from the Avielle Foundation; a truck \ndecorated in pink promoting a culture of\n\n[[Page S6516]]\n\nkindness. Sandy Hook Elementary School had a float called ``The Magic \nSchool Bus to Sandy Hook School.'' It had a positive message of ``Think \nYou Can, Work Hard, Get Smart, Be Kind,'' and the judges selected Sandy \nHook School's float as the winner in the best school category.\n  It is a reminder that Sandy Hook is a positive place; Newtown is a \npositive place--a place that is rebounding as we come upon the 2-year \nanniversary, the 2-year memorial of the tragic shooting in that town \nthat took the lives of 20 6- and 7-year-olds, and 6 of their teachers \nwho were sworn to protect them.\n  Senator Blumenthal and I have come to the floor today to mark that 2-\nyear anniversary and to talk for a brief few moments about what has \nhappened over the last 2 years--what has happened that has been \npositive, and the work that is left to still be done.\n  There are a lot of positive things that have happened. It is \nimpossible to try to find any good that comes out of this, but the \nfoundational work that has happened in the memory of these children is \nremarkable.\n  The Jessica Rekos Foundation was formed in an effort to pay homage to \nJessica's love of horses and her love of whales. They opened up a \nsummer camp where kids ages 6 to 10, the age that Jessica was when she \npassed, could be able to enjoy horses, learn how to ride and take care \nof them. They raise money to sponsor the Orca Fellowship, which is \ndedicated to conservation initiatives for the orca whale.\n  I mentioned the Avielle Foundation. Avielle's brilliant parents \nstarted a foundation seeking to do new research into brain activity. \nThey have a new PSA video to highlight the need to understand the \naspects of the brain that can lead to aggression and violence.\n  Ana Grace Marquez-Greene. Her family is a musical family. They \nstarted a foundation which tries to identify ways to build stronger \ncommunities. Her father is a wonderful jazz musician, and he recently \nreleased an album called ``Beautiful Life.'' The proceeds all go to \nthis effort.\n  Sandy Hook Promise, a group of families, is asking schools and \ncommunities to take a simple first step to ending violence. That first \nstep is to talk to children and teens about how to be a good \nbystander--to look out for those first signs of trouble, and to report \nanything that may seem out of the ordinary.\n  We frankly have seen how that small act can make a big difference. \nJust last week a young man was arrested in Utah after he admitted he \nhad brought a gun to school with the intent to shoot a girl he had a \nfalling out with and then his plans were to open fire on the rest of \nhis classmates, but a student heard about it and tipped off authorities \nso he could be stopped before he carried out his plan. That is what \nSandy Hook Promise is trying to do in the wake of this tragedy, to \nspread the word that those small acts can make a difference.\n  I will talk for a few minutes about what hasn't been done when it \ncomes to policy changes, but there is a lot that has happened when it \ncomes to policy as well. In Connecticut we passed the strongest antigun \nviolence measure in the country. It cracks down on illegal guns and \ninvests more resources into identifying trouble spots before they \nhappen. Washington State just passed a new referendum with 60 percent \nof the vote that extends their background check systems to private \nsales and to transfers. In Colorado they passed a strong new law as \nwell. On the private sector side retailers are stepping up. Big \nretailers from Starbucks to Chipotle, to Target have taken proactive \nsteps, separate and aside from anything government has done, to keep \nfirearms out of their stores. So there are a lot of positives that have \nhappened in the private sector and in the public sector, and hopefully \nwe can build on that work. Hopefully Congress can recognize that our \nsilence, our inability to pass anything in the 2-year period of time \nsince Sandy Hook passed, effectively makes us complicit in the \ncontinuing assault on students all across this country.\n  Here is the map. In the 2 years since Newtown, there have been 95 \ndifferent school shootings all across the country. Ninety-five \ndifferent school shootings have occurred. During the last 3 months \nalone, there were 17 school shootings, including a single week where \nthere was one every day, five events over the course of 5 days. This is \nan absolute epidemic that is happening all across this country since \nSandy Hook. Why I say we are complicit is that when there is no \nresponse from Congress, when there is not a single legislative act \npassed to try to do something about this, it sends a message of quiet \nendorsement of what is happening. I know that is not our intent. I know \nthat is not in the hearts or minds of any of our Members, but people \nnotice when every week there is a new story of a school shooting all \nacross the country and Congress does absolutely nothing about it while \nthe private sector and State legislatures step up to do something about \nit. So this is a day when we remember what happened 2 years ago, but it \nis also a day in which we should feel ashamed that we haven't done a \nsingle thing to try to stem this tide.\n  I get it that we are not going to get a background check bill passed \nin the next 2 years, but why not work on mental health funding? Why not \nhave everybody in this Chamber spend 5 minutes of your time reading the \nreport that was just released by the Connecticut child advocate \ndetailing the history of Adam Lanza's intersection with the mental \nhealth system during his early years and adolescence and how it failed \nstep after step, year after year, month after month--a lack of \nfollowup, a lack of coordination, a lack of diagnosis. We have a mental \nhealth system in this country that is broken and can be fixed--yes, \nwith some more resources but just with better coordination. That is \nsomething we can work on together over the next 2 years. So we can say \nwhen this chart gets peppered with another 50 dots by this time next \nyear that we didn't just stand silent.\n  Nobody is more articulate than Senator Blumenthal in talking about \nthat day, and I don't want to relive it on this floor, except to share \nthe most powerful testimony I have heard about what happened that day.\n  This is a community that is recovering, but it is still a community \nin crisis. We don't lose 20 little boys and girls and just come back to \nlife in 2 years. It is a resilient community, but it is a community \nthat still hurts, and it hurts in part because they don't see us doing \nanything about it.\n  So before I yield the floor to Senator Blumenthal to say a few words, \nI wish to close with somebody else's words. I have shared these words \non the floor before, but they are just as powerful now as they were the \nlast time I read them.\n  This is Neil Heslin testifying before Congress in February of 2013. \nHe is still Jesse Lewis's father, one of the little boys who was killed \nthat day. So as we think about what happened 2 years ago in Sandy Hook \nand we think about the charge we have before us and we think about the \nfact that there are those of us such as myself and Senator Blumenthal \nand others who will not rest until we honor their memories by our \nactions, let me give you these words:\n\n       On December 14, Jesse got up and got ready for school. He \n     was always excited to go to school. I remember on that day we \n     stopped by Misty Vale Deli. It's funny the things you \n     remember.\n       I remember Jesse got the sausage, egg and cheese he always \n     gets, with some hot chocolate. And I remember the hug he gave \n     me when I dropped him off. He just held me, and he rubbed my \n     back. I can still feel that hug.\n       And Jesse said, ``It's going to be alright. Everything's \n     going to be okay, Dad.'' Looking back it makes me wonder. \n     What did he know? Did he have some idea about what was going \n     to happen? But at the time I didn't think much of it. I just \n     thought he was being sweet.\n       Jesse had this idea that you never leave people hurt. If \n     you can help somebody, you do it. If you can make somebody \n     feel better, you do it. If you can leave somebody a little \n     better off, you do it.\n       They tell me that's how he died. I guess we still don't \n     know exactly what happened at that school. Maybe we'll never \n     know. But what people tell me is that Jesse did something \n     different.\n       When he heard the shooting, he didn't run and hide. He \n     started yelling. People disagree on the last thing he said. \n     One person who was there said he yelled ``run.'' Another \n     person said he told everybody to ``run now.'' Ten kids from \n     my son's class made it to safety. I hope to God something \n     Jesse did helped them survive that day.\n       What I know is that Jesse wasn't shot in the back. He took \n     two bullets. The first one grazed the side of his head. . . . \n     The other hit\n\n[[Page S6517]]\n\n     him in the forehead. Both bullets were fired from the front. \n     That means that the last thing my son did was look Adam Lanza \n     straight in the face and scream to his classmates to run. The \n     last thing he saw was that coward's eyes.\n       Before he died, Jesse and I used to talk about maybe coming \n     to Washington someday. He wanted to go up to the Washington \n     monument. When we talked about it last year Jesse asked if we \n     could come and meet the President.\n       . . . Jesse believed in you.\n\n  This is Neil Heslin, his father talking.\n\n       . . . Jesse believed in you. He learned about you in school \n     and he believed in you. I want to believe in you, too. I know \n     you can't give me Jesse back. Believe me, if I thought you \n     could, I'd be asking you for that.\n       But I want to believe that you will think about what I told \n     you here today. I want to believe you'll think about it and \n     then you'll do something about it, whatever you can do to \n     make sure no other father has to see what I've seen.\n\n  That is a pretty powerful message, a message that on the 2-year \nanniversary mark of that horrible tragedy we would be wise to listen \nto.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, on December 14, 2012, we saw evil, but \nwe also saw good. We saw tragedy, but we also saw actions that should \ncontinue to inspire us.\n  The evil was in a deranged young man who committed unspeakable and \nunimaginable horrific acts, but the good was exemplified by the police, \nthe emergency responders, and the teachers who not only risked their \nlives but saved other ones. The good was something that came forward in \nthe days and months and in the past 2 years.\n  Often I visit the playgrounds that have been built throughout the \nState of Connecticut in memory of those children, in memory of \nCharlotte Bacon in West Haven and Ana Grace Marquez-Greene in Hartford, \nJessica Rekos in Fairfield, and Dylon Hockley in Westfork, and Victoria \nSoto in Stratford. I visit them to watch children playing, children \noften the same age as the wonderful, beautiful children who perished on \nthat day, and parents about the same age as the teachers who lost their \nlives, sixth-grade educators.\n  On that day parents in Newtown took their children to school, kissed \nthem goodbye and went about their days, went to work to plan play dates \nand snack breaks and holiday parties, and just hours into that morning \nmany parents were standing at the Sandy Hook Volunteer Fire Station \nwhere I also went that day. What I saw was through the eyes of a \nparent, not just a public official, the cries of grief, the faces, and \nvoices filled with tears and longing. Those images I will never forget, \nand they have redoubled my own determination to try to make America \nsafer and better, to keep faith with those 26 wonderful people whose \nlives were lost that day, and more than 30,000 people who perished in \nthe United States as a result of violence simply because many of them \nwere in the wrong place at the wrong time--on the street or in \nneighborhoods or in their own home.\n  The good that is done every day by our police and firemen and \nemergency responders to try to stem and stop this epidemic of violence \ncannot overcome the flood of guns in our Nation and cannot compensate \nfor the lack of effective measures to make America safer and better by \nmaking our laws against gun violence more effective.\n  I will never forget that day or any of the victims or their families, \nand I hope America never forgets them as well. We are memorializing now \ntheir wonderful lives by acts of kindness, but the best and truest way \nto memorialize them in history is to approve effective, commonsense, \nsensible measures against gun violence.\n  In the aftermath of those horrific events of December 14, all of \nConnecticut, certainly in Newtown, and our State came together to lift \nthose who were so devastatingly impacted, and those families have shown \nincredible strength. They sat in the gallery, they came to visit us and \nour colleagues urging action. Congress's failure to act is contemptible \nand unconscionable and a betrayal of those individuals. The action that \nis ultimately truest and best as a memorial to them will be for this \nCongress to act.\n  In Newtown and around the Nation, every community in some way was \naffected in those days and in some way came together with Newtown. So \nmy hope is still that that spirit will be an inspiration to action, \nthat it will be an impetus to the Congress for effective, commonsense \nmeasures that will protect countless others who are in danger and who \nwill die if Congress does not act.\n  More than 60,000 firearm deaths have occurred since December 14, \n2012. There are 32,000 firearm deaths per year. Those families have \ndemonstrated unrelenting resolve, and so should we, and we will. It \ntook more than 10 years for the Brady law to be approved, even after a \nPresident of the United States was almost assassinated and his Press \nSecretary, Jim Brady, was severely injured and paralyzed.\n\n  I hope it will not take 10 years for action to be taken by Congress, \nbut we need the persistence and perseverance that will carry us through \nwhatever it takes to achieve lasting reform.\n  I have been proud to serve as a member of the Judiciary Committee and \nto have worked hard for this measure, helping to lead the effort to \napprove the ban on high-capacity magazines as well as assault weapons \nand background checks. But a mental health initiative and school safety \ninitiative have also been part of what we need do. I will continue my \nwork on those efforts--mental health and school safety bills I have \nintroduced, including the Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor \nProtection Act.\n  Lori Jackson was estranged from her husband. She obtained a court \norder against him because of the real evidence of danger from him. \nUnfortunately, that court order failed to save her life because it was \nonly temporary, and it failed to take away the guns her husband had. \nThe Lori Jackson Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act will fill \nthat gap in our laws now.\n  Women are five times as likely to die as a result of domestic \nviolence when there is a gun in the home. One in five women are victims \nof domestic violence at some point in their lives. That is the reason \nwe need to continue this fight on many fronts. Since that day or about \nthen, on December 14, I have worn a bracelet and I still do. The \nwriting has faded and is no longer visible, but the one thing it said \nwas, ``Love wins.'' I truly believe that love won in Newtown, that love \nwon when Connecticut's legislature passed a strong and effective \nmeasure. It was the next step. It is not the end of the work, but the \nnext step. I believe that love won through the grace and courage and \nstrength of the families of those children and the loved ones of the \nteachers who lost their lives.\n  I believe love wins every day in our classrooms around the Nation \nwhen teachers work hard--and they work hard--and resolve to keep their \nchildren safe. Love wins every day when someone stands up and speaks \nout against gun violence. Love will win, eventually. Honor will win. We \nwill honor those children, and we will celebrate the love they felt so \ndeeply and unconditionally--as only children can--unqualifiedly for \ntheir parents and their community. I believe that love will win \neventually as long as we keep working.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6517-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6517-S6518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FAA MODERNIZATION AND REFORM ACT OF 2012\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal).

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                      Taxpayers Right-To-Know Act\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes to talk as \nin morning business. I am not going to offer a unanimous consent \nrequest, but I am putting the majority leader on notice that I will do \nthat before we leave today or tomorrow or whenever we leave.\n  Yesterday the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, Senator Carper, and I, thought we cleared all holds \non the Taxpayers Right-To-Know Act. I wish to give a little history \nabout that because for 2 years the House and Senate, in conjunction \nwith the committees, have been working on this bill. The history goes \nback to a bill that was passed with President Obama, myself, Senator \nMcCain, and Senator Carper, and it was the Federal Financial \nTransparency and Accountability Act, usaspending.gov. It was the first \nstart towards transparency in terms of how and where we spend our \nmoney.\n  Quite frankly, as we got that bill through Congress, with we heard \nthe same thing from OMB that Senator Reid is representing today. \nPresident Bush and his OMB Director didn't want that bill. They didn't \nthink the American people ought to know where their spending was going. \nThey didn't think the American taxpayer ought to have the right to hold \nus accountable to know where we spent the money, on which programs, and \nhow.\n  Interestingly, under Republican leadership, we passed that bill \nagainst the wishes of the OMB Director of the Bush administration, and \nthat bill became law. The President has touted that bill as the first \nin a long line of transparency which his administration has embraced--\nthe idea that the American people ought to know where their money is \nbeing spent.\n  Since that time, we passed the DATA Act, which will move us towards \nbetter quality in terms of usaspending.gov, and then we have the \nTaxpayers Right-To-Know Act, which the majority leader objected to \nyesterday.\n  Here is what the Taxpayers-Right-To-Know Act says. It says the \ntaxpayer has the right to know how many programs we have in each \ndepartment, how much spending is going on in each program, and where \nthe money is being spent. It is pretty simple, straightforward stuff \nthat we ought to know about our government.\n  The question that I am asking is, Why would anybody in this body \nobject to us knowing where our money is being spent? Why would anybody \nin this body object to knowing how many programs each agency has? Why \nwould anybody in this body object to coordinating with all the \ntransparency things that we have done thus far and make it so that 2 \nyears from now the American people can actually see where their money \nis being spent, how much is being spent on each program in each State \nand at what location.\n  If somebody can give me an honest explanation and a logical reason \nfor why we wouldn't want to do that, I will take that, and I will not \noffer another unanimous consent request. But the answer from OMB is \nthat it is too hard to work. It is not too hard to work. That is \nexactly what the Bush administration said when we said we are going to \nhave the transparency act and usaspending.gov. They said it was too \nhard, and we can't do it. We can do it.\n  The American people are owed that explanation, they are owed that \ntransparency, and this administration, through its claims of being the \nmost transparent administration should step forward and release this \nhold.\n  So before we leave here, I will offer the unanimous consent request \nagain. If it is objected to, we will know that it has nothing to do \nwith reality. It has nothing to do with honesty, it has nothing to do \nwith integrity, it has nothing to do with truth, it has nothing to do \nwith being transparent with the American people, and it has everything \nto do with the Federal Government saying that it is just too hard to be \nhonest with the American people to allow them to see where we are \nspending the money.\n  I find that is really unacceptable for us, as Members of the Senate. \nFor a Member of the Senate to stand up and say, I object to doing that, \ntells us that we have a long way to go on much, much bigger problems if \nwe are going to play the game just because something is a little bit \ntough to do, and we are going to fall for complaining that we just \ncan't get it done.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n      SSCI Study of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I wish to salute my friend and \ncolleague from Oklahoma. I don't agree with probably 80 to 90 percent \nof what he says, but I really respect him. He is a person of integrity \nwho really cares. When you shake his hand and make a deal, a deal is \ndone, which is a rarity around here, and we wish him the best.\n  Today I rise to discuss the recently released report by the Senate \nIntelligence Committee. As a representative of one of the most targeted \ncities in the world, I feel compelled to speak about this report. I \nwant to say clearly that I am troubled by many of its findings.\n  First, the many members of the CIA and the intelligence community \nselflessly serve this Nation and put their lives on the line. They are \npatriots who are committed to protecting and serving America, keeping \nher safe from those very real enemies who are actively seeking to do \nthe unspeakable in terms of harm. We owe the members of the CIA and the \nIntelligence Committee their due recognition and gratitude. We salute \nthem for protecting us. In many cases, they risk their lives to protect \nus and our freedom.\n  But as with many institutions in our society, be it part of the \ngovernment or part of the private sector, transparency and \naccountability for mistakes are an essential part of the process that \npreserves the balance in our democracy. The fact of the matter is this \nreport lays bare some very troubling activities on the part of the CIA. \nIt warrants a close examination. When we find the conduct of the CIA to \nbe grossly counter to the Nation's ideals, we must reckon with that and \nmake sure we never go back to the days when our government sanctioned \ntorture.\n  Here, I agree with my colleague and friend from across the aisle, \nSenator McCain. He has been an unimpeachable voice on this topic, and \nhas said time and again that these actions were torture, and that \ntorture besmirches the honor of this great Nation.\n  I also agree with the remarks made by Vice President Joe Biden, that \nonly a great Nation and only an open and free society can forthrightly \ntake ownership of their mistakes, find ways to change those policies, \nand move positively forward on both the domestic and international \nlevels.\n  It is doubtless this report contains lessons that our intelligence \ncommunity must take to heart--for their goal must be to protect our \nNation without sacrificing what it stands for.\n  Before I go any further, I wish to recognize the many years of hard \nwork, diligence, and courage--yes, courage--on the part of my \ncolleagues on the Intelligence Committee and their staffs for putting \nthis report together.\n  I particularly wish to recognize my dear friend and colleague, the \nchair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Dianne Feinstein, for her \nwork with\n\n[[Page S6519]]\n\nthis report. She has been a fearless, yet level-headed chair of the \ncommittee for many years now. She is just what you would envision as an \nideal chair.\n  I thank her for her excellent report, where once again, she has been \nboth fearless and level-headed.\n  An extensive report like this one deserves careful review, but at \nfirst reading, two things have been made very clear. First, the CIA \nundoubtedly went too far in its pursuit of intelligence from captured \nsources abroad.\n  As I have said in formal proceedings in this legislature before, I am \nabsolutely opposed to waterboarding and deplore some of the tactics \ndepicted in this report.\n  I believe our intelligence community can obtain information using \nmethods that are not anathema to our Nation's values.\n  Second, the report makes it clear that there was a breakdown of \ncommunication between the CIA and the administration at the time of \nthese events.\n  There is no doubt we live in a dangerous world. There are threats \nabroad and threats here in the homeland. We cannot expect to counteract \nthese threats and protect our people and to do so in a responsible way \nif the CIA and the executive branch are not effectively communicating \nwith one another.\n  I was astounded to learn that the report asserts that over 4 years \nwent by without the President having full knowledge of some of the \nCIA's actions detailed in this report. That simply cannot be the modus \noperandi for the CIA. They are accountable to the government and to the \npeople and cannot behave without proper oversight. There is so much to \nunpack in this report. I urge my colleagues patience and a careful \nexamination of the work produced by my colleagues on the Intelligence \nCommittee. It should be out in front of the American people, and now it \nis. We must take a very, very close look at it.\n\n  The United States, its government, and its people must take stock of \nthis account and reckon with the conclusions of the study. We have \nhundreds of thousands of brave men and women posted around the world, \ntasked with the difficult job of keeping us safe. We should always be \nmindful of their dedication and thankful for their sacrifice. Their \nmission is demanding. It is never-ending and nearly all of them perform \nwith a level of professionalism beyond reproach.\n  However, from time to time, it is important for us to review those \nactions to make sure they meet the hard scrutiny of our Nation's ideals \nwhile still protecting its people.\n  In that light the Senate Intelligence Committee report is an \nextremely important document for us all to examine.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues, especially my friend Senator Feinstein, \nfor their exhaustive and exemplary work on this report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            ISIS And Authorization For Use Of Military Force\n\n  Mr. CASEY. I rise today to discuss the fight against ISIS and the \ndebate we are having here in the Senate and across the country about \nthe authorization for use of military force, known by the acronym AUMF.\n  The debate about the appropriate use of force is, I believe, healthy \nfor our country. The American people deserve to know when and how our \nservicemembers are going to be deployed to protect our national \nsecurity interests. All Senators in this body have an abiding \nobligation to take the time to learn about this issue and to ask \nquestions about our strategy, to thoroughly debate the strategy and the \nissues that relate to the authorization for use of force, and then we \nhave an obligation to vote on the grave question of the use of military \nforce.\n  It has been 6 months since ISIS began its major offensive in Iraq, \ntaking control of key boarder crossings and the city of Mosul. The \nPresident has laid out since that time a strategy for combating ISIS \nthrough all available means--military action, diplomatic coalition \nbuilding, coordinating efforts to cut off financing and recruitment, \nand providing humanitarian assistance.\n  The Administration has taken these actions under previous \nauthorizations. In these weeks and months I have consulted with \nAdministration officials, both military and civilian, outside experts \nand former diplomats, as I know many of our colleagues have. I also \nhave listened to my constituents in Pennsylvania. We owe it to the \nAmerican people to have a debate and a vote on a new authorization for \nuse of military force that clarifies, and if necessary, places \nlimitations on the President's authority in this fight against ISIS.\n  We know that 1,830 servicemembers, 91 of whom were from Pennsylvania, \nhave been killed in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and \n3,482 servicemembers, of which 197 were from Pennsylvania, have been \nkilled in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Those are two conflicts, and in \nPennsylvania alone the killed-in-action number was 91 in Afghanistan \nand 197 in Iraq.\n  Thousands more have been wounded in action from Pennsylvania and from \nacross the country--some of them grievously, permanently injured \nbecause of their service. I am mindful, as I know many are here, that \nwith both the 2001 and 2002 authorizations for use of force, Congress \nmoved very quickly to take that action. I understand that. We know in \nhindsight that in the case of Iraq, at least, mistakes were made \nbecause leaders did not take the time to debate and ask tough questions \nand demand answers to those tough questions. I believe it is \nappropriate for us to do the following: thoroughly debate this AUMF, as \nwe should every time we consider sending U.S. servicemembers into \nharm's way; second, to be prepared to continually reassess and debate \nour strategy against ISIS to ensure it is achieving our national \nsecurity goals.\n  We all hope to develop an AUMF that has broad bipartisan support. \nHowever, our priority must be to give the President clear and specific \nauthority to continue the fight against ISIS.\n  The Administration should have come forward with a recommendation \nearly in the process for what they would like to see in an \nauthorization for use of military force. I welcomed Secretary Kerry's \ntestimony before the Foreign Relations Committee yesterday. That \nhearing was an important step in the right direction.\n  It is appropriate for the Congress to not only conduct rigorous \noversight of the executive branch's decisions about military force but \nalso, from time to time, to take steps to shape or place boundaries \naround the Administration's strategy. I appreciate Chairman Menendez's \nefforts to craft an AUMF proposal that satisfies the needs of the \nAdministration and the concerns from both sides of the aisle and across \nour country.\n  The Congress should move forward with an authorization for use of \nmilitary force which addresses the following:\n  First, this AUMF should not allow for any significant deployment of \nU.S. troops in traditional ground combat roles. This is consistent with \nwhat the President has determined is necessary at this time. We also \nneed to see nations in the region step up to do the fighting. We can't \njust have--to use an old expression from Pennsylvania--coat holders. \nThat is someone that says you go do the fighting and I will hold your \ncoat while you fight.\n  We need a real coalition which we have in place now but it has to be \nbuilt and strengthened and fortified and sustained. That coalition, \nespecially in the case of members of the coalition from the region, \nwill contribute fighters to the battlefield because it is their region. \nIt is their conflict as much as it is for other nations in the \ncoalition.\n\n  When I say we cannot have a coalition of coat holders, I am serious \nabout that. We need a coalition that will help us. We have already done \na lot, and our people have, our taxpayers have, and our soldiers have. \nWe need a real coalition that will do the fighting.\n  We also know that ISIS has taken American hostages before and will \ntry to do so again. If, for example, the Administration has a chance to \nbring one of these Americans home, I want them--the Administration--to \ntake action expeditiously and with clear authority. If the \nAdministration disagrees with the current proposal for\n\n[[Page S6520]]\n\nauthorization for exceptional circumstances or operations--for example, \na search and rescue operation inside Syria or the recovery of an \nAmerican hostage--the Administration should propose to us language they \nfind acceptable to use in those difficult situations.\n  Second, this authorization for force should not be geographically \nlimited. ISIS and its associated forces do not and will not respect \nsovereign borders. However, I would like to see language that requires \nthe Administration consult closely with Congress if they want to \nconsider U.S. military operation against ISIS in countries beyond Iraq \nand Syria. Expanding this fight geographically could have the \nunintended effect of prompting unrest in other countries or pushing \nrecruits into the arms of ISIS.\n  Third, this authorization for use of force should have a reasonable \ntimeline--something along the order of 3 years--with the explicit \noption for the administration to extend it a bit longer if needed. We \ncannot know exactly how long it will take us and our coalition partners \nto degrade and defeat this terrorist organization. However, the AUMF \nshould not be open-ended in the way that the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs were. \nWe have seen how difficult it is to shift gears or even to repeal an \nexisting authorization for use of military force.\n  Fourth, and finally, this authorization must also address the \nnonmilitary components of the administrations's strategy. I was one of \nthe first Members to call for greater support for the moderate well-\nvetted Syrian opposition. We know that opposition, especially in the \nnorth, is fractured and suffering, especially under the continual \nonslaught from Mr. Assad's barrel bombs--not to mention other actions \nhe has taken against the opposition.\n  Although efforts to support them are ramping up, the brutal Assad \nregime has done significant damage. That is an understatement. Further, \nthe Assad regime continues to commit unspeakable atrocities against \nSyrian civilians, starving, torturing, or indiscriminately murdering \nthem in violation of international law and U.N. Security Council \nresolutions--that is plural.\n  I have also emphasized on a bipartisan basis with Senator Rubio \nseveral years ago the importance of cutting off ISIS's finances. This \ncould include airstrikes against known oil-smuggling pipelines or \nadditional sanctions against facilitators. I should say with Senator \nRubio that the financing efforts or the cutting off of the financing \nwas this year. I have worked with him in other years on other parts of \nSyrian policy.\n  As we have heard multiple administration leaders today say, there is \nno purely military solution to this conflict with ISIS. I would also \nsay that if we have an authorization for force, this bill should \ninclude strict reporting requirements that press the administration to \nanswer a series of questions:\n  First, what are you going to do to support the moderate opposition in \nSyria? I have raised this over and over again with the administration \nand still do not have satisfactory answers.\n  Second, what steps are you taking to address the Assad regime's \nbrutal barrel bomb campaign, and what are you doing to bring about a \npolitical settlement to the conflict in Syria?\n  Third, how is the military campaign helping to cut off the financial \nsupport that ISIS is receiving, as I mentioned before?\n  There is strong bipartisan agreement that ISIS proposes a clear and \nproximate if not immediate threat to our national security interests \nand those of our partners. I believe we can reach the same level of \nbipartisan agreement on an authorization for the use of military force.\n  We have no greater or more sacred responsibility than to carefully \nand thoroughly consider when and how we send American men and women in \nuniform into harm's way. I urge my colleagues in both parties to engage \nin this debate and to work expeditiously to pass an authorization for \nthe use of military force. I would have preferred and I know many would \nhave preferred that we would have passed a bill before we adjourn this \nyear, knowing that in this holiday season there are servicemembers \nalready deployed away from home, from their families, to support this \noperation, Operation Inherent Resolve.\n  If we cannot get that done by the end of this year, where the debate \nwould not be fully developed enough to pass an authorization, we must \nget it done early in 2015. It must be among our first orders of \nbusiness in the new year, in the new Congress when we come back in \nearly January. This is a very grave matter. It is among the highest and \nmost difficult responsibilities Congress has. I believe we will \ndischarge that obligation with a full debate, with a debate that is \nwell-informed and a debate that every Member participates in before we \nmake a decision about the authorization for the use of force.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss title 30 of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, the title of which has \nbecome referred to as the lands package. As with most of the items \nCongress considers, this provision has generated some controversy. For \nmy part, however, it appears that many of the concerns here are \noutpaced by the substance of good public lands policy being advanced \nhere and the economic development opportunities it will generate.\n  The bill the committees of jurisdiction included in the package all \nhave some form of committee procedure in either the House or the \nSenate. Thirty-four of the measures have passed the House on \nsuspension. Another nine have passed the Senate by unanimous consent.\n  It is also worth noting that because the Federal Government owns so \nmuch land, particularly in the Western United States, Congress has to \napprove all sorts of transactions involving these public lands no \nmatter how small the tracts might be.\n  On the substance, I believe the bipartisan group who assembled this \npackage of bills struck a pretty good balance, deferring to intrastate \npriorities that will promote responsible economic growth. In Arizona, \nfor example, I was pleased to see the inclusion of the Southeast \nArizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act. This is a bill sponsored by \nmy colleague John McCain. I was happy to join him to advance the \nmeasure. It also shares bipartisan support in the House among Members \nof Arizona's House delegation: Representatives Gosar, Kirkpatrick, \nFranks, Salmon, and Schweikert.\n  At its core, this bill will facilitate access to the largest copper \nore deposit in North America. By some estimates the economic impact of \nthe mine could exceed $60 billion over the course of the \nmine operations. It will support approximately 3,700 direct and \nindirect jobs annually.\n\n  It is also worth noting that copper is a critical component in most \ntechnologies, from weapon systems, to computers, to automobiles, to \nturbines that generate electricity, to name a few.\n  This mine would supply an amount of copper roughly equivalent to 25 \npercent of the U.S. demand.\n  Also notable is what this bill does in terms of conservation. It \nwould preserve more than 5,300 acres of conservation land in Arizona.\n  Despite the broad benefits for economic development and conservation \nas well as the bill's bipartisan support, there has been some \nopposition. We have done our best to include some provisions that \naddress those concerns. For instance, the land exchange would not occur \nuntil after the completion of a NEPA environmental impact statement. It \nwill also generate a special management area around the large \nescarpment known as Apache Leap. Likewise, it will provide protections \nfor Native Americans to continue traditional gathering and ceremonies \nafter the land exchange has been completed so long as it remains safe \nto do so.\n  I would also note that Resolution Copper has proactively sought ways \nto address its anticipated water needs. To that end, I was encouraged \nto learn that the company has entered into a contract with the Gila \nRiver Indian Community to use a portion of the tribe's water supplies \nto meet the long-term needs of the mine. This is further evidence of \nhow the measure, even before it is passed, can help foster economic \nopportunities for Indian and non-Indian communities around the State.\n\n[[Page S6521]]\n\n  I would also like to take a moment to talk about a couple of the \nother positive provisions in the lands package. From a resource \nmanagement perspective, it would support further economic activity on \nFederal lands by conveying approximately 110,000 acres of land out of \nthe Federal estate. This includes not only the aforementioned \nResolution Copper project but also a Copper mine in Nevada, timber \nharvests in Alaska, and coal production in Montana.\n  The lands package also includes a provision that would streamline the \npermitting process for oil and gas leases. This is critical. We have \nseen the pace of oil and gas production on Federal lands decline in \nrecent years while development on private lands has increased \nsignificantly. This measure also improves the permitting process for \ngrazing and makes a downpayment on so-called payment in lieu of taxes, \nor PILT. This is critical in helping communities that are burdened with \ntracts of Federal land to meet the obligations of providing services \nrelated to those lands without a corresponding tax base. This applies \nto a lot of the land in rural Arizona.\n  Although reasonable people can disagree, I believe this is a good \nmeasure for the State of Arizona and the United States as a whole. I am \npleased to see that it will advance as part of this package. I know the \nlands package was difficult to negotiate. They always are. It has \nachieved strong bipartisan support. I think it does strike the right \nbalance between deference to intrastate concerns and Federal lands \ndecisions. I urge support of the legislation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am on the floor this evening for \n``Time to Wake Up'' speech No. 82.\n  Scientists tell us that the evidence for climate change is now \n``unequivocal''--not a word often used in scientific writing. The \nAmerican people know that climate change is real.\n  In a new poll released by the insurance firm Munich Re, 8 out of 10 \nAmericans believe the climate is changing. They see it happening around \nthem. The American people also know we need to cut our carbon pollution \nif we are to avoid the worst effects of climate change. We can't keep \nburning carbon-polluting fossil fuels indiscriminately. Seven out of 10 \nAmericans put using more carbon-free energy, such as solar and wind, \namong the best ways to battle climate change.\n  Changing the way we generate power will help cut emissions from the \nlargest sources of carbon pollution in the country, our coal-fired \npowerplants. The Energy Information Administration notes that coal \ngenerates less than 40 percent of our country's electricity while it \ngenerates 75 percent of the carbon pollution from the power sector.\n  The 50 dirtiest coal plants in America emit more carbon pollution \nthan all of South Korea or all of Canada, which brings us to the war on \ncoal.\n  Every effort to protect the American people from coal pollution has \nbeen denounced by the fossil fuel industry and its various mouthpieces \nas a ``war on coal.'' When EPA proposed limits on emission from new \npowerplants, we heard ``war on coal.'' When EPA promoted limits on \nexisting powerplants, ``war on coal.'' For mercury limits, ozone \nlimits, particulate limits, always ``war on coal.''\n  The war on coal is a fabrication. The denial machine, funded by \nfossil fuel money, literally owns the war on coal. The Web site \nwaroncoal.com is owned by American Commitment, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit \nthat has been funded by the Koch brothers-backed group Freedom \nPartners. War-on-coal is a public relations strategy, a catchphrase, a \ngimmick that serves to distract people from the harm coal wreaks on us.\n  Dr. Drew Shindell is a professor at Duke University. He worked at \nNASA for two decades. Last week in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee he said:\n\n       We hear a lot up here on Capitol Hill about the war on \n     coal; what we forget about is coal's war on us.\n\n  So let's talk about the so-called war on coal versus coal's war on \nus. When Republicans talk about President Obama's war on coal, they \nleave a lot out. They leave out that coal companies have shifted to big \nopen-topped mines--what is called mountaintop removal--so they can lay \noff miners and still produce the same amount of coal. They leave out \nthat coal simply can't compete with today's cheaper, cleaner burning \nnatural gas.\n  In 2012 Duke Energy's own CEO acknowledged that EPA's proposed \nclimate rule for new powerplants was not to blame. This is what he \nsaid:\n\n       The new climate rule is in line with market forces anyway. \n     We're not going to build any coal plants in any event.\n\n  ``We're not going to build any coal plants in any event,'' he said.\n  He continued:\n\n       You're going to choose to build gas plants every time, \n     regardless of what the rule is.\n\n  That is not a regulatory war on coal; that is the free market \noperating.\n  EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan for existing powerplants is the \nnewest PR front in the imaginary war on coal. EPA projects that the \nClean Power Plan will yield between $55 billion and $93 billion in \nbenefits per year by 2030, compared to $7 billion to $9 billion to \ncomply with the rule. That math makes it a winner for the American \npeople. Some war on coal. What would they expect us to do--give up $90 \nbillion at the high end in benefits for the American people in order to \navoid a $9 billion compliance cost, again at the high end? Again, $90 \nbillion for the American people versus $9 billion in compliance--who \nwouldn't take that deal?\n  If the Obama administration is waging a war on coal, it has a funny \nway of going about it. Coal exports grew by 44 percent from 2008 to \n2012. The Obama administration keeps opening up Federal lands to coal \nextraction, awarding many leases at below-market rates. It actually \ntook a Federal judge in Colorado to tell the Obama Bureau of Land \nManagement and Forest Service to factor the cost of climate change into \ntheir cost-benefit analysis of coal mining leases. The Federal agencies \nhad looked at only one side of the ledger. They counted the economic \nbenefits of mining coal but not the costs. Some war on coal. Two years \nago the Obama Army Corps of Engineers fast-tracked environmental review \nof a proposed coal export terminal on the Columbia River in Oregon. \nLocal communities and tribes objected, and the State of Oregon denied \nthe permit for the project. If that is what a Federal war on coal looks \nlike, somebody didn't get the memo.\n  On the other side, let's look at what coal's war on us looks like. \nEvidence that mining and burning coal harms our health and our \nenvironment and our oceans is undeniable. It is this other side of the \ncoal ledger which hits home in Rhode Island and Connecticut and many \nother States, and it is that side which the polluters want to ignore \nand obscure with ``war on coal'' rhetoric.\n  Burning coal releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. That \nwarms our atmosphere, bringing changes we are already seeing in \nseasons, weather, and storms. There is a strong association between \nglobal warming and the kinds of rain bursts that flooded homes and \nbusinesses in Rhode Island in 2010, for instance.\n  Coal burning contributes to the formation of toxic ground-level \nozone, which is a cause of the bad air days in my home State of Rhode \nIsland. Kids with asthma in the emergency room in Rhode Island are \nconnected with midwestern powerplants that burn coal and pump often \nunscrubbed emissions up smokestacks designed to move the problem \ndownwind--out of State, out of mind.\n  Don't overlook our oceans, which absorb about one-third of the carbon \npollution being emitted and most of the excess heat. As a result, \noceans are becoming more acidic, water temperatures are rising, and sea \nlevels are rising across the globe. In Rhode Island the sea is up \nnearly 10 inches at the tide gauge at Naval Station Newport since the \n1930s, when we had our great hurricane of 1938.\n\n  So whether you have a flooded home or are a mom with a child with \nasthma in the emergency room or somebody\n\n[[Page S6522]]\n\nwith coastal property facing 10-inch higher seas, there are costs to \ncoal. This is all virtually indisputable, and it follows immutable laws \nof nature. Damage to coastal homes and infrastructure from rising seas \nand erosion, asthma attacks in children triggered by smog, forests \ndying from beetle infestations and unprecedented wildfire seasons, \nfarms ravaged by worsened drought and flooding--these are all real \ncosts to Americans. This other side of the coal ledger counts too.\n  It even hits home in coal country, where blowing up mountaintops \npollutes streams and harms folks around the mining operations. West \nVirginia University has linked the dust thrown up by these mountaintop \nmines to lung cancer among nearby residents.\n  Coal-fired powerplants are the biggest sources of mercury pollution \nin the United States, and they also emit arsenic, acid gases, and other \ntoxins.\n  Dr. Shindell, whom I mentioned earlier, is an expert in atmospheric \nchemistry and health. Here is what he told the EPW Committee last week:\n\n       Of all of the sources of the emissions that lead to poor \n     air quality in the United States, coal burning is the single \n     largest, causing by my calculations about 47,000 premature \n     deaths per year. That happens to be larger than the total \n     number of Americans killed in all of the years of the Vietnam \n     War by hostile fire.\n\n  If you look at the casualties, the Federal Government isn't waging a \nwar on coal. If there is any war, coal is waging a war on us.\n  This is business as usual for the polluter industry and its \npropaganda apparatus. Coal companies have long fought public health \nstandards, mine worker protections, and compensation for ailments such \nas black lung disease, as well as efforts to address acid rain or \nreduce toxic pollutants, such as mercury, that cause brain damage in \nkids.\n  In 1989 Southern Company's CEO Edward Addison testified that acid-\nrain controls would increase electricity rates in States with the most \ncoal power by 10 to 20 percent by 2009. Well, we couldn't evaluate that \nprediction then, but now we can. This is a fact: In the 10 States with \nthe most coal, rates actually fell. Big Coal's war on the truth has a \nlong history.\n  I recently had the opportunity to visit West Virginia with Senator \nManchin to learn about what coal means to the Mountain State economy. I \nget it. We need to care about the miners, the truckers, the powerplant \noperators, the engineers, and others who make their living in this \nindustry. It would be wrong to ignore their plight, just as it is wrong \nwhen the coal industry tries to ignore the effects of its carbon \npollution.\n  I think we need a carbon fee to correct the market and to slow \nclimate change. I am sure I will hear that is a war on coal. It is not. \nIt is simple fairness. It is simply paying for the mess you cause. That \nis not war. It is not even punishment. It is just fair accounting, \ntaking both sides of the ledger into account.\n  When people do that--economists and scientists--they calculate the \ncost of carbon pollution as what they call the social cost of carbon. \nThe administration estimates the social cost of carbon at around $40 \nper ton of carbon pollution--$40 per ton. The effective cost to \npolluters for causing that mess is zero.\n\n  My carbon fee bill would correct that. It would correct what even \neconomists and groups as conservative as the American Enterprise \nInstitute agree is a market failure, and then return every dollar of \nthe fee to the American people. That could include transition \nassistance for coal workers--and assistance for communities far from \ncoal mines, like in Rhode Island, facing these costs of climate change. \nIt is also becoming increasingly clear that a revenue-neutral carbon \nfee will spur innovation, create jobs, and boost the economy \nnationwide.\n  So it is time to end the polluters' holiday from responsibility. It \nis time to see through their fanciful war on coal, and protect those \nfacing the effects of coal's war on us and coal's war on the truth. It \nis time to seize the economic benefit of a clean energy economy. It is \ntime to wake up.\n  I yield the floor to my friend, the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. I \nam so happy to follow him on the floor today and to see him again. We \nhave worked together on so many important issues. It is wonderful to \nsee the Presiding Officer to be back on the floor.\n  I come today for a very special reason. I am so proud to present to \nthe Senate a package of lands bills that have been included in the \nDefense Authorization Act.\n  What is significant about this particular package is it is quite \nlarge, and it is the first package in almost 6 years and almost three \nCongresses, which is quite an accomplishment for our committee.\n  I am so proud of the staff of our committee, Energy and Natural \nResources. I made this a priority when I took over as Chair 9 months \nago. It was a long shot to see if we could put any package at all \ntogether that had eluded us for several Congresses, but I worked very \nclosely with my counterpart, Congressman Hastings, in the House. We met \non several occasions with our top staff and committed to do all we \ncould to see what was possible.\n  One of the important principles that made this grand compromise \npossible--and there are Republican bills and Democratic bills; it is \nvery well balanced as between the parties, but also geographically in \nprojects and expansions of parks, creation of new parks, and land \ntransfers. The principle that we followed is it is revenue neutral. \nSome of these bills raise money, some of these bills spend money, but \nthe lands package is revenue neutral. I think the taxpayer is going to \nget some extraordinary value in the package being presented today.\n  In addition, one of the principles I pushed very strongly is to make \nsure that this package included opportunities for the development of \nour natural resources. We are very proud of our wilderness areas. We \nare very proud of our parks. We are very proud of our areas that are \noff limits to economic development. But there are parts of the Federal \nlandscape of public lands that should be developed--whether it is \nforests, or oil and gas, or hard-rock mining, for the benefit of the \ntaxpayer and for our overall economy. That was a very important \nprinciple for me and of course for Congressman Hastings.\n  We also wanted to make sure that we expanded our national park \nsystem. Again, this has been a 6-year hiatus, almost three Congresses. \nWe have not been able to make any progress on adding to the beautiful \nheritage areas and special national park system that America is known \nfor and helped to pilot for the world. Next year will be the 100th \nanniversary of the founding of the National Park Service, and we are \nexcited about the additional eight new national parks that will be \ncreated by this lands package, and it expands the boundaries of six \nexisting national parks.\n  One of the expansions I want to note particularly is in Texas, in San \nAntonio. It expands the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park. \nThe reason I am excited about this is because the San Antonio missions \nare next on the list in the United States sites to be designated as \nworld heritage sites. I had a great opportunity to help our only site \nin Louisiana, Poverty Point, achieve that designation just a few months \nago. What an extraordinary action it was to be there when we cut the \nribbon on a site that is going to continue to be excavated that we \nbelieve is over 3,500 years old, with a very sophisticated Native \nAmerican settlement on these beautiful raised mounds in one of the \nhighest points in the Louisiana-Mississippi delta area. I was excited \nto see that San Antonio missions will be next. This puts these sites on \nthe same level as the Grand Canyon and other really extraordinary \ninternational places of cultural significance. So that is one example.\n\n  In the new national parks, it has only taken us 200-something-plus \nyears, with Senator Carper and Senator Coons, to get a national park in \nDelaware. They were the only State without a national park. Although \nthey are small in size, they are very important as they are the first \nState in the Union. So as it would be appropriate, the name of their \npark is the First State National Park. So now every State in the United \nStates has at least one national park. Of course, some States have many \nmore. Our commitment is to continue this great heritage for our Nation \nfor generations to come.\n\n[[Page S6523]]\n\n  This package represents a major milestone in our work to reach a \nconsensus across party lines. We will clear much of the backlog of the \npublic lands bill that has built up in the Senate, last passed in the \nomnibus package 5 years ago. It is worth noting the Congressional \nBudget Office has again scored this as revenue neutral.\n  Let me speak for a minute about a few Louisiana priorities. Although \nmost of these bills do not have anything to do with Louisiana--we did \nnot have any major expansion efforts of any of our parks to present--I \ndid wish to discuss two meaningful impact on the economy of my State.\n  The first provision will ensure the economic vitality and viability \nof the Toledo Bend hydroelectric project located on the beautiful \nSabine River on the Louisiana-Texas border. Toledo Bend provides power \nto thousands of Louisiana homes and serves as an economic engine for \nour western border with Texas.\n  The project was first licensed in 1963. Russell Long and our \ncongressional delegation were very instrumental in getting this dam for \nhydropower established in our State. Although we are known for oil and \ngas, we do have some hydropower in our State. It was relicensed in \nAugust--I am proud of, with my support and leadership--for an \nadditional 50 years, which is a terrific certification on the part of \nthe Federal Government that this project is fulfilling its original \ngoals and objectives. Not only is it generating power, it is providing \nan extraordinary recreational opportunity.\n  This project includes a dam which impounds a 185,000-acre reservoir, \nthe largest manmade body of water in the South, and a powerhouse \ncapable of generating 81 megawatts of electricity. The project is \noperated primarily for water supply purposes, secondarily for \nhydropower, and thirdly for recreation. But it has become an extremely \npopular recreational site both on the Texas side and on the Louisiana \nside. It is an interesting project, because we have joint jurisdiction. \nThe Texas Commission runs its side, the Louisiana Commission runs our \nside, and it occupies about 3,800 acres of Federal land in a narrow 3-\nfoot strip along the shore of the reservoir where it borders the Sabine \nNational Forest and Indian mounds.\n  Under current law, just because of that 3-foot strip, the forest, \nland, and other Federal agencies were claiming jurisdiction just \nbecause of this very narrow edge around the Toledo Bend. So we \neliminated their jurisdiction. It gave the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission the basis to impose annual charges. We didn't think that \nwould be fair, so we carved out a much-needed exemption that would \nprohibit undue regulation, and allow the local governmental structures \nand appropriate Federal agencies to determine the best use of this \nland. Local zoning ordinances will apply, local rules about what areas \ncan be developed privately and publicly. There is plenty of public \naccess to this reservoir. We hope, and I anticipate, that it will be \nanother momentum builder for the economic development in this region.\n\n  Significantly for me--I have worked on it for many years, because I \nhave been aware of this since I was a legislator years ago and the real \nneed to develop this as a really first-class destination for resorts, \nhotels, marinas--not only for the people who live and have property \nthere, but for visitors who may come from all over the region.\n  In addition, Fort Polk is situated only about 40 miles away. So it is \nwithin driving distance for soldiers and their families for recreation. \nIt is really quite beautiful. It is isolated. We don't have quite \nenough highway infrastructure I think for us to develop it in a way \nthat we really should, but that will come with time. But this was a \nvery important step to get the 50-year certification to move forward. \nAnd now our local communities--the parishes of Sabine, DeSoto, and \nVernon--can lean forward and dream and plan for how this area can be \ndeveloped.\n  The second Louisiana-related provision authorizes the National Park \nService to study areas along the Lower Mississippi River in Plaquemines \nParish for the potential addition to the national park system. It is \njust a study, but this Lower Mississippi area is of course rich in \ncultural history. It was first traveled by Spanish explorers in the \n1500s and later, in 1699, became the site of the first fortification on \nthe Lower Mississippi River known as Fort Mississippi.\n  The area to be studied includes several other historic \nfortifications, including Fort St. Philip, which played a key role \nduring the Battle of New Orleans and was the final major battle of the \nWar of 1812. While Andrew Jackson's forces were successful on land, it \nwas William Overton's 10-day defense of the back door to New Orleans \nthat helped seal the American victory.\n  Fort Philip, and its companion fort located across the river, Fort \nJackson, also played a pivotal role during the siege of New Orleans \nduring the Civil War. These two forts, with their withering crossfire, \nheld the Union Navy at bay for 12 days. And the history goes on and on.\n  These special places are tangible links to the dramatic stories of \nour Nation's history and deserve to be studied for inclusion in our \nnational park system.\n  Let me underscore again how important I think is the principle of \ndeveloping our public resources in the right ways--preserving what we \ncan, conserving what we must, but developing what we can for the \nbenefit of the taxpayer. That is one of the underlying principles of \nthis grand compromise. I recognize that to break the logjam, \nparticularly with the House of Representatives, we needed to find a way \nto address both the development of natural resources and conservation \nand preservation, as well as the expansion of our public lands and \npublic parks. This package reflects that balance. Let me mention a \ncouple of the economic development provisions.\n  We will convey 70,000 acres in the Tongass National Forest to \nSealaska, an Alaska Native corporation, to complete its land settlement \nunder the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. This legislation has \nbeen a longstanding priority for Senator Begich and Senator Murkowski. \nI thank them both for their extraordinary leadership in working on this \nland transfer.\n\n  This bill has been considered in the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee for years, and the final language was carefully negotiated \nwith the Department of Agriculture. So I thank the Department for \nhelping us work out this extraordinary land transfer.\n  Another provision which was included at the request of Senator McCain \nand Senator Flake and which has been worked on by the Arizona \ndelegation is a land exchange in Arizona between the Forest Service and \nthe Resolution Copper company to allow development of a major copper \nmine. My friend Trent Franks has been a leader in this area as well in \nthe House and in his legislative district, and I have had good \nconversations with him. This may be the deepest copper mine in the \nUnited States of America. It is going to be one of the richest in the \nworld.\n  There was some original language in this legislation that was perhaps \nnot as responsible as it should have been--or as sensitive maybe is a \nbetter word--to some of the needs or requests of some of the nearby \ntribes. We tried to address some of their concerns in the final \nlanguage. We haven't, of course, settled all complaints, but we have \nsettled as many as we can.\n  This is an extraordinarily valuable asset for the people of the \nUnited States, and the people of the United States own this land and \nright now own the potential copper that would come out of this mine. I \nmost certainly, through my staff, have insisted and negotiated that the \ntaxpayers get a fair exchange, that they are not underpaid in any way \nin this transfer and this development. I am very hopeful that the \nForest Service, which will continue under the authorization in this \nbill to negotiate, will make sure the taxpayers of the United States \nare paid fairly for the exchange of this very valuable property, which \nwill create many jobs in Arizona and which will create opportunities \nfor economic development in our whole country and around the world, as \ncopper is a very valuable substance. One of my overriding conditions \nfor approval was to make sure the taxpayers get a full benefit.\n  While the Sealaska and Resolution Copper provisions have drawn most \nof the attention in this bill, in total the\n\n[[Page S6524]]\n\npackage includes many other prominent Federal land conveyances, all \nwhich will allow for community services such as cemeteries and schools, \nprovide land for development by local communities, allow for outdoor \nrecreational opportunities, and increase management efficiencies for \nboth public and adjacent private land.\n  The package also wonderfully includes almost 250,000 acres of new \nwilderness designations, including in Washington State. I thank Senator \nCantwell and Senator Murray for their advocacy for their State and for \nour Nation. Senator Tester has been a strong proponent for the State of \nMontana, Senator Reid in the State of Nevada, and in the State of \nColorado, Senator Bennet and Senator Mark Udall, and, of course, in New \nMexico we have had some expansion of wilderness areas. Each of these \nbills was the product of years of discussion among stakeholders and \neach State's congressional delegation.\n  In addition to wilderness designations, the package will protect the \nwatershed of over 360,000 acres of natural forest lands adjacent to \nGlacier National Park and will designate 200,000 Forest Service and BLM \nlands in Montana as the Rocky Mountain Front Conservation Heritage area \nand protect 70,000 acres of the Hermosa Creek Watershed in Colorado.\n  Among the eight new national parks are two in Maryland and New York \nthat celebrate the life of Harriet Tubman, known, of course, for her \ngreat role in civil rights and developing the Underground Railroad and \nfor so many other things she did as a leader at that time. Our new \nnational parks will protect 80,000 acres of forest land and volcanic \npeaks in New Mexico; designate the first national park in Delaware; \nprotect fossil resources outside of Las Vegas; and interpret the story \nof the World War II Manhattan Project in Washington State, which was so \nimportant to Representative Hastings. Tennessee and New Mexico are, of \ncourse, also included in that history and the Colt firearms company in \nHartford, CT, which is an unusual kind of park to celebrate, but it is \npart of the American development of manufacturing, and the Colt \nfirearms company played a major role. So we have that included in this \nbill.\n  The individual bills that are included have been developed with local \nsupport and in many cases have been priorities of Senators for years. I \nam pleased to have played a pivotal role in building this comprehensive \npackage, and it took a lot of compromising and an awful lot of hard \nwork.\n  I thank the lead Senator on the Defense bill, Mr. Levin, for allowing \nus to be part of the Defense authorization bill, along with Senator \nJack Reed, whom I spoke with on many occasions along with Senator \nLevin, because without their support I don't know if this bill could \nhave survived standing alone with one or two strong objections still \nout there. But they can't fight the Defense authorization bill. Tucking \nit in a bill that is going to pass and will not be vetoed is a way to \nmove these bills forward.\n\n  It does enjoy broad and deep bipartisan support from literally \nhundreds of Members of Congress, and hundreds of staffers have spent \nhours and hours, and the executive branch--particularly Interior and \nAgriculture--has spent hours negotiating the fine details of this \npackage.\n  I thank David Brooks, who is a lead staff member with our committee, \nEnergy and Natural Resources, who has been a magnificent staffer here \nin the Senate for many years. He is known as the Senate expert on \npublic lands, and that title certainly is appropriate for a man who \nknows so much and cares deeply about our public spaces and finding the \nright balance between preservation, conservation, and development.\n  I thank Liz Craddock, who is my staff director for the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources, who was absolutely tireless. Not only \nrunning the committee in my absence, sometimes when I was on the \ncampaign trail, but also taking appropriate time to come and work with \nme for reelection and in addition putting together, with David, this \npackage while all this was going on is really a testimony to their \nprofessionalism. I thank them very much.\n  I thank all the Members of my side particularly for their patience \nand their understanding as we worked through this package of almost 80 \nto 90 bills and the subcommittees that worked so well moving them \nforward.\n  I will submit this for the Record. There may be other Senators, I am \nsure, who want to put in individual remarks for the parks and projects \nand land swaps, but I think it is pretty remarkable that we have \ncleared up 6 years of backlog at zero expense to the taxpayer with \nextremely broad and deep bipartisan support.\n  I will only say as one of my last remarks on the Senate floor that it \nis possible to find common ground if we are willing to look for it and \nwork hard enough to find it. We need to have our eyes open a little \nwider. We need to put our shoulder to the wheel a little bit stronger, \nand if we can do that, we can move a lot of significant legislation \nthrough that benefits generations of our citizens and taxpayers for \nyears to come.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I have come down to the floor today to \ntalk about the package of public lands measures included in the House-\npassed Defense bill. I am told we are likely to vote on that bill as \nearly as tomorrow in the Senate.\n  Within the lands package is a measure we worked on called the Hermosa \nCreek Watershed Protection Act.\n  The watershed, which is pictured here, is a beautiful parcel of \nnational forest land up the road from Durango in the southwest corner \nof Colorado.\n  I will say at the outset that our office may have introduced the bill \nin the Senate, but it was really the people I represent in southwest \nColorado who wrote every bit of this piece of legislation.\n  Over 6 years ago, a diverse group of local citizens, mountain bikers, \nanglers, outfitters, local officials, and many others all got together \nto talk about the future of the land. Everyone involved liked to visit \nthe area for recreation or to do business there. Their discussion was \nto developing a plan to manage the area so everyone could enjoy it and \nbenefit from the multiple uses well into the future.\n  Over the Memorial Day weekend in 2011, the Hermosa workgroup invited \nmy family and me for a hike through the watershed and to join the \ndiscussion, and we took them up on that offer.\n  We loaded up the van, drove to Durango, and met the working group at \nthe Hermosa Creek trailhead.\n  My youngest daughter Anne, who was then probably about 8, made a \nhiking stick out of a nearby fallen branch, and we started up the trail \nwith 40 or so others from the local community.\n  The Presiding Officer knows this area well. As we climbed higher and \nhigher, we were overcome by the beauty around us and the forests and \nvalleys and crystal-clear streams and unspoiled views in almost every \ndirection.\n  After about an hour, the group pulled off the forest service trail \ninto a meadow, and as Anne, Halina, and Caroline Bennet, my three \ndaughters, made me a dandelion necklace out of the dandelions that were \nthere, we started a discussion about what this area meant to the people \nwho were on this trip.\n  The sportsmen came to fish for native Colorado cutthroat trout and \nfor back-country elk hunting. The mountain bikers came to enjoy single-\ntrack riding trails known throughout the country and throughout the \nworld. The local water districts love Hermosa because it provides clean \nwater for the city of Durango, and workers in the timber and mining \nindustry stress that some of the watershed could contribute to \nextractive development in the future.\n  The upshot of the discussion we had in the meadow that afternoon was \nan agreement to work together on a bill, a balanced bill that managed \nthe watershed so it would contribute to the local economy long into the \nfuture. More than just working on this bill, I think\n\n[[Page S6525]]\n\nthe people in that meadow set out to prove that people in this country \ncan still work together and set an example for the U.S. Congress.\n  After nearly 3\\1/2\\ years of negotiations since that hike, we are on \nthe verge of passing that bill and sending it to the President for his \nsignature. The Hermosa Creek Watershed Protection Act governs the \nentire watershed. It includes provisions to allow for multiple uses, \nsuch as timber harvesting for forest health, continued access for \nColorado's snowmobilers--a critical provision to allow Silverton's \nwinter economy to continue to prosper.\n  The bill enhances opportunities for back-country fishing made \npossible by the great work of Trout Unlimited and Colorado Parks and \nWildlife to reintroduce native cutthroat trout to the watershed.\n  The bill also adds--importantly--nearly 40,000 acres to the National \nWilderness Preservation System, lands that provide unique and important \nopportunities for solitude and reflection, lands that will remain \nundeveloped forever so that they will always have clear streams to fish \nand lush forests for local outfitters to take clients into the forest \non horseback.\n  I am proud to report that the bill has the unanimous bipartisan \nbacking of the two county commissions involved, the San Juan County \nCommission and the La Plata County Commission. I thank those \ncommissioners for their leadership, collaboration, and their vision, \nand the two local towns, Durango and Silverton. It has the support of \nthe Hermosa Creek Workgroup, ranging from hardrock miners to \nenvironmental groups. These are the people we say can never get along \nand can never get anything done because everybody has to get only their \nposition and disregard the position that the other has, and we have \nproven that is not true, as I said, ranging from hardrock miners to \nenvironmental groups such as the San Juan Citizens Alliance, \nConservation Colorado, and The Wilderness Society.\n  It has the support of sportsmen, Trout Unlimited, and the back-\ncountry hunters and anglers.\n  The Hermosa bill is also supported by the local water district, the \nSouthwestern Water Conservation District.\n  The outdoor recreation community--including the Colorado Snowmobile \nAssociation, Colorado Off-Highway Vehicle Coalition, and the Trails \n2000 mountain bike group--supports the measure. And support for Hermosa \nis especially strong from the local business community. Companies as \ndiverse as fly shops, car dealerships, the Durango Chamber, and Mercury \nPayment Systems, one of the area's largest employers, all agree that \nprotected public lands add to the region's quality of life and help \nthem attract topnotch talent to the region.\n  This bill grew from the grassroots up. Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents worked together to cement a long-term plan for their \ncommunity's future.\n  I thank Senator Udall, a long-time champion for Colorado's public \nlands and wilderness, for joining me as a cosponsor of the bill.\n  I also wish to thank Congressman Scott Tipton, our partner in the \nHouse, for supporting this bill and demonstrating that bipartisanship \nstill exists in some corners of the Capitol. He has been outstanding to \nwork with, as has his staff, and I look forward to collaborating on \nother conservation measures in the future.\n  To close and bring this back to the beginning--I see my colleague is \nhere--I don't have to convince most people that Colorado is a special \nplace. Many people from all over the United States have been to our \nState to ski our mountains, run our rivers, or climb a 14er.\n\n  The Hermosa Creek watershed represents some of the best Colorado has \nto offer. It deserves to be protected, and that is what this bill does.\n  However, in some respects, I wish Hermosa didn't have to pass this \nway. This lands package is a great achievement. It came through a \nrobust bipartisan and bicameral process, and that work is something \ntruly to be commended.\n  At the same time, I think the Hermosa Creek bill could have passed by \nunanimous consent years ago as a stand-alone bill, or as part of \nanother smaller, bipartisan, bicameral package that didn't have to wait \nalmost 6 years while local communities all across the country have been \nleft in limbo. People there don't work on the same time that people \nhere work, and their expectations are that we are going to move things \nalong. No one should object to bipartisan, commonsense measures that \nare widely supported. But instead of regular order, we are left voting \non large packages of lands bills every number of years.\n  In fact, save one wilderness bill that passed earlier this session, \nCongress has not passed a wilderness bill since 2009. Congress has not \npassed one wilderness bill since 2009--I suppose we passed one.\n  Last Congress was the first time a session of Congress hadn't passed \na wilderness bill in the 50-year history of the Wilderness Act. That \nhad never happened before, whether the Senate was Democratic or the \nSenate was Republican, whether the House was Democratic or Republican, \nor whether the President was a Democrat or a Republican. It never \nhappened before. This Congress--provided the vote goes well tomorrow--\nwill have waited until the eleventh hour.\n  The 2009 bill, which was one of the very first ones I voted on as a \nSenator, created 2 million acres of new wilderness.\n  The package we will vote on tomorrow contains several hundred \nthousand acres more, including nearly 40,000 new wilderness acres, as I \nmentioned in the Hermosa bill. While that is great progress, and it \ntruly is, I wish we were doing more.\n  Despite dozens of other widely supported conservation proposals that \nhave been introduced this session, there are only four other wilderness \nbills included in this package. Once again, I am strongly supportive of \nthe package, and I urge my colleagues to vote yes. But in the new \nCongress we ought to hit the reset button and truly honor the intent of \nthe Wilderness Act--which President Johnson signed into law 50 years \nago--by passing more wilderness bills. I can't think of a better \nanniversary present for the landmark law than for the 114th Congress to \nreturn and pass more of these bills.\n  Let's defy expectations about what the change in the majority means \nhere. Let's lift up the bipartisan work that is happening around here \nand pass more of these bills.\n  Historically conservation has been a bipartisan issue going all the \nway back to Teddy Roosevelt, and I hope we might return to the \ncooperation we have seen in the decades since then and get some more \nwilderness and conservation done for the American people.\n  This is a glorious and beautiful country that we all represent. We \nought to save some of it for our kids and grandkids by passing this \npackage and coming together on some others.\n  I urge yes on the bill.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for all of his work to make sure we \ncould bring this lands bill together with the NDAA bill.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I thank my colleague from Alaska \nfor allowing me to go ahead with my remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank my colleague and his comment about the \ncourtesy for allowing him to go first. I think the Senator from \nColorado was scheduled to go first, and we were just a little bit \nbehind, so I was pleased to listen to my friend's comments about one of \nthe provisions in this NDAA lands bill, and I thank him for those \ncomments.\n  I also wish to acknowledge the comments of the Senator from \nLouisiana, our chairman of the Energy Committee. I have had the \npleasure and privilege of working with her as the ranking member on the \ncommittee now for the past 6 to 8 months since she has held the chair. \nBut even before that, I have had the honor and privilege of working \nwith her on so many energy issues.\n  As the Senator from Louisiana was detailing the contents of this \nlands package that is contained within the NDAA bill, I was reminded of \nwhat a good partnership we have had working together on the committee. \nThey are not exactly easy issues that come before us. They generate a \nlevel of controversy--certainly a level of debate and dialog--but there \nhas always been\n\n[[Page S6526]]\n\ngood, civil debate and dialog as we try to work through some very \ndifficult issues.\n  As Senator Landrieu leaves the Senate at the end of this Congress, I \nwant her to know, as I stated in committee just this morning, how much \nI have appreciated the good work she has done, not only on energy \nissues, but the good work she has done on behalf of the people whom she \nrepresents in Louisiana.\n  If there is anybody who exemplifies the word ``tenacious,'' it is \nMary Landrieu, and I think the people of her State have enjoyed the \nbenefit of the very tenacious approach and how my friend and colleague \ntakes care of those she represents. I thank the Senator for that.\n  I too wish to add my comments this evening in support of the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, and more specifically, \nto the public lands package, which is title 30.\n  As Senator Landrieu detailed in greater specificity, what we have \nhere is a collection of smaller bills related to public lands. Just \nbecause a bill is small and somewhat discreet in terms of its area of \nimpact, it doesn't mean these are not issues that are critically \nimportant to the people of that State, critically important to that \nregion.\n  With so many of these bills that are now part of this package, we \nhave spent months--and in some cases we have spent years--developing, \nconsidering, refining, amending, and working through these packages. We \nhave spent weeks negotiating which ones will actually be in the package \nthat we have before us in title 30. We have now arrived at this point \nwhere we have a bipartisan and bicameral consensus in support of it.\n  What I wish to do with my time this evening is to explain how this \npackage is fundamental to economic development in our Western States.\n  I also wish to lay out what this package is as well as what it isn't \nbecause I think there have been some misconceptions about what is \ncontained in this. I also want to provide a little bit of insight into \nthe process by which we crafted this and why it is now time for the \nSenate to do what the House has already done in passing it by a very \noverwhelming margin.\n  But before we get into the substance of some of these measures, I \nthink the Senate needs to understand why we want this package, why we \nneed to pass it now rather than waiting until the next Congress or \nperhaps the one after that or perhaps whenever we have a slow day \naround here. So I will proceed to the basics of some of this.\n  It is probably best described by just looking at the map. The \ndominant landowner in the United States is the Federal Government. The \nFederal Government, like it or not, owns roughly 640 million acres of \nland. That is more than one-quarter of our country that is held by the \nFederal Government. Ninety-three percent of these lands are clustered \nin just 12 Western States. So we can see here our Federal fault line. \nThese 12 Western States are areas where less than 50 percent of the \nland is owned or held by the State and private interests. When we look \nat this divide, on this side, more than 95 percent is state-controlled \nland.\n  So we have a situation where in many of our Eastern States the \nFederal Government owns just a small fraction of the lands. But if we \nlook to some of our Western States and we look at the extent of Federal \nownership, this is where the picture comes into greater focus. In \nWyoming, 42.3 percent of the State of Wyoming is held in Federal lands. \nIn my State of Alaska, 69 percent of the State of Alaska is federally \nowned. Nevada walks away with No. 1, where over 80 percent of the State \nof Nevada is held by the Federal Government.\n  For folks back on the east coast, what does that mean? Let's say it \npresents some real difficulties for us in the West. Say we want a minor \nland conveyance--not a big deal. But if a person lives in a State such \nas New York with less than 1 percent of Federal lands, chances are that \nperson can go see a real estate attorney and they can have a document \ndrawn up, and they might even be able to draw it up in 1 day or maybe \nit takes a couple of days, but a person can complete a transaction \nwithout too much difficulty. If a person tries to do a conveyance in 1 \nof our 12 Western States, where 93 percent of the Federal lands are, it \nis a different story. Chances are a person will not have the same luck \nas they might in New York. Even if they are seeking the smallest of \nland conveyances, say 1 acre--just 1 acre is all we want to move from \nthe Federal side to the State side, to a local side, to the private \nside--a person does not go see an attorney. A person needs to go talk \nto one of the four Federal land management agencies to get approval for \ntheir request, and they are not done there. Then a person needs to go \nsee their Congressman and their Senator because they need Federal \nlegislation to make it happen. It honestly takes an act of Congress. In \nthe East, in places where land ownership is different than it is in the \nWest, people can handle all of these conveyances. We can work through \nsome of what we are seeing in this public lands package. We can do it \nthrough private transactions. But in the West, it takes an act of \nCongress for a land conveyance.\n  That is why we see hundreds of public lands bills introduced each \nCongress. It underscores why their passage is so critical to economic \ndevelopment and to job creation in our country. I have to admit, I am \npleased the Senator from New Mexico is in the chair today, coming from \na State such as New Mexico, which is at 41.77 percent. The Presiding \nOfficer knows full well what we are talking about when we talk about \nthe imperative of our communities that are asking for a little relief \nwhen it comes to a land conveyance, and the level it rises to is not \nthe city council, it is not the mayor or the legislator or the \nGovernor, it is a Congressman and Senator, and ultimately signed into \nlaw by the President of the United States.\n  So what are we actually looking at in this package? After truly \nmonths of negotiations, perhaps a few near-death experiences, and many \ntemptations to walk away, we have agreed to a balanced, budget-neutral, \nrevenue-neutral, bicameral, bipartisan package contained in title 30. \nThese provisions that are contained here will create jobs. They will \ncreate thousands of American jobs. They will cut the redtape to energy \nproduction. They will boost American mineral production. They protect \nmultiple use and public recreation. They convey Federal land for \ncommunity development. They protect our treasured lands through \nmeasured conservation, and they provide new means for private dollars \nto support our national parks.\n  We have included a bipartisan provision to streamline oil and gas \npermitting on our Federal lands. It is supported by the Western \nGovernors' Association. It cleared the Senate by unanimous consent \nbefore the elections. So think about that. So many things get tied up \nin the politics of elections, but this was so important to so many, on \na bipartisan basis, on a regional basis, we moved it through the Senate \nby unanimous consent.\n  We have included a provision to address the backlog of the grazing \npermit renewals for our western ranchers to ease their burdens. Then \nthere is another provision we have included that will help to hopefully \nprotect the collapse of the timber industry in Southeastern Alaska with \nthe conveyance to our Alaska Native peoples--a promise that has been 40 \nyears--40 years--in achieving.\n  We have included a major priority for Arizona. This is an issue \nSenator Landrieu spoke to, an extensively negotiated land exchange led \nby Senator McCain and Senator Flake. I know Senator McCain has been \nworking on this for a decade to find a way to responsibly open a copper \ndeposit that could meet 25 percent of our country's needs while at the \nsame time taking incredible care to protect and maintain access to \ncultural resources and traditional uses of those lands.\n  There is another provision that relates to Nevada which also \nfacilitates development of a different copper mine. But now think about \nthis. We are going to have an opportunity in Nevada and in Arizona to \nextract copper. Our military needs copper. The construction industry \nneeds copper. The automotive industry needs copper. The renewable \nenergy industry needs copper. There are so many benefits to be had \nhere.\n  We have some provisions that are contained in this package that \nperhaps generate fewer headlines but are still hugely important for \nlocal communities. Probably the best example of\n\n[[Page S6527]]\n\nthis is a provision for a school in Minnesota. This is a measure we \nhave been working on with Senator Franken. But it facilitates a land \nexchange of just 1 acre--1 acre to a school in Minnesota--a single, \nlonely acre. We probably have people saying, So do we really have to \npass a bill in order to make that happen? The simple answer is yes. \nThat is why we are here. That is why we are including these \nprovisions--so many provisions--in this very important bill.\n\n  I also want to mention what the package is not--what it does not do, \nwhat it does not contain, and some of the parade of horribles that \ncertain groups have been saying that in fairness, they are not looking \nagain to the balance we have achieved with this overall package.\n  We saw some rightful concerns emerge before this title was finalized. \nEverybody's ears always perk up when they hear ``public lands \npackage,'' wondering what it is going to be. But we have seen some \ninaccurate criticisms emerge even after the release. It is one thing if \nthey haven't seen what is in it. It is another thing to look at it and \nthen be critical of it.\n  As I mentioned earlier, this is a balanced, revenue-neutral package. \nWe have taken great care to make sure it is not all focused on new \nwilderness, new parks. In Western States, and particularly coming out \nof Alaska, we are just not going to have the support we need if it is \nall focused on wilderness and parks, so it is not. There is a \nconservation piece, absolutely, and it is a strong conservation piece, \nand I think it is a good, balanced one. But we also have the very \nimportant development piece that is critical to what is contained \nwithin.\n  To those who have spoken out against creating new national parks, \ngiven the maintenance backlogs that I think we recognize--it could be \nas high as $20 billion. I get it. I agree with Senator Coburn that we \nmust address the backlog issues, the maintenance issues, and I thank \nhim for the scrutiny he and his staff have given to this issue and the \nreport they came out with. We are going to be working to address that \nin a manner that is constructive and long term. I want to reduce the \nbacklogs, and we will do it.\n  Again, this has been judged to be revenue neutral. Through its \npassage, we could make progress on the backlog issue.\n  One provision that is contained in the bill that will help is the \nauthorization of a National Park Service commemorative coin. There are \n75 Senators who are cosponsors that will allow for additional funds to \nbe raised. Senator Coburn has a measure in here that will allow for \nappropriate recognition of volunteers to our national parks. We have \nalso tailored this package to include the wilderness provisions, but it \nis a discrete number. All of these have strong local and congressional \nsupport. We are looking at less than 250,000 acres in all, and actually \nfrom a practical perspective, far less than that. Most of these \nprovisions were sponsored by a House Republican. Some have been \nendorsed by a Governor or a State legislature. With others, we are \nsimply making it official. Nearly half of what would become wilderness \nis already managed as if it were wilderness. It is in wilderness study \nareas or it is in roadless area designation.\n  This is not a zero-sum game because we should be focused on the \nproductive value of our public lands above all else. But for those who \nare kind of keeping score--is this acre per acre--I want to remind \npeople that the package transfers almost 110,000 acres of Federal land \ninto State or private hands through conveyances, exchanges, and sales. \nWe are also releasing more than 26,000 acres of land from wilderness \nstudy back into multiple use. Examples of what those lands could be \nused for include building of transmission lines or motorized \nrecreation.\n  I know some have raised issues about the various studies that are \ncontained within the bill which, in my view, are more a matter of due \ndiligence than anything else. Because a further act of Congress will be \nrequired before any new park, any new museum or wild or scenic \ndesignation can be established, and then we have the funding aspect of \nit as well. So, again, these are studies. This is not the creation of a \nnew museum. This is not the creation of a new park. These are studies.\n  I think it is also important to reiterate that we have taken great \ncare to protect private property. We have forbidden the use of eminent \ndomain and the condemnation of private property. We have also set a \npositive precedent by eliminating the potential use of buffer zones \naround designated lands.\n  Again, I am going to say it one more time: This package is the result \nof bipartisan and bicameral negotiation, weeks of meetings amongst \nMembers and staff of the committees of jurisdiction, the committees \nthat have crafted the overall NDAA bill, leadership in both Chambers, \nand many individual Members.\n  For those who would suggest that this package was somehow hastily \nassembled, that this is some kind of rush to judgment, it is at the end \nof a very long and actually a very traditional process. We have \nconsidered, debated, and amended these provisions over the course of \nCongress using the committee process and the House and Senate floor \nwhen we could. Every bill within this package has been reviewed by the \ncommittees of jurisdiction. We are not hopscotching over anybody. At \nleast 30 bills have passed the House and 7 have passed the Senate. Even \nthough we haven't devoted time to a large package of individual bills, \nsome of these provisions have been considered in multiple Congresses. \nYou may look through the list, and they look like reruns. It is because \nwe have tried, and the process didn't allow for full completion.\n  What we have with title 30 builds upon the lands and natural resource \nprovisions that were included in the initial House-passed NDAA. These \nwere provisions that were primarily the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee's jurisdiction.\n  We have seen in the past the NDAA bill include public lands packages. \nIt has happened enough times that the House leaders actually name the \nHouse Resources Committee as official conferees to it. But I think what \nis very important for us to remember about this lands package is that \nwhat we have done, this effort, has taken no time and no funding away \nfrom our military or our veterans, nor has its inclusion held the NDAA \nback for a single moment here.\n  I think we would all prefer a process where we could take the time to \nbring up Senator Bennet's bill on the floor and talk about it and have \nhim tell us about all the magic of this region, but we haven't seen \nthat in this body in far too long. I would prefer that process where \nall these bills could be considered individually on their own, but know \nthat we have reviewed everything closely. This is a revenue neutral \npackage. We found the right balance and reached bipartisan and \nbicameral agreement. We don't need to start over. We don't need to be \nworking these same bills in a new Congress. We don't need to see a \ngroundhog's day with so many of these measures that are small but are \nso important to these Western States. It is time to finish this. It is \ntime to pass these reasonable measures. So I would encourage the Senate \nto support this package as part of the larger NDAA bill so that we can \nfulfill our responsibility to those in the Western States and those who \nhave public lands that we are happy to have, but we also need to know \nwe can have a level of responsiveness within our system to allow us to \nwork those lands.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nAlaska for her tireless efforts on the lands bill and the NDAA bill and \nthe bipartisan spirit she brought to all of these negotiations over a \nlong period of time. She is to be commended for it. I don't think we \nwould be anywhere close to where we are without her work. I thank her \nfor that.\n  I am here to speak briefly about the Intelligence Committee's report \non the CIA's interrogation methods. I support the committee's decision \nto release the report. As a country, it shows we have the courage to \nface the truth no matter how ugly that truth may be. Coloradans need to \nknow the truth. The American people deserve to know the truth. Our \nwillingness to face this difficult truth reminds us that we live and we \nare lucky to live in the most open and transparent democracy the world \nhas ever known. Unlike the acts brought to light by the Intelligence \nCommittee report, the willingness for self-examination is something to \nbe celebrated about America.\n\n[[Page S6528]]\n\n  The report will be the subject of significant debate over the coming \nweeks and months and maybe even years, as it should be. Nobody should \nbe cavalier about the risks that are associated with the release of \nthis information, but this is a discussion our country needs to have.\n  Although I am still reviewing the report, a couple of things are \npretty clear at the outset.\n  First, the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques failed \nto secure accurate information or cooperation from detainees. The very \nfirst finding of the report says:\n  While being subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques \nand afterwards, multiple CIA detainees fabricated information, \nresulting in faulty intelligence. Detainees provided fabricated \ninformation on critical intelligence issues, including the terrorist \nthreats which the CIA identified as its highest priorities.\n  Not only has torture not made the country safer, it may have made us \nless safe--at least according to this report.\n  Second, the report reveals that the CIA withheld information from the \nFBI, the State Department, and the Director of the Office of National \nIntelligence. It denied access to detainees and provided inaccurate \ninformation about the interrogation tactics. Information was withheld \nfrom former Secretary of State Colin Powell out of concern he would \n``blow his stack if he were to be briefed on what's been going on.'' \nThe CIA repeatedly misled Congress and impeded oversight by its own \ninspector general.\n  The report rebuts any notion that these brutal tactics led to \nactionable intelligence that made our country safer. It highlights the \nlengths to which people systematically misled other agencies, the \nCongress, and for years the American people. But most significantly, \nthis report--and I thank the Presiding Officer for his service on the \nIntelligence Committee. It is a committee that by definition people \ncan't learn very much about, and I know it takes a lot of time and an \nawful lot of work that can go underappreciated. But this week we are \nlearning why the work on that committee is so important.\n  Most significantly, as I was saying, this report has reminded us that \nthe use of torture is completely at war with who we are as a country \nand the ideals we hold. Throughout our country's history, our American \nvalues--the notion that all people are endowed by their Creator with \ncertain unalienable, sustainable rights--have sustained us through our \nmost difficult times. They helped us triumph in World War II and \neventually led to the fall of communism during the Cold War. They have \nattracted millions of immigrants to our shores. They inspired \ngenerations of Americans to rectify the inequality that exists in their \nown time to create a more perfect union. In fact, the values of \ndemocracy and human dignity are what brought my mother and her family \nto the United States after surviving the horrors of the Holocaust in \nPoland. It was a place that they called beautiful America, as much an \nidea as it was a place to them. Torture is repugnant to these \nfundamental American ideals.\n  It is often said that the strength of our democratic institutions is \ntested during times of crisis. Understanding what happened and ensuring \nwe won't use torture again will help our democratic institutions \npersevere in the future and serve future generations as well as the \ngenerations that were here before.

The HAVEN Act lies within the jurisdiction of the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, to which it has been \nreferred. However, working in close coordination with the chairman of \nthe banking committee, we were able to include this measure in the NDAA \nbill, in recognition of its potential to assist veterans of our armed \nservices who are in need; isn't that correct, Chairman Johnson?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.

Mr. President, James Baker has served the State of Vermont \nwith great distinction over many years, and I was saddened when he \nannounced his retirement in 2009 after 3 decades with the Vermont State \nPolice. To no one's surprise, he finished his tenure there at the top, \nas commander.\n  But we knew retirement would not last long for a man of his talents.\n  In 2010, Jim Baker answered the call to step in where he was most \nneeded, taking the helm of the Rutland City Police Department when the \ndepartment and the community were beset by turmoil. Chief Baker's \nleadership and loyalty was infections, and his plan to serve for only a \nfew months turned into a few years.\n  During that time, Chief Baker pulled together a team of committed \nneighbors, businesspeople and community organizers to face the \nchallenges head-on. They tackled blighted neighborhoods and encouraged \nnew investment. They sent a strong message to drug dealers: NOT in our \ncommunity. And they developed a statistical mapping system to reduce \ncrime in the city's worst-hit blocks. This effort, known as ``Project \nVISION,'' has shown great success.\n  With Rutland now on a steady course, one might think Chief Baker \nwould again be thinking of retirement, but that will not be the case. \nInstead, Jim Baker will be bringing his leadership talents to \nWashington D.C., where he will serve as director of law enforcement and \nsupport with the International Association of Chiefs of Police.\n  Rutland's loss is our Nation's gain. I look forward to a continued \nworking relationship with Jim, and thank him for his dedication and \nleadership to the State of Vermont. I ask that the following profile of \nJim Baker, which recently appeared in the Vermont weekly Seven Days, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Seven Days, Nov. 19, 2014]\n\n                 Influential Police Chief Has a New Gig\n\n                            (By Mark Davis)\n\n       When Jim Baker first took over Rutland's scandal-plagued \n     police department in the winter of 2012, he had a running \n     joke with the mayor.\n       In department-head meetings during which a particularly \n     vexing problem arose, Baker would hold up his city-issued \n     notebook and point to the first word of his job title. \n     ``Mayor, mayor, look--`interim,' OK?'' Baker would say to \n     Mayor Chris Louras. ``That question is for the next guy.''\n       Baker, a former head of the Vermont State Police, initially \n     signed on for a six-month stint as Rutland's chief of police. \n     Nearly\n\n[[Page S6529]]\n\n     three years later, he still occupies the corner office at the \n     Rutland police station.\n       Baker is widely credited with stabilizing the department, \n     initiating a statistics-based policing program and rallying \n     dozens of community groups to fight the city's drug problem. \n     ``He was the driving force not just to turn around a \n     dysfunctional department but in helping the renaissance of \n     the city,'' Louras said. ``It would not have happened without \n     him.''\n       But now, talk of the ``next guy'' is no joke.\n       Although the mayor had started preliminary contract \n     discussions to keep Baker around for a couple more years, the \n     chief decided it was time for something less stressful. In \n     December, Baker is leaving for a position with the \n     International Association of Chiefs of Police, a Washington, \n     D.C., think tank.\n       ``I burn a lot of jet fuel when I get into a situation like \n     I found here,'' said Baker, who has preferred working short \n     stints--no longer than a few years--during his lengthy law-\n     enforcement career. The D.C. opportunity, he said, will \n     enable him to engage in national and international issues on \n     a less demanding schedule.\n       A New York native and Southern Vermont College graduate, \n     Baker methodically climbed the ladder during the 30 years he \n     worked at Vermont State Police. He held nearly every position \n     there, including director, before retiring in 2009.\n       Baker says it is unlikely he'll ever stop working. After \n     leaving the state police, he launched a consulting business \n     and became something of a Mr. Fix-It for Vermont law \n     enforcement. Then a scandal rocked the Vermont Police \n     Academy: A training coordinator committed suicide after his \n     computers were seized during a child-pornography \n     investigation. It prompted the director of the academy to \n     resign, and in 2010, Baker took over that job for several \n     months with the intention of rooting out problems and \n     improving morale.\n       Next Baker spent a few months as interim police chief in \n     Manchester. That's when Louras and Rutland Police \n     Commissioner Larry Jensen came calling. They convinced Baker \n     to come aboard for six months to help ``settle down'' a \n     department in the midst of its own scandal.\n       The Rutland force had been in disarray since 2010, when \n     state police busted former sergeant David Schauwecker for \n     viewing pornography on his work computer and removing a \n     pornographic video from an evidence locker for personal use. \n     After he accepted a plea deal, Schauwecker was fired. Rutland \n     aldermen urged the police commission to do the same to then-\n     chief Tony Bossi, but they said no; Bossi finally resigned in \n     early 2012.\n       The Rutland Herald asked for documents related to the \n     investigation, but the city's police department refused. So \n     the newspaper sued--and won: In 2013, the Vermont Supreme \n     Court ordered the department to release the records, which \n     revealed that, years earlier, two other Rutland officers had \n     also watched porn on the job.\n       Meantime, the city wasn't faring much better than its \n     police department. Once a boomtown fueled by railroads and a \n     marble quarry, Rutland's economy had lagged for decades. Out-\n     of-state drug dealers moved in as property values plummeted, \n     downtown went dormant and vacant buildings proliferated. \n     Drugs had decimated large swaths of the city long before Gov. \n     Peter Shumlin devoted his 2014 State of the State address to \n     Vermont's ``opiate epidemic.''\n       Known throughout Vermont as ``Rut-Vegas''--a moniker that \n     Baker forbade his officers from using inside the station--the \n     city was the brunt of countless jokes.\n       Then, in September 2012, a tragedy illustrated the severity \n     of the city's plight. A 23-year-old Rutland man passed out \n     while driving through downtown, as a result of inhaling gas \n     from an aerosol can. His foot remained on the accelerator, \n     and, moving at 80 miles per hour, he slammed into a bank of \n     parked cars outside the Discount Food and Liquidation Center. \n     Carly Ferro, a 17-year-old Rutland High School senior, had \n     just worked a shift in the store and was walking to her \n     father's car when she was struck and killed.\n       ``That was the tipping point,'' Baker said. ``That was the \n     single incident where people in the community said they had \n     finally had enough and starting rallying around the police \n     department and the neighborhoods.''\n       To tackle Rutland's growing list of urban ills, Baker and a \n     few others organized regular meetings with housing agencies, \n     social workers, neighborhood activists, lawyers, mental \n     health experts, educators and city hall workers.\n       The group that formed called itself Project VISION--Viable \n     Initiatives and Solutions through Involvement of \n     Neighborhoods--and focused on problems related to drugs, \n     crime, housing and jobs. Its monthly meetings, which \n     attracted 70 to 100 people, helped build public support for a \n     methadone clinic that opened earlier this year, among other \n     initiatives.\n       Seeking further collaboration, Baker invited mental health \n     workers, social workers, prosecutors, probation officers and \n     domestic violence experts to relocate their offices to the \n     police station.\n       Meanwhile, inside the police force, the chief aimed to \n     strengthen relations with residents and institute smarter \n     enforcement. He helped create a crime-mapping project that \n     plotted the details of every police call--whether for a \n     family fight or a noise disturbance--into a database. Every \n     two weeks, officers and members of Project VISION reviewed \n     ``hot spots'' and developed strategies to defuse them.\n       Baker also instructed his officers to stop measuring \n     success by arrest numbers. ``We're not focused on arrests or \n     how much drugs were seized, but on working through \n     problems,'' Baker said.\n       When his first six-month contract was up, Baker signed a \n     one-year extension, then two more, the last of which paid him \n     $125,000 a year. ``I saw some opportunity, that I thought I \n     could contribute,'' Baker said. ``I found out there were some \n     people in the community working very hard to get it right.''\n       Among them was Linda Justin. A Rutland native who had \n     become increasingly distraught by the city's decline, she and \n     her husband, Bill Beckim, cashed out their 401(k), bought a \n     derelict building in Rutland's Northwest neighborhood, and in \n     January 2013 opened the Dream Center, where they host youth \n     groups, prayer sessions, meetings, block parties and free \n     meals. One day, Justin called Baker looking for an answer to \n     a neighbor's question.\n       After talking for a while, Baker realized, ``Oh my gosh, \n     you guys are doing what we're talking about doing,'' the \n     chief recalled.\n       Baker started to join Justin and Beckim on their \n     neighborhood walks, chatting with residents about problems \n     and their ideas for making things better. ``He doesn't just \n     sit in his office and direct,'' Justin said. ``He gets his \n     hands right in it. He's a real person. He's down-to-earth.''\n       And while no one is declaring victory, officials say \n     Rutland is improving. Calls for police service have dropped \n     since Project VISION launched, and Baker said the department \n     is registering double-digit drops in burglaries and property \n     crimes this year.\n       Rutland police have had a lot of help. Federal authorities \n     conducted a three-year operation in the city and have been \n     responsible for most of the prosecutions against prominent \n     drug dealers operating there. Vermont Attorney General Bill \n     Sorrell tasked one of his prosecutors to focus exclusively on \n     Rutland; assistant attorney general Ultan Doyle works out of \n     the downtown police station.\n       Its porn scandal may be over, but the department still \n     isn't perfect.\n       In September, two officers were suspended after a brawl \n     outside a Rutland bar.\n       In a pending lawsuit filed in January 2013, Andrew Todd, a \n     former Rutland police officer and now a Vermont State Police \n     trooper, describes a culture of police misconduct and cover-\n     ups, and alleges that superiors subjected him to racial \n     abuse.\n       Todd, who is African American, claims he brought several \n     concerns to higher-ups but that little was done. The alleged \n     misconduct, including officers stealing, having sex and \n     sleeping while on duty, occurred before Baker came to \n     Rutland. Though Todd left the department before Baker \n     arrived, he has alleged that Baker tried to ``influence'' an \n     outside review of the Rutland police department.\n       Baker declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n       In three years, nearly half of the department's roster has \n     turned over, through firings and attrition. Baker says he is \n     proud of the holdovers who were willing to adapt to his \n     methods. ``It would have been very easy for those folks to \n     bunker down, wait me out,'' Baker said. ``My track record is \n     pretty clear--I don't stay anywhere very long.''\n       The mayor is intent on continuing Baker's legacy. Guiding \n     the search for a new chief, Louras said, will be his or her \n     ability to adopt Baker's methods.\n       That includes the continuation of Project VISION. In recent \n     months, Baker handed off much of his work there to Capt. \n     Scott Tucker. The community agencies that populate the top \n     floor of police headquarters aren't going anywhere. And the \n     monthly Project VISION meetings still attract a crowd.\n       ``You can't lead,'' Baker said, ``if no one is following \n     you.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6529-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6529-S6530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THANKING CURRENT AND PAST DEMOCRATIC STAFF OF THE SENATE SELECT \n                       COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to one of Illinois' \ngreat pioneers, State Comptroller Judy Baar Topinka. Judy passed away \nsuddenly last night at the age of 70. She was the only woman in our \nState to hold two State constitutional offices, and her leadership \nbuilt bridges for countless women.\n  Born in 1944 to William and Lillian Baar, Judy and her family lived \nin Riverside, near Cicero and Berwyn, two blue-collar Chicago suburbs. \nHer mother ran a real estate business while her father fought in World \nWar II. She went to Northwestern University and graduated with a degree \nin journalism from the university's Medill School in 1966.\n  Judy became a reporter for a suburban Chicago newspaper chain and \nrose through the ranks to editor. But in 1980, she decided to run for \nthe Illinois House. She said she ran because the corrupt officials were \nignoring the community.\n  Her trademark humor and her work ethic served her well and she went \nto serve as State senator from 1985 until 1995. In 1994, she became the \nfirst woman in Illinois history to hold the post of State treasurer and \nthen went on to set another first as the only State treasurer to be \nreelected to three consecutive terms. Judy was a consummate public \nservant. A few weeks ago, she was re-elected as State comptroller and \nwas about to start her second term.\n  Judy never shied away from taking tough stands or making the hard \ndecisions. When it was not popular among many in her party, she was an \nadvocate of women's rights and gay rights. When both parties needed to \nbe held accountable, she was fearless. She was always a straight \ntalker.\n  She was one of a kind. Judy could play the accordion, and she spoke \nfour languages--English, Czech, Spanish, and Polish. She loved dance \npolkas and really was Illinois' Polka Queen. Anyone who knew her also \nknew about her beloved dogs and their preference for McDonald's \ncheeseburgers. In an era where far too many are stuck on talking \npoints, Judy said what she thought and did it with style.\n  In a political world of cocker spaniels she could be a bulldog taking \na bite out of both Democrats and right-wing Republicans without missing \na beat. She was a blue-collar, immigrants' kid who lit up the room with \nher quick wit and boundless energy.\n  Illinois lost someone special. My prayers and thoughts go out to her \nson Joseph, her new granddaughter Alexandra Faith, and the rest of her \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6530-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF THO DINH-ZARR\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I address the Senate on the \nnomination of Dr. Tho ``Bella'' Dinh-Zarr of Texas to be a Member of \nthe National Transportation Safety Board, NTSB.\n  Dr. Dinh-Zarr is uniquely qualified to serve as a Member of the NTSB. \nDr. Dinh-Zarr currently holds the position of Director of the U.S. \noffice of the FIA Foundation, an independent nonprofit charity based in \nthe United Kingdom which supports activities that promote international \nroad safety research and sustainable mobility. I have been informed \nthat, prior to assuming her current role, Dr. Dinh-Zarr also served as \nthe Foundation's Road Safety Director from 2007-2014. Dr. Dinh-Zarr has \nextensive professional experience with traffic and highway safety \nissues, working previously as Director of North America's Make Roads \nSafe Campaign for Global Road Safety, a scientist at the National \nHighway and Traffic Safety Administration, and as National Director of \nTraffic Safety Policy for the American Automobile Association.\n  I would like to highlight some of Dr. Dinh-Zarr's connections to our \nshared home State of Texas--in particular, her education and work \nexperience at some of our well-known academic and research \ninstitutions. Dr. Dinh-Zarr and her family escaped Vietnam in 1975, \neventually taking up residence along the Gulf Coast in Galveston, TX. \nFrom an early age, Dr. Dinh-Zarr developed an awareness of the region's \nextensive multi-modal transportation network and the importance of \nrail, marine, and pipeline safety in her community. One of her first \njobs was working at the Galveston Railroad Museum, an institution \ndedicated to preserving the region's storied history of rail \ntransportation through educational exhibits and programs. Dr. Dinh-Zarr \nearned both a Masters of Public Health and a Ph.D. in Health Policy and \nInjury Prevention from the University of Texas School of Public Health. \nShe is a graduate of Rice University and worked as a Research Associate \nat the Texas A Transportation Institute, TTI, widely recognized as \none of the premier transportation research agencies in the country.\n  The NTSB plays a critical role in advancing transportation safety. \nThe agency is charged with investigating transportation-related \naccidents and making recommendations aimed at preventing future events. \nIn order to best meet its goal of improving safety across our Nation's \ntransportation system, the NTSB must ensure safety recommendations are \nreasonable, balanced and evidence-based. The agency's investigative and \nadvocacy responsibilities must be considered in light of the unique and \ndiverse safety challenges confronting our States, where innovative and \ntailored solutions can often more effectively reduce or eliminate the \nlikelihood of future incidents or injury versus a one-size-fits-all \napproach. Toward this end, NTSB must place a high priority on \ntransparency and accountability, working to ensure communities, \nindividuals, small businesses, and all others impacted by its work are \nprovided adequate opportunities to be heard.\n  I am confident that Dr. Dinh-Zarr is up to the challenge. She will \nnot only bring to the position a wealth of knowledge and experience, \nbut also a Texan's sense of compassion and dedication to the service of \nothers. I am pleased to join her friends and family, members of \nVietnamese American community in Texas and across the country, and many \nothers in support of this well-qualified nominee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6530-3", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6530-S6531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         INSURANCE CAPITAL STANDARDS CLARIFICATION ACT OF 2014\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with \nSenators Brown and Johanns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in June of this year the Senate passed by \nunanimous consent, S. 2270, urgent legislation I introduced with \nSenators Brown and Johanns to address the capital requirements that \napply to insurance companies under Federal supervision pursuant to the \nDodd-Frank Act. This legislation clarifies the Federal Reserve's \nauthority to recognize the distinctions between banking and insurance \nwhen implementing section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act, ensuring that \nbank-centric capital standards are not applied to such companies' \nregulated insurance activities.\n  One of the central elements of the Dodd-Frank Act was stronger \ncapital rules for both banks and certain non-bank financial \ninstitutions. Two sections of the Dodd-Frank Act accomplished this--\nsection 165, which applies to large bank holding companies and to non-\nbank systemically important financial institutions, SIFIs, and section \n171, which applies minimum capital standards to insured depository \ninstitutions, depository institution holding companies, including \ninsurance savings and loan holding companies, and to SIFIs.\n  Insurance companies, specifically insurance savings and loan holding \ncompanies, are different from banks. Insurers must match long-term \nobligations\n\n[[Page S6531]]\n\nto their policyholders with long-term assets, mostly bonds, while banks \nhave more callable obligations--securities and loans and mortgages--and \nfund them with deposits as well as a mix of debt and equity of varying \nmaturities and durations. The Dodd-Frank legislation reflected this \nreality, both in its text and in the legislative history, which \nrepeatedly recognizes that the business of insurance is unique and \npresents different risks.\n  Mr. BROWN. I and other original cosponsors and strong supporters of \nS. 2270 have, like you, been disappointed by the regulators' failure to \nrecognize that they have the authority to implement the Collins \namendment as it applies to insurers in a manner that tailors the \ncapital requirements for insurers to reflect the substantial \ndifferences between insurers and depository institutions. We continue \nto believe that the regulators could solve this problem using their \nexisting authority. This legislation shows that there is strong \nbipartisan support for addressing this issue. As you know, 31 of your \ncolleagues and I cosponsored the bill, and the legislation passed the \nSenate with unanimous support in early June.\n  S. 2270 is narrowly crafted to only address this issue as it relates \nto insurance companies and insurance savings and loan holding \ncompanies. If you are a bank, or another entity that owns a bank, you \nwill be subject to the full force of the Collins amendment for your \nbanking activities. At the same time, if you are a financial \norganization engaged in insurance which is also engaged in bank \nactivities, including derivatives market making, those activities would \nbe subject to the Collins amendment.\n  To accomplish the goal of directing the Federal Reserve to tailor \nrules for insurance, our legislation permits the Federal Reserve to \ncreate a non-Basel III regime for the insurance operations of \nsupervised entities. The legislation allows the Fed to work with State \ninsurance regulators to develop appropriate insurance-based capital \nstandards for insurance activities.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I am an original cosponsor of this legislation and \nappreciate your long-standing partnership on this issue. The bill \nclarifies that, in establishing the minimum leverage capital and risk-\nbased capital standards under section 171, the Federal Reserve Board is \nnot required to include activities or companies that are engaged in the \nbusiness of insurance and are subject to State insurance regulation, \nincluding State insurance capital requirements. Similarly, regulated \nforeign affiliates or subsidiaries engaged in the business of insurance \nand subject to foreign insurance regulation and foreign insurance \ncapital requirements that have not been deemed to be inadequate also \nmay be excluded from section 171 capital standards. We believe it is \nworth noting that the Government Accountability Office found that the \nState risk-based capital rules performed well during the financial \ncrisis.\n  The bill allows the insurance capital requirements that have been \neffective to continue to determine the capital requirements for the \nactivities of insurance companies and groups that are supervised by the \nFederal Reserve Board. Furthermore, activities of a holding company \nsupervised by the Federal Reserve Board that are not the business of \ninsurance would remain subject to the capital standards under section \n171. In determining insurance versus non-insurance activities of a \nsupervised entity, the legislation provides regulators with the \nflexibility to tailor the rules for certain affiliates or subsidiaries \nof insurance companies that are necessary to the business of insurance, \nincluding, for example, affiliates or subsidiaries that support \ninsurance company general and separate accounts.\n  Our legislation defines ``business of insurance'' by reference to \nsection 1002 of the Dodd-Frank Act, and under this definition the \nbusiness of insurance means ``the writing of insurance or the \nreinsuring of risks by an insurer, including all acts necessary to such \nwriting or reinsuring and the activities relating to the writing of \ninsurance or the reinsuring of risks conducted by persons who act as, \nor are, officers, directors, agents, or employees of insurers or who \nare other persons authorized to act on behalf of such persons.'' The \nreference to this definition of the ``business of insurance'' will help \nensure that insurance activities of federally supervised companies are \nsubject to tailored capital rules, whether those activities are \nundertaken by the insurance companies themselves or by their affiliates \nor subsidiaries on their behalf.\n  Ms. COLLINS. We also want to ensure that the Federal Reserve uses its \nauthority to tailor capital rules for insurance operations of entities \nunder its supervision, regardless of the size of the subsidiary insured \ndepository institution. As we have stated, under this legislation and \nunder current law, the Basel banking regime and the Collins amendment \nrequirements will continue to apply to all insured depository \ninstitutions. It would be at odds with sound public policy and the \nintent of this legislation for the Federal Reserve to impose a Basel \nbanking capital regime on the entire enterprise of an insurer that \nhappens to also own a sizable insured depository institution--the \ndepository institution in that operation will already be subject to \nbanking rules, but the insurance operations should not be.\n  Mr. BROWN. Another important provision of our legislation addresses \nthe issue of insurance accounting for a small number of non-publicly \ntraded insurance companies. While every publicly traded company in the \nUnited States is required by the Federal Securities laws to prepare \nconsolidated financial statements under Generally Accepted Accounting \nPrinciples, GAAP, all insurance companies in the United States--whether \nin mutual or stock form of organization--are required by their State \ninsurance regulators to utilize an accounting method known as Statutory \nAccounting. Indeed, most mutual insurance companies only use Statutory \nAccounting in preparing their financial statements.\n  Statutory Accounting Principles, SAP, are generally more conservative \nthan GAAP because they are specifically designed to promote insurer \nsolvency and the ability to pay claims instead of measuring an \ninsurer's value as a going concern. SAP does not allow a number of non-\nliquid or intangible assets to be included on an insurer's balance \nsheet and provides less favorable accounting treatment for certain \nexpenses. In both the text of the Dodd-Frank Act and its legislative \nhistory, Congress recognized the acceptability of SAP for holding \ncompanies engaged in insurance activities coming under Federal Reserve \njurisdiction. Specifically, Congress 1) directed the Federal Reserve to \nrely on existing reports and information provided to State and other \nregulators (which for insurance companies would have been prepared \naccording to SAP); and 2) included Senate report language stating that \nFederal Reserve assumption of jurisdiction over savings and loan \nholding companies engaged in the business of insurance did not reflect \na mandate to impose GAAP. However, in proposed rulemakings, the Federal \nReserve expressed its intention to require all companies to eventually \nprepare GAAP financial statements-consistent with their existing model \nfor all bank holding companies. Imposing such a mandate on companies \nusing only SAP would cost insurers a substantial amount to take on \nmulti-year financial projects yielding minimal, if any, supervisory \nbenefit to regulators.\n  S. 2270 makes clear that under Section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act and \nthe Home Owners' Loan Act, such a mandate is inappropriate where the \nholding company is a non-publicly traded insurance company that is only \nrequired to prepare and file SAP statements. Nothing in this provision \nprevents the Federal Reserve from obtaining any information it is \notherwise entitled to obtain from a SAP-only insurer.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I and the many other supporters of S. \n2270 are pleased that this legislation has passed the Senate. It is \ncritical that this legislation be enacted this year. We look forward to \nits enactment this year and working with regulators as they implement \nappropriate, tailored capital rules for insurers under their \nsupervision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6531-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6531-S6532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NEWBORN SCREENING SAVES LIVES REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I applaud the passage of the Newborn \nScreening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act.\n\n[[Page S6532]]\n\nAcross the United States, newborns are screened routinely for certain \ngenetic, metabolic, hormonal and functional disorders. Most of these \nbirth defects have no immediate visible effects on a baby but, unless \ndetected and treated early, they can cause serious physical problems, \ndevelopmental disability and, in some cases, death.\n  Fortunately, most infants are given a clean bill of health when \ntested. In cases where newborns are found to have metabolic disorders \nor hearing impairment, early diagnosis and proper treatment are crucial \nin making the difference between healthy development and lifelong \ninfirmity.\n  Newborn screening has been saving lives for more than 50 years, but \nprograms vary from State to State. To address disparity among States' \nnewborn screening capabilities, Congress passed the original Newborn \nScreening Saves Lives Act of 2008, P.L. 110-204, legislation I \nsponsored with Senator Chris Dodd. The law established national newborn \nscreening guidelines and helped facilitate comprehensive newborn \nscreening in every State in America and the District of Columbia.\n  Before passage, some States offered as few as only four of the \nrecommended tests, and only 11 States and D.C. required the recommended \nscreening for all disorders. Today, 42 States and D.C. require \nscreening for at least 29 of the 31 treatable core conditions, and both \nparents and physicians are more aware of the availability and necessity \nof newborn screening.\n  To maintain the important work of newborn screening programs, I am a \nproud sponsor of the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act \nof 2013. This legislation will allow States to continue improving their \nprograms to help medical providers promptly diagnose and treat \nconditions which could result otherwise in irreversible brain damage, \npermanent disability, or death.\n  I very much appreciate and commend the hard work of my colleagues and \ntheir staffs here in the Congress, the administration, and the public \nhealth community to ensure that this program will continue to help \nStates provide critical, timely, and lifesaving newborn screening for \nour youngest Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6532-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DODD-FRANK REFORM\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, 14 years ago, Congress made a grave \nmistake. In the dead of night, as part of the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2001, Congress passed a little-noticed provision \nthat prohibited all meaningful oversight and regulation of swaps, which \nthen were the latest financial product in the fast-growing financial \nderivatives market. In that new regulatory void, the swaps markets grew \nto unprecedented size and complexity. It was the swaps market that \nultimately lead to unprecedented taxpayer bailouts of some of the \nlargest financial institutions in the world.\n  Some have estimated that the cost of the last crisis was $17 \ntrillion--with a ``t''. To the families across the country, it meant \nlost jobs, home foreclosures and reduced home values for those who did \nnot lose their homes. Far too many of my constituents, far too many \nAmericans, are still struggling to recover. It was all enabled by \nCongress passing a financial regulatory provision with little \nconsideration, tucked inside a funding bill.\n  We enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection \nAct, in part, to address the significant risks posed by swaps and other \nfinancial derivatives. Section 716 was a key component of the financial \nreforms. That provision is titled ``Prohibition Against Federal \nGovernment Bailouts of Swaps Entities.'' It explicitly prohibited \ntaxpayer bailouts of banks that trade swaps. It set out a plan to help \nachieve that goal, by requiring bank holding companies to move much of \ntheir derivatives trading outside of their FDIC-insured banks.\n  This provision has come to be known as the ``swaps push out'' \nprovision. Four years after its enactment, however, banking regulators \nhave yet to finalize a rule to enforce compliance. Before they do, some \nin Congress want to relieve them of the obligation altogether.\n  Some of the largest bank holding companies prefer to conduct their \nswaps trades in their government-backed, FDIC-insured banks because \nthey have better credit ratings, which means lower borrowing costs and \ntherefore higher profits. But because the activity is within the bank, \nit puts the Federal Government--and taxpayers--directly on the hook for \nthose bets that, as we saw in the financial crisis, can be unlimited in \nnumber, because banks can create an unlimited number of ``synthetic'' \nderivatives related to a particular financial asset.\n  A couple years ago, JPMorgan Chase lost billions of dollars on a bad \nbet in the credit derivatives markets. The Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, which I chair, conducted an extensive investigation and \nissued a 300-page bipartisan report with its findings. JPMorgan's risky \ntrading by its bank was a disaster--costing the bank over $6 billion. \nIt was receiving the taxpayer subsidy the whole time.\n  To be clear, Section 716 does not cure all the risks posed by swaps. \nBut it was an important part of the effort to protect us from another \ncrisis. Along with the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau and the Merkley-Levin provisions on proprietary trading and \nconflicts of interest, these reforms form the backbone of the Dodd-\nFrank Act's safeguards.\n  By repealing this provision, we would ignore the lessons of the last \nfinancial crisis and weaken Dodd-Frank's protections against the next \ncrisis.\n  American families and businesses deserve better than this. If there \nare provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that need to be improved or \nreformed, the appropriate Senate committees should review, evaluate, \nand modify them. They should be given time on the Senate floor for \nfurther review and improvement. The proponents of this legislation \nshould explain why they think that deregulating swaps--before we ever \nstarted re-regulating them--is the right course of action. They should \nexplain why taxpayers should run the risk of bailing out risky swaps \ntrades gone bad. They should explain why, despite the loss of millions \nof jobs and trillions of dollars the last time Congress deregulated \nderivatives, this time will be different. A legislative vehicle is the \nright place for considering these issues, not an urgent appropriations \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6532-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6532-S6535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n\n                            Saxby Chambliss\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as the current session of Congress comes to \na close it is our custom to take a moment to express our appreciation \nfor the service of our colleagues who are retiring and will not be with \nus when the next session begins in January. We will miss them all. Over \nthe years their experience and insights on a number of issues have been \na very valuable part of our debates and deliberations.\n  I know I will especially miss Saxby Chambliss. His work here on the \nfloor and in his committee assignments has played an important role in \nour consideration of a number of issues over the years. Simply put, he \nhas been a great champion for conservative causes during his service in \nthe House and Senate and he has made a difference for his constituents \nin many, many ways. He is a man of principle and he has a great gift \nfor expressing his viewpoint in a thoughtful, clear and interesting \nmanner. He is so persuasive, in fact, that even if you disagree with \nhim he makes you take a moment to reconsider your position just to be \nsure you have not missed something.\n  Before he began his years of public service to the people of Georgia, \nSaxby proved to be the kind of individual who would have been a success \nat just about anything he decided to pursue. Fortunately, the path he \nchose to follow in his life brought him to the Nation's capital to \nrepresent Georgia--first in the House of Representatives and later in \nthe Senate.\n  Saxby served four terms in the House. It was a challenge that he \nenjoyed because it gave him a chance to sit on the committees that were \ntaking a closer look at our intelligence organizations to be certain \nthey would be ready to face any future threats to our national \nsecurity. Georgia was proud to see that they had elected someone to \nCongress who was hard not to notice. He did such a good job, in fact, \nhe was encouraged to run for the Senate.\n  When he arrived in this chamber, he had already established himself \nas one\n\n[[Page S6533]]\n\nof our leading conservative voices. That did not surprise any of us. He \nhas a calm, even way of expressing himself and articulating how his \nprinciples play out in whatever issue we have before us.\n  One great attribute that Saxby brought with him to his work in the \nCongress was his willingness to work with people who did not always \nagree with him. He knew there would come a time when they would agree \nwith him on something no matter how many times they had disagreed in \nthe past. When the situation presented itself that was what he would \nfocus on.\n  Simply put, Saxby believes very strongly in making progress and \ngetting results. He is not all that concerned about who gets credit for \nit. As the old adage reminds us, for Saxby, it is all about leaving \nthings a little better at the end of the day today than they were \nyesterday.\n  Over the years Saxby has always found a way to make progress no \nmatter how rough the road seemed to be. It has been one of the guiding \nprinciples behind Saxby's 20 years of service. His commitment to moving \nforward has enabled him to leave his mark in Georgia and throughout \nmuch of the United States.\n  Now that this chapter of Saxby's life has come to a close, I am not \nsure what he has planned for his next great adventure. He just does not \nstrike me as someone who will be content to sit on the sidelines. I am \nsure we will be hearing from him from time to time with some words of \nencouragement and support--and a suggestion or two. In fact, I am \nlooking forward to it.\n  Saxby, thank you for your service in the House and the Senate. In \nyour 20 years of service in the House and the Senate you have not only \nbeen a witness to the history of your home State of Georgia and our \nNation, you have helped to write it. Because of you the Nation is \nstronger, safer and more secure. Yours is a record of leadership of \nwhich you should be very proud.\n  Diana joins in sending our best wishes to you. From one Sigma Chi \nbrother to another, you have made a difference because you have always \nled the best way--by example. What others are content to talk about you \nhave stepped up to do the work needed to get the job done and because \nof that you have been able to make a difference--an important and long \nlasting one.\n\n\n                              Mike Johanns\n\n  Mr. President, as the current session of Congress comes to a close it \nis our tradition to take a moment to express our appreciation for the \nfaithful service of those of our colleagues who will be returning home \nat the end of the year. We appreciate their hard work and great service \non behalf of their home States and our Nation. We will miss them and \nthe thoughtful suggestions and good ideas they have brought to our \ndeliberations on the issues before us.\n  The word ``service'' brings to mind one of our retiring colleagues, \nMike Johanns. Mike has followed a path that has brought him from his \nservice as the Mayor of Lincoln, to his post as the Governor of \nNebraska, on to serve in the President's Cabinet as Secretary of \nAgriculture and then on to the floor of the United States Senate. He \nhas made important contributions at each post and now, as he has \ndecided with the support and guidance of his family, ``it is time to \nclose this chapter in his life.''\n  As a former mayor myself I have a great deal of regard for Mike and \nhis commitment to the people that he has served for many, many years. \nHe has a great understanding of his home State of Nebraska and the \nworkings of its State and local government. He understands the \nchallenges that face his home State in the present, and the hopes and \ndreams of the people of Nebraska for the future.\n  It did not take long to discover that Mike is a workhorse, not a \nshowhorse. He is not someone to land on a weekend talk show every week \ntalking about what needs to be done--he would rather be in committee or \non the floor every day doing it. In everything he did Mike always \nbrought along an abundance of Nebraska common sense. He used that \nspecial gift of his and his varied background as a starting point for \nfinding common ground and a workable solution on a number of issues \nthat would be acceptable to all.\n  During his service in the Senate it has been good to have a neighbor \nto work with who understands agriculture and our rural way of life. He \nhas been a great help in making the case clear to the Congress about \nthe difference between living on a farm and living in a big city or \ntown.\n  That is why I will not be the only one who will miss him. Our rural \ncommunities in the West will miss his ability to understand the \nproblems of rural America and what should be done to address them.\n  Mike has also been one to focus on the money side of each issue that \ncame to the Senate. He knows how important it is for us to get a handle \non our Nation's finances to ensure that our children and grandchildren \nwill not have to clean up the financial mess we are going to leave them \nif we are not careful. Mike has said that our failure to act will cause \nour financial problems to appear sooner than we might think.\n  I am sorry to see Mike go when there is so much to be done that could \nuse his understanding not only of the issues, but from his experience, \nthe impact they will have on the local, State and national level.\n  Still we know where to find him whenever we could use some of his \nNebraska-rooted common sense. Thanks, Mike, for your service to the \nState of Nebraska and to our Nation. You can be proud of what you \nhelped to accomplish and the seeds you planted that will lead to more \naccomplishments in the years to come.\n  Thanks for your leadership and thanks for your friendship, too. Diana \njoins in sending our best wishes to you and our appreciation for all \nyou have done. Please keep in touch with us. We will always be pleased \nto hear from you.\n\n\n                               Carl Levin\n\n  Mr. President, once again, as is our tradition here in the Senate, we \ntake a moment to express our appreciation for the service of those \nMembers who will be retiring at the end of the year. We will miss them, \ntheir good ideas and thoughtful suggestions, and their concern and \nactive involvement in the challenges facing our Nation in a number of \nareas.\n  It is hard to mention the word ``service'' and not have Carl Levin \ncome to mind. As a former local official myself, I have a great deal of \nrespect and regard for all those who have worked their way up from the \nlocal level to the Senate.\n  For Carl the great adventure of his political life began with his \nservice on the Detroit City Council. During his 8 years on the council \nCarl probably had enough run-ins with the Federal bureaucracy that he \ndecided he had to do something about it. For him that meant a run for \nthe Senate.\n  Carl's election and his subsequent service in the Senate have shown \nhim to be quite an effective legislator and a force for the positions \nhe has taken on a long list of issues. He has been a Member of the \nSenate since 1979 and he has hit a number of milestones since then that \nreflect the length and production of his service.\n  It is important to emphasize that Carl's service in the Senate has \nnever been about longevity, it is been about results. That is why he \nhas been a part of so many issues that needed someone with his talents, \nskills and abilities to help move them through. Such an issue has been \nhis great support for our Nation's military and our veterans.\n  Carl has been working for the benefit of those who have served in our \nArmed Forces since he first walked in the door of the Senate. \nDetermined that they reap the benefits they have earned with their \nservice, Carl joined the Armed Services Committee to ensure our \nmilitary and our veterans were getting what they deserved and required \nboth during and after their service.\n  That is one of the main reasons why he is currently serving as the \nChairman of our Armed Services Committee. He wanted to make a \ndifference for those who were sacrificing so much to serve in our \nNation's military. I don't think our servicemen and women--and our \nNation's veterans--have ever had a better friend than Carl Levin.\n  Now he is closing the chapter of this great adventure of his life. \nWith his service he has made a difference in more ways than I could \never hope to mention in my brief remarks. In the process Carl has \ntouched more lives for the better than we will ever know with his \ncommitment to the day-to-day\n\n[[Page S6534]]\n\nissues that affect us all--like education, the environment and health \ncare. He has had an impact on his home State and our Nation that will \nbe felt for a long time to come.\n  Thank you, Carl, for your service in the Senate. I know I join with \nthe people of Michigan in expressing our appreciation to you for \ndedicating so much of your life to making our Nation a better place for \nus all to live. That is why your constituents have always been there to \nexpress their appreciation of your work here in the Senate with their \nvotes. That is also why no other Senator has ever represented Michigan \nas long as you have.\n  Diana joins in sending our best wishes to you for all you have \naccomplished and for your close and personal attention to the needs of \nour Armed Forces and the concerns of our veterans. Thanks, too, for \nyour friendship. We will miss you, but I am certain we will be in \ntouch.\n\n\n                               Tom Harkin\n\n  Mr. President, it is hard to believe how quickly this session of \nCongress has come to an end. Before that final gavel brings it to a \nclose, however, it is good to have this time to express our \nappreciation for the service of those Members who will be retiring at \nthe end of the year. They all have a lot to be proud of--from their \nfirst speech here on the floor to their representation of their State \nover the years.\n  Those words can not help but bring to mind Tom Harkin. I have had a \nchance to come to know him and work with him as the Chairman of the \nhealth committee. I have been very impressed with his dedication to his \nwork and his determination to make a difference for the people who \nvoted to hire him on for the job--and all Americans in all of the \nStates.\n  I think one of the reasons why we were able to work together has to \ndo with his Wyoming background. Tom spent some of the best years of his \nlife in Rock Springs and I can not help but think that his time there \nmade a big difference in his life.\n  Tom has quite a remarkable record of service to the people of Iowa \nand it is clear they feel the same about him. They have sent him back \nto the Senate to serve as their representative for five terms in the \nHouse and five terms in the Senate. During his service in the Senate I \nappreciated having the opportunity to work with him as the ranking \nmember of the committee. In addition, the leadership he has provided \nthe committee as chairman has enabled him to take an active role on \nissues that will have an impact on his home State and the rest of the \ncountry for many years to come.\n  If I were to name just a few of the issues on which Tom has made a \ndifference I would begin with his work on behalf of those living with \ndisabilities that resulted in the passage of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. Tom's groundbreaking legislation was written to help \nensure all Americans would have an opportunity to lead more fulfilling \nand productive lives. In the days to come, his work on this issue will \ncontinue to provide the support that will help those living with \ndisabilities to work toward their goals in life--and achieve them.\n  I also wanted to point out his work with our education system. Tom \nunderstands the importance of a good education and the difference it \nmakes in young lives--today and tomorrow. Thanks to his hard work and \ndetermination students of all ages have a new appreciation for the fact \nthat an education consists of more than just a few years in a \nclassroom--it is a lifelong adventure, a journey that never ends \nbecause there is always something new to learn, some new skill that \nwill make someone a more valuable member of the workforce.\n  I am sure he has heard it before but it is pretty clear that Tom \nHarkin is Iowa, through and through. He has devoted so many years of \nhis life to the people of his State and they are greatly appreciative \nof his efforts--and the results he has been able to achieve.\n  Now, as Tom has made clear, it is time for someone else to step up to \nthe plate and continue the work he has begun on so many issues. There \nis no question that you will be a difficult act to follow. For all \nthose years Tom's heart and soul has been in Iowa while his mind and \nhis focus has been in the nation's capital, working to make Iowa a \nbetter place to live.\n  Now Tom's remarkable career in the House and the Senate has come to a \nclose and this chapter of his great adventure of serving the people of \nIowa here in Congress has concluded. While we did not always agree on \nthe best way to get things done we always agreed that we needed to \nfocus on what we could do to have the greatest impact on the lives of \nAmericans all across the country. Fortunately, I think we succeeded in \nmany ways and Tom will be remembered for those positive results--and so \nmany more.\n  One last Tom Harkin memory has to do with his popcorn tradition. I \nknow I am not the only one who hopes it will continue. I do not think a \nsingle visitor to your office or that section of the building will ever \nforget the wonderful aroma your Iowa popcorn sent all around the area. \nFor visitors from back home it must have been a touch that made them \nfeel right at home. It was just more proof that you never lost sight of \nthe people back home and they loved you for that.\n  Thank you, Tom Harkin, for all you have brought to the House and the \nSenate over the years. You have made it clear what the people of Iowa \nexpect from their government and what you were working so hard to \nachieve for them. Thank you for your service, thank you for your \ndedication to making our Nation a better place to live and most of all, \nthank you for your friendship. You have not only been a witness to the \nhistory of your State and our country, you have helped to write each \nchapter over the years. In the days to come your achievements will \ncontinue to inspire the next generation of our leaders who will want to \ndo what you have done. I am sure they can count on you for your \ninsights, suggestions and advice. Diana joins in sending our best \nwishes to you.\n\n\n                               Mark Pryor\n\n  Mr. President, it is one of the Senate's great traditions at the \nclose of each session of Congress to take a moment to note the service \nof those of our colleagues who be leaving the Senate at the end of the \nyear. It is a time for us to express our appreciation to our fellow \nSenators for their service and share what we have learned from them as \nwe worked together to make a difference in our states and in our \nnation.\n  I have often thought that Mark has one great overriding rule that has \nguided him in his work in the Senate, ``Is this what the people of \nArkansas sent me here to do?'' More often than not the answer to that \nquestion has helped him to develop a strategy to get things done that \nwere designed to make his home State and our nation better places to \nlive.\n  Ask just about any one of us here in the Senate what has made Mark \nPryor such an effective legislator and you will get the same answer--\nbipartisanship. In fact, he was so good at it, we might need to come up \nwith a different word to explain his strategy, something like Pryor-\nitize. For Mark, the best way to get things done was to get everyone \ninvolved--all parties, all sides of an issue, and representatives of \nevery point in between--together and then take the best of what \neveryone had to offer to form a coalition that would bring his \nlegislative effort to a successful conclusion.\n  That is why both parties would often try to recruit him for their \nlegislative projects. Each party knew he had a great ability to \npersuade that would help to bring other members together to support \ntheir efforts.\n  I have often said that serving in the Senate is a great adventure. If \nit were anything else, it would be too much like work and too hard a \njob to take on. Because it is an adventure it is something more--it is \na chance to take on the greatest challenge there is, leaving the world \na better place than we found it when we first walked through the doors \nof the Senate, and find new, creative, and inventive ways to make it \nhappen.\n  As he closes this chapter of his life, his Senate adventure, Mark can \nbe very proud of his efforts, and his successes over the years. He has \na great deal to be proud of and I hope it brings him the satisfaction \nthat comes from knowing he has taken on a difficult job and done it \nwell.\n  I know I will miss seeing Mark around campus here in Washington, DC. \nI will miss his willingness to help on those tough challenging issues \nwe always seen to have before us. I will also miss his words of faith \nand determination that he would share with us during our prayer \nbreakfasts.\n\n[[Page S6535]]\n\n  I hope you will keep in touch with us in the days to come with news \nof your next great adventure in life. Thank you for your service to our \ncountry, thank you for your focus on making Arkansas and our nation \nbetter places to live, and, most of all, thank you for your friendship. \nGood luck in all your future endeavors. God bless.\n\n\n                              Tim Johnson\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my friend and \ncolleague from South Dakota, Senator Tim Johnson, who is retiring at \nend of this year. Tim has an impressively long career in public \nservice, representing his home State of South Dakota in Congress for \nthe last 28 years.\n  Tim is often described as ``a work horse, not a show horse,'' and \nwith good reason. His values, passion and work ethic are reflected in \nthe projects he has championed and the constituent services he has \nprovided for the people of South Dakota. Following his AVM in 2006, \nSenator Johnson came into the national spotlight which he so seldom \nsought. All were inspired by his perseverance and dedication to the \npeople of South Dakota to return to do the work he loves, and the \nSenate has been better for it.\n  As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Tim \nchampioned important water projects to bring clean drinking water to \nrural communities and Indian reservations, pressed for the development \nof renewable fuels, and supported efforts to build vital infrastructure \nthroughout rural America. Through his position on the Appropriations \nCommittee, he fought to see these efforts through from planning to \ncompletion.\n  Farmers and ranchers throughout his State could count on Tim to be a \nstrong voice for agriculture, advancing their priorities in numerous \nfarm bills. His leadership on country of origin labeling, COOL, laid \nimportant groundwork to support our Nation's producers and ensure \nconsumers know where their food comes from--a fight that continues \ntoday.\n  Tim has also been a champion for veterans, working to improve the \nbenefits they are owed and connecting South Dakota veterans with \nsupport and services in their communities. He was able to secure \nadvanced appropriations for the Veterans Administration, providing \nbudget certainty and ensuring access to health care for those who have \nso bravely served their country.\n  Tim has a strong relationship with the tribes in South Dakota and is \nconsidered a steadfast and valued friend in Indian Country. He has \ntirelessly pressed for the Federal Government to meet its treaty and \ntrust responsibilities. While significant challenges remain, Tim \nJohnson's legacy as an advocate for Native American issues has improved \nthe quality of life on many reservations. This commitment will be \nmissed both in the Senate and on the Indian Affairs Committee.\n  Senator Johnson brought his passion for rural and Native American \nissues to the Senate Banking Committee. Under his chairmanship, the \nwork of the committee highlighted the often-overlooked needs in these \ncommunities--and he was a champion during our efforts on housing \nfinance reform to make sure they could receive the resources they so \ndesperately need. Strengthening small community banks, improving \nhousing, and reauthorizing critical highway and transit programs are \njust a few of the initiatives Chairman Johnson undertook, and it was a \npleasure working under his leadership.\n  Throughout all of these accomplishments, accolades, and challenges, \nTim has remained true to his roots. He has never taken his public \nservice for granted and has always considered it a privilege to serve \nthe people of South Dakota. The impact of his work during his time in \nCongress will be seen in communities throughout his State for years to \ncome, and he has certainly left his mark on South Dakota politics. I \nwish him the very best as he and his wife Barbara embark on this new \nchapter and get to enjoy more time with their family back in South \nDakota.\n\n\n                              Mike Johanns\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to honor my colleague from Nebraska, \nSenator Mike Johanns, who is retiring from the Senate at the end of \nthis year. Senator Johanns has been a friend since I started in the \nSenate, and I appreciate his willingness to work with me towards our \nshared goals. He is one of only two current Senators to have served as \na Governor and cabinet Secretary, providing him with a tremendous \namount of wisdom on how to get things done. It is his incredible \nknowledge and strong Midwestern work ethic that I admire most about \nhim.\n  For more than 30 years, Senator Johanns has been a strong voice for \nthe people of Nebraska. His first act in public service was in 1983 as \na County Board member in Lancaster County. He later went on to serve as \nboth Councilman and Mayor of Lincoln. He would eventually become \nGovernor of Nebraska and Secretary of Agriculture under President \nGeorge W. Bush. Senator Johanns set no limits to his potential; readily \nserving in any capacity he could to make our great Nation a better \nplace.\n  Senator Johanns and I serve together on the Agriculture Committee and \nI greatly admired the thoughtfulness and expertise he brought to the \nnegotiations on the Farm Bill. His knowledge as a former Agriculture \nSecretary was unmatched and ensured many improvements were made \nthroughout the debate. Senator Johanns never forgot about our farmers \nand always kept his eye on providing them with the best possible \noutcome he could.\n  We also had the privilege of working together on the Banking and \nHousing Committee. He and I worked together with a bipartisan group of \ncommittee members to draft and advance legislation reforming the \nhousing finance system to protect the American taxpayer from another \nbailout and to guarantee that another housing crisis does not happen \nagain. Once again, his voice on behalf of rural America during these \ntalks was critical and something that I greatly appreciated.\n  Senator Johanns has never been about taking credit or seeking the \nspotlight. He maintained a strong, hard work ethic throughout his time \nin the Senate and was one who was willing to cross the aisle to get \nthings done. The American people expect that of their representatives, \nand Senator Johanns met those expectations on behalf of Nebraska.\n  I will miss having him as my colleague in the Senate, but I also know \nthat his wife and family will enjoy the free time they will have with \nhim. I wish him happiness and success in the next chapter of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6535-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6535-S6536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL GAMEL-McCORMICK\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as I approach the end of my Senate career, \nI cannot help but reflect on the role that my tremendous staff members \nhave played in advancing my policy goals and, indeed, advancing the \nimportant work the American people over the years. I have been blessed \nto have worked with truly remarkable individuals who have worked \ntirelessly to promote initiatives that will improve the lives of \nordinary Americans.\n  Among my own legislative and policy priorities over the years, none \nhas been greater for me than advancing the rights of persons with \ndisabilities. I am proud and honored to have been the chief Senate \nsponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the last of the great \ncivil rights laws of the 20th century--one that has correctly been \ncalled the Emancipation Proclamation for persons with disabilities. \nThat legislation sought, once and for all, to fully enfranchise people \nwith disabilities and to fully integrate them into the fabric of \nAmerican life, guided by four great principles--equal opportunity, full \nparticipation, independent living, and economic sufficiency. Over the \nlast quarter century, that legislation has resulted in a quantum leap \nforward in the civil rights and daily quality of life of millions of \nAmericans with disabilities.\n  However, even with that quantum leap forward, much work remains to be \ndone to advance the rights of people with disabilities both in the \nUnited States and around the world. And over the last several years, no \none has worked harder to advance this unfinished agenda of disabilities \nrights than Michael Gamel-McCormick, who served on the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee as my lead K-12 staffer \nthrough the markup of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and \nsubsequently as a team leader on disability policy.\n  Throughout his career, Michael has worked to improve the lives of \nchildren\n\n[[Page S6536]]\n\nand other people with disabilities. He came to the HELP Committee from \nthe University of Delaware, where he was dean of the College of \nEducation and Human Development and where he had previously served as a \ndepartmental chair and director of the Center for Disability Studies. \nPrior to that, Michael served, variously, as director of an early \nintervention program in West Virginia, director of children's services \nat an urban community services agency, and as a preschool and \nkindergarten teacher. Michael also consulted worldwide in helping other \ncountries to establish their own systems to support persons with \ndisabilities and to expand early learning opportunities.\n  Michael's deep experience and knowledge was evident as soon as he \narrived at the HELP Committee. Immediately, Michael became an integral \nand trusted member of my staff. His initial work on the committee was \nas an education policy advisor, lead staffer on K-12 education, and an \nexpert on the intersection of education and inequality. His expertise \nand leadership were critical in crafting and passing in committee the \nStrengthening America's Schools Act. As an education policy adviser, \nMichael was also deeply involved in shaping policies to strengthen the \neducation of children with disabilities.\n  After serving as a senior education advisor, Michael assumed the role \nof my chief disability policy advisor, spearheading a number of \nimportant initiatives, including two important committee reports on \npersons with disabilities. The first report, on the continued use of \nseclusions and restraints in our schools, exposed the inappropriate and \noften dangerous use of physical restraints on and unsupervised \nexclusion of many children, especially children with disabilities, in \nU.S. schools. That report was accompanied by important legislation to \nfinally prohibit these outdated and ineffective measures. The second \nreport, ``Fulfilling the Promise: Overcoming Persistent Barriers to \nEconomic Self-Sufficiency for People with Disabilities,'' investigated \nthe barriers that people with disabilities face as they seek to rise \nout of poverty and enter the middle class. This report found that \nliving with a disability is both economically and socially costly, and \nthat significant barriers--especially logistical barriers and \ndiscrimination--continue to stand in the way of the economic security \nof people with disabilities. Specifically, the report said this:\n\n       Twenty-four years ago, Congress passed the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act. We have been successful at meeting many of \n     the goals of the ADA. We have increased the accessibility of \n     our buildings, our streets, even our parks, beaches and \n     recreation areas. And we've made our books and TVs, \n     telephones and computers more accessible as well. And for \n     many Americans with disabilities, our workplaces have become \n     more accessible as well.\n       But far too few people with disabilities are in the \n     workforce! The unemployment rate for people with disabilities \n     is 12.8 percent, more than double the six percent \n     unemployment rate for people without disabilities. Of the \n     almost 29 million people with disabilities over 16 years of \n     age, less than 20 percent participate in the workforce \n     compared with nearly 70 percent of those without a \n     disability.\n\n  Not content to identify a problem, Michael also seeks to solve them. \nHis most enduring legacy as my disability policy director will be his \nwork to promote the employment of persons with disabilities through the \nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, which was signed into law \nearlier this year. That law will ensure that young people with \ndisabilities get the experiences they need to succeed in work settings. \nTo obtain those experiences, the bill requires State vocational \nrehabilitation programs to work hand-in-hand with local secondary \nschools. The bill also ensures that employers will have the information \nnecessary to recruit, hire, and retain people with disabilities.\n  These efforts will directly address the high unemployment rate among \npeople with disabilities, smooth the transition of young people with \ndisabilities into the competitive integrated workforce, and help \nemployers to support their employees with disabilities. I am especially \nproud of these provisions. And I am very grateful to Michael, who \nsuccessfully endeavored to enact them in the face of long odds.\n  I had the good fortune to travel with Michael to China earlier this \nyear, where we sought to identify opportunities for international \ncooperation on disability policy and to work with the Chinese \nGovernment to strengthen its own policies and programs to assist and \nempower the millions persons with disabilities in that country. On the \ntrip, not only was Michael incredibly helpful and knowledgeable, but he \nalso proved to be a good humored and indefatigable travel partner.\n  Last and certainly not least, I want to salute Michael's heroic \nefforts over the past year to advance the Convention on the Rights of \nPersons with Disabilities. The CRPD, as it is known in shorthand, is a \nUnited Nation's treaty modeled after our own Americans with \nDisabilities Act, with a goal of exporting the same advances enjoyed by \npersons with disabilities in the United States to countries around the \nworld. The United States has always been a city on a hill when it comes \nto disability policy, and the CRPD offers an opportunity for us to play \na more robust leadership role in advancing disability rights across the \nglobe. Unfortunately, despite broad support for the CRPD among business \nleaders, faith leaders, and in the disability policy community, the \nCRPD ran up against significant and, I might add, spurious opposition \nhere in the Senate. In fact, after failing to be ratified in the 112th \nCongress, the treaty was all but declared dead.\n  However, at my urging and direction, Michael worked tirelessly to \nrevive the moribund treaty, reaching out to Republicans, enlisting the \nassistance of business interests and activating grassroots networks \naround the country in support of the treaty. At the end of the day, the \nSenate was still not able to overcome the misinformed objections of a \nnumber of Senators who blocked consideration of the treaty. But \nMichael's efforts to resurrect and advance the treaty in the face of \ndaunting odds were remarkable. Thanks to Michael's work, we came closer \nthan ever before to passing the CRPD. I certainly haven't given up the \nfight to pass the CRPD, and I am grateful to Michael for all that he \ndid to advance the cause of global disability rights.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that Michael has enriched the lives of \ncountless individuals. Because of his work, young children have been \nexposed to the rich environments that they need for early learning. \nBecause of his work, young people with disabilities will receive the \nsupports and experiences they need to secure gainful employment. \nBecause of his work, school-aged children will receive developmentally \nappropriate discipline and direction rather than the cruelty of \nseclusion and physical restraints. And because of his work, countless \nindividuals with disabilities will work, live, laugh, and flourish in \ntheir communities alongside friends, colleagues, and neighbors.\n  This is a living legacy that Michael Gamel-McCormick deserves to be \nvery proud of. I am deeply grateful for his service to the committee, \nto the American people, and to me personally. And I wish him great \nsuccess in his future endeavors on behalf of people with disabilities \nhere in America and across the globe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6536-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6536-S6537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BETH STEIN\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in 1997, Beth Stein, a talented young \nwoman armed with a razor-sharp mind and relentless attention to detail, \narrived on Capitol Hill as counsel to a true American hero, U.S. \nSenator John Glenn. As his investigative counsel, Beth played a key \nrole in the inquiry into campaign finance abuses in the 1996 election. \nAnd she helped to lead investigations into other critical issues, \nincluding food safety, Medicare fraud, waste, and abuse, and the \nrelationship between thyroid cancer rates and exposure to nuclear \nfallout from Nevada testing in the 1940s. After working for Senator \nGlenn, Beth went on to serve as election counsel to Representative \nSteny Hoyer and as Judiciary Committee counsel to U.S. Senator Maria \nCantwell.\n  The work of a U.S. Senator is only as good as the staff that he or \nshe hires, and in 2004 I was fortunate to convince Beth to join my \nstaff, where she has served ever since. Throughout that time, she has \nserved in a number of different capacities, distinguishing herself in \neach and every one of them. I owe a debt of gratitude to so many of my \nstaff members across my career,\n\n[[Page S6537]]\n\nbut I would be remiss if I did not single out Beth for her especially \nmeritorious contributions to my office over the past decade.\n  Beth began her work in my office as counsel, providing excellent \nadvice on myriad constitutional and civil rights issues, among other \nthings. One of her most noteworthy accomplishments from this time \nrelated to the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, located not far from \nBurlington, IA. The history of the covert nuclear weapons program at \nthe IAAP is a fascinating one that I could recount for hours. Suffice \nit to say that for decades the men and women of the Iowa Ammunition \nPlant worked on a secret nuclear weapons program, handling highly \nradioactive materials with protective gear of only cotton gloves--\ngloves that were intended to protect the weapons material from contact \nwith humans, not to protect humans from contact with dangerous \nradioactive materials.\n  After my office helped to uncover the long history of dangerous \nworking conditions at the IAAP, we still had to address the needs of \nhundreds of men and women who were exposed to radioactive materials and \nto try and help them receive compensation and health care to deal with \nthe high rates of cancer and respiratory disease associated with their \nwork. For years we struggled with various Federal agencies. We tried to \nseek a legislative fix. We sought an administrative remedy. It was \nfinally under Beth's leadership that the men and women of the IAAP were \ndesignated a special exposure cohort, which made them eligible for \ncompensation and medical care to account for medical expenses and lost \nwages. It is not an exaggeration to say that, but for Beth's efforts, \nthe former workers of the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant might still be \nwaiting on the Federal Government to appropriately compensate them for \ntheir service to our nation.\n  So much did I value Beth's work that when she decided that she wanted \nto take a step back and spend more time with her kids, I convinced her \nnot to leave the payroll entirely but to stay on to work on special \nprojects. In that capacity, Beth played a critical role in one of my \nproudest achievements, the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments \nAct of 2008. This law was written in response to several Supreme Court \ndecisions narrowing the definition of disability under the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act. These narrow interpretations led to the denial \nof the ADA's protections for many individuals that Congress intended to \nprotect under the ADA. The ADAAA made a number of changes to restore \nthe intent of the ADA and to ensure that its protections were broadly \navailable to persons with disabilities. Though the ADAAA passed the \nSenate by unanimous consent, a fact that is a credit to the Senate, one \nshould not take from this the idea that it was easy. It required long \nnegotiations and difficult choices involving Congress, the \nadministration, disability rights organizations, and business \ninterests. Beth played a critical role in these negotiations, deftly \nmanaging both the politics and the policy. The result of her steady \nguiding hand is abundantly clear today: the ADA, as amended by the \nADAAA, continues its impact as one of the landmark civil rights laws of \nthe 20th century, the Emancipation Proclamation for Persons with \nDisabilities.\n  When I became chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions, one of my first acts was to establish an \ninvestigative unit to provide critical oversight and investigations \nwork. There was no question in my mind that Beth, with her \nrelentlessness, eye for detail, and penchant for sifting through \ndetritus to reveal the truth, was the person for the job. As my chief \ninvestigative counsel, she has delivered time and again, for example, \nuncovering labor abuses by government contractors that led to a White \nHouse Executive order clamping down on such abuses. Beth also played a \nkey role in producing HELP Committee reports on the abusive use of \nseclusions and restraints in our Nation's schools, on barriers that \nstand in the way of the economic security of persons with disabilities, \nand on the rapid growth of e-cigarettes and their marketing.\n  Most noteworthy was Beth's leadership of the HELP Committee's \ninvestigation of abuses in the for-profit sector of higher education. \nThis investigation spanned several years and culminated in the release \nof a multi-volume report detailing in remarkable detail the abuses by \nsome for-profit colleges--in particular, their misuse of taxpayer \nfunds, their poor educational outcomes, and the need for greater \nFederal oversight of these schools. This investigation was monumental \nboth in its scale and in its level of detail. Beth oversaw every aspect \nof this very delicate investigation, which resulted in much greater \nscrutiny of the for-profit industry and which also put the \ninvestigations arm of the HELP Committee on the map.\n  About a year ago, I asked Beth to return to my personal office to \nserve as legislative director. In that capacity, she has done yeoman's \nwork managing the legislative staff, helping in the unenviable job of \nclosing our Senate office, and continuing to provide the excellent \ncounsel that had made her indispensable for the past decade. And she \nhas done all of this while continuing in her role as chief \ninvestigations counsel for the HELP Committee.\n  Mr. President, when I was growing up, my parents didn't talk \npolitics. We didn't know politicians. But we knew this: When my family \nhit rock bottom in the late years of the Depression, with my father out \nof work and with no way to provide for his family, the government gave \nus a hand up. Dad got a postcard in the mail notifying him to report \nfor employment with the Work Projects Administration, the WPA. Dad \nalways said that Franklin Roosevelt gave him a job. That opportunity \ngave my father dignity and enough money to put food on the table, and, \nmaybe most important of all, it gave him hope.\n  As a proud Midwestern progressive, I have fought to give opportunity \nand hope to those who truly need it and deserve it, including working \nfamilies seeking affordable health care and childcare, family farmers \nstruggling to stay on the land, young people paying for college, and \nseniors seeking financial security in their retirement years.\n  But I haven't done it alone. Every Senator stands on the foundation \nof his or her staff, and on my staff Beth Stein has been a rock-solid \ncornerstone in that foundation. For her counsel, intelligence, and \nexcellent work, and for helping me to be the best servant I can be to \nthe people of Iowa and the United States, for working alongside me to \ndo our best to give people hope, I extend my deepest gratitude to my \ncounselor and friend Beth Stein.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6537-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6537-S6538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MILDRED OTERO\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President. As a boy growing up in rural Cumming, IA, \npopulation 150, I could never have imagined that I would one day serve \nin Congress. My father had a sixth-grade education. He spent most of \nhis life working in coal mines, and all he had to show for it was a \ncase of black lung disease. My mother was an immigrant, raising six \nkids in our little two-bedroom house. My parents did not talk politics. \nWe did not know politicians. But we knew this: When my family hit rock \nbottom in the late years of the Depression, with my father out of work \nand with no way to provide for his family, the government gave us a \nhand up. Dad got a postcard in the mail, notifying him to report for \nemployment with the Work Projects Administration, the WPA. Dad always \nsaid that Franklin Roosevelt gave him a job. That opportunity gave my \nfather dignity, and enough money to put food on the table. Maybe most \nimportant of all, it gave him hope.\n  As a proud Midwestern progressive, my career has been guided by a \ndesire to give hope to those who truly need it and deserve it, to \nprovide a ladder of opportunity to working families seeking affordable \nhealth care and child care, family farmers struggling to stay on the \nland, and seniors seeking financial security in their retirement years. \nThere is no rung on the ladder of opportunity more important than \neducation, from rich early learning experiences, to college, and \nbeyond.\n  As I have endeavored to give people hope and to provide them with a \nladder of opportunity, I have not done it alone. I have been blessed to \nhave one of the most capable staffs on Capitol Hill. I rise today to \nextend a personal thanks to one of the best, my chief\n\n[[Page S6538]]\n\neducation counsel, Mildred Otero, who has stood stalwartly alongside me \nin my efforts to secure for every American a quality education from \ncradle to career.\n  Mildred came to Washington in 2003 as a Congressional Hispanic Caucus \nInstitute Public Policy Fellow, working for then-Senator Hillary \nClinton. Over the years, she has also worked at the Children's Defense \nFund, for Senator Jack Reed, and at the Department of State. Before \njoining the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Mildred \nserved as Senior Policy Officer at the Bill and Melinda Gates \nFoundation, helping to lead its Federal advocacy efforts for U.S. \nprograms.\n  When she arrived at the HELP Committee, she brought with her sterling \ncredentials, unmatched knowledge of education policy, and a reputation \nas a tough but fair negotiator. Most importantly, she brought with her \na commitment to children and a determination to confront the savage \ninequalities in America's public education system, and these priorities \nhave been the foundation of all the work that she does. For Mildred, \n``leave no child behind'' is not a slogan, it is an imperative, an \nobligation that motivates her every day to strive to do what is best \nfor the children of our country, especially those who are born into \ndisadvantage.\n  Mildred's commitment to our children and her determination to extend \na hand up to the disadvantaged have borne fruit in significant \naccomplishments since she joined the HELP Committee.\n  Foremost among these accomplishments was passage last summer of the \nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, a bill to update and \nstrengthen our Nation's job training programs. Frankly, to call \nenactment of this bill an accomplishment is a huge understatement. This \nis a bill that had been stalled for years due to one disagreement after \nanother, each seemingly as intractable as the next. But for Mildred, \nwhat others see as an intractable disagreement is just another \nchallenge to work through with creativity and diplomacy. Work through \nthem she did, one after another, until all that was left was final \npassage of the bill. It is testament to Mildred's determination, \ncreativity, and skill that the final bill passed by a vote of 95-3. As \na result of her work on this bill, millions of Americans will be able \nto upgrade their skills, obtain better jobs, and ultimately, better \ntheir lives and the economic security of their families.\n  Mildred and her team also successfully guided into the law \nimprovements to the Child Care and Development Block Grant, which \nallocates more than $5 billion annually and supports more than 1.5 \nmillion children across the country. The last reauthorization of this \nprogram took place 18 years ago, at a time when child care was \nprincipally seen as a work-support activity and only incidentally as \nsomething that could have a positive impact on the development of \nchildren. Today, backed up by impressive scientific research, we know \nthat this program can and should be much more. In addition to providing \nvital work support for parents, it should be a rich early-learning \nopportunity for children. These are exactly the kinds of improvements \nthat Mildred shepherded into law. Among other things, the bill requires \nStates to improve education and training requirements, strengthens \nlicensing requirements, and stipulates that States must demonstrate how \nthey are meeting the needs of the most vulnerable children, especially \nchildren with disabilities.\n  I would be remiss if I did not also mention Mildred's effort in the \nK-12 and higher education spaces. Last summer, the HELP Committee, \nunder Mildred's guidance, passed the Strengthening America's Schools \nAct of 2013. This bill, an update to the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, provided a framework to ensure that all children \ngraduate from high school with the knowledge and skills needed to \nsucceed in college and their careers. With Mildred's guidance, the \nStrengthening America's Schools Act focused greater attention on early \nchildhood, encouraged equity through fair distribution of resources, \nand maintained a laser focus on helping all children, but especially \ndisadvantaged children, to succeed in school.\n  Mildred brought similar energy to her efforts this year on the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act, efforts that culminated \nwith the introduction of the Higher Education Affordability Act. For \ngenerations, a college education has been the pathway to the middle \nclass, but new challenges are threatening that promise for many \nfamilies in Iowa and across the country. College affordability, \nskyrocketing student debt, transparency--these are high stakes issues \nfor students and families. The Higher Education Affordability Act seeks \nchanges to our system of higher education in order to make college more \naffordable and accessible, and to restore and strengthen the ladder of \nopportunity--a ladder that has been growing weaker and that is in need \nof repair.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said that ``life's most urgent and \npersistent question is: what are you doing for others?'' During her \ntenure as a senior counselor on the HELP Committee, Mildred has \nanswered that question in powerful ways, and in particular through her \ntireless efforts to bring greater equity to public education at all \nlevels. We respect her expertise, and we admire the strong moral voice \nthat she has brought to the Committee. I am deeply grateful to Mildred \nfor her superb leadership of the Committee's Education Office, and I \nwish her the very best in her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6538-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO DON HOUSE\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN.

That is why when he began his service as mayor he \nmet with all of the community's employees.\n  Don led a reorganization of the police department in an effort to \nserve the needs of the community more responsibly, including a \ncrackdown on drug dealers and drug manufacturers within the city. Don \nalso oversaw the completion of the Northeast Arkansas Water Authority \nproject, improving the water quality in Walnut Ridge.\n  In addition to serving as mayor, Don lived in Lawrence County most of \nhis life, owned House-Gregg Funeral Home--a local funeral home and \nfamily business, and held office in the Arkansas State House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I applaud Don for his outstanding achievements and success as city \nmayor. My staff and I have enjoyed working with Mayor House on the \nprojects important to Walnut Ridge. I am truly appreciative of his \ndedication, leadership, and eagerness to serve Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6538-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6538-S6539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING THE IDAHO FARM BUREAU FEDERATION\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the Idaho Farm \nBureau Federation's 75th year as an organization.\n  The Idaho Farm Bureau, which was started in 1939 in Murtaugh as an \norganization of farm and ranch families, has represented the interests \nof Idaho producers in addressing agriculture and natural resources \nissues. The organization is focused on ``formulating action to achieve \neducational improvement, economic opportunity, and social advancement \nand thereby, to promote the national well-being.''\n  Idaho is home to more than 25,000 farms and ranches. Farm families \nsupport our communities and are central to our economy and our State's \nculture. The pressures on these hard-working producers meeting the food \nneeds of a growing world population are increasing as the pressures on \nour natural resources increase. Consideration of how policy changes \naffect this bedrock is critical to long-term economic growth and the \nsuccess of our State and Nation.\n  From providing input on the farm bill, to transportation legislation \nand Federal regulation affecting the farm and ranch community, \nincluding Endangered Species Act concerns, the Idaho Farm Bureau has \nhelped ensure that Idaho producers' voice is heard in a broad array of \nlocal and Federal policy discussions. I have greatly valued\n\n[[Page S6539]]\n\nthe input of farm bureau leadership, staff and members. I look forward \nto continuing to work with this seasoned Idaho organization in shaping \nagriculture and natural resources policy to ensure that it best meets \nthe needs of Idaho producers.\n  Congratulation to the Idaho Farm Bureau and its membership on this \nsignificant milestone. I wish you continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6539-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO BENJAMIN CHARLES STEELE\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to honor Benjamin Charles \nSteele, a veteran of World War II.\n  On behalf of all Montanans and all Americans, I stand to say ``thank \nyou'' to Ben for his service to our Nation.\n  It is my honor to share the story of Ben's service in World War II, \nbecause no story of bravery--especially not one from our ``greatest \ngeneration''--should ever be forgotten.\n  Ben was born on November 11, 1917, in Roundup, MT. The son of \nranchers, Ben loved the outdoors. Sometimes he would sneak out of \nschool by pretending to go to the bathroom, but instead would jump on \nhis horse and head for the ranch.\n  Ben was 22 when he enlisted in the Army Air Corps in Missoula, MT on \nSeptember 9, 1940.\n  In September of 1941, Ben was assigned to serve in the Philippines.\n  Ben had barely arrived in country when the Army gave him a rifle and \ntold Ben ``now you're in the infantry.''\n  The Japanese attacked on December 8. A few weeks later, Ben's unit \nwas evacuated from Clark Field and ordered to the Bataan Peninsula. In \nJanuary 1942, Ben was sent to the front lines.\n  Three months later, the front lines collapsed. Soon after, Ben's unit \nwas captured and he and his fellow soldiers began the infamous Bataan \nDeath March.\n  Ben marched for 6 days and was fed only two cups of rice. The \nAmerican captives were tormented by the Japanese soldiers. They were \nforced to walk closely together, and if a prisoner stumbled, or worse, \nfell, they were bayoneted or shot and killed.\n  Ben was a prisoner for three and one-half years. During this time, at \ngreat risk to himself, he secretly made drawings of the torture and \ncruelty he and his fellow prisoners endured. On one construction \nproject, 324 prisoners started work beside Ben. By the end, Ben was one \nof only 50 surviving prisoners.\n  Ben then was sent to Japan where he did hard labor in the Japanese \nmines. He was liberated once the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, \nwith Ground Zero less than 80 miles from Ben's coal mine. When he was \nfreed, Ben had dysentery, pneumonia, malaria, blood poisoning and \nberiberi.\n  Ben was discharged from the U.S. Air Force on July 10, 1946. After \nbeginning his art career drawing on the concrete floor of a prison in \nthe Philippines, Ben pursued a formal art education. In 1955, he \nreceived a master's in art from the University of Denver.\n  Ben then taught art at Montana State University-Billings. To this \nday, he continues to recreate the images of his imprisonment through \ndrawings and paintings.\n  Ben was never ``officially'' assigned to the infantry; the military \njust handed him a weapon and told him to go fight--and he did. He \nfought for months before he was captured.\n  Ben is now 97 years old, living in a nursing home in Billings, MT, \nfighting his last battle--and still painting. Ben never requested any \nmedals or recognition for his brave and incredible service. A true \nWorld War II veteran, Ben feels he simply did the job he was sent to \nthe Philippines to do.\n  But today, it is my honor to honor Ben Steele's true heroism, \nsacrifice, and dedication to service by including his story in the \nCongressional Record.\n  Thank you, Ben.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6539-2", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:56 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 2759.

\n STATES GOVERNMENT OF EVENTS SURROUNDING THE MASS KILLINGS DURING 1965-\n                                   66\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 596\n\n       Whereas, on October 1, 1965, six Indonesian Army generals \n     were killed by military personnel, including members of \n     Indonesia's Presidential Guard, and these killings were \n     blamed on the Indonesian Communist Party and labeled an \n     ``attempted Communist coup d'etat'';\n       Whereas this alleged coup was used to justify the mass \n     killing of alleged supporters of the Indonesian Communist \n     Party, with estimates of the number of dead ranging from \n     500,000 to 1,000,000 killed;\n       Whereas the targeted individuals were predominantly unarmed \n     civilians, and often included members of trade unions, \n     intellectuals, teachers, ethnic Chinese, and those involved \n     in the women's movement;\n       Whereas these killings and the imprisonment of up to \n     1,000,000 targeted individuals were done without due process \n     of law;\n       Whereas the targeted individuals were subject to \n     extrajudicial execution, torture, rape, forced disappearance, \n     forced labor, and forced eviction;\n       Whereas the United States Central Intelligence Agency in a \n     1968 research study described the period as one of the worst \n     mass murders of the twentieth century;\n       Whereas the United States Government provided the \n     Indonesian Army with financial, military, and intelligence \n     support during the period of the mass killings, and did so \n     aware that such killings were taking place as recorded in \n     partially declassified documents in the Department of State \n     history, ``Foreign Relations of the United States'', \n     pertaining to this period;\n       Whereas, within months of military leader Suharto's \n     assumption of the presidency following the mass killing, the \n     United States Government began sending economic and military \n     support to Suharto's military regime, and played an \n     indispensable role in its consolidation of power;\n       Whereas aid to the Suharto government continued for more \n     than three decades, despite on-going crimes against humanity \n     committed by the Suharto government, including mass killing \n     and other gross violations of human rights during the \n     invasion and subsequent 24-year occupation of East Timor;\n       Whereas perpetrators of the 1965-66 mass killings have \n     largely lived with impunity, and the survivors and \n     descendants of the victims suffer continuing discrimination \n     economically and for decades had limited civil and political \n     rights, as noted in the 2012 Indonesia National Commission on \n     Human Rights report;\n       Whereas the United States Government has not yet fully \n     declassified all relevant documents concerning this time \n     period, and full disclosure could help bring historical \n     clarity to atrocities committed in Indonesia between 1965 and \n     1966;\n       Whereas the United States Government has in recent years \n     supported the declassification and release of documents in \n     support of truth and reconciliation efforts following periods \n     of violence in countries such as Chile and Brazil;\n       Whereas open dialogue about alleged past crimes against \n     humanity and past human rights violations is important for \n     continued efforts to reconcile populations of Indonesia and \n     to ensure a stable, sustainable peace that will benefit the \n     region and beyond;\n       Whereas, Indonesia has undergone a remarkable democratic \n     transition over the last two decades, and is the world's \n     third largest democracy with the largest Muslim population in \n     the world;\n       Whereas through free and fair elections, the people of \n     Indonesia have elected new leaders who now have the \n     opportunity to establish a culture of accountability in \n     partnership with the country's vibrant civil society, press, \n     academia, and human rights activists;\n       Whereas the relationship between the United States and \n     Indonesia is strong and involves many shared interests, as \n     reflected in the 2010 United States-Indonesia Comprehensive \n     Partnership, including democracy and civil society, \n     education, security, climate and environment, energy, and \n     trade and investment;\n       Whereas the economic relationship between the United States \n     and Indonesia is strong, with bilateral goods trade exceeding \n     $27,000,000,000 and with major United States companies making \n     significant long-term investments in Indonesia; and\n       Whereas strong relations between the United States and \n     Indonesia are mutually beneficial to both countries: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the mass murder in Indonesia in 1965-66;\n\n[[Page S6542]]\n\n       (2) expresses great concern about the lack of \n     accountability enjoyed by those who carried out crimes during \n     this period;\n       (3) urges political leaders in Indonesia to consider a \n     truth, justice, and reconciliation commission to address \n     alleged crimes against humanity and other human rights \n     violations, and to work to mend differences and animosity \n     that remain after the 1965-66 mass killings; and\n       (4) calls on the Department of State, the Department of \n     Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, and others involved \n     in developing and implementing policy towards Indonesia \n     during this time period to establish an interagency working \n     group to--\n       (A) locate, identify, inventory, recommend for \n     declassification, and make available to the public all \n     classified records and documents concerning the mass killings \n     of 1965 and1966, including records and documents pertaining \n     to covert operations in Indonesia from January 1, 1964 \n     through March 30, 1966;\n       (B) coordinate with Federal agencies and take such actions \n     as necessary to expedite the release of such records to the \n     public; and\n       (C) submit a report to Congress describing all such \n     records, the disposition of such records, and the activities \n     of the Interagency Group.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, our Nation and Indonesia \nenjoy a strong relationship, reflected in the U.S.-Indonesia \nComprehensive Partnership of 2010. This partnership is robust and \ngrowing. It serves both of our countries for bilateral, regional, and \nglobal cooperation. The election of President Widodo in July was a step \nforward--part of a great democratic tradition--over the past two \ndecades in Indonesia. We are working together for economic growth, for \nthe environment, and for our security.\n  This is progress--and to be encouraged. Indonesia has a major role to \nplay as a regional and global leader, but in that role it must be an \ninclusive democracy. Key to this is to address past human rights \nabuses--specifically the mass murders committed in 1965 to 1966. Next \nyear is the 50th anniversary of those killings.\n  I rise today, International Human Rights Day, to submit a resolution \nconcerning those events, which Indonesia's own Human Rights Commission \nhas labeled a crime against humanity. But let me be clear. This is not \na censure of the people of Indonesia or Indonesia's new government; it \nis an opportunity for justice and for reconciliation.\n  The events took place decades ago. The reasons behind them are \ncomplex, but that cannot justify the past or forgetting those who \nsuffered under it, nor can we ignore our own government's role during \nthat time.\n  My resolution proposes two things:\n  First, I urge Indonesia's new government to create a truth and \nreconciliation commission to address these crimes. Second, I urge our \nown government to establish an interagency working group and to release \nrelevant classified documents. We should make clear what was known to \nus, and we should make this information available.\n  It is a painful history to recall. On October 1, 1965, six Indonesian \nArmy generals were killed. According to scholars, these generals were \nkilled by military personnel, but their deaths were blamed on \nIndonesia's Communist Party, which was used to justify mass murders.\n  The next few months were horrific for the Indonesian people. The CIA \nhas called it one of the worst periods of mass murder in the 20th \ncentury. Hundreds of thousands were killed. Many others were \nimprisoned, tortured, raped, starved, and disappeared across the \ncountry. These individuals were targeted for their alleged association \nwith communism, but they came from all walks of life, including women's \ngroups, teachers, intellectuals, and others. Most were unarmed, and \nnone had due process of law.\n  The United States provided financial and military assistance during \nthis time and later, according to documents released by the State \nDepartment, and General Suharto consolidated his power, ruling from \n1967 to 1998.\n  Some may ask, why is this resolution needed? Why now? This is why. \nThe survivors and descendents of victims continue to be marginalized. \nMany of the killers continue to live with impunity. Very few Americans \nare aware of these historical events or our government's actions during \nthis time. These events demand our attention and resolution as we work \ntogether to build a strong Asia-Pacific partnership.\n  I am proud to serve on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. An \nimportant goal is the development of peaceful, stable democracies--\ndemocracies that provide security and hope to their own people and \neconomic opportunity for businesses in my State and across the United \nStates.\n  Indonesia is the world's third-largest democracy. Its population is \ndiverse. It has the largest Muslim majority population in the world. It \nhas faced many challenges and continues to move forward. A strong U.S.-\nIndonesia relationship benefits both of our countries.

Bush and passed Congress on a bipartisan vote in \n     2003, and remains the largest commitment in history by any \n     nation to combat a single disease;\n       Whereas, as of the end of September 2014, PEPFAR supported \n     treatment for 7,700,000 people, up from 1,700,000 in 2008, \n     and in 2012, PEPFAR supported the provision of antiretroviral \n     drugs to 750,000 pregnant women living with HIV to prevent \n     the transmission of HIV from mother to child during birth;\n       Whereas PEPFAR directly supported HIV testing and \n     counseling for more than 56,700,000 people in fiscal year \n     2014;\n       Whereas considerable progress has been made in the fight \n     against HIV/AIDS, with the number of new HIV infections \n     estimated at 2,100,000 in 2013, a 38 percent reduction since \n     2001, new HIV infections among children reduced to 240,000 in \n     2013, a reduction of 58 percent since 2001, and AIDS-related \n     deaths reduced to 1,500,000 in 2013, a 35 percent reduction \n     since 2005;\n       Whereas increased access to antiretroviral drugs is the \n     major contributor to the reduction in deaths from HIV/AIDS, \n     and HIV treatment reinforces prevention because it reduces, \n     by up to 96 percent, the chance the virus can be spread;\n       Whereas the World Health Organization (WHO) has revised its \n     guidelines for determining whether HIV positive individuals \n     are eligible for treatment, thereby increasing the number of \n     individuals eligible for treatment from about 15,900,000 to \n     28,600,000;\n       Whereas 13,600,000 people in low- and middle-income \n     countries had access to antiretroviral therapy as of June \n     2014;\n       Whereas 19,000,000 of the 35,000,000 people living with HIV \n     globally do not know their status, according to a 2014 UNAIDS \n     report;\n       Whereas, although sub-Saharan Africa remains the epicenter \n     of the epidemic with approximately 1,100,000 AIDS-related \n     deaths in 2013, there have also been successes, with an \n     approximate 33 percent decline in new HIV infections from \n     2005 to 2013 and a 39 percent decrease in the number of AIDS-\n     related deaths in sub-Saharan Africa between 2005 and 2013;\n       Whereas stigma, gender inequality, and lack of respect for \n     the rights of HIV positive individuals remain significant \n     barriers to access to services for those most at risk of HIV \n     infection;\n       Whereas President Barack Obama voiced commitment to \n     realizing the promise of an AIDS-free generation and his \n     belief that the\n\n[[Page S6543]]\n\n     goal was within reach in his February 2013 State of the Union \n     Address;\n       Whereas the international community is united in pursuit of \n     achieving the goal of an AIDS-free generation;\n       Whereas a UNAIDS 2014 report on the state of the global \n     epidemic assessed that AIDS could be ended as a public health \n     threat by 2030 if a fast-track response is taken and certain \n     targets are realized by 2020, and further noted that doing so \n     would avert nearly 28,000,000 new HIV infections and \n     21,000,000 AIDS-related deaths by 2030;\n       Whereas, during the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak of 2014, \n     countries with PEPFAR-strengthened lab capacity, human \n     capacity, and health facility capacity were able to contain \n     Ebola outbreaks;\n       Whereas, in August 2014, PEPFAR and the Children's \n     Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) launched an initiative to \n     double the total number of children receiving treatment over \n     the next two years in ten countries;\n       Whereas December 1 of each year is internationally \n     recognized as World AIDS Day; and\n       Whereas, in 2014, the theme for World AIDS Day \n     commemorations was ``Focus, Partner, Achieve: An AIDS-free \n     Generation'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of World AIDS Day, \n     including seeking to get to zero new HIV infections, zero \n     discrimination, and zero AIDS-related deaths;\n       (2) applauds the goals and approaches for achieving an \n     AIDS-free generation set forth in the PEPFAR Blueprint: \n     Creating an AIDS-free Generation, as well as the targets set \n     by United Nations member states in the 2011 United Nations \n     Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS;\n       (3) commends the dramatic progress in global AIDS programs \n     supported through the efforts of PEPFAR, the Global Fund to \n     Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and UNAIDS;\n       (4) urges, in order to ensure that an AIDS-free generation \n     is within reach, rapid action by all nations towards--\n       (A) full implementation of the Global Plan Towards the \n     Elimination of New HIV Infections Among Children by 2015 and \n     Keeping Their Mothers Alive to build on progress made to \n     date; and\n       (B) further expansion and scale-up of antiretroviral \n     treatment programs, including efforts to reduce disparities \n     and improve access for children to life-saving medications \n     such as getting antiretroviral HIV medication to the \n     2,000,000 children with HIV currently unable to access them;\n       (5) calls for scaling up treatment to reach all individuals \n     eligible for treatment under WHO guidelines;\n       (6) calls for greater focus on the HIV-related \n     vulnerabilities of women and girls, including those at risk \n     for or who have survived violence or faced discrimination as \n     a result of the disease, and urges more directed efforts to \n     ensure that they are connected to the information, care, \n     support, and treatment they require;\n       (7) supports efforts to ensure inclusive access to programs \n     and appropriate protections for all those most at risk of \n     HIV/AIDS and hardest to reach;\n       (8) encourages additional private-public partnerships to \n     research and develop better and more affordable tools for the \n     diagnosis, treatment, vaccination, and cure of HIV;\n       (9) supports continued leadership by the United States in \n     bilateral, multilateral, and private sector efforts to fight \n     HIV;\n       (10) stresses the importance of ensuring that HIV and AIDS \n     are central to the post-2015 United Nations development \n     agenda and of advocating for the inclusion of targets under \n     relevant goals towards achieving zero new HIV infections, \n     zero discrimination, and zero AIDS-related deaths;\n       (11) encourages and supports greater degrees of ownership \n     and shared responsibility by developing countries in order to \n     ensure sustainability of their domestic responses; and\n       (12) encourages other members of the international \n     community to sustain and scale up their support for and \n     financial contributions to efforts around the world to combat \n     HIV/AIDS.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6543-1", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 598--EXPRESSING CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILY OF ABDUL-\n RAHMAN PETER KASSIG AND CONDEMNING THE TERRORIST ACTS OF THE ISLAMIC \n                      STATE OF IRAQ AND THE LEVANT\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY (for himself and Mr. Coats) submitted the following \nresolution;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Audit the Pentagon Act of \n     2014''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Section 9 of Article I of the Constitution of the \n     United States requires all agencies of the Federal \n     Government, including the Department of Defense, to publish \n     ``a regular statement and account of the receipts and \n     expenditures of all public money''.\n       (2) Section 3515 of title 31, United States Code, requires \n     the agencies of the Federal Government, including the \n     Department of Defense, to present auditable financial \n     statements beginning not later than March 1, 1997. The \n     Department has not complied with this law.\n       (3) The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of \n     1996 (31 U.S.C. 3512 note) requires financial systems \n     acquired by the Federal Government, including the Department \n     of Defense, to be able to provide information to leaders to \n     manage and control the cost of Government. The Department has \n     not complied with this law.\n       (4) The financial management of the Department of Defense \n     has been on the ``High-Risk'' list of the Government \n     Accountability Office, which means that the Department is not \n     consistently able to ``control costs; ensure basic \n     accountability; anticipate future costs and claims on the \n     budget; measure performance; maintain funds control; [and] \n     prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse''.\n       (5) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2002 (Public Law 107-107) requires the Secretary of Defense \n     to report to Congress annually on the reliability of the \n     financial statements of the Department of Defense, to \n     minimize resources spent on producing unreliable financial \n     statements, and to use resources saved to improve financial \n     management policies, procedures, and internal controls.\n       (6) In 2005, the Department of Defense created a Financial \n     Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan, overseen by a \n     directorate within the office of the Under Secretary of \n     Defense (Comptroller), to improve Department business \n     processes with the goal of producing timely, reliable, and \n     accurate financial information that could generate an audit-\n     ready annual financial statement. In December 2005, that \n     directorate, known as the FIAR Directorate, issued the first \n     of a series of semiannual reports on the status of the \n     Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan.\n       (7) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2010 (Public Law 111-84) requires regular status reports on \n     the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan described \n     in paragraph (6), and codified as a statutory requirement the \n     goal of the Plan in ensuring that Department of Defense \n     financial statements are validated as ready for audit not \n     later than September 30, 2017. In addition, the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Public Law \n     112-239) requires that the statement of budgetary resources \n     of the Department of Defense be validated as ready for audit \n     by not later than September 30, 2014.\n       (8) At a September 2010 hearing of the Senate, the \n     Government Accountability Office stated that past \n     expenditures by the Department of Defense of $5,800,000,000 \n     to improve financial information, and billions of dollars \n     more of anticipated expenditures on new information \n     technology systems for that purpose, may not suffice to \n     achieve full audit readiness of the financial statement of \n     the Department. At that hearing, the Government \n     Accountability Office could not predict when the Department \n     would achieve full audit readiness of such statements.\n       (9) At a 2013 hearing of the Senate, Secretary of Defense \n     Chuck Hagel affirmed his commitment to audit-ready budget \n     statements for the Department of Defense by the end of 2014, \n     and stated that he ``will do everything he can to fulfill \n     this commitment''. At that hearing, Secretary Hagel noted \n     that auditable financial statements were essential to the \n     Department not only for improving the quality of its \n     financial information, but also for reassuring the public and \n     Congress that it is a good steward of public funds.\n\n     SEC. __03.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On April 23, 2014, representatives of the Palestinian \n     Liberation Organization and Hamas, a designated terrorist \n     organization, signed an agreement to form a government of \n     national consensus.\n       (2) On June 2, 2014, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas \n     announced a unity government as a result of the April 23, \n     2014, agreement.\n       (3) United States law requires that any Palestinian \n     government that ``includes Hamas as a member'', or over which \n     Hamas exercises ``undue influence'', only receive United \n     States assistance if certain certifications are made to \n     Congress.\n       (4) The President has taken the position that the current \n     Palestinian government does not include members of Hamas or \n     is influenced by Hamas and has thus not made the \n     certifications required under current law.\n       (5) The leadership of the Palestinian Authority has failed \n     to completely denounce and distance itself from Hamas' \n     campaign of terrorism against Israel.\n       (6) President Abbas has refused to dissolve the power-\n     sharing agreement with Hamas even as more than 2,300 rockets \n     have targeted Israel since July 2, 2014.\n       (7) President Abbas and other Palestinian Authority \n     officials have failed to condemn Hamas' extensive use of the \n     Palestinian people as human shields.\n       (8) The Israeli Defense Forces have gone to unprecedented \n     lengths for a modern military to limit civilian casualties.\n       (9) On July 23, 2014, the United Nations Human Rights \n     Council adopted a one-sided resolution criticizing Israel's \n     ongoing military operations in Gaza.\n       (10) The United Nations Human Rights Council has a long \n     history of taking anti-Israel actions while ignoring the \n     widespread and egregious human rights violations of many \n     other countries, including some of its own members.\n       (11) On July 16, 2014, officials of the United Nations \n     Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near \n     East (UNRWA) discovered 20 rockets in one of the \n     organization's schools in Gaza, before returning the weapons \n     to local Palestinian officials rather than dismantling them.\n       (12) On multiple occasions during the conflict in Gaza, \n     Hamas has used the facilities and the areas surrounding UNRWA \n     locations to store weapons, harbor their fighters, and \n     conduct attacks.\n\n     SEC. 1283.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON BENEFITS OF USING SIMULATORS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The use of technologies such as virtual reality and \n     modeling and simulation tools provides cutting-edge, cost-\n     effective training and technology development for members of \n     the Armed Forces.\n       (2) Leveraging such technologies is an especially relevant \n     supplement to live training given the future of declining \n     defense budgets.\n       (3) The implementation by the Air Force Agency for Modeling \n     and Simulation of virtual reality centers is part of a \n     coordinated effort to broaden the use of virtual training \n     methods.\n       (4) Those centers use of a variety of training tools that \n     give members of the Armed Forces and developers alike a \n     realistic training experience that contributes to improved \n     readiness and system effectiveness.\n       (5) Organizations like the United States Army Program \n     Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and \n     Instrumentation would benefit from increased utilization of \n     virtual reality and modeling and simulations tools.\n       (6) Modeling and simulation tools can provide powerful \n     planning and training capabilities to expose a member of the \n     Armed Forces to the complexities and uncertainties of combat \n     before ever leaving the member's home station. For example, \n     the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division \n     integrates the science of learning with performance-based \n     training focused on improving the performance of members of \n     the Army and Marine Corps and measures the effectiveness of \n     such training. The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems \n     Division continually engages members of the Army and Marine \n     Corps to understand challenges, solve problems, create new \n     capabilities, and provide essential support.\n       (7) The use of simulation training has yielded military \n     units that are better trained, more capable, and more \n     confident when compared to units that do not have access to \n     modern simulation training devices.\n       (8) Simulation training can be a cost-effective means for \n     units to improve combat readiness and tactical decisionmaking \n     skills and ultimately to save lives.\n       (9) The Department of Defense could meet the training \n     challenges of the future in a fiscally austere environment by \n     leveraging simulation training that uses simulators owned and \n     operated by the Federal Government combined with simulation \n     training services provided by universities and industry.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the use of simulators offers cost savings and provides \n     members of the Armed Forces exceptional preparation for \n     combat; and\n       (2) existing synergies between the Department of Defense \n     and entities in the private sector should be maintained and \n     cultivated to provide members of the Armed Forces with the \n     best simulation experience possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4021.

Res. 413, as \namended, with its preamble, as amended, as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 413\n\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the Holocaust, the United \n     Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the \n     Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide declaring \n     that genocide, whether committed in a time of peace or war, \n     is a crime under international law;\n       Whereas the United States was the first country to sign the \n     Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \n     Genocide, and the Senate voted to ratify the Convention on \n     the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide on \n     February 11, 1986;\n       Whereas, for approximately 100 days between April 7, 1994, \n     and July 1994, more than 800,000 civilians were killed in a \n     genocide in Rwanda that targeted members of the Tutsi, \n     moderate Hutu, and Twa populations, resulting in the horrific \n     deaths of nearly 70 percent of the Tutsi population living in \n     Rwanda;\n       Whereas the massacres of innocent Rwandan civilians were \n     premeditated and systematic attempts to eliminate the Tutsi \n     population by Hutu extremists, fueled by hatred and \n     incitement propagated by newspapers and radio;\n       Whereas in addition to systematic targeting of an ethnic \n     minority in Rwanda resulting in the mass slaughter of \n     innocent civilians, rape was also used as a weapon of war;\n       Whereas, despite the deployment of the United Nations \n     Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) in October 1993 \n     following the end of the Rwandan Civil War, its mandate was \n     insufficient to ensure the protection of large swathes of the \n     population, demonstrating the inability of the United Nations \n     to effectively respond to the unfolding genocide and stop or \n     mitigate its impact;\n       Whereas, on July 4, 1994, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, a \n     trained military group consisting of formerly exiled Tutsis, \n     began its takeover of the country, which resulted in an \n     ending of the genocide, though not a complete end to the \n     violence, including retribution;\n       Whereas, in October 1994, the International Criminal \n     Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) was established as the first \n     international tribunal with the mandate to prosecute the \n     crime of genocide and ultimately prosecuted 63 individuals \n     for war crimes, including genocide and crimes against \n     humanity as well as the first convictions for rape as a \n     weapon of war;\n       Whereas the United States Government supports initiatives \n     to ensure that victims of genocide and mass atrocities are \n     not forgotten, and has committed to work with international \n     partners to help prevent genocide and mass atrocities and \n     identify and support a range of actions to protect civilian \n     populations at risk;\n       Whereas, in July 2004, the Senate adopted Senate Concurrent \n     Resolution 133 and the House of Representatives adopted House \n     Concurrent Resolution 467, declaring that ``the atrocities \n     unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, are genocide'', and calling on \n     the United States Government and the international community \n     to take measures to address the situation immediately;\n       Whereas, in September 2004, the United States Government, \n     in testimony by Secretary of State Colin Powell before the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, declared the \n     ongoing conflict in Darfur, Sudan, a ``genocide'' perpetrated \n     by the government based in Khartoum against its own people \n     and affecting over 2,400,000 people in Sudan, including an \n     estimated 200,000 fatalities;\n       Whereas, in September 2005, the United States joined other \n     members of the United Nations in adopting United Nations \n     General Assembly Resolution 60/1, which affirmed that the \n     international community has a responsibility to use \n     appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means \n     to help protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic \n     cleansing, and crimes against humanity;\n       Whereas, in December 2011, the Senate unanimously passed \n     Senate Concurrent Resolution 71, recognizing the United \n     States national interest in helping to prevent and mitigate \n     acts of genocide and other mass atrocities against civilians, \n     and urging the development of a whole of government approach \n     to prevent and mitigate such acts;\n       Whereas, in April 2012, President Barack Obama established \n     the Atrocities Prevention Board within the United States \n     inter-agency structure, chaired by National Security staff, \n     to help identify and more effectively address atrocity \n     threats, including genocide, as a core national security \n     interest and core moral responsibility;\n       Whereas, in July 2013, the National Intelligence Council \n     completed the first ever National Intelligence Estimate on \n     the global risk for mass atrocities and genocide;\n       Whereas, in January 2014, the National Director of \n     Intelligence testified before the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the Senate, stating that ``the overall risk \n     of mass atrocities worldwide will probably increase in 2014 \n     and beyond. . . . Much of the world will almost certainly \n     turn to the United States for leadership to prevent and \n     respond to mass atrocities.'';\n       Whereas, despite measures taken by the United States \n     Government and other governments since 1994, the \n     international community still faces the challenges of \n     responding to escalation of violence, atrocities, and \n     religious-based conflict in many corners of the globe, \n     including Syria and the Central African Republic, and a \n     failure of the international community to appropriately \n     respond to and address the rapidly deteriorating situation \n     could result in further atrocities;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council was unable to \n     pass a resolution condemning the Government of Bashar al \n     Assad of Syria for the use of chemical weapons against \n     civilians, killing more than 1,400 of his own people in \n     August 2013; and\n       Whereas United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \n     recommended to the United Nations Security Council the \n     establishment of a United Nations peacekeeping mission in the \n     Central African Republic with the primary mandate to protect \n     civilians: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the United Nations designation of April 7th \n     as the International Day of Reflection on the Genocide in \n     Rwanda;\n       (2) honors the memory of the more than 800,000 victims of \n     the Rwandan genocide and expresses sympathy for those whose \n     lives were forever changed by this horrific event;\n       (3) expresses support for the people of Rwanda as they \n     remember the victims of genocide;\n       (4) affirms it is in the national interest of the United \n     States to work in close coordination with international \n     partners to prevent and mitigate acts of genocide and mass \n     atrocities;\n       (5) condemns ongoing acts of violence and mass atrocities \n     perpetrated against innocent civilians in Syria, the Central \n     African Republic, South Sudan, Sudan and elsewhere;\n       (6) urges the President to confer with Congress on an \n     ongoing basis regarding the priorities and objectives of the \n     Atrocities Prevention Board;\n       (7) urges the President to work with Congress to strengthen \n     the United States Government's ability to identify and more \n     rapidly respond to genocide and mass atrocities in order to \n     prevent where possible and mitigate the impact of such \n     events;\n       (8) clarifies that nothing in this resolution shall be \n     construed as an authorization for the use of force or a \n     declaration of war; and\n       (9) supports ongoing United States and international \n     efforts to--\n       (A) strengthen multilateral peacekeeping capacities;\n       (B) build capacity for democratic rule of law, security \n     sector reform, and other measures to improve civilian \n     protection in areas of conflict;\n       (C) ensure measures of accountability for per-petrators of \n     mass atrocities and crimes against humanity; and\n       (D) strengthen the work of United States and international \n     institutions, such as the Holocaust Memorial Museum, which \n     are working to document, identify, and prevent mass \n     atrocities and inspire citizens and leaders worldwide to \n     confront hatred and prevent genocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/12/10/senate-section/article/S6579-3", "month": "12", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6579-S6580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DEATH IN CUSTODY REPORTING ACT OF 2013\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 604, H.R. 1447.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1447) to encourage States to report to the \n     Attorney General certain information regarding the death of \n     individuals in the custody of law enforcement agencies, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today Senators have finally come together \nto pass the Death in Custody Reporting Act, which will provide \nimportant transparency to law enforcement efforts and our prison \nsystem. At a time\n\n[[Page S6580]]\n\nwhen our Nation is having an important conversation about police \nencounters that result in the loss of life, we know that hundreds of \npolice-related deaths are unaccounted for in Federal statistics. The \nDeath in Custody Reporting Act will require that State and Federal law \nenforcement officials report deaths in their custody, including those \nthat occur during arrest. The Justice Department will then have the \nopportunity to analyze the data and see what we can learn from it. The \nAmerican people deserve as much.\n  Too many communities across our country are losing faith in our \njustice system. This bill provides a step toward accountability, and it \nis my hope that it may ultimately lead to restoring some measure of \ntrust in these communities. If we are ever able to truly embody the \nwords engraved in Vermont marble above the United States Supreme Court \nbuilding, ``Equal Justice Under the Law,'' then more of course must be \ndone. I look forward to continuing these efforts in the next Congress.\n  The prior authorization for the Death in Custody Reporting Act \nexpired in 2006, and after too many years of inaction, I am glad that \nDemocrats and Republicans have come together and sent this \nreauthorization bill to the President for signature. My appreciation \ngoes to Congressman Bobby Scott, who sponsored and has long championed \nthis legislation, as well Senator Richard Blumenthal, who sponsored a \nSenate version.\n  This has been an important week for transparency. On Monday, the \nSenate came together to pass my bipartisan FOIA Improvement Act and I \nhope the House will soon take up this bill. On Tuesday, I spoke on the \nSenate floor in favor of the release of the executive summary of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee Study of the CIA's Detention and \nInterrogation Program. Both of these actions did not come easily, but \nin both instances the interests of the American public and our values \nas a democracy prevailed. Today, we have again come together in the \ninterest of transparency for the betterment of our Nation.\n  Mr. BENNET.
