Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to recognize \nand celebrate this morning's Chaplain. Rabbi Michael Beals has served \nour community in Wilmington, DE, and our country admirably and with a \nstrength of faith and foundation that you have heard in this morning's \nprayer. He is joined by his wife Elissa, a caring veterinarian, his \ndaughter Ariella, whose bat mitzvah was just celebrated, and his \ndaughter Shira and many other family and friends. He has a wonderful \nand accomplished education, being ordained at the Jewish Theological \nSeminary and also having studied at the American University, the \nUniversity of California at Berkeley, and the Hebrew University in \nJerusalem.\n  In addition to his remarkable education, he is someone who is \nprofoundly grounded in the calling, in the challenge of rebuilding. As \nyou heard in his reflections in prayer this morning, he is someone who \ncares deeply for the widow, the orphan, the stranger, and is true to \nthe Biblical calling of us to be witnesses to our communities wherever \nwe might be found.\n  I am grateful for the chance to add his voice to the many who have \nbrought this Senate into session year in and year out over the \ncenturies, and I am grateful for his friendship and leadership in my \nhometown of Wilmington, DE.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. With the Republican leader's consent, I ask now that the \nsenior Senator from Delaware be allowed to say a few words regarding \nour guest Chaplain.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, Senator Coons and I spent a couple of \nlovely hours together in Michael Beals' synagogue last Saturday as his \ndaughter was going through bat mitzvah. I will never forget that \noccasion. What a joy for everyone there, people from all over the \ncountry. I know it was a source of family pride for the father, the \nmom, and for the rabbi to be there with their daughter on that special \nday.\n\n[[Page S3792]]\n\n  To my colleagues I would say that one of the things I pray for every \nday is that we will find our way to a two-state solution in the Middle \nEast that provides a homeland for the Palestinians, a capital for the \nPalestinians, and security for the people of Israel and peace for the \npeople of Israel.\n  There is a great partnership in our State between Rabbi Beals' \nsynagogue and my church and a number of other churches of different \nfaiths. I just want to mention that here today and thank you for your \ncommitment not just to the least of those in our society and those who \nneed our help but also across the world to a really big trouble spot \nthat needs our attention and our thoughts and our prayers.

Mr. President, as a boy, as I grew up, what I wanted to be \nwas a baseball player. It didn't take long until I learned I was not \nbig enough, fast enough, or good enough to be the baseball player of my \ndreams, but that has not taken away my love of the game. I have \nfollowed it so closely for many years. I follow it really, really \nclosely.\n  I was a cheerleader for any team Greg Maddux was on. He came from \nValley High School, from Las Vegas. Almost immediately he was a star \nbaseball player in the Major Leagues. Whatever team he was on was the \nteam I cheered for.\n  I have been here in Washington now for a number of years. They have \nhad in recent years a professional baseball team. I am reminded that \nwhen I was going to law school, working in this building, I went to \nGriffith Stadium and watched baseball games. I only watched two, but I \nwatched the Washington Senators play the New York Yankees twice--Mickey \nMantle, Yogi Berra, all that crowd. I remember that.\n  In recent years--in fact, the last 2 years--I have focused on the \nNationals a lot because of another phenomenon from Las Vegas by the \nname of Bryce Harper. He has meant so much to that team, as we learned \nlast night. He is recovering from running into the wall at full speed, \nhurting himself. But last night he was the reason they won--hit a home \nrun and a double in the 10th inning and made a sensational catch. He is \nreally very good.\n  The reason I mention that is that Davey Johnson is the manager of the \nWashington Nationals. He has managed five different Major League \nBaseball teams. He is one of the greatest managers in the history of \nbaseball. He won pennants, won national championships. But what would \nthe Washington Nationals be like today if he did not have the ability \nto have the players he wanted? Someone would say: OK, you can have your \nthird baseman Ryan Zimmerman, but you are going to have to wait--not at \nthe beginning of the season, you are going to have to wait until \nAugust. We are willing to have him come in August. Or their first \nbaseman, Adam LaRoche--he is a good first baseman, Golden Glove. But \nyou can't have him for a while. Wait for a few months and then bring \nhim on.\n  That is an example of what is going on in the Senate. The President \nof the United States does not have the team he wants, the team he \ndeserves.\n  Yesterday my friend--and he is my friend--the minority leader offered \na full-throated defense of the dysfunctional status quo here on Capitol \nHill. Here is what he said: ``I think we have demonstrated there is no \nreal problem here,'' talking about the Senate. This he said yesterday \non this floor.\n  Congress has an approval rating I don't even like to talk about. It \nis very low. Senator McConnell stood on the Senate floor and said \nthings here in Congress are going just fine. I think it is safe to say \nAmericans disagree, and I am on their side. Senator McConnell is free \nto defend this Republican-created logjam that exists in the Senate \ntoday, but I will not join him in this defense. The problem of gridlock \nin Washington is real, and it must be fixed. I am committed to making \nthe Senate work again.\n  These remarks I am giving today are only in an effort to get this \nbody to work well. There is nothing sinister in what I am saying. I \njust want the Senate to work well. I have been here a long time, and it \ndid not work this way before.\n  Despite the agreement we reached in January of this year, Republican \nobstruction on nominees continues unabated--no different than it was \nthe last Congress.\n  The minority leader used strong words yesterday accusing me of going \nback on my word. I take that accusation very seriously. It is true that \nin January Democrats and Republicans entered into an agreement. \nRepublicans agreed to cease the endless obstruction of Presidential \nnominees. They agreed they would work with us ``to schedule votes on \nnominees in a timely manner except in extraordinary circumstances.'' \nThis is what he said, what the minority leader said. I just quoted \nthat. He said it this year. I repeat, ``Republicans agreed they would \nno longer block the President's nominees without extraordinary \ncircumstances.''\n  Look at the dictionary about ``extraordinary circumstances.'' Here is \nhow it is defined: ``going beyond what is usual, regular, or \ncustomary.'' That is not some definition I came up with, that is the \ndefinition in the dictionary. ``Extraordinary'' is defined as ``going \nbeyond what is usual, regular, or customary.''\n  In return for their saying that is what they would do, we agreed that \nwe would not consider any changes to the Senate rules outside of \nregular order. Democrats have kept our word. We intend to keep our \nword. We have not altered the rules. But since we entered into that \nagreement, Republicans have failed to hold up their end of the bargain. \nWhat they have done these past 5 months has not been usual, regular, or \ncustomary as defined in the dictionary. Not only have they failed to \nwork with us to schedule votes on nominees in a timely manner, they are \ndoing everything in their power to deny the President his team and thus \nundermine Obama's Presidency.\n  Instead of throwing about accusations, let's look at the facts. Let's \nstick with the facts. Republican obstruction has slowed down nearly \nevery nominee President Obama has submitted. Even Cabinet Secretaries \nhave faced unparalleled procedural hurdles, and Republicans are \nthreatening to block many more of them. For example, in the some 230-\nplus years we have been a country, for the first time in the history of \nthis country, while a war is going on and one is winding down, for the \nfirst time in the history of this country, Senate Republicans \nfilibustered the nomination of Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel--who, \nby the way, is a Republican and, by the way, is a Vietnam hero for his \ncombat activities there and was a Republican Senator from Nebraska.\n  The minority leader himself is threatening to block President Obama's \nnominee for Secretary of Labor, and he said so. The Secretary of Labor \nis a good person. He put himself through school working as a garbage \nman. His parents are immigrants.\n  What we have done here for generations of the Senate is we have had \nhearings on these nominees. That is the way it should be.\n\n[[Page S3793]]\n\n  In recent years, after the hearings have taken place, a Senator will \nsay: I have a few more questions. We will send them. Usually there \nwould be two or three or four or five questions. Secretary Geithner, \nwho recently resigned as Secretary of the Treasury, got 28 questions.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. No, I am going to finish my statement.\n  What happens in these committees is they ask all the questions they \nwant, but 28 questions is not enough for them. For example, on Gina \nMcCarthy--the President asked her to be the Director of the EPA--more \nthan 1,100 questions were submitted to her after the hearing.\n  Jack Lew--who has basically had many jobs in government--had a full \nhearing. They gave him more than 700 questions to answer. This has \ngotten way out of hand. Anything they can do to slow things down, that \nis what they do.\n  Executive and judicial nominees who are ready to be confirmed by the \nSenate have been pending an average of 200 days--more than 6 months. \nLet me repeat that: Executive and judicial nominees who are ready to be \nconfirmed by the Senate have been pending an average of 200 days. That \nis more than 6 months. The confirmation process has moved at a glacial \npace because of extraordinary Republican obstruction.\n  Cloture has been filed on 58 of President Obama's nominees--58. By \nthis point in President Bush's term, cloture had been filed on a \nhandful of nominees. Republicans are not blocking these nominations \nbecause they object to the qualifications of the nominees.\n  This body passed something called Dodd-Frank. It was an answer to \nwhat was going on on Wall Street--the collapse of Wall Street. Richard \nCordray, the nominee to lead the Consumer Finance Bureau--which is part \nof that bill that is now law--is a perfect example. He was nominated by \nthe President of the United States almost 2 years ago--23 months ago. \nRepublicans are not concerned about his ability to do the job. They are \nafraid, I guess, he would do his job too well. He is extremely well-\nqualified. If anything, they are concerned he might, as I said, \nactually do the job, protecting consumers from the kind of corporate \ngreed that collapsed the financial markets in the first place. If he \nreceived an up-or-down vote here today, he would be approved in a \nminisecond, however long it takes to call the roll.\n  I have a couple of other examples. Yesterday we talked about the D.C. \nCircuit. By statute, the D.C. Circuit--some say the most important \ncourt in America, more important than the Supreme Court--has 11 spots. \nJustice Roberts went to the Supreme Court in 2005. His spot has not yet \nbeen filled. We have tried, but there have been two filibusters \nstopping that. There are four vacancies there.\n  President Obama is the first President in more than 50 years who has \nnot had an appointment confirmed in the D.C. Circuit, but it is not \nbecause we have not tried. For example, we tried to get Caitlyn \nHalligan for 4 years, but her nomination has been filibustered twice. \nThe seat she was nominated for--I repeat--was the seat vacated by \nJustice Roberts in 2005. Today it is 2013. Do the math.\n  Now Republicans have forced cloture on this nomination even though \nSri Srinivasan was nominated for the D.C. Circuit a year ago. Even \nthough it was reported out of the committee unanimously, they have \ndecided to stall and not have a vote on it.\n  The nominee has wide bipartisan support, it appears, from both sides \nof the aisle. If it was reported out of the committee unanimously, I \nwould assume that is the case. Neither stellar qualifications nor \nbipartisan support are enough to prevent Republican obstruction.\n  According to a report released this month by the nonpartisan \nCongressional Research Service, first-term judicial nominees who were \nreported out of committee unanimously have waited nine times longer to \nbe confirmed than under President Bush. President Obama's first-term \ndistrict court nominees have waited five times longer than those \npreviously. The first-term circuit court nominees have waited more than \nseven times longer.\n  Yesterday the Republican leader raised the example of a Wyoming judge \nas proof they are willing to support some of our nominees. Wyoming--as \nI indicated yesterday, there may be a more Republican State in the \nUnion, but I don't know where it is. I said, well, let's schedule a \nvote yesterday--Wednesday. The Republican leader said no.\n  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure why we have a judicial \nvacancy crisis in this country. We can talk about how we cleared most \nof the calendar. I take the Senate's charge to advise and consent very \nseriously, but Republicans have corrupted the Founders' intent by \nblocking qualified nominees for the slightest reason, if no reason.\n  President Obama deserves to choose his team, just as Davey Johnson \ndeserves to choose his team. I believe any President deserves his or \nher team.\n  The Republicans have again and again delayed or obstructed the \nPresident's nominees. This Republican obstruction has created an \nunreasonable and unworkable standard where minor issues are raised as \nexcuses to block major nominees or require a 60-vote supermajority for \nconfirmation.\n  Before the Republican leader accuses me of going back on my word, he \nshould take a long look in the mirror, and he should spend some time in \nhonest reflection of Republican contributions to the gridlock \nthreatening this storied institution before he claims ``there is no \nreal problem here.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/23/senate-section/article/S3793-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, according to the Congressional Research \nService, President Obama has had his Cabinet nominees confirmed quicker \nthan his predecessors during the same period in the second term--\nquicker.\n  I don't know what the majority leader thinks advise and consent \nmeans. Listening to him it means: Sit down, shut up, don't ask any \nquestions, and confirm immediately. I don't think that is what the \nFounding Fathers had in mind.\n  Talk about manufacturing a problem--the Secretary of Energy, 97 to 0; \nthe Secretary of Interior, 87 to 11; Secretary of the Treasury, 71 to \n26; Office of Management and Budget, 96 to 0; Secretary of State, 94 to \n3--in 7 days.\n  What we have just heard, I am afraid for my good friend the majority \nleader, in spite of the baseball analogy--and I read in the papers this \nmorning he has been meeting with his members and trying to get 51 votes \nto blow the Senate up.\n  We have important issues coming down the pike. We want to finish the \nfarm bill. We have been working hard to develop a broad bipartisan \nsupport for an immigration bill. We know what is going on here. What I \nfear is that the majority leader is working his way toward breaking his \nword to the Senate and to the American people, blowing up this \ninstitution, and making it extremely difficult for us to operate on the \ncollegial basis we have operated on for over 200 years.\n  He wants to have no debate. Do what I say and do it now. This is the \nculture of intimidation we have seen at the IRS, HHS, FCC, SEC, and now \nhere at the Senate: Do what I say when I say it. Sit down and shut up \nor we will change the rules. We will break the rules to change the \nrules.\n  We need to think over how we conduct ourselves in this body. The \nmajority leader has a very important position. It is not only to lead \nthe party of the majority, it is also to protect the institution. What \nI hear lacking in that speech is any interest whatsoever in protecting \nthe traditions of this institution. What I hear is: We are going to get \nour way as rapidly as possible. You guys and gals, sit down and shut \nup. Don't ask too many questions; don't make it take a week longer. Do \nwhat we say, and if you don't, we will break the rules to change the \nrules. That is what this is about.\n  I want to make sure everybody understands where the majority leader \nis taking us. Make no mistake about it, the American people have given \nus divided government, but that doesn't mean they expect us not to \naccomplish things. We are on the cusp of beginning\n\n[[Page S3794]]\n\nan extremely important debate about the future of the country after the \nrecess, but we know what is going on. What I hear is the majority \nleader does not want to keep his word to the Senate or to the American \npeople. We will take that into consideration as we move forward.\n  With regard to this D.C. Circuit nomination--talk about a \nmanufactured crisis. This well-qualified nominee came out of the \ncommittee unanimously. We have been operating on confirming judges on \nthe basis of coming out of committee. So the majority leader decided \nthat wasn't good enough and to do it now.\n  Yesterday I objected to that simply because--we did not have a \nproblem here. We have been operating in a very collegial and sensible \nway. However, he has now manufactured something he can call a \nfilibuster by filing cloture on a nominee we were prepared to confirm \nin an up-or-down vote in a week from now. So we ought to confirm him \nnow.\n  Therefore, as I noted yesterday, Senate Republicans don't have a \nproblem with an up-or-down vote on this pending nominee for the D.C. \nCircuit. Indeed, the day after his nomination appeared on the Executive \nCalendar for the first time, we offered to have an up-or-down vote on \nthe nomination. The only thing we asked was that Members who did not \nserve on the Judiciary Committee have at least a reasonable amount of \ntime to review his record. Unfortunately, the majority would not take \nyes for an answer.\n  Instead, it moved to set a 60-vote hurdle by filing cloture on the \nnomination the day after it first appeared on the calendar. It was \nheavyhanded, and, frankly, completely mystifying. As I said, the \nnomination had been on the Executive Calendar for barely a day, but we \nare not going to let the majority leader manufacture an obstruction \ncrisis where none exists.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/23/senate-section/article/S3794-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am not going to have a long conversation \nthis morning with my friend the Republican leader, other than to say \nthis: My speech speaks for itself. I wrote it; no one else wrote it. It \nis my speech, and I want everyone to look at that. I want Republicans \nand Democrats to look at it.\n  I also want the record to be clear: This man, on whom we are going to \nvote this afternoon at 1 p.m. or 2 p.m.--whatever time the consent \nagreement suggests--has been waiting 1 year. So the Republican leader \ncan talk about how quickly it came, but this man has been waiting for a \nyear. I went through the statistics, and I will not go over them again. \nI hope things work out in this Senate so we don't have to go through \nanymore procedural battles, but things are not working well. I went \nthrough the statistics, and they are in my speech.\n  I don't object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me make sure everybody understands where we are. \nLet's have no misunderstandings. What the majority leader is doing is \ntrying to get 51 votes to break the rules of the Senate and change the \nrules of the Senate. We know what he is doing, and let's make no \nmistake what the stakes are: He is threatening this institution, which \nhe elected, in part, to protect, by manufacturing a crisis that does \nnot exist. As we all know, in the Senate every Senator has the ability \nto impact how we do business. Unanimous consent means exactly what it \nsays, unanimous consent.\n  I hope the majority leader will think long and hard, and I hope my \nfriends in the majority, who may some day be in the minority--I know \nthere are a lot of new Democratic Senators who think that will never \nhappen, but amazingly enough the American people do, from time to time, \nchange their minds about who they want running the country. The shoe \ncould be on the other foot, and we never know when. I could have the \njob the majority leader currently has.\n  I think we need to think long and hard about protecting this \ninstitution and its traditions, particularly manufacturing crises when \nthey don't exist.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, prior to coming to Congress, I was a trial \nlawyer. I tried more than 100 cases to a jury. The jury decided what \nwas right or wrong in the particular conflict, and I have the American \npeople on my side with this conflict. They don't like what is going on \nin the Senate, and I have an obligation to protect the Senate. I know \nthat, and my friend reminds me of that, and I think of it very often. I \nthink of it every day and when I have my weekly caucus with my 54 \nDemocratic Senators. I represent them to represent the people they \nrepresent. I represent, because the people they represent are \nRepublicans, Democrats and Independents, and I understand that.\n\n  So I am willing to take this case to the American people. I hope we \ncan resolve any problems we have, but it is not right what is going on. \nI submit my case to the American people. I submit my case to the \nAmerican people.\n  I don't know what he is talking about. I had a very early meeting \nthis morning. I haven't read the newspaper. Maybe there is something in \nthere I will have to deny. I don't know anything about the 51 votes. I \nlook for 51 votes all the time on many different issues.\n  As I said, I don't want to have any animosity between me and my \nfriend. He is a lawyer. I am a lawyer. He represents Kentucky. I \nrepresent Nevada. We both represent our respective caucuses and we both \nhave an obligation to make this place work better.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, now I wish to talk about a real scandal \nand not a manufactured crisis.\n  Nearly 2 weeks have now passed since we learned about the scandal at \nthe IRS. The more we learn, the more troubling it becomes. It is now \nclear this was about much more than one or two employees going rogue at \nsome far-flung office out in the administrative hinterlands as was \nfirst suggested.\n  The facts we have seen so far point to something far more systemic \nthan that, and it shouldn't surprise anybody. This is the IRS we are \ntalking about--the IRS. This is an agency that is basically a euphemism \nfor mind-numbing bureaucracy--the kind of place where one would assume \nnobody does much of anything without signatures and countersignatures \nfrom section chiefs and subsection chiefs and deputy office heads and \nsecondary assistant deputy subassociate directors; sort of like a Kafka \nnovel without the laughs.\n  So what we first heard always stretched credulity. Employees at \nground zero of the Federal bureaucracy going rogue? Come on. Think back \nto the testimony we heard this week--or didn't hear. Why did Lois \nLerner and other senior and former IRS officials refuse to address \nquestions they had previously misled Congress? Somehow I doubt it is \nbecause they had nothing of interest to say. We will look forward to \nhearing more from them and we will look forward to hearing from \nwhomever actually made the decisions that led to these abuses, since no \none we have heard from yet is able to take responsibility for what went \non.\n  Let's not forget the administration continues to give us different \ntimelines about who knew what and when.\n  So the long and short of the situation is this: The public doesn't \nknow the full story yet. A number of my constituents have shared \nstories with my office about the IRS auditing their organizations and \nbusinesses during the recent Presidential campaign for the first time \never. All of a sudden they get\n\n[[Page S3795]]\n\naudited during the Presidential campaign for the first time ever.\n  These folks believe the audits were conducted for no other reason \nthan the fact that their groups were conservative, and they believe the \nquestions they have been asked have more to do with their political \nviews than their business activities.\n  Without a proper investigation, frankly, we will just never know. So \nwe owe it to our constituents to have a detailed and deliberate \ninvestigation. That is why both House and Senate committees have begun \ninvestigations into the matter.\n  That is why, last week, every Republican on the Finance Committee \nsigned a letter to the Inspector General for Tax Administration \nrequesting a probe into reports that the IRS leaked confidential \ninformation about conservative groups--actually, to their political \nopponents--leaked information about conservative groups to their \npolitical opponents, and that is why even the FBI is looking into the \nmatter, because as Attorney General Holder recently testified, the \nIRS's targeting of conservative groups could have violated numerous \ncriminal provisions.\n  I am willing to bet there is a lot more we will discover in terms of \nscope, in terms of timeline, in terms of who was involved and why. But \nwe certainly can't go about fixing the problem--we can't remove all of \nthose who need to be removed, we can't put safeguards in place if they \nare deemed necessary--until we find out all the details.\n  Here is another thing we shouldn't be doing: handing over the \nadministration of ObamaCare to these folks--handing over the \nadministration of ObamaCare to the IRS. Think about that, the deeply \nunpopular law being administered by an agency that has so betrayed the \npublic trust. Even the IRS's staunchest defenders in this scandal \ndescribe their actions as a case of ``horrible customer service.'' That \nis the best they can say: ``Horrible customer service.'' Now they are \ngoing to be put in charge of a new $1 trillion program, one that will \ngive them access to all sorts of sensitive and deeply personal \ninformation?\n  That is just what the administration and congressional Democrats are \nabout to let happen. The IRS is in charge of administering some of the \nmost important elements of ObamaCare, and for many Americans that is \ngoing to mean submitting to probing questions about their health \ninsurance, questions such as--this is the IRS asking you, American \ncitizens: Do you have insurance? What kind of insurance is it? Does it \nfollow our rules? If the people at the IRS don't like the answers, \nAmericans will be hit with new taxes. If the people over at the IRS \ndon't like the answers to their questions about Americans' health \ninsurance, they will be hit with new taxes.\n  For small businesses, the questions are going to be far more \nextensive and the consequences for noncompliance far worse. The agency \nwill have broad discretion to define what constitutes noncompliance. \nThe IRS will have broad authority to determine what is noncompliance \nwith ObamaCare. This is nuts.\n  The potential for waste and abuse would have been there regardless of \nwhich agency was put in charge of administering this bloated law. \nObamaCare is massive--about 20,000 pages of regulations already. That \nis about 7 feet tall. So waste and abuse is basically unavoidable, but \nnow we are going to have Americans worrying they might be discriminated \nagainst too, just for having an opinion. Do my colleagues know what. We \nare not going to be able to tell them not to worry because we don't \nknow the truth ourselves yet.\n  Guess who is heading the IRS office charged with managing ObamaCare. \nGet this. It is the very same person who led the division of IRS now \nembroiled in the scandal who oversaw the very office now under fire for \nthe discriminatory and harassing behavior. I am not making this up.\n  Here is what needs to be done today: No. 1, the administration needs \nto work honestly and transparently with us to get to the bottom of this \nscandal once and for all. They can do that by working cooperatively \nwith congressional investigators. They can do it by testifying openly \nand sharing key documents with House and Senate committees. They can \nhelp us conduct a thorough administrationwide review to ensure no other \ndiscrimination of this kind is occurring anywhere else--anywhere else--\nin the Federal Government.\n\n  No. 2, the administration needs to suspend its implementation of \nObamaCare until all the things I mentioned have been taken care of. The \nSupreme Court declared the individual mandate, the core of ObamaCare, \nto be a tax--a tax--so IRS involvement is going to be absolutely \nunavoidable. That needs to be halted.\n  Better yet, the administration could work with us to repeal the law \nand put in place health reforms that might actually work to control \ncosts and provide better quality of care for our constituents. I \nwouldn't hold my breath on that one, by the way, but here is what I do \nknow. I know we need to get to the bottom of this IRS scandal because, \nat a minimum, Americans from the left, right, and center should not \nhave to worry their government will harass or intimidate them for \ndaring--daring--to have an opinion and express it. They shouldn't have \nto worry about that when partaking in the political process, and they \ncertainly should not have to worry about it when it comes to an issue \nas personal and as sensitive as health care.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/23/senate-section/article/S3795-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in morning business, and I \nwish to recognize the presence of my senior Senator from Kansas.\n  I am here to visit about an individual who died in Kansas recently to \nwhom I wish to pay tribute. There are many things we admire about our \nfolks back in our home State of Kansas, but one of the things that \nstands out to me is how strongly people care about their local \ncommunities and the citizens who live there. It is demonstrated by \nvolunteering at school, serving at their church or getting involved in \npublic service. Kansans are often looking for ways to improve the lives \nof those who are around them.\n  Former Kansas State Representative Melvin Minor was exactly one of \nthose individuals. In Kansas, his family, his constituents lost a great \nman. He was a talented educator, highly regarded by his students, and a \ndedicated public servant.\n  Mel was born in 1937 in the small Central Kansas community of \nArlington. As a young man, he attended Kansas State Teachers College--\nnow known as Emporia State University--where he graduated in 1959.\n  Six years later, Mel married Carolyn Fuller and spent the next 46 \nyears by her side before her passing in 2011. Together they raised two \ndaughters, Gayle and Mary Jo.\n  Mel and Carolyn had a lot in common, especially their interest in \neducation and in young people. In fact, they met while they were both \nserving, working as teachers. For 15 years Mel taught American \nGovernment and Carolyn taught home economics in the St. John School \nDistrict.\n  Many of us can remember a favorite teacher who made an impact on our \nlives when we were growing up, someone who taught us not only facts and \nfigures but also instilled in us a love for learning and an interest in \nthe world around us. Mel was just that kind of teacher for many Kansas \nhigh school students. St. John is a small rural community in Central \nKansas with less than 1,500 people.\n  Many folks who live in St. John make their living on the farm and Mel \nunderstood this way of life and could\n\n[[Page S3796]]\n\nrelate to his students from the farm because he too was a farmer. For \nmore than a decade Mel taught them about how our government works and \ninvested in their lives. He helped broaden the horizons of those \nstudents and opened their eyes to new subjects and to new ideas. Upon \nlearning of his passing, one of his former students said, ``There was \nno better social studies and government teacher than Melvin Minor.''\n  After teaching government for 15 years, Mel decided to try his own \nhand at governing and he campaigned for a seat in the Kansas State \nLegislature. He was elected and he served Kansans in the 114th District \nin the Kansas House of Representatives for the 14 years to follow.\n  We all know that to serve in public office takes a great commitment \nfrom your family, but especially from your spouse. For the Minor family \nrunning for office was a team effort. Mel and Carolyn made a great \nteam--such a team that, in fact, Carolyn served as his campaign manager \nand treasurer.\n  I had the privilege of getting to know Mel when I served as a State \nsenator and our terms overlapped for 6 years. Even though we were of \ndifferent political parties, we had a lot in common because it was \nabout our love for Kansas and interest in rural issues that brought us \ntogether.\n  He was such a strong advocate for rural Kansas and the special way of \nlife we enjoy in small communities across our State. As a farmer Mel \nwas especially interested in agriculture policy and stood up for the \nbest interests of Kansas farmers and ranchers.\n  As a longtime Kansas resident, Mel was well known and respected \nthroughout our State but especially there in Central Kansas where he \nwas very active in the community of Stafford. He was a member of the \nStafford United Methodist Church and served on the board of directors \nof the St. John National Bank, the Zenith COOP, and the Stafford \nDistrict Hospital.\n  He was also dedicated to making sure all Kansans have access to a \nquality education and served on the Stafford Board of Education.\n  During his time on the school board, he met another strong advocate \nfor education, Ruth Teichman. After getting to know Ruth and witnessing \nher dedication to Kansans, Mel encouraged her to run for the State \nsenate. Here it was a Democrat encouraging a Republican to run. It took \n8 years of prodding, but he finally convinced her, and she served \nKansans for 12 years in the Kansas Senate.\n  Ruth remembers Mel as someone who was never without a smile and \nsomeone who simply enjoyed life and spending time with people. Even \nwhen things were not going his way, he was known for saying ``the sun \nwill come out tomorrow'' and took all of life in stride.\n  His family and friends described him as someone to whom others went \nfor advice and counsel. He was known for his integrity, hard-working \nspirit, and dedication to the work at hand--whether as a teacher, a \nfarmer, or a legislator.\n  One of his former colleagues in the house, Dennis McKinney of \nGreensburg, eventually rose to become the minority leader in the Kansas \nHouse of Representatives and considered Mel his mentor when he began \nhis political career. He remembers Mel as someone who always lived out \nthe biblical command to care for those with the greatest needs. From \nthe patients at Larned State Hospital to the youth in the juvenile \njustice system, Mel was always looking for ways to serve his fellow \nKansans and improve their lives.\n  Dennis McKinney also remembers that Mel Minor had a great sense of \nhumor. Dennis recalled one time when the two of them were the only two \nDemocrats voting in favor of an appropriations bill in the Republican-\ncontrolled house of representatives. Dennis was sitting behind Mel at \nthe time and leaned forward to tell him that he felt a little bit \nawkward. Mel looked around the chamber, and with a glint in his eye \ntold Dennis he did not see anyone in the chamber registered to vote in \nhis district. He said he was not concerned about the pressure from his \ncolleagues but was more concerned about doing what was right for the \npeople who voted him into office.\n  Mel lived each day to its fullest, and his commitment to his fellow \nman serves as an example for all of us.\n  I extend, on behalf of Senator Roberts and me, our sympathies to his \ntwo daughters Gayle and Mary Jo and to his grandchildren Abby, Katie, \nand Barrett. I know they loved him dearly. He loved them dearly. He \nwill miss them and they will miss him very much.\n  I ask my colleagues and Kansans to remember the Minor family in your \nthoughts and your prayers as they face these days ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Kansas for his \nwonderful eulogy to a wonderful man, a teacher, a State legislator, and \njust a very nice individual. I thank the Senator for that excellent \neulogy. We will miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/23/senate-section/article/S3796-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3796-S3797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FOOD LABELING\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I understand that the distinguished \nchairperson of the sometimes powerful Senate Agriculture Committee will \nbe on the floor to lock in amendment No. 965 by Senator Sanders.\n  I rise in opposition to that amendment. The amendment would allow \nStates to require--let me emphasize the word, ``require''--that any \nfood, beverage, or other product be labeled if it contains a \ngenetically engineered ingredient.\n  Now, that is how it is described mostly in this debate: a genetically \nengineered ingredient. I think it would be more accurately called \nmodern science to feed a very troubled and hungry world.\n  We already have policies and procedures, I would tell my colleagues, \nin place at the Food and Drug Administration to address labeling of \nfoods that are derived from modern biotechnology. The U.S. standards \nensure that all labels for all foods are truthful and are not \nmisleading to the public.\n  FDA has a scientifically based review process to evaluate all food \nproducts.\n  The Food and Drug Administration states:\n\n       FDA has no basis for concluding that bioengineered foods \n     are different from other foods in any meaningful or uniform \n     way, or that, as a class, foods developed by the new \n     techniques present any or greater safety concern than foods \n     developed by traditional plant breeding.\n\n  The FDA reviews products and determines that they are safe. I think \nwe need to trust the science of their review and allow this process to \nwork.\n  The amendment by Senator Sanders would result in additional costs to \nfood producers, and that is going to come right back to consumers. The \nFDA has determined that approved biotech crops are not materially \ndifferent than conventional crops and therefore do not require \nsegregation from conventional crops.\n  The only difference--if you have a bioengineered product, and let's \nsay you come from Africa, one of the countries over there that \ncontinually has a very difficult time trying to feed themselves--the \nonly difference is if you use a bioengineered product that makes that \ncrop more resistant to heat or to rain or to a particular insect that \nis causing a lot of problems--you have a choice: You can have a crop or \nyou can have no crop or you can have perhaps a crop with a pesticide or \nyou can have a bioengineered product that is perfectly safe.\n  Furthermore, a change in policy would place additional costs on \nfarmers by potentially requiring them to segregate crops and change \ntheir equipment. It would also be very problematic for grain processing \nfacilities. I know some fail to recognize--and I know many criticize--\nthe importance of biotechnology or criticize the safety of the product. \nI just say, let science be the judge. Each product goes through \nextensive tests to ensure safety to both human health and the \nenvironment.\n  There are different views, of course, on farming, and some of my \ncolleagues in the Senate believe we should focus on those that only \nfarm a few acres--the small family farmer; somebody about 5 foot 3 \ninches from Vermont--and then grow organic crops and sell them to the \nlocal farmers market. There is nothing wrong with that. I encourage \nthat. There is nothing wrong with organic farming, and there is \ncertainly nothing wrong with regard to farmers who farm less acres. God \nbless them.\n\n[[Page S3797]]\n\n  However, if we are going to supply enough food for this growing \npopulation around the world--9 billion more people in the next several \ndecades--we need agriculture of all types, and that includes organic \nand conventional and biotech crops. The more nations we can help to \nfeed and bring economic prosperity, the more stable the world will \nbecome. That is good for our families, our Nation, and the world, and \nthe world's stability. We can only do that through commonsense policies \nbased on sound science that will allow our producers to do what they \nneed to do to get the job done.\n  My colleagues--and I see the distinguished chairperson. I will \nconclude in just about 30 seconds. I am glad she is here. I will just \nsay to my colleagues in the Senate that we should not be putting on lab \ncoats individually and taking action on this amendment. We have a clear \nscientifically based review process that works. If we pass this \namendment, probably in Vermont, California, you will have a \nrequirement; some other States may or may not; in Kansas we will not, \nand so our State legislature would have no need of putting on lab \ncoats.\n  At any rate, the FDA has guidance for voluntary labeling, and \ncompanies can choose to voluntarily label food and products if their \ncustomers want it, if they demand it. Let the consumer decide.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  I yield back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there is \nnow 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. \n965 offered by the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders. The time is \nequally divided.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wanted to thank Senators Begich, \nBlumenthal, Bennet, and Merkley for cosponsoring this amendment, as \nwell as support from many environmental and food organizations all over \nthis country. The concept we are talking about today is a fairly \ncommonsense and nonradical idea. All over the world, in the European \nUnion, in many other countries, dozens and dozens of countries, people \nare able to look at the food they are buying and determine through \nlabeling whether that product contains genetically modified organisms.\n  That is the issue. In the State of Vermont our legislature voted \noverwhelmingly for labeling. The State Senate in Connecticut, by an \nalmost unanimous vote, did the same. All over this country States are \nconsidering this issue.\n  One of the concerns that arises when a State goes forward is large \nbiotech companies such as Monsanto suggest that States do not have the \nconstitutional right to go forward; that they are preempting Federal \nauthority. This bill makes it very clear that States can go forward. I \nwould appreciate my colleagues' support for it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. First, Mr. President, before discussing the amendment, \nI think it is important to note that this is not germane to the farm \nbill. Food labeling is properly subject to the jurisdiction of the HELP \nCommittee; therefore, Senator Harkin opposes the amendment.\n  While I appreciate very much the advocacy of Senator Sanders on so \nmany different issues, I do believe this particular amendment would \ninterfere with the FDA's science-based process to determine what food \nlabeling is necessary for consumers. It is also important to note that \naround the world now we are seeing genetically modified crops that have \nthe ability to resist crop disease and improve nutritional content and \nsurvive drought conditions.\n  In many developing countries we see wonderful work being done by \nfoundations such as the Gates Foundation and others that are using new \ntechniques to be able to feed hungry people. I believe we must rely on \nthe FDA's science-based examination before we make conclusions about \nfood ingredients derived from genetically modified foods. They \ncurrently do not require special labeling because they have determined \nthat food content of these ingredients does not materially differ from \ntheir conventional counterparts. I would urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order requiring \n60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S3798]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n               Unanimous Consent Request--H. Con. Res. 25\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise to make a unanimous consent \nrequest, but I want to make a few remarks first.\n  At the risk of being patronizing to my colleagues about the \nConstitution, I wish to give a basic lesson on the Constitution this \nmorning.\n  My understanding is our Founding Fathers in the Constitution devised \na system where we had a House of Representatives and a Senate, and they \nhave to agree before something becomes a law. I think this is an \namazing decision our Founding Fathers made because what it does is \nrequire the Senate, where all of us represent a whole State, to reach \nagreement with our colleagues in the House, who have much smaller \nconstituencies and, therefore, may be targeted more to one specific \narea than some of us are.\n  I have listened to lecture after lecture from my colleagues across \nthe aisle about the Constitution. It is almost as if some of them think \nthey are the only ones who have read it or that they are the only ones \nwho understand it. Well, they are not. Here is how the Constitution \nworks: When we pass a bill and the House passes a bill, we go to \nconference. Why did the Founding Fathers want that? Because they \nunderstood that compromise was the mother's milk of a democracy.\n  But here is the bizarre thing about this. As a candidate for office \nlast year, I bet I heard 10,000 times: Why don't you pass a budget? I \nlistened to the leader of the Republican Party stand on this floor--and \nI would love to put together a montage, because we do a lot of \nhyperbole around here. We exaggerate, we go too far and say too much--\nbut it is not exaggerating that the rallying cry of the Republican \nParty was: Pass a budget. Regular order. Pass a budget. Regular order. \nPass a budget. Regular order. So what did we do? We passed a budget in \nregular order.\n  Here is the bizarre part. Following the Constitution, which my \nfriends like to wave around and pretend they are the only ones who love \nit, some people on that side now think regular order doesn't matter \nand, by the way, they do not want to go to conference and they do not \nwant to compromise, blowing up the constitutional premise of compromise \nbetween the two Houses--blowing it up.\n  I don't know what the American people think of this, but we have to \nshake our head at the politics of this. We have got to shake our heads, \nbecause here is what is bizarre. They keep moving the goalpost about \nwhat it would take to get us to conference.\n  By the way, the people who are going to be conferring on the other \nside are in the Republican Party. Are my colleagues worried their \ncounterparts in the House haven't read the Constitution and they are \nnot answerable to their constituents who voted them into office as \nRepublicans so that we have to have another budget bill and redo the \ndebate or we have to make sure they can't compromise on anything and we \nhave to put it in the law?\n  They had an opportunity to get their way. It is called amendments. My \ncolleagues could have gotten their way through the amendment process. \nWe had over 100 of them. We were here until 5:30 in the morning voting \non them. We passed 70 of them. How many amendments did the Senator from \nTexas offer on the debt ceiling that he is now saying he has to have \nbefore we can go to conference? How many amendments did he offer on \nthat? Zero. He offered 17 amendments, but he didn't offer 1 on the debt \nceiling. In fact, there was not one Republican amendment on the debt \nceiling--not one. So I have to say it is pretty obvious they didn't \nwant a budget, they wanted a political talking point. They wanted to \nmake it look as though we didn't care about doing our job.\n  They didn't care about a budget. Because if they cared about a budget \nthey would hightail it to conference right now. They would hightail it \nto conference. It has been 2 months.\n  I hope the American people are paying attention. No wonder they think \nwe are all losers. This is not a game. You can't love the Constitution \none day and blow it up the next. You can't be a situational \nconstitutionalist when you don't get your way. That is not the way our \ndemocracy works. I got elected fair and square, and so did my \nRepublican colleagues, and that is why we all have to be willing to \ncompromise with one another. We are not serving the American people by \nplaying these games, and they are sick and tired of it. Frankly, I \nthink it makes the body look a little silly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that the amendment \nwhich is at the desk, the text of S. Con. Res. 8, the budget resolution \npassed by the Senate, be inserted in lieu thereof; that H. Con. Res. \n25, as amended, be agreed to; the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table; that the Senate insist on its amendment, \nrequest a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two \nHouses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of \nthe Senate; that following the authorization, two motions to instruct \nconferees be in order from each side--motion to instruct relative to \nthe debt limit, and motion to instruct relative to taxes and revenue; \nthat there be 2 hours of debate equally divided between the two leaders \nor their designees prior to votes in relation to the motions; further, \nthat no amendments be in order to either of the motions prior to the \nvotes; all of the above occurring with no intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator modify her request so that it not be \nin order for the Senate to consider a conference report that includes \nreconciliation instructions to raise the debt limit.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator so modify her \nrequest?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Could I inquire of the Senator? I am asking: Is the \nSenator saying the constitutional provision for a conference between \nthe two Houses--what the Founding Fathers put in the Constitution for \nconferences--is, in fact, a backroom deal of the Constitution; you \ndon't accept that part of the Constitution?\n  Mr. LEE. My friend and my distinguished colleague from Missouri is \nabsolutely correct in citing the Constitution and pointing out the fact \nthe two Houses do have to agree before something becomes law.\n  It is also important to point out that under article 1, section 5, \nclause 2 of the Constitution, each House of Congress is \nconstitutionally charged with the task of establishing its own rules \nfor operation. The rules of operation in this body, as they apply right \nhere, require this kind of request receive unanimous consent. What that \nmeans is every one of us has to be willing to vote for this. What I and \na few of my colleagues have said is that regardless of what you might \ndecide to do, we respect your opinion. But if you are asking us to vote \nfor this, meaning to give our consent, which is a vote, we are asking \nfor one slight modification, and that slight modification includes \nsomething very simple, which says we are not going to negotiate the \ndebt limit as part of a budget resolution.\n  They are two separate things. We didn't consider a single amendment \nthat would have addressed the debt limit. Not a single part of the \nbudget resolution passed out of this body addressed the debt limit. The \ndebt limit not having been the subject of the budget resolution, it is \nnot important for that to be addressed by the conference committee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator so modify her \nrequest?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will object to the \nmodification.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. First of all, I think what is being done here, if we \nagree that a small number of Senators could basically change the way \nthe Senate does business, could have serious ramifications for the \nfuture.\n  The Senator from Utah said he doesn't want to be deprived of his \nvote. We are ready to vote, I say to my colleague from Utah. We are \nready to vote. We are ready to vote on a motion that would send this \nbill, which was the subject of an enormous amount of\n\n[[Page S3799]]\n\ndebate and discussion for hours and hours--until perhaps 7 in the \nmorning--to a conference, with motions to instruct the conferees.\n  I would be more than happy to vote on instructions to the conferees \nconcerning his previous concern about a tax increase, which somehow has \nbeen removed, and/or that of increasing the debt limit--instructing \nthose conferees. That is the way the Senate should do business.\n  If the Senator from Utah will allow this body to vote on whether we \nshould move to conference with instructions to conferees, that is the \nregular order. It is not the regular order for a number of Senators, a \nsmall number--a minority within a minority here--to say we will not \nagree to go to conference because of a particular problem with an \nissue, which I grant is important to the Senator from Utah, and it is \nimportant to many Senators as to whether we raise the debt limit.\n  We are on the agriculture bill right now, I say to my colleague from \nMississippi. Suppose we pass the agriculture bill and the House of \nRepresentatives passes the agriculture bill and we want to appoint \nconferees, but there is a burning issue that a number of my colleagues \nmight have. Are we then going to block going to conference?\n  Look, this isn't just about the budget conferees, this is about \nwhether we will ever be able to appoint conferees on a bill that has \nbeen passed by the House and also by the Senate; that we will come \ntogether and do what we have been doing since the Congress of the \nUnited States started functioning, and that is to sit down and iron out \nour differences.\n  If the Senator from Utah is worried about the result, I understand. I \nam worried about the result. I am worried about a bill right now that \nis just outrageous, porkbarrel spending on catfish and all kinds of \nstuff I have concerns about, subsidies for the tobacco companies and \nall that. But that does not mean I am going to object that we move for \nconferees, not when the will of the Senate and the Congress and the \npeople is heard in open and honest debate and voting. We are here to \nvote. We are not here to block things. We are here to articulate our \npositions on the issues in the best possible and most eloquent way we \ncan and do what we can for the good of the country and then let the \nprocess move forward.\n  I say to my friend from Utah, he is not going to win every fight \nhere. He is not going to win every battle here. But if he is right, I \ncan tell him from the experience I have had in the Senate, he will win \nin the end if his cause is just. But he can only win if he articulates \nhis argument before his colleagues in the Congress and the American \npeople.\n  We are about to, I hope--I hope--conclude the immigration reform \nbill. There will be portions of that bill I do not like. There will be \nportions of that bill that many of my colleagues do not like. But we \nare not counting on 100 votes in the Senate. But we are counting on a \nmajority of votes in passing it, and we are hoping the House will do \nthe same. Then we will go to conference.\n  Does that mean that if a group of Senators--4, 5, 10; I don't know \nhow many colleagues the Senator has on this issue--object to us going \nto conference on the immigration bill that therefore it should stop?\n  I am very worried, if this happens, about the precedent that will be \nset on how the Congress of the United States does business. Just a \ncouple or few weeks ago, after the Newtown massacre, my colleague from \nUtah and my colleague--I believe from Florida, I am not sure who else--\nsaid we do not want to take up the gun bill. We do not want to discuss \nthe gun bill.\n  I happen to have disagreed with many of the proposals, but was it \nright? Would it have been right for us not even to debate in light of \nthe Newtown massacre? But the Senator from Utah thought it was the best \nthing for us not to move forward. Thank God there was a group of us who \nsaid let's move forward, let's debate the gun bill, let's do what we \ncan to prevent these further massacres. That is our obligation and our \nduty to the American people. So here we are again. So here we are \nagain.\n  The budget that for 4 years I loved beating the daylights out of my \nfriend from Missouri, who would not insist on a budget being brought to \nthe Senate--now a budget has been passed. Everybody was talking about \nwhat a great moment it was. We stayed up all night--at my age that is \nnot nearly as enjoyable as it once was--and now, after being so proud, \nwe cannot observe at least a vote?\n  If the Senator from Utah wants a vote on whether we should appoint \nconferees and what those instructions to the conferees should be, then \nthat is what we should be doing. I understand how important it is for \nthe Senator from Florida or the Senator from Utah--I don't know how \nmany there are. But I can tell you there is a majority of us who want \nthe Congress to work the people's will.\n  All I would do is say I hope my colleagues will agree with motions to \ninstruct the conferees. If it is the concern of the Senator from Utah \nthat the conferees should not address the issue of the debt ceiling, \nthen let's vote to instruct the conferees to do that. That is the \nregular process. That is regular order around here.\n  But I can also tell my colleague from Utah something else. If we \ncontinue to block things such as this and block what is the regular \norder, then the majority will be tempted to change the rules of the \nSenate. That would be the most disastrous outcome I could ever imagine. \nI do not begrudge anybody--whether they have been here 6 months or they \nhave been here 30 years--their rights as Senators. But I hope my \ncolleagues will look at the way the Senate has functioned in the past.\n  Are the American people unhappy with us? Of course they are unhappy \nwith us. One reason is because they do not see us accomplishing \nanything.\n  What I have done for these years, and the people whom I have \nrespected in this body on both sides of the aisle--we fight the good \nfight. We make our case to our colleagues and the American people, and \nthen we accept the outcome of a regular order while preserving our \nrights as an individual Senator. We have maintained that balance to a \nlarge degree. I hope my colleagues will understand how important that \nis. I urge my colleagues to do what we have been doing; that is, to \nhave motions to instruct the conferees--if their issue is taxes, if \ntheir issue is the debt ceiling--and we vote to instruct those \nconferees and those conferees carry out the will of the majority of the \nSenate.\n  [Several Senators addressed the Chair.]\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the modified \nrequest? The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I reserve the right to object to the request made by \nthe Senator from Utah to amend my request. I would say within my \nrequest there is, in fact, the opportunity to vote; and he had the \nopportunity to offer an amendment on the debt ceiling on the budget and \nhe did not.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona and I renew my unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the modified \nrequest?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. There is an objection to the modified request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Just for 30 seconds, this is a very important debate. I \ndo not intend to interrupt it. But for purposes of colleagues who wish \nto speak next, I ask that once the debate is done, Senator Feinstein \nand Senator McCain have 15 minutes to discuss a farm bill amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, for 62 days several of my colleagues and I \nhave objected to the majority's request for unanimous consent to \ncircumvent regular order to go to conference with the House on the \nbudget.\n  They want permission to skip a few steps in the process, and jump \nstraight to the closed-door back-room meetings.\n  There, senior negotiators of the House and Senate will be free to \nwait until a convenient, artificial deadline and ram through their \ncompromise--\n\n[[Page S3800]]\n\nun-amended, un-debated and mostly un-read.\n  And with the country backed up against another economic cliff crisis, \nwe are concerned they will exploit that opportunity to sneak a debt-\nlimit increase into the budget.\n  We think that is inappropriate.\n  And yet, objecting to this dysfunctional, unrepublican, undemocratic \nprocess has invited anger and criticism from colleagues here on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  We just don't get it, you see.\n  Proceeding to a secret, closed-door, back-room, 11th-hour deal, we \nare told, is the way the process works. It is the way the Senate works. \nIt is the way the House works. It is the way Washington works.\n  We know this. That is why we're objecting. In case nobody has \nnoticed, the way Washington works stinks. Closed-door, back room, cliff \ndeals are not the solution, they are the problem.\n  The unspoken premise of every argument we have heard in favor of \ngoing to conference on this budget without conditions is that Congress \nknows what it is doing.\n  ``Trust us--to go into a back room and cut a deal.''\n  ``Trust us--to ignore special interests and only work for the good of \nthe country.''\n  ``Trust us--to not wait until the 11th hour, to not hold the full \nfaith and credit of the United States hostage, to not ram through \nanother thousand-page, trillion-dollar bill, sight unseen.''\n  ``Trust us--We're Congress!''\n  As it happens, the American people don't trust Congress--or either \nparty. And we have given them at least 17 trillion reasons not to.\n  I can even provide physical evidence to support my claim. If the \nAmerican people had confidence in the way the Senate works I know for a \nfact I would not be here. I do not think my colleagues joining me in \nthis objection would be here either.\n  We were not sent here to affirm ``the way the Senate worked'' as \nCongress racked up trillions in debt, inflated a housing bubble, doled \nout favors to special interests, squeezed the middle class and trapped \nthe poor in poverty.\n  We were sent here to change all that. We are fully aware that \n``Washington'' and the establishments of both parties do not like what \nwe are doing--but as computer programmers say, ``that's a feature, not \na bug.''\n  The tactics of Washington serve the interests of Washington--of \nCongress itself, the Federal bureaucracy, corporate cronies and special \ninterests.\n  And does so at the expense of the American people, their wallets, and \ntheir freedom.\n  The only time I can think of when it has not worked out that way was \nwith the recent budget sequestration and that was--literally--an \naccident; a mistake.\n  The sequestration process worked out exactly the opposite of how \nWashington expected and intended.\n  There is a reason that six of the ten wealthiest counties in the \nUnited States are suburbs of Washington, D.C.--a city that produces \nalmost nothing of actual economic value.\n  And it is not because the two parties have been so effective taking \non the special interests and doing the people's business.\n  There is a reason Tea Partiers on the right and Occupiers on the left \nprotest their shared perception that our economy, our politics, and our \nsociety seem rigged.\n  That elites on Wall Street, K Street, and Pennsylvania Avenue get to \nplay by one set of rules and people on Main Street have to play by \nanother.\n  It is because they are mostly right. This is our true inequality \ncrisis: not between rich and poor, but between Washington and everyone \nelse.\n  The national debt, and its statutory limit, is a hidden part of this \ninequality crisis.\n  After all, what is new debt but a tax increase on future Americans? \nOn those who cannot yet vote? On those who have not yet been born?\n  Raising the debt limit thus results in a form of taxation without \nrepresentation. That is why the American people resent it. And it is \nwhy Washington desperately wants to raise the debt limit with as little \npublic scrutiny and accountability as possible.\n  And that is why we're objecting.\n  Our critics say we should allow the process to move forward so we can \nhave a debate. I don't know if they've noticed, but we are having the \ndebate. We have had it several days in a row.\n  More than that, we are having the debate here on the floor, open to \npublic scrutiny, and not secretly behind closed doors. This, right \nhere, is how the process is supposed to work. The only way the American \npeople can have any hope of supervising their Congress--not ours, their \nCongress--is for us to do our work above board and in the open, \naccording to the rules.\n  That is all we are asking for--and only on one issue. For all our \nconcerns, we have still said all along that we will not block a budget \nconference. We can go to conference right now. We are willing to give \nthe majority permission to break from regular order and scurry off to \nclosed door negotiations to cut their back room deal.\n  All we have asked is one thing, a very small and simple request: \nleave the debt limit out of it. Do everything else you want, spend all \nthe money you want, use all the accounting gimmicks you want, but when \nyou go into that back room, check the debt limit at the door. That way \nthe American people can have that separate debate, on its own merits, \nhere on the floor.\n  This should not be controversial. The House Republican budget did not \ninclude a debt limit increase or instructions to include one. The \nSenate Democratic budget does not include it either. House and Senate \nnegotiators, therefore, have no procedural or democratic justification \nfor including a debt limit hike in their talks. They have no right to \ndo it. Yet they won't promise not to.\n  Once again: Trust us, we are Congress.\n  ``This is how the Senate works,'' they say. ``This is how we do \nthings.''\n  Respectfully, this is how we fail. This is how we earn our 15 percent \napproval rating. We know this is business as usual around here. That is \nwhy we're objecting.\n  If the majority wants to proceed to a budget conference through \nregular order, we can not stop them. But again, that is not their \nrequest. Their request is for permission to break from regular order, \nskip a few steps, and go straight to the secret negotiations, behind \nclosed doors, where in the Washington-centered view of the world, the \nreal governing can be done.\n  The American people do not trust secret, back-room deals, and neither \ndo I. Unless and until the American people are assured that we will not \nsneak a debt limit increase into the Conference report, I will happily \ncontinue to object.\n  I object to the motion on the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we have been through it before. In a \nnutshell, what the Senator from Utah has just said is that if we pass \nthis legislation, and if the House passes this legislation, we will not \ngo to conference unless certain conditions are imposed on those \nconferees that happen to be important to a small group of Senators. \nObviously, that will paralyze the process. Obviously, we can predict \nthe outcome.\n  The Senator from Utah keeps talking about backroom, closed-door \ndeals. It is the process of the Senate and the House to appoint \nconferees. Those conferees come to agreement and then subject their \nagreement to an overall vote in both bodies.\n  If the Senator from Utah wants to get rid of the ``backroom''--and \nall of the other adjectives and adverbs he used--then what is the \nprocess? What is the process? How do we reconcile legislation that is \npassed by one body and the other body? That is what we have been doing \nfor a couple of hundred years.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. All I can say is, Does the Senator from Utah have another \nway of reconciling legislation between the House and Senate? Of course \nnot. Of course he doesn't. Of course he doesn't. Of course he doesn't \nbecause that is the only way we can get legislation that will be passed \nby both bodies and signed by the President of the United States. That \nis the only way.\n  I tell the Senator from Utah again, if this condition is imposed then \nthere is no reason why any group of Senators should impose conditions \non conferees from now on, which will then mean, of course, we would not \ngo to conference.\n\n[[Page S3801]]\n\n  I would be glad to answer a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from \nArizona a question through the Chair.\n  It is my understanding the budget resolution passed by the House and \nthe budget resolution passed by the Senate, if conferenced and agreed \nupon, will result in a resolution passed by both the House and Senate \nbut never sent to the President. It is a budget resolution that governs \nthe way we appropriate from that point forward.\n  So as to the question of the debt ceiling, it could not be done in a \nbudget resolution. If there is going to be any action on the debt \nceiling, it has to be in a separate legislative vehicle that ultimately \ngoes to the President of the United States.\n  Even if there were an agreement on debt limit in the budget \nconference, it would have no impact of law. Is that not true?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Perhaps the Senator from Utah doesn't know about that, \nand the fact that even if they did raise the debt limit, it could not \nbecome law because it doesn't go to the President of the United States.\n  Again, maybe the Senator from Utah ought to learn a little bit more \nabout how business has been done in the Congress of the United States. \nBudget resolutions are not signed by the President of the United \nStates, so even if we did vote to increase the debt limit as a result \nof the conference--which, by the way, would be irrelevant to the work \nof the conference--it would not have any meaning whatsoever.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. This business of secret backroom dealmaking, that is what \nconferences are about, and conference results are subject to a vote of \nboth Houses as to the conference result.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I say to the Senator, through the Chair, I have \nconferred with our budget chair while Senator McCain was debating this \nwith the Senator from Utah, and maybe they are not aware that \nconference committees are open to anyone who wants to observe them. I \nwould like Senator McCain to invite the Senator from Utah to sit in on \nthe conference committee and listen to every word.\n  This notion that our democracy is a backroom deal because of bills in \nconference--the Founding Fathers are shaking their heads in disgust at \nthis notion. It is not a closed-door process. It is an open process. \nAnybody can come and listen.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my understanding since the conference is open to \nthe public, it will also be broadcast on C-SPAN so all the American \npeople can watch the deliberations.\n  I wonder, why would the Senator from Utah say it is a backroom, \nclosed-door deal when, in fact--doesn't the Senator from Utah know this \nconference is open to the public and seen by everybody?\n  I mean, for the Senator from Utah to say this is a backroom, closed-\ndoor deal, he is either directly misleading or my colleague has no \nknowledge of how the budget conference works. I don't know which one it \nis, and I don't know which one is worse.\n  All I can say is we know, one, even if we had a restriction on \nallowing raising of the debt limit, it would not matter because it is \nnot legislation that would be signed by the President of the United \nStates--no matter what the budget conferees did. We also know the \nbudget conferees--I will admit, unlike many--meet in open session with \nC-SPAN so the American people are able to observe it.\n  So I at least hope the Senator from Utah would withdraw his comment \nthat this is a backroom, closed-door deal because it is not. Those are \nfundamental facts.\n  Again, it is disappointing that we are spending this time when we \nshould be on the farm bill. The Senator from California and I have an \nimportant amendment to remove a lot of the corruption that is in that \nbill.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, as to the suggestion that this produces a \nbudget resolution that at the end of day does not go to the President, \nand therefore it isn't law, technically, on its own face, is accurate.\n  What we are concerned about are the instructions which would \naccompany the conference report. We are concerned about instructions \nthat would allow the normal rules of the Senate to be circumvented \nspecifically for something like this or perhaps a piece of legislation \nwhich would itself raise the debt limit to be considered----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEE. I would like to finish what I am saying--legislation which \nwould itself raise the debt limit and voted on a 51-vote margin rather \nthan a 60-vote margin. So this is different.\n  Regardless of how open they make that conference meeting, it is not \nthe same kind of open debate in which every Senator and every \nRepresentative is able to participate in the same way they would be \nable to on the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator admit it is not a deal that is made \nbehind closed doors? Does the Senator admit that? Does the Senator \nadmit he misspoke on that issue? It is not behind closed doors.\n  Mr. LEE. Compared to the way we do things on the floor, this is a \nclosed-door deal. Compared to the way we do things on the floor, this \nis not subject to the same kind of scrutiny.\n  The fact is that we have rules in the Senate--rules--on something \nlike this, which would allow us to proceed on the basis of a 60-vote \nthreshold. That is the whole purpose of this discussion. That is the \nbasis of our concern. We don't want legislation that can run through to \nraise the debt limit, incurring potentially trillions of dollars in \nborrowing authority on the basis of only a 51-vote threshold. That is \nour concern.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate, not \njust today but for 61 days as we have been working extremely hard to \nget the budget passed and go to conference so we can work with our \nHouse colleagues--and, by the way, the majority are Republicans. We are \nworking to do that because the American people have been very loud \nabout not managing by crisis. We all know that what will happen if we \ndon't go to conference is exactly what the Senator from Utah has been \nsaying he doesn't want.\n  If we go to conference we will have an open conference committee to \ndiscuss the differences between the House and the Senate budgets. They \nwill then give those instructions to the conference committee on how to \nmove forward on our appropriations bills that we are now looking at and \nhow we are going to deal with sequestration. It will be an open debate \nthat will come back here.\n  If we are not allowed to go to conference--we do have to pass our \nappropriations and spending bills or move to a continuing resolution \nbecause we can't if we don't get a budget deal--we are going to have to \nhave a closed-door and secret discussion to figure out what we are \ngoing to do when the debt ceiling hits. It will come down on them in \nthe middle of the night, and they will not have had an opportunity to \nbe a part of it because of the delay that is occurring right now.\n  If the Senate allows us to go to conference, Members of the Senate, \nboth Democrats and Republicans, my counterpart Senator Sessions, and I, \nhis committee, as well as Congressman Ryan from the Republican Party in \nthe House and his committee members and Democrats will sit together in \nan open process and determine how we move our budget forward.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In the case of the appointment of conferees, will that be \nopen to the public on C-SPAN or any other media coverage that wishes to \ncome in the room?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Once the conference is set and we begin meeting in a \nconference, it is like any other committee hearing where the public \nwill be able to come in and listen. They will able to watch on C-SPAN, \nand it will be an open process.\n  I will tell the Senator from Arizona that if we don't get to \nconference, we are going to have to have discussions, as a country, \nabout how we manage our finances and our government moving\n\n[[Page S3802]]\n\nforward, and those will be behind closed doors.\n  So what the Senator is objecting to as to the closed-door secret \nmeetings he is causing.\n  I hope our Republican colleagues would allow us to move forward. As \nthe Senator from Missouri said, we had 50 hours of debate, we had over \n100 amendments which were considered. Not one amendment was offered or \nconsidered on the debt ceiling, which is now what they are objecting to \nif we go to conference.\n  The Senator from Texas, I believe, offered 17 amendments, and he has \nbeen objecting because of this. Not one of them was about the debt \nceiling.\n  I know the Senator wants to have a debt ceiling debate on the floor \nof the Senate. He is welcome to come to the floor anytime and talk \nabout the debt ceiling. We welcome that discussion. We believe our \nbills should be paid, but that is separate from what we are talking \nabout here. We are talking about a budget resolution.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How many amendments were considered?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. There were over 100 amendments considered. There was 50 \nhours of debate equally divided. Every Senator participated.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How many were voted on?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Over 70 were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. But there was not one amendment on the debt ceiling?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Not one amendment was offered or considered on the debt \nceiling.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would add that what the Senator from Missouri has \noffered, after talking with the Senator from Arizona, is the ability \nnow to have a vote, despite there wasn't any during that time. There \nwas an offer, with our consent, that, yes, OK, fine. If you have to \nhave that now, we want to get to conference so we will allow a vote on \nthat and proceed to the conference.\n  So I do not understand this argument that we are going into some \nsecret meeting. I assure the Senator that we have seen secret meetings \nhere when it comes to the budget in the past that have gotten us all to \na very frustrating point.\n  Let's move to conference so we do not have those secret meetings. The \nSenator is arguing for something--I say to the Senator from Utah--that \nthe Senator from Utah is going to cause.\n  I hope we can come to an agreement. We have offered a consent which \noffers two motions to be considered. We hope to have those, and we hope \nto go to conference.\n  I assure the Senator that we will be as open and as transparent as \npossible. That budget resolution will come back to the Senate, everyone \nwill have a chance to have their say if they want that, and then that \nbudget resolution will give us our instructions so we can continue to \nmove forward on regular order to fund the Defense Department, \nAgriculture, Education, and to fund the different aspects of government \nsuch as transportation and housing. That is our obligation as the \nUnited States Congress in order for the American public to be able to \nmanage what they are required to do once we pass our budget.\n  I urge our Republican colleagues to back off on their insistence on \nthis matter. I am ready to go to conference. Am I going to like what \ncomes out of conference as chair of the Budget Committee that worked \nvery hard to get a budget passed in the Senate? Probably not.\n  I know my responsibility as a Senator is to work with my House \nRepublican colleagues and those on our conference committee to come to \nthe best judgment we can mutually so we can move our country forward \nand get us out of this management by crisis that has been forced on us \ntime and time again over the last several years.\n  The American people deserve certainty. That certainty will come when \nwe can move to conference with an open, transparent committee process \nwhich allows us to get the budget in order.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to reconsider their objections.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I too want the Senate to move to negotiate \nwith the House on the budget. I think it is critically important.\n  I have tremendous respect for the legislative process and our \nRepublic at the State level, local level, and the Federal level. In \nfact, my colleagues are correct. Oftentimes in this place we have to \nvote for issues we don't like because it is a product of compromise. It \nmay not have everything we want, but it gives us the things we need.\n  I have certainly been on the losing end during multiple votes in this \nplace during the time I have been here because I am in the minority \nboth in party and sometimes in view. So I certainly understand that \npart of it.\n  That is why I voted against the budget. I am glad we finally produced \na budget after 1,000 days, but that budget is one that I believe is \ndeficient. That is why I voted against the budget.\n  Nevertheless, I believe this institution should move forward in \nnegotiating the differences between our budget and the budget that the \nHouse has so we can finally have a budget in this country and so this \ncountry can move forward.\n  The only thing me and my colleagues are asking for is that as part of \nthat negotiation the issue of the debt limit not be included.\n  I have heard here today statements made that there were X number of \namendments filed and they didn't include the debt limit. I think the \nreason is because most of us agree that is an issue which needs to be \ndealt with on its own. This is not just some issue. It is an extremely \nconsequential issue--one that needs to be debated in and of itself \nbecause it is a function not just of an annual budget. The massive debt \nour country faces is a function of a structural problem we have. We \nbasically have these massive government programs that are going \nbankrupt, and if we don't deal with it, it will keep getting worse.\n  I have also heard statements made here today that we can't raise the \ndebt limit even if we wanted to because of the way it is structured. \nThat is why I am puzzled. Why, then, the objection? Why the objection \nto a very simple notion?\n  We could be in conference with the House today. We could be \nnegotiating with the House at this very moment if all we would do is \njust say: Go ahead and negotiate the differences with the budget. \nNegotiate taxes. If there is a tax increase, I am voting against it, \nbut negotiate that. Negotiate all of these sorts of things. But the \ndebt limit cannot be part of it; it has to be dealt with separately.\n  I don't understand the objection to that being in there.\n  I would say one more thing about the amendment process, and this is a \ncautionary tale. The next time someone comes up to you and says, \n``Don't file any more amendments; you are slowing the place down,'' \nmaybe you should file them because if you don't file them, you will \nhave to hold your peace forever.\n  With that being the case, I think we need to move to negotiation with \nthe House with the very simple language in it that it should not have a \ndebt limit increase.\n  I am going to move and ask for unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that \nthe amendment which is at the desk, the text of S. Con. Res. 8, the \nbudget resolution passed by the Senate, be inserted in lieu thereof; \nthat H. Con. Res. 25, as amended, be agreed to; that the motion to \nreconsider be made and laid upon the table; that the Senate insist on \nits amendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses; and that the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate, all with no intervening action or \ndebate; further, that a conference report in relation to H. Con. Res. \n25 not be in order in the Senate that includes reconciliation \ninstructions to increase the debt ceiling.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Well, then, we are in the same place we were before. \nBasically, this is senatese, but what I basically said is that I want \nthe Senate to go into negotiations with the House. The only thing we \nask is that when they come back, there not be reconciliation\n\n[[Page S3803]]\n\ninstructions in there that the debt limit be dealt with or increased \nbecause the debt limit is so consequential for our country that it \nneeds to be dealt with on its own.\n  Let me remind everybody of what we are dealing with. Let me tell my \ncolleagues that this is a bipartisan debt. I said it yesterday, and I \nwill repeat it today. This is a debt that grew over the last 20 or 30 \nyears with the cooperation of both parties, unfortunately, although we \nhave never seen anything like the last 5 years. It is a function of a \nstructural problem in our spending programs. If we don't deal with \nthose programs, it is going to collapse our economy within our lifetime \nand certainly that of our children. It is time to deal with it now. \nThat issue should be debated on its own, not as part of a budget \nnegotiation that deals with a 1-year spending agreement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we have been through this quite a bit, \nbut, again, I wish to respond by saying that if it were part of the \nbudget resolution, it would have no effect in law. So one has to then \nquestion what the knowledge of those who are advocating this is about \nfundamental procedures.\n  Second of all, if this is a prerequisite, then for every conference \nwe send, Senators will be allowed, according to this precedent, to set \ncertain parameters of those conferences, which is a procedure we use \nnow--instructions to conferees. We are willing to have votes on \ninstructions to conferees on any issue any Senator feels necessary for \nthe conferees to do their job.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. The Senate is a wondrous creation by our Founding \nFathers in that a great deal of power was given to the minority in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thank God.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. And I know the Senator from Arizona has enjoyed \nhaving that power from time to time, and I am sure when my party has \nbeen in the minority it has been important, and we have respected that \nin this body, although there have been some really dicey times, and I \nam sure the Senator from Arizona has been involved when we have been on \nthe brink of blowing up the rights of the minority.\n  I want to make sure I understand. The way I really see what is going \non is we now have a superminority. If this were allowed to pass, what \nwe would be doing is changing what the Founding Fathers had in mind in \nterms of the power of the minority and actually saying: Let's go back \nin history and say there were one or two or three Senators or four \nSenators who decided, by gosh, they weren't going to do voting rights \nlegislation or they weren't going to do the vote for women or they \nweren't going to do some of the changes that have occurred in our \ncountry.\n  Does the Senator from Arizona see a problem that if we allow a \nsuperminority--a minority of the minority--to hijack a process laid out \nin our Constitution, that what would happen is the majority would have \nno choice at that point other than to begin to circumscribe the rules \nfor the minority?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, I think that is a danger and I think it is a \nsignificant danger if a number of Senators, either large or small, \nshould insist that certain conditions be imposed unilaterally without \nmotions to instruct. That is what we have the motions to instruct for. \nIt is not that we don't want the conferees to do certain things, but we \nhave motions to instruct. That is the regular order of how we do \nbusiness.\n  The Senators who are here who say the debt ceiling should not be part \nof any negotiations, fine. Let's have a vote, motions to instruct the \nconferees. It has been my experience that the conferees have stuck with \nthe instructions that were voted on by the majority of the Senate.\n  So this is kind of a sad time because here we are debating as to \nwhether we should allow the debt limit to be part of negotiations, \nwhich would have no meaning in law whatsoever because it is not signed \nby the President. We have pressing issues. The Senator from California \nand I have an issue that has to do with tobacco and the health of our \nkids that we would like to have considered before the Senate. We could \nbe debating on the instructions to the conferees. We could be doing so \nmany things, and we are not. We are not doing those things.\n  Finally, I would again share my experience with my colleagues. I have \nlost a lot more times than I have won, but I have come to the floor of \nthe Senate using the rules of the Senate and made the argument on those \nthings I believe in and stand for. I have been passionate on those \nissues, and sometimes I have irritated my colleagues, but at least I \nhave had my say.\n  But then after I have had my say, there have been votes, and the body \nhas decided, and the body has decided whether I was right or wrong. \nWhen I have been voted down, I have gone back on those issues and I \nhave tried to convince my colleagues of the rightness of my position, \nrather than, as with the gun bill, after people were slaughtered in \nNewtown, CT, my colleagues didn't even want to debate the issue of gun \ncontrol and what we should do about that. That is not how the Senate \nshould function. The Senate is supposed to debate and discuss and give \nour passionate appeals and beliefs and then put it to the will of the \nbody. That is the protection of the individual Senator, not to just say \nwe are not going to do anything. That is not the way the American \npeople want us to act. And to throw in all this stuff about the debt \nand the deficit--I will match my record on opposing the debt and the \ndeficit against certainly my colleagues here.\n  But that is not the point. The point is, will this deliberative body, \nwhether it is the greatest in the world or the worst in the world, go \nahead and decide on this issue so we can have a budget so we can at \nleast tell the American people we are going to do what we haven't done \nfor 4 years and what every family in America sooner or later has to do, \nand that is to have a budget.\n  So, as I say, we have gone on too long. The farm bill is of the \nutmost importance, and the Senator from California and I have \namendments on it. I hope my colleagues will realize the best way to get \ntheir point of view over and sway the opinion of our colleagues and the \nAmerican people is to engage in honest and open debate, as the Senate \ndoes, instruct the conferees, let them go to conference in an open--not \nclosed-door, not behind closed doors, not backroom--process that is the \nprocedure employed by the Budget Committee in conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, in ``Gulliver's Travels,'' Swift told us of \ntwo fictional lands--Lilliput and Blefuscu--that had been at war for \nyears over which end of the egg to open first. In Lilliput they opened \nthe big end of the egg, and in Blefuscu they opened the small end of \nthe egg, and the big-enders and little-enders battled endlessly. I am \nsorry to say that satirical depiction often reflects what occurs in \nthis august body. We spend a great deal of time arguing about \nprocedural niceties, about motions to commit or not commit that do not \nmatter to the American people, and all the meantime we are bankrupting \nour children and our grandchildren.\n  If I could, I wish to cut through all of the arguments back and forth \nbecause in my view most of the arguments are by design missing the \npoint of this disagreement. This disagreement is over one issue and one \nissue only: Can the Senate raise our debt limit with only 50 votes or \ndoes it take 60? Everything else that is being talked about is smoke, \nis a side issue. The central fight is, Should the Senate be able to \nraise the debt limit with 50 votes or 60?\n  I will note that my friend from Arizona questioned the knowledge of \nthose who are objecting, and he suggested that perhaps our knowledge \nwas lacking because this could not be done. Well, I know my friend from \nArizona is a long veteran of this body, and he surely knows it was done \nin 1987 and 1990. This is not a hypothetical. In 1995 and in 2004 it \nwas attempted. It didn't quite get accomplished, but it was attempted.\n  What occurs under the Budget Act of 1974 is that when a conference \nreport is adopted and reconciliation instructions are sent, that raises \nthe debt ceiling, and that can then be passed by this body with merely \n50 votes. This is all an avenue to allow a debt ceiling increase to be \nraised with 50 votes. And I\n\n[[Page S3804]]\n\nknow my friend from Arizona is well aware of that because he is such an \nesteemed historian of this body, he knows not only that it can be done \nbut that it has been done.\n  We don't need to hypothesize over whether that is what this is about \nbecause for 62 days we have asked the majority leader: Simply say we \nwon't use this as a procedural trick to raise the debt ceiling with 50 \nvotes and then we can go to conference. For 62 days the majority leader \nhas said: No, no, I will not do that; I will not do that. And those \nprotestations make absolutely clear what this is about.\n  I think that on both sides of the Chamber there are different things \nat work. On the Democratic side of the Chamber--President Obama has \nbeen very explicit. He wants to raise the debt limit, and he has said \nhe wants no debate about it. He is unwilling to debate. He wants to \nshut down the discussion. He simply wants a blank check. He simply \nwants an unlimited credit card to keep digging the debt hole this \nNation is in deeper and deeper and deeper. He said this publicly, \nrepeatedly from the White House.\n  What our friends the Democrats are doing is standing shoulder to \nshoulder with the Democratic President in fighting to enable the Senate \nto raise the debt limit with just 50 votes, which means, if that \nhappens, that would then allow the 55-Member Democratic majority to \nvote to do so without listening to a word from the minority. That is \nwhat this fight is about, and there is no other issue being contested \nhere.\n  What is happening on the Republican side? Well, some have suggested \nwe ought to just have a motion to instruct. The problem with the motion \nto instruct is that a motion to instruct is nonbinding, so it is a \npurely symbolic gesture. But even a motion to instruct not to raise the \ndebt ceiling would lose. Why? Because there are 55 Democrats, and the \n55 Democrats would vote against it.\n  Here is the dirty little secret about some of those on the right side \nof the aisle: There are some who would very much like to cast a \nsymbolic vote against raising the debt ceiling and nonetheless allow \nour friends on the left side of the aisle to raise the debt \nceiling. That, to some Republicans, is the ideal outcome because they \ncan go to their constituents and say: See, I voted no, and yet at the \nsame time, wonderfully, they lost, and they did not actually have to \nstand up and stop what was happening. That is an outcome I believe some \non this side of the aisle desire.\n\n  I do feel obliged to rise in defense of my colleagues, the \nRepublicans, because the senior Senator from Arizona has impugned the \nRepublicans by claiming repeatedly it is only a minority of Republicans \nwho are opposed to raising the debt ceiling on 50 votes. He has \nrepeatedly suggested on the floor of the Senate that, in fact, it may \nbe a small minority, that the overwhelming majority of Republicans, the \nsenior Senator from Arizona said, stand with Harry Reid in wanting to \nbe able to raise the debt ceiling on 50 votes.\n  Let me suggest to the senior Senator from Arizona that, No. 1, in \nsaying that, he is impugning all 45 Republicans in this body, but, No. \n2, it has been suggested that those of us who are fighting to defend \nliberty, fighting to turn around the out-of-control spending and out-\nof-control debt in this country, fighting to defend the Constitution--\nit has been suggested we are wacko birds. Well, if that is the case, I \nwill suggest to my friend from Arizona there may be more wacko birds in \nthe Senate than are suspected. Indeed, I would encourage my friend, the \nsenior Senator from Arizona, that if he were to circulate to \nRepublicans a simple statement that said: We, the undersigned \nRepublican Senators, hereby state we support giving Harry Reid and the \nDemocrats the ability to raise the debt ceiling with 50 votes instead \nof 60, I believe he will find his representation to this body that it \nis only a minority of Republicans who oppose that is not accurate.\n  This issue gets obscured by the procedural complexities, and that is \nnot by accident. Washington is very good at speaking doublespeak that \nmakes the citizens' eyes glaze over. But as its heart it is very \nsimple. Majority Leader Reid and the Democrats want to raise the debt \nceiling. They have stated they want to raise the debt ceiling, and they \nwant to do so consistent with President Obama's instructions to do so \nwithout debate because he does not want to debate this issue, without \nconditions, without anything to fix our out-of-control spending, our \nout-of-control debt--simply give him an additional blank credit card \nbecause going from $10 trillion to $17 trillion has not been enough. \nThat is the desire of the Democrats, and it is candid.\n  We could go to conference right now, today, if the Democrats would \nsimply say: We will not raise the debt ceiling with just using 50 \nvotes. We will debate it on the floor with a 60-vote threshold and \nactually be forced to find some bipartisan agreement. But that is not \nwhat the majority wants to do.\n  Those who are arguing that Republicans should accede to that demand \nare arguing that all of us who have told our constituents we are going \nto fight to solve this economic problem, we are going to fight to stop \nout-of-control spending, we are going to fight to stop bankrupting our \nkids--that those promises are hollow, those are just what we tell \nconstituents at home, that is not actually what we do when we are on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  I would note, indeed, when the senior Senator from Arizona said it is \nonly a small minority that believes this on the Republican side, if my \nfriend, the senior Senator, is able to produce a written letter with \nthe signature of a majority of Republicans, I will offer here and now \nto go to a home game of my Houston Astros wearing an Arizona \nDiamondback hat. And I can guarantee you, in Houston that will not be \nwell received. But yet I stand in complete comfort that I will not find \nmyself in that situation because I do not believe it is right that a \nmajority of the Republicans in this body have given up the fight on \nspending, have given up the fight on reining in out-of-control \nWashington bipartisan spending, deficits, and debt. I believe we are \nseeing leadership in this body stand together to fix the problem. That \nis what the American people want.\n  Let me say this in closing: It is easy to get confused by all of the \nprocedural discussions back and forth. This issue is about one issue \nalone: Should Majority Leader Harry Reid be able to raise the debt \nlimit an unlimited amount with just 50 votes or should it require 60? \nIf it requires 60, there will have to be some positive steps made to \nfix the problem. If it is just 50, the majority leader has the votes \nright now, today, to write a blank check for the Federal debt.\n  That is the issue, and I think the American people are not conflicted \nin the answer to that issue. The American people want us to fix the \nproblem and stop digging the debt hole deeper and deeper, stop putting \nour kids and grandkids on the path to Greece.\n  I am proud so many Senators are standing here working very hard to \nhonor our commitments to our constituents because that is exactly what \nour job is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I thank my friend and my colleague, the \nSenator from Texas, for his remarks and I speak briefly to respond to a \ncouple of points that have come up today.\n  First of all, it is important for us to remember that although the \nrules of our body might allow for a conference committee to meet in \npublic, and although that may have happened in the past from time to \ntime, it is not the norm. In asking around to some senior staff members \nwho have been here longer than I have, it typically has not happened in \nrecent years. In fact, it has become relatively rare in recent years. \nSo to suggest it necessarily is an open process because it has the \ncapacity to be made into an open process, those are not the same \nthings. Typically, we can legitimately expect for this to be a \nbackroom, closed-door process.\n  That is not the end of the world; we, of course, need conference \ncommittees. They do valuable, important work. We are not disputing \nthat. We are not disputing the fact that sometimes it is important for \nconference committees to meet in order to reconcile competing versions \nof the same legislation--one passed in the House and one passed in the \nSenate. But what we are talking about here is a very limited request: \nto limit the scope of their work\n\n[[Page S3805]]\n\nso as to exclude the possibility of a debt limit increase without the \n60-vote threshold.\n  It is also important to remember that although this is the procedure \nthe majority has chosen to use in order to try to get to a conference \ncommittee, it is not the only way. In fact, it is possible to do this \nwithout unanimous consent. It is possible to do this without, in other \nwords, all of us being willing to do it--all of us--by withholding our \nobjection as effectively voting to do that.\n  If, as has been suggested, the other body does, in fact, want to go \nto conference, the other body could take the budget we passed, could \nslap their amendments on top of it, could even replace most or even all \nof our budget with theirs, send it back over, and at that point it is \nmy understanding we could go to conference without the need for a \nunanimous consent.\n  So there are other ways. This is just the way the majority has chosen \nto go. The majority has every right to do that, and we have every right \nto object. That we do and that we will continue to do until such time \nas it either becomes unnecessary or until such time as the majority \nagrees to modify the request along the lines we have specified so as to \npermit and ensure that any debt limit discussions and votes will take \nplace subsequent to the normal order and subject to a 60-vote \nthreshold.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I believe pursuant to a unanimous \nconsent agreement propounded by the chairwoman of the Agriculture \nCommittee that I am next up to be able to speak on an amendment. But \nfor a brief moment I want to reflect on what I have heard and the lens \nthrough which I see it.\n  I have been here for 20 years. When I came to the Senate, it was not \nthis way. The rules of the Senate were observed. A small minority never \ntried to subvert the will of a majority. I think Senator McCain said it \nwell. We stand on the floor. We advocate for our views. We either win \nor lose. The dye is cast. But we have an opportunity for full \ndeliberation.\n  It is one thing to have a minority have their rights. It is another \nthing to have a minority of the minority absolutely try and handcuff a \ncommittee of the Senate. I believe that is wrong. Because what is \nhappening here sets a precedent for future answers. And there is no \nreason not to have a conference committee.\n  I think the Senator from Utah knows full well these conference \ncommittees are open to the public. They are open to the press. They are \noften long. They can be laborious. But it is a way of reconciling the \ndifferences between the House and the Senate.\n  So to handcuff this Budget Committee and say it can do this but it \ncannot do that is not the right thing to do. I hope the credibility of \nthe minority of the minority running this body diminishes with this \ndebate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 923\n\n  Let me now go to an amendment Senator McCain and I are offering to \neliminate taxpayer subsidies for tobacco production in the farm bill of \nAmerica. It is No. 923. I will not call it up because I understand an \nagreement is--I am just told by the chairwoman of the committee that I \ncan call up the amendment, and to this end I call up amendment No. 923.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is this objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask reading of the amendment be vitiated, and I \nwill proceed with my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will simply report the amendment \nfirst.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Fine.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein, for herself \n     and Mr. McCAIN, proposes an amendment numbered 923.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit the payment by the Federal Crop Insurance \n   Corporation of any portion of the premium for a policy or plan of \n                         insurance for tobacco)\n\n       On page 1101, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 11___. PROHIBITION ON PAYMENT OF PORTION OF PREMIUM BY \n                   CORPORATION FOR TOBACCO.\n\n       Section 508(e) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. \n     1508(e)) (as amended by section 11030(b)(2)) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) Prohibition on payment of portion of premium by \n     corporation for tobacco.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Effective beginning with the 2015 \n     reinsurance year, notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     subtitle, the Corporation shall not pay any portion of the \n     premium for a policy or plan of insurance for tobacco under \n     this subtitle.\n       ``(B) Deficit reduction.--Any savings realized as a result \n     of subparagraph (A) shall be deposited in the Treasury and \n     used for Federal budget deficit reduction.''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the chairwoman. She made a \ncommitment to hold a vote on this amendment on Monday evening, and she \nhas sought mightily to keep her word, and I very much appreciate that.\n  This amendment is, to my view, about common sense. Tobacco is not \njust another crop; it causes 443,000 deaths each year. It is the \nleading cause of preventable death in America. The CDC estimates that \ntobacco costs the American economy more than $200 billion each year in \nhealth care expenses and lost productivity.\n  A recent study estimates that annual smoking-attributable \nexpenditures add $22 billion each year to Medicaid's bottom line. In \nother words, Medicaid costs $22 billion more because of tobacco.\n  In 2004, Congress approved nearly $10 billion--$9.6 billion, to be \nexact--in payments over the next 10 years to tobacco farmers and quota \nholders in exchange for ending the tobacco program.\n  In addition to this $10 billion, tobacco farmers also received more \nthan $276 million in taxpayer-funded crop insurance subsidies since \n2004. That is what we are trying to change. Unlike crop insurance \nindemnities, the tobacco insurance subsidy is not based on losses. The \ngovernment pays premium support subsidies year in and year out \nregardless of losses.\n  In 2012, farmers received $37.4 million in subsidies; in 2011, $33 \nmillion; in 2010, $37.1 million; in 2009, $40.1 million. If you add \nthis up, there is $147 million in subsidies given, despite the big \ntobacco buyout of $10 billion, in subsidies to crop insurance.\n  If you look at our $642 billion deficit, why would the government \ncontinue to subsidize crop insurance for tobacco?\n  Now that is not to say tobacco farmers should not have access to crop \ninsurance. Insurance is an important risk management tool for any \nbusiness, and our amendment allows tobacco farmers to continue to \npurchase crop insurance.\n  The amendment is specific. It eliminates the government's \ncontribution to the annual cost of tobacco insurance premiums. But it \ndoes not impact the ability for crop insurance companies to sell these \nproducts. Farmers can manage weather and market risk without the \nmandatory taxpayer premium support.\n  Some may say: Well, market rate insurance is not feasible for \nfarmers. I challenge that notion. Carrot farmers do not have access to \nany crop insurance--federally subsidized or otherwise--neither do \nspinach farmers, broccoli farmers, or artichoke farmers.\n  The list of crops with no insurance support goes on: cauliflower, \ncelery, eggplant, cut flowers, Kiwi, kumquats, melons, garlic, \nraspberries, and pomegranates, to name a few.\n  Farming without government-subsidized crop insurance is possible, \ncontrary to what some would have you believe.\n  I also want to remind my colleagues that tobacco farmers have done \nquite well by the government. In 2014, North Carolina tobacco farmers \nand quota owners will have received $3.9 billion in buyout payments. In \nother words, they have taken this money to be bought out. Kentucky \nquota owners and farmers will have received $2.4 billion from the \ngovernment. Quota holders and farmers in Tennessee, South Carolina, \nVirginia, and Georgia will each have received more than $600 million in \nbuyout payments by the end of next year.\n  Evenly divided among the thousands of tobacco quota holders and \nfarmers nationwide, the nearly $10 billion buyout has provided very \ngenerous support. We need to remember this is not a struggling \nindustry. Contrary to what some would have you believe, a 2012 \nUniversity of Illinois study found that productivity on Kentucky \ntobacco farms increased by 44 percent in the last 10 years.\n\n[[Page S3806]]\n\n  At the same time, tobacco farmers are seeing some of their best \npaydays since the 2004 buyouts began. Tobacco is fetching nearly $2 a \npound for some farmers. The 2012 crop was valued at $1.579 billion.\n  To return to the question at hand, should taxpayers continue to \nsubsidize tobacco productions, I believe the answer is no. Tobacco is \nthe leading cause of preventable death in the United States. As I said, \nit kills 443,000 people each year. It costs $200 billion in health care \nand reduced productivity.\n  I am not alone. This amendment is supported by the American Cancer \nSociety, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, \nthe Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, the American Public Health \nAssociation, the Environmental Working Group, Doctors for America, \nPhysicians for Responsible Medicine, and Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n  Some would have you believe this is going to affect the small tobacco \nfarmer. Let's take a look at it. There are 16,228 farms that grow \ntobacco nationwide. Well, I will not get into that. The industry is \nconcentrated. A small number of large farms produces the vast majority \nof the crop. Two percent of the farms produce 50 percent of the annual \ntobacco crop; 10 percent, 75 percent of the annual tobacco crop. Twenty \npercent of farms that grow tobacco are smaller than 50 acres. Eighty \npercent of farms that grow tobacco are larger than 50 acres.\n  The bottom line is most tobacco farmers are not relying on tobacco as \ntheir primary crop. Thus, it is not surprising that only 4,495--that is \n72 percent of farms--have tobacco sales of more than $50,000 a year. A \nfair assessment shows that about 5 percent of tobacco farmers, 908, do \nfall into the category of small farmers who rely on tobacco as their \nprimary farm income.\n  The buyout expires, I believe, at the end of 2014. My point is nearly \n$10 billion of taxpayer funds is in the process of being expended to \nbuy out tobacco farmers. Why should we then subsidize crop insurance? I \nvery much hope my colleagues will join me in supporting what I think is \ncommonsense reform. We have to say no to tobacco in America. Most of us \nthink we have made great progress. Young people smoke less; older \npeople smoke less; you do not smoke in public places. All of these have \nhad a big impact. I think by eliminating this subsidy on crop \ninsurance, it also can have a constructive impact.\n  I urge an ``aye'' vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from California \nfor her excellent work on the amendment she is offering which takes to \nanother level the fight against tobacco addiction that has so plagued \nthis country. She has been such a champion of the victims of nicotine \nand tobacco addiction. Her work certainly has been a model for many of \nus who have been involved in this fight.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Blumenthal pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1041 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 1 p.m. be equally divided between proponents and opponents of the \nFeinstein-McCain amendment No. 923; that following the confirmation \nvote this afternoon and the resumption of legislative session, the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to the amendment; that there be 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to the vote and that the amendment be \nsubject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. One more comment, as I see my colleague is waiting to \nspeak on the Senate floor. I want to thank everyone. As we are working \nthrough the farm bill, we are making progress, moving forward, and \nlooking forward to continuing to put in place the final path for \npassage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 133\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I rise to make a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  We have been following an extraordinary horror story in the news, and \nit is the story of Kermit Gosnell's truly unspeakable crimes that were \ncommitted over a long period of time--maybe as long as two decades--at \nthe Women's Medical Society in Philadelphia, PA.\n  We suspect there were literally hundreds of late-term and very late-\nterm abortions that were conducted there, and we now know from his \nconviction in a criminal trial that there were babies born alive--\nprobably many--who were then murdered when scissors were used to sever \ntheir spinal cords after they were born alive in a failed abortion \nattempt. Further, we know that Kermit Gosnell and some of his \ncolleagues kept aborted fetuses in bags and bottles, discarded them, \nleft them on shelves.\n  It is unbelievable what was happening at that place for years and \nyears. In fact, the crimes were discovered by accident. Police raided \noffices to seize evidence of illegal sales of prescription drugs. It \nwas only during that raid for illegal prescription drug sales that they \ndiscovered the evidence of these atrocities.\n  It is my view and the view of many of my colleagues that we need to \ndo a lot more to make sure that the laws, which were blatantly being \nviolated by Kermit Gosnell, are better enforced. We need to do that \nthrough proper due diligence and discover where they are being \nviolated.\n  About 2 weeks ago Kermit Gosnell was convicted. He was convicted of \nthree counts of first-degree murder for killing three infants. He was \nconvicted of one count of third-degree murder in the overdose death of \na woman. There were 21 counts of abortion of an unborn child of 24 \nweeks or more, and he was convicted of 208 counts of violation of \ninformed consent.\n  We have a resolution, S. Res. 133. It points to these atrocities that \nwere committed. It simply calls on Congress and the States to \ninvestigate and correct the abusive, unsanitary, and the blatantly \nillegal abortion practices that certainly were conducted here at the \nWomen's Medical Society in Philadelphia and similar such practices that \nmay be occurring in other places.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the HELP Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration of S. Res. 133, that the Senate proceed to its \nconsideration, and that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be \nagreed to, and the motion to reconsider be made and laid on the table, \nwith no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill, in fact, but I want to first discuss the resolution that now for \nthe third time essentially has been brought to this body, and I am here \nto speak and object for a third time but not out of disagreement with \nthe basic goal that has been well articulated by my friend from \nPennsylvania.\n  I think I am quoting him directly from his remarks just now in saying \nthat the goal is to do a lot more to ensure that the laws violated by \nKermit Gosnell are vigorously enforced. I am here to say, yes, let's \ncondemn the kinds of practices that resulted in the conviction of \nKermit Gosnell and his sentence, in effect, to life in prison. Let's do \nmore to ensure that laws are vigorously enforced that protect innocent \npatients in any setting, whether it is a doctor's office, a hospital, \nor a nursing home; whether it is by a nurse, a doctor, or another kind \nof caregiver, or by a vicious, conscienceless practitioner like Kermit \nGosnell.\n  Let's stop this kind of despicable medical conduct even if it may be \nonly a tiny fraction of all the caregiving that occurs in the United \nStates by an even tinier fraction of a great and noble profession, by \nextraordinarily experienced and expert members of our medical \nprofession.\n  We need to talk about all of the kinds of malpractice and criminal \nmisconduct that can cause death or injury or the threat of death or \ninjury.\n  We ought to be equally outraged by the doctors and the nurses in \nStates such as, for example, hospitals and nursing homes in both New \nJersey and Pennsylvania--in 2006, a nurse was sentenced to multiple \nlife sentences for\n\n[[Page S3807]]\n\nkilling at least 29 patients by intentionally overdosing them with \nmedication. There was simply no justification for those actions, and \nthey are equally as heinous and unforgivable as the crimes that \nresulted in the conviction of Kermit Gosnell.\n\n  We need to talk about the nurse who was charged with killing 10 \npatients in a hospital in Texas by injecting them with a medication to \nstop their breathing. She pleaded no contest and is now serving life in \nprison.\n  I want this body to adopt a resolution that addresses those kinds of \nlapses in basic decency, ethics, and morality, as well as law.\n  We ought to be talking about the doctor who worked in hospitals in \nseven States--New Hampshire, Kansas, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Michigan, \nNew York, Georgia--and exposed almost 8,000 patients to hepatitis C. He \nknowingly injected patients with his own infected blood and exposed \nthem to a life-threatening disease.\n  The resolution I am going to ask this body to adopt speaks to those \nviolations of trust, decency, and law.\n  In this place, I have talked about other similar violations--the \nOklahoma dentist who exposed as many as 7,000 patients to HIV and \nhepatitis B and C through unsanitary practices. In Nevada, \npractitioners at an endoscopy center exposed 40,000 patients to \nhepatitis C through their unsanitary practices, and it went on for \nyears.\n  My resolution speaks to those basic violations of trust and morality.\n  Kermit Gosnell's case has run its course. Our criminal justice system \nhas done its work.\n  I have a resolution, and I ask unanimous consent that it be adopted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the HELP Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration of S. Res. 134 and that the Senate proceed to its \nconsideration; that the resolution be agreed to, the Blumenthal \namendment to the preamble, which is at the desk, be agreed to, the \npreamble, as amended, be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid on the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  I object to the resolution offered by my colleague from Pennsylvania \nand ask him and my colleagues to join me in support of this alternative \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the request of the Senator from Connecticut?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Reserving the right to object, I think the Senator from \nConnecticut makes a number of important observations and raises a \nnumber of very important issues. I think there is an opportunity for \nthe two of us to work together to address some of these. However, my \nreading of the actual resolution for which he is requesting unanimous \nconsent, in my view, equates outcomes--including deaths but outcomes \nresulting from malpractice and unsanitary conditions and other \ncompletely indefensible practices--equates those with the serial, \npremeditated, intentional murder of babies. I don't think those things \nought to be equated because I think they are of a very different \nnature.\n  Furthermore, the resolution of the Senator from Connecticut, it is my \nunderstanding, does not call for the investigations that I think are \nnecessary to determine how widespread these practices are, under what \ncircumstances they are occurring, and what more could be done to \nprevent them.\n  For those reasons, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, being a majority leader is not an \neasy job whether you are a Republican or a Democrat. Some good things \nhave been happening in the Senate recently, and I think we should \ncredit both the majority leader and the Republican leader with helping \nto make that happen.\n  Over the last few weeks we have seen the water resources bill come to \nthe floor. The majority leader allowed Senator Boxer and Senator Vitter \nto manage the amendment process, to handle the necessary arguments that \nalways occur about what they will be. They came to a conclusion and \npassed a bill. The bill went through committee, went through the floor. \nIt is a very important bill because it deals with locks, dams, and \nports in the United States. We want to make sure that as the Panama \nCanal is widened and deepened, that ports in the United States are deep \nenough to receive the bigger ships and that the locks and the dams are \nin good enough shape so that commerce can move through the company and \nthe jobs can be created. That is an important piece of legislation.\n  And now we are on the farm bill and we see the Senator from \nMississippi and the Senator from Michigan managing a bill. There is \nplenty of opportunity for amendments, as far as I have been able to \ntell, and that has been very helpful.\n  At the same time, we have coming out of the Judiciary Committee, \nafter several days of intense work, a bill on immigration. Probably the \nfour most important words that can be said about the immigration debate \nis that we are all Americans, and Americans know we must have a legal \nimmigration system if we want to be able to say we are all Americans. \nAnd we want one. We don't have an enforceable legal system today. All \nof us know that. None of us like the status quo, I don't think, and all \nof us know the President and the Congress are the only ones who can fix \nit. This is not something we can dump on the mayors or the State \nlegislatures.\n  Many of us haven't formed a final opinion about this legislation that \nis coming forward, but I, for one, respect the fact that it has moved; \nthat it has four principal Republican sponsors and four principal \nDemocratic sponsors. It has moved through the committee, voices have \nbeen heard, it is coming to the floor, and, again, the majority leader \nhas indicated, and the Republican leader has agreed, there will be a \nfull and open debate so the American people can see it and watch us \ncome to a result.\n  All those are good things. In addition, so that we might do that, \nthere are a number of nominations about which we are likely to \ndisagree. They will come after that so as not to interfere with the \nimmigration debate.\n  That brings me to my final point. I would note the fact that with \noccasional interruptions for debate over whether we are going to go to \na budget, which I hope gets resolved, we are on a pretty good path \nright now. I hope the majority and the minority leaders can see that.\n  We are moving this afternoon to a vote on a Federal appellate judge \nfor the D.C. Circuit. A major objective of the Democratic side has been \nto get another judge on that circuit, and the President has nominated a \nperson, Mr. Srinivasan, who, by every account, is an exceptional \nattorney. He came out of the committee with an 18-to-0 vote and has \nwidespread respect and support.\n  The only glitch in the process is the majority leader believed it was \nnecessary to file a cloture motion this week, even though the \nRepublican leader had agreed we would have an up-or-down vote on the \nTuesday we get back, and every indication is that almost everyone would \nvote for that judge. That has now been resolved, and we are going to \nvote this afternoon at 2 p.m. I know better than to predict how the \nSenate will vote, but I will vote for Mr. Srinivasan, and I suspect he \nwill be easily confirmed.\n  In all of this the majority leader has believed it was necessary to \nsuggest that somehow there is a problem with the President's \nnominations being considered by the Senate, so I think it is important \nthat someone other than the Republican leader--because it is his job, \nreally, to defend our side--lay out the facts, and I hope I can do that \nwith some credibility because I worked with my Democratic colleagues at \nthe beginning of the last Congress and at the beginning of this \nCongress to make it easier for this President and future Presidents to \nhave their nominations considered. We have changed the rules to make it \neasier.\n  Just a few months ago, in a long discussion that involved Senators on \nboth sides in a debate on the floor, we made a number of changes to \nmake it easier for a President to have his nominations considered. And \n2 years ago we adopted the expedited nominations, where nominations \nsimply come to the desk. If no single Senator wants it sent to \ncommittee, it just sits there until all the paper is in, then the \nmajority leader will just move it on. Within the next few days there \nwill be a number of\n\n[[Page S3808]]\n\nthose that come out of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee. So that speeds things up.\n  We removed from the list of nominations about 160 low-level executive \nnominations. They are not subject anymore to Senate advise and consent. \nThe President may just go ahead and appoint those persons.\n  We have gotten rid of the secret hold, which was used for a long time \nto hold up nominees, and even to block them, because no one knew who \nwas doing that. Earlier this year we changed the rules so that when a \ndistrict judge comes up, there can't be a long debate after the \ndistrict judge comes to the floor. As a result, things are moving along \nvery well.\n  So I would like to say there is not a problem with the President's \nnominations being considered in a timely fashion by the Senate. There \nis no problem. There is, however, the responsibility for advice and \nconsent. Most of our Founders did not want a king. They created a \nCongress and they said: Here is an advice and consent. So we now have \nabout 1,000 people the President will nominate whom we are supposed to \nconsider, and we should do that well. That is our job to do, and it is \nour check on a runaway Executive.\n  When I first came here, Senator Byrd made wonderful speeches about \nthat. I remember the speeches Senator Kennedy gave from the back row, \nwith that big booming voice of his, about President George W. Bush's \nrecess appointments and how offended he was by those because they \noffended the Constitution. Senator Byrd, as I mentioned, was very \neloquent, going all the way back to President Reagan's days.\n  So we have always jealously defended the people's right to have an \nelected group of representatives to check the Executive, and we need to \nuse that in a responsible way. Therefore, it is important to have an \naccurate report on just how well President Obama is being treated by \nthe Senate in terms of his nominations.\n  I have just noted that we have changed the rules to make it easier. I \ndid not even say we have even made it easier for the nominees; we set \nup a working process to make it easier. I like to call it a response to \nthe ``innocent until nominated'' syndrome.\n  The President picks some well-respecting person from the Midwest and \nsends his or her nomination to the Senate, and all of a sudden it is as \nif they were a criminal of some kind. That is because there were so \nmany conflicting forms to fill out it was easy to make a mistake and \nlook as though you were misleading the Senate. We have tried to \nsimplify that, and this President is the first beneficiary of that \nchange.\n  So this President is the first beneficiary of consecutive Congresses \nthat have changed the rules to reduce the number of potential nominees \nsubjected to advice and consent. We have expedited a number of others, \nand we have made it easier--easier and quicker--for the President to \nhave his nominations considered. This President is the first to benefit \nfrom that.\n  So what are the results? The majority leader suggested there was \ndelay and obstruction. Those words just come out automatically \nsometimes when people wake up in the morning on that side of the aisle. \nBut let's look at the facts.\n  I asked the Congressional Research Service to take a look at the \nWashington Post article written earlier this year--now, these are not \nRepublican people I am asking, this is the Congressional Research \nService--about how President Obama is being treated in terms of his \nSenate nominees.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, as of May 16, 2013--\nthat is last week--President Obama's Cabinet nominees were still, on \naverage, moving from announcement to confirmation faster than those of \nPresident George W. Bush or President Clinton. President Obama's \nnominees were moving from announcement to confirmation, at that time \nlast week, in 50.5 days, George W. Bush averaged 52 days, and President \nClinton averaged 55 days.\n  So let me say that again: President Obama's Cabinet nominees are \nmoving ahead in the Senate more rapidly than those of his two \npredecessors: one of them President George W. Bush and one of them \nPresident Clinton. So there is no delay there that is unusual.\n  It is not unprecedented, Madam President, for some second-term \nnominations to take much longer to move from announcement to \nconfirmation than the average. President Clinton's nominee for \nSecretary of Labor, Alexis Herman, took 135 days; President George W. \nBush's nominee for Attorney General, Alberto Gonzalez, took 85 days. I \nremember the case of one especially distinguished nominee for Secretary \nof Education by President George H.W. Bush, a former Governor of \nTennessee whose name was Alexander. His nomination took 88 days from \nannouncement to confirmation, and President Reagan's nominee for \nAttorney General, Ed Meese, took nearly 1 year.\n  Now that is an unusual case, but it is not so unusual for second-term \nnominees to take a little while--for the Senate to perform advice and \nconsent. And as the Congressional Research Service and the Washington \nPost have reported in their own analysis, President Obama's Cabinet \nnominees are being better treated than either President Bush's or \nPresident Clinton's in terms of the time it takes to confirm them from \nannouncement to confirmation.\n  Now, one last thing. What about judges? Sometimes I have heard \nSenators on that side and Senators on this side get up and give \nconflicting information about whether judges are being considered \nrapidly. Here is what the data says about the judicial nomination \nprocess.\n  If Mr. Srinivasan is confirmed today, as I expect he will be, \nPresident Obama will have had 20 judges confirmed at this point in his \nsecond term, including 6 circuit judges and 14 district court judges. \nAt this point in his second term, President George W. Bush had 4. So \nthat is 20 for President Obama, 4 for President George W. Bush. No \nunusual delay there.\n  Apparently, President Obama's nominations are being considered more \nrapidly than those of President Bush. To be specific, let's go to the \ndistrict court nominations. We know, with all the talk of a filibuster, \nin the history of the Senate there has never been a nominee for a \nFederal district court judge who has ever been denied his seat by a \nfilibuster after that nomination came to the floor. So that needs to be \nsaid, too. But right now there are five pending district judge \nnominations that have been reported from committee that haven't been \nconfirmed.\n  There have been 33 nominations this year. Fourteen are already \nconfirmed, five are reported from committee, as I said, and await floor \naction. They were reported in May and April and three of them in March. \nSo there is no big backlog. There are five. They were reported in the \nlast few weeks. So no excessive delay there.\n  Finally, on circuit court nominations. I mentioned we are likely to \nconfirm one of the three that are today pending, Mr. Srinivasan. Twelve \nnominations of Federal circuit court judges have been received this \nyear. Six will have been confirmed after this afternoon. That leaves \ntwo--two--circuit court judges who have been nominated by the President \nand await floor action. They were reported by the committee in April \nand February.\n  So I can't find any evidence of any delay on Cabinet nominations. In \nfact, President Obama is being treated better than his predecessors. I \ndon't see any evidence of any delay on judicial nominations. After the \nvote on Mr. Srinivasan, President Obama will have 20 confirmed in his \nsecond term, President Bush had 4. And there are only five pending \ndistrict court nominations, all reported within the last few weeks. \nThere are only three circuit nominations, one of which is likely to be \nconfirmed this afternoon. On that one, the majority leader indicated \nMr. Srinivasan, who has such widespread support on both sides of the \naisle, had been waiting forever. Well, he has been waiting a while. \nPresident Obama nominated him on June 11, 2012. But why did he wait? \nMadam President, he had no hearing. Who is in charge of setting \nhearings? The Democratic majority is in charge of setting hearings. The \nRepublicans can't call a hearing in the Judiciary Committee.\n  So their nominee, Mr. Srinivasan, sat there all of last year, after \nJune 11, without a hearing. There may have been delay, but that was a \nself-inflicted delay.\n  What about this year for Mr. Srinivasan? Here is the timeline. He was \nnominated again on January 4 by\n\n[[Page S3809]]\n\nthe President. His hearing was April 10. I don't know why they had to \ngo from January to April to have a hearing, but, again, that is solely \nwithin the control of the Democratic majority. He returned his \nquestions--which we all have to do if we are nominated for an executive \nposition--on May 6. That is this month. The committee considered his \nnomination May 16, which is just last week. They approved it 18 to 0. \nThat is all Democrats and all Republicans voting yes. He came to the \ncalendar of the Senate on May 20. That was on Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Srikanth Srinivasan, of \nVirginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 60 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I will conclude for those who are \nexpecting to do that, but these are timely remarks.\n  So, Mr. Srinivasan, nominated on June 11, 2012--no hearing by the \nDemocratic majority and the executive committee, I wonder why; \nnominated January 4 by President Obama this year again, no hearing \nuntil April 10. If there is any delay there, it has no fault anywhere \non the Republican side. May 6, questions returned; no nominee is \nconsidered by the committee until his questions come back; marked up \nMay 16 last week, 18 to 0, unanimous; came to the floor on Monday and \nthe Republican leader moved yesterday to ask unanimous consent that we \nconsider an up-or-down vote for Mr. Srinivasan when we return after a \nweek, which means he would have been fully considered then, to which \nthe majority leader put down a cloture motion.\n  Now he has removed the cloture motion but there was no need for the \ncloture motion. The only suggestion may be he did it, he made it so it \nwould look as though there was some delay over here, but there is no \ndelay. Mr. Srinivasan has broad support. We are ready to vote for him \nup or down. I think it is time we got away from this idea of \nmanufacturing a crisis about nominations when in fact we have made it \neasier for any President to offer his nominations, and the majority \nleader and Republican leader agreed at the beginning of this year when \nwe did that, that that was the end of the rule changes for the Congress \nin this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes on the Feinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, let me first say about the comments of \nSenator Alexander, you see why he is a former university president, a \nGovernor, a Secretary of Education, a candidate for President, and now \nsome would call him a Senator. I think you would call him a statesman, \nbecause he tries to lay it out in a way we can all understand it, with \nfacts and not hyperbole, and this is an opportunity for us on both \nsides to step back from the brink and actually do the people's \nbusiness, to get something done, to solve big problems.\n  I came to the floor to talk on the Feinstein amendment, knowing it is \nnot up for an hour--and I will be very brief, to my colleague from \nVirginia, because I know he wants to talk about judges--primarily \nbecause there is some misinformation that has been stated. Let me recap \nthe tobacco industry in a very brief summary.\n  Tobacco, like many agricultural products, for years received a price \nsupport system that the Federal Government, the Congress of the United \nStates, put in place. A number of years ago, Members of Congress said, \nfor obvious reasons, the Federal Government probably should not have a \nprice support on something we consider not to be best for people's \nhealth. At that time farmers reluctantly listened to Members of \nCongress who said the international market should be open to you and we \nshould do our best to make it unlimited, and we did. At that time we \neliminated the price support system.\n  Senator Feinstein came to the floor--I do not think she did this \nintentionally--and she said it costs the American taxpayer $10 billion. \nIn fact, there was not one dime of American taxpayer money that went to \nthe tobacco buyer; 100 percent of the cost of the elimination of that \nprogram was absorbed by the tobacco companies. So, yes, if the purchase \nof a pack of cigarettes and the profit that goes to a tobacco company \nand the $1.01 in Federal taxes they pay per pack of cigarettes is the \nAmerican taxpayer paying the price of the buyout, she is right. I am \nnot sure you can make that connection.\n  But I want to state for my colleagues: The Federal Treasury did not \npay $10 billion to buy out tobacco farmers. It was the companies, the \nones that understand they have to have a viable, abundant source of \nproduct. Sixty percent of what we grow in the United States is shipped \nfor export. It does not go to the domestic market.\n  Let me say to my colleague, if the intention of this is to be \npunitive to this product, for gosh sakes, come to the floor; change \nyour amendment; let's vote up or down as to whether tobacco is going to \nbe legal. If the purpose here is to suggest we are going to save \ntaxpayer money, let me suggest if you put every tobacco farmer out of \nbusiness--and this is the commodity that achieves, actually, our best \nbalance of trade in agricultural products--you would make a real long-\nterm mistake. The only thing this commodity, this agricultural \ncommodity, asks is let us participate in the Federal Crop Insurance \nProgram. Without that protection it is impossible for my neighbor, your \nneighbor, the backbone of the community--a farmer--to go to a bank and \nsay: Can you lend me enough money to plant my crop this year? And if \nMother Nature is good and I work hard I am going to be able to sell \nthis product, I am going to be able to pay you back, and I am going to \nbe able to make a profit to feed my family. Without that assurance of a \nsafety net they would never get the bank to loan the money.\n  This is about availability of capital, this one cost. Why in the \nworld we would pick one commodity out of the entire agricultural \nindustry and say everybody else can participate in the crop insurance \nprogram but you can't is insane.\n  Let me say to my colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, I \ndon't think this was intentional. I think she either got bad staff \ninformation or she made a gaffe.\n  To my colleagues, let me encourage you, vote against this amendment. \nDon't do this to a piece of the agricultural community that is \nprofitable, that works hard, but, more importantly, contributes a lot \nto the backbone of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise to support the nomination of \nSrikanth Srinivasan to be judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nD.C. Circuit. This matter will be before us for a vote later today. I \nwant to talk for a bit about Sri's significant qualifications. I am \ngoing to discount the fact that he was born in Kansas and raised in \nKansas, as I was. I will not take that into account. I will discount \nthe fact he lives in Virginia as I do, and focus on other \nqualifications because he has them by the boatload.\n  Sri has a wonderful background that equips him for this most \nimportant judicial position, and this has been a position that has been \nvacant since June of 2008. He was an undergraduate and then law degree \nand then business degree, MBA at Stanford after he grew up in Lawrence, \nKS. Like many law graduates, his next step was to work in a clerkship \nwith appellate judges. He\n\n[[Page S3810]]\n\nworked first for a wonderful Virginia jurist, Judge J. Harvie \nWilkinson, who was the chief judge of the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals headquartered in Richmond. Judge Wilkinson is well known as a \nsuperb legal scholar and judge.\n  After he completed that clerkship, he had the honor of being selected \nto work as a clerk for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, also a tremendous \nhonor for a young lawyer. I talked at length with Mr. Srinivasan and \nheard about the fact that he learned a great deal from both of these \njudges about judicial temperament and the importance of so many aspects \nto be a good judge.\n  Sri had the expertise developed in private practice at one of \nAmerica's major firms, O'Melveny and Myers. O'Melveny and Myers has had \na very significant pro bono practice for years, headed by Bill Coleman, \nwho was a long-time official--one of the lawyers who worked on the \nBrown v. Board of Education case in the 1950s. Sri eventually became \nthe leader of the appellate practice in O'Melveny and Myers, in that \ncapacity doing good work. He has been a teacher at Harvard Law School.\n  Probably most specific to the needs of the D.C. Circuit, Sri has had \na long career working in the Solicitor General's Office, the key legal \noffice of the United States, charged with representing the United \nStates on important matters before the Supreme Court and the Federal \nappellate courts. He has worked two stints in the Solicitor General's \nOffice, having worked both under the Solicitor General's Office during \nPresident Bush 43's tenure, and then again returning to work as the \nprincipal deputy solicitor general under President Obama. In that \ncapacity he has had extensive arguments, more than 20 arguments before \nthe U.S. Supreme Court and numerous appellate court arguments in the \nFederal appellate courts, including the D.C. Circuit Court for which he \nis nominated.\n  Srikanth Srinivasan enjoys broad support. Numerous officials in the \nSolicitor General's Office under both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations have weighed in on behalf of his candidacy. The ABA, \nAmerican Bar Association, which looks at candidates and scrutinizes \ntheir qualifications, has given him the ``most qualified'' award, their \nhighest recommendation. He comes with significant support in this body \nand others with whom he has practiced.\n  The area I probably spent most time with him on as I was interviewing \nhim was the whole notion of judicial temperament. These are important \npositions, and under the Constitution we grant them to people for life. \nYou can have all the intellectual qualifications, but if you do not \nhave the life experience to enable you to understand situations and \npass judgment on matters important to people, and if you do not have \nthe temperament to work in a collegial body--circuit courts, as you \nknow, hear cases generally in panels of three and then occasionally \nhear cases en banc, the entire list of the circuit court judges for the \nD.C. Circuit would sit together--it is not enough to be a scholar; you \nhave to be a good listener, you have to be a good colleague. Srikanth \nSrinivasan's career is a track record of his dedication and ambition, \nbut his temperament is a real tribute to his humility, to his ability \nto listen not only to litigants but to other judges.\n  I think these credentials, both his formal credentials--his work \nexperience and temperament--would make him an excellent choice. For \nthat reason I am proud to stand up as one of his home State Senators. I \nam proud to acknowledge the Judiciary Committee's unanimous vote on his \nbehalf and urge my colleagues today as we move to the vote to support \nhis nomination. None of us will be disappointed in his work as a D.C. \nCircuit judge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I voted for this nominee out of \ncommittee. I will vote for this nominee on the floor of the Senate. He \nis well qualified for this position.\n  I come to the floor not to repeat what a lot of other people have \nsaid about this nominee, but the process that was connected with \narranging the vote for today's vote. Basically I want to speak about \nthe needless shenanigans that have gone on before we get to this point \nwhere we vote at 2 o'clock.\n  Today's nominee for the D.C. Circuit was voted out of committee 1 \nweek ago, on May 16, a unanimous vote of 18 to 0. He was placed on the \nExecutive Calendar 3 days ago, on Monday, May 20. One day later, on May \n21, the Republicans cleared this nominee to have an up-or-down vote \nwhen we returned from the Memorial Day recess, but the majority leader \nwas not content to take yes for an answer. One day after this nominee \nwas placed on the Executive Calendar and after Republicans agreed to an \nup-or-down vote, the majority leader chose to file cloture.\n  Why file cloture? Why would the majority leader do that on a nominee \nwhom the minority party, the Republicans, were ready and willing to \nvote on, backed up by the fact that every Republican on the committee \nvoted for this nominee?\n  There is only one plausible answer: That is part of the majority's \nattempt to create the appearance of obstruction where no obstruction \never existed. It is pure nonsense. It is a transparent attempt to \nmanufacture a crisis, a crisis that does not exist. The fact of the \nmatter is there is no obstruction and particularly no obstruction on \nthis nominee, and the other side knew it before they filed cloture.\n  This morning in his opening remarks the majority leader tried to \nargue he has had to file cloture 58 times. But what the majority leader \ndid this week illustrates precisely why that claim is completely \nwithout merit.\n  What the Majority Leader did fits neatly into the Democratic \nMajority's playbook.\n  First, file cloture for no apparent reason, none whatsoever. And then \nimmediately turn around and claim: See, look everybody, we had to file \ncloture.\n  The fact is, we are confirming the President's nominee--all \nnominees--at a near-record pace. After today, the Senate will have \nconfirmed 193 lower court nominees. We have defeated only two. That is \n193 to 2, which in baseball terms is a .990 batting average. Anybody \nwould agree that is an outstanding record. Who could complain about 99 \npercent?\n  After today--this year alone, the first year of the President's \nsecond term--the Senate will have confirmed 22 judicial nominees. Let's \ncompare that to the previous President's first year of his second \nterm--President Bush--when there was a Democratic Congress. In that \nsame period of time in 2005, the Senate had only confirmed four \nnominees. So that is a record of 22--the first year of this President's \nsecond term--compared to only 4 for the first year of President Bush's \nsecond term.\n  If we were treating this President in the same way the Senate \nDemocrats treated President Bush in 2005, we would not be confirming \nthe 22nd nominee, we would be confirming only the 4th. So it should be \nclear to everyone that these are needless shenanigans.\n  Anyway, based on that record, what can the Senate Democrats possibly \ncomplain about? The bottom line is they can't complain--or they \nshouldn't complain. That is not based upon rhetoric but based on the \nrecord of 22 so far this year and 193 total confirmations for this \nPresident versus 2 disapprovals.\n  Of course, because the record is so good, the other side needs to \nmanufacture a crisis, and that is why the other side filed cloture on \nthis nomination just 1 day after it appeared on the Executive Calendar.\n  Yesterday, when the majority leader was pressed on why he chose to \nfile cloture 1 single day after his nomination appeared on the \nExecutive Calendar, he pointed to the fact that the nominee was first \nnominated in the year 2012. But apparently the majority leader was \nunaware that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee made no effort to \nschedule a hearing on this nominee until late last year.\n  Apparently, the majority leader was unaware that by January of this \nyear, we learned the nominee was potentially involved in the quid pro \nquo that Mr. Perez--the President's nominee for Labor Secretary--\norchestrated between the Department of Justice and the city of St. \nPaul.\n  I spoke on this issue last week regarding the deal Mr. Perez struck, \nwhere he agreed the Department would decline two False Claims Act cases \nin exchange for the city of St. Paul withdrawing a case from the \nSupreme\n\n[[Page S3811]]\n\nCourt. I am not going to go into those details again, but that is a \nvery serious issue. The Department--and as it turns out Mr. Perez in \nparticular--bartered away a case worth about $200 million of taxpayers' \nmoney to come back into the Federal Treasury under the False Claims \nAct. To have that case withdrawn is a pretty serious matter.\n  As it turns out, the nominee before us today happened to be the \nlawyer in the Solicitor General's Office who handled the case Mr. Perez \ndesperately wanted withdrawn from the Supreme Court.\n  So, as would be expected, any Member of the Senate--particularly \nthose who have the responsibility in the minority--needed to know what \nthe nominee knew about the quid pro quo and what Mr. Perez told the \ncommittee about that deal.\n  We needed the documents about this issue, and we needed to speak with \nthe witnesses involved, but the Department was desperate to keep those \ndocuments from Congress. They were desperate to keep the witnesses from \nbeing involved and interviewed.\n  The bottom line is that the Department of Justice dragged its feet \nfor months. If the Department of Justice had turned over those \ndocuments and made witnesses available way back when we asked for them, \nthe hearing for this nominee could have been one of the first we had \nthis year. Instead, the Department of Justice chose to try their best \nto keep Congress from getting to the bottom of that quid pro quo, and, \nfrankly, Mr. Perez's involvement in that matter.\n  If the majority wishes to complain about the nominee having his \nhearing in April rather than February, they should pick up the phone \nand call those in charge at the Department of Justice and ask: Why \ndidn't you give Congress the information they needed?\n  It wasn't the Senate Republicans who withheld the documents, it was \nthe Department of Justice. It wasn't Senate Republicans who held up the \nnominee's hearing, it was the Department of Justice.\n  The bottom line is that the Senate is processing the President's \nnominees exceptionally fairly. I will not repeat those statistics \nbecause I have already gone through them in this speech and in previous \nspeeches.\n  This President is being treated much more fairly than Senate \nDemocrats treated President Bush in 2005.\n  The fact is this: Filing cloture on this nominee--who will probably \npass unanimously--was nothing but a transparent attempt to create the \nappearance of obstruction.\n  As I said, I intend to support this nominee, just as I did in \ncommittee, and I encourage my colleagues to support the nomination as \nwell.\n  But as we move forward on these nominees, I wish we could stop these \nneedless shenanigans. I wish the other side would stop shedding those \ncrocodile tears. The statistics of approval by this Senate of judicial \nnominees, which is 193 to 2, is no justification for any crocodile \ntears whatsoever.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, today this body will have the chance to \nvote on the nomination of the highly qualified Sri Srinivasan for the \nD.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I am a member of the Judiciary Committee and have had the honor and \nprivilege of chairing Mr. Srinivasan's confirmation hearing. I can say, \nwithout question, he has the background, skills and, perhaps most \nimportantly, the temperament to serve as a circuit court judge.\n  He is one of the single most qualified judicial nominees I have seen \nin my years in this body, and he deserves better than the games which \nhave been played with his confirmation. He already has bipartisan \nsupport. Now let's work together and give him a strong bipartisan vote.\n  The Constitution of the United States gives the Senate the \nresponsibility to advise and consent to the President's nominations for \nimportant posts, such as the bench of the D.C. Circuit Court of \nAppeals. It is certainly our responsibility to review and vet \ncandidates--nominees--who come over from the President. We should not \nsimply serve as a rubberstamp but neither should we be a firewall, \nunreasonably blocking qualified nominees from service at the highest \nlevels of our government.\n  Our Nation's courts should be above politics. When the President \nsubmits a highly qualified candidate of good character and sound legal \nmind, as that of Mr. Srinivasan, then absent exceptional circumstances \nthat candidate should be entitled to a rollcall vote.\n  Up to this point in President Obama's administration--nearly 1,600 \ndays--the Senate has failed to live up to its responsibility and to \nconfirm any nominee to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The D.C. \nCircuit Court of Appeals is often called the second most important \ncourt in the Nation.\n  Similar to the Supreme Court, the D.C. Court of Appeals handles cases \nthat impact Americans all over the country and from all walks of life. \nIt regularly hears cases that range very broadly from terrorism and \ndetention to the scope of Federal agency power. Yet today it is \ncritically understaffed. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has not seen \na nominee confirmed since President George W. Bush's fourth nominee to \nthat court was confirmed in 2006--7 years ago.\n  Republicans in this Chamber filibustered President Obama's nominee, \nCaitlin Halligan, until she ultimately--after hundreds and hundreds of \ndays of waiting across several Congresses--gave up and withdrew. Her \nopponents said the caseload at the D.C. Circuit was too low and that it \ndid not deserve another judge.\n  Such concerns about caseload did not prevent the Republican-led \nSenate from confirming two nominees to the 10th seat on the D.C. \nCircuit and one to the 11th. Mr. Srinivasan is not nominated for the \n10th or 11th seat on the D.C. Circuit but for the 8th.\n  We need to confirm Mr. Srinivasan and we need to act quickly on the \nPresident's next nominee for that court and the one after that.\n  I believe we have a chance to start fresh with Mr. Srinivasan, who \nwould serve equally well and ably on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, \nas might Ms. Halligan.\n  Mr. Srinivasan has a razor-sharp legal mind. He served in the \nSolicitor General's Office for both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations and has earned the bipartisan support of his \ncolleagues. Twelve former Solicitors General and Principal Deputy \nSolicitors General wrote a letter supporting his nomination--6 \nDemocrats and 6 Republicans.\n  The letter, which is signed by conservative legal luminaries such as \nPaul Clement and Ted Olson, notes that Mr. Srinivasan is ``one of the \nbest appellate lawyers in the country.'' They commented further in the \nletter and said that he has an ``unsurpassed'' work ethic and is \n``extremely well prepared to take on the intellectual rigors of serving \nas a judge on the D.C. Circuit.''\n  My point is a simple one: Sri is a capable and, in fact, highly \naccomplished attorney, with the character and demeanor to serve \nadmirably on this bench, which has sat without a nominee from the Obama \nadministration for the entire time our current President has served.\n  Sri Srinivasan has earned bipartisan support. Today, let's give him a \nbipartisan vote.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that any time \nduring quorum calls leading up to the vote be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S3812]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I certainly recognize that providing advice \nand consent of Presidential nominees is one of our most important \nresponsibilities as Members of the Senate, and it is a responsibility \nthat I expect and believe all of us take very seriously.\n  On a number of occasions, I have had the opportunity to meet Sri \nSrinivasan, whom President Obama has now nominated to fill a vacancy on \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. I have \nfound Sri to be a highly qualified candidate who has a distinguished \ncareer in the private sector and in the Department of Justice of both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations, for President Bush and \nPresident Obama. I announced my support for his confirmation in advance \nof the Judiciary Committee realizing the same circumstance I realized, \nwhich is that we have a very highly qualified individual of integrity \nwho has been nominated by the President. Of course, the Judiciary \nCommittee unanimously supported that nomination to confirm him.\n  Sri is a fellow Kansan and is one of our State's most accomplished \nlegal minds. He was born in India and moved with his parents to \nLawrence, KS, where he graduated valedictorian from Lawrence High \nSchool in 1985. As do most Kansans, he enjoyed basketball and at one \npoint in time was a guard on the high school basketball team playing \nalongside one of our State's most famous athletes, Danny Manning.\n  After high school, he went to Stanford University, earning a \nbachelor's degree, an MBA, and a law degree.\n  Sri served as a clerk for the U.S. Supreme Court and served with \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor and later worked in the Solicitor General's \nOffice under President George W. Bush. He became the Principal Deputy \nSolicitor General in 2011.\n  Sri has argued more than two dozen cases before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, and his nomination is supported by 12 former Solicitors General \nand Principal Deputy Solicitors General evenly split among political \nparties.\n  If confirmed today, Sri would become the first South Asian to serve \non a Federal circuit court.\n  I wish to indicate to my colleagues how proud Kansans are of Sri and \nhis success, his accomplishments, and I am pleased to support his \nnomination. He is one of our Nation's leading appellate lawyers, and I \nbelieve he will serve our Nation well on the U.S. Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit has primary responsibility to review administrative actions \ntaken by countless Federal departments and agencies. The court's \ndecisions--including its recent invalidation of President Obama's \nunconstitutional ``recess'' appointments--often have significant \npolitical implications. As a result, this body--the Senate--has a \nlongstanding practice and tradition of scrutinizing nominees to the \nD.C. Circuit very carefully. When evaluating those nominees, we have \nalso carefully considered the need for additional judges on that court.\n  In July 2006 President Bush nominated an eminently qualified \nindividual, Peter Keisler, to fill a seat on the D.C. Circuit. I know \nPeter Keisler. Peter Keisler is among the very finest attorneys I have \never worked with. In fact, most who know him would agree he is among \nthe very finest attorneys in the entire country. He is one who happened \nto have enjoyed bipartisan support throughout the legal profession at \nthe time of his nomination. Nevertheless, Democratic Senators blocked \nMr. Keisler's nomination, and his nomination simply languished in the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  At the time a number of my Democratic colleagues signed a letter \narguing that a nominee to the D.C. Circuit ``should under no \ncircumstances be considered--much less confirmed--before we first \naddress the very need for that judgeship.'' Those Senators argued that \nthe D.C. Circuit's modest caseload simply did not justify the \nconfirmation of any additional judge to that court.\n  More than 6 years have elapsed from that moment, but the D.C. \nCircuit's caseload remains just as minimal as it was back then. The \ncourt's caseload has actually decreased since the time Democrats \nblocked Mr. Keisler. The total number of appeals filed is down over 13 \npercent, and the total number of appeals pending is down over 10 \npercent. With just 359 pending appeals per panel, the D.C. Circuit's \naverage workload is less than half of other Federal appellate courts.\n  Some have sought to make much of the fact that since 2006 two of the \ncourt's judges have taken senior status, leaving only seven active \njudges on the D.C. Circuit. But the court's caseload has declined so \nmuch in recent years that even filings per active, nonsenior, sitting \njudge are roughly the same as they were back then.\n  Of course, this doesn't account for the six senior judges on the D.C. \nCircuit who continue to hear appeals and author opinions. Their \ncontributions are such that the actual work for each active, nonsenior \njudge has declined and the caseload burden for the D.C. Circuit judges \nis less than it was when the Democrats blocked Mr. Keisler on the basis \nof declining caseload in the D.C. Circuit. Indeed, the average filings \nper panel--perhaps the truest measure of actual workload per judge--is \ndown almost 6 percent since the time Democrats blocked Mr. Keisler. And \nthose who work at the court suggest that in reality, the workload isn't \nany different today than it was back at the time the Democrats blocked \nMr. Keisler's nomination to that court.\n  Much like Mr. Keisler, the D.C. Circuit nominee before us today, Mr. \nSrinivasan, is exceptionally qualified, and I am pleased to say he \nenjoys broad bipartisan support from throughout the legal profession.\n  Unlike what the Democrats did to Mr. Keisler, I will vote to confirm \nMr. Srinivasan. I do not believe in partisan retribution and hope that, \nmoving forward, the Senate--whether controlled by Democrats or \nRepublicans at any moment in the future--will rise above such past \ndifferences and disputes.\n  The D.C. Circuit is one area in which we share common ground. Both \nDemocrats and Republicans have argued repeatedly that the D.C. Circuit \nhas too many authorized judgeships. Indeed, while other Federal circuit \ncourts throughout the country struggle to keep up with rising \ncaseloads, in each of the last several years the D.C. Circuit has \ncanceled regularly scheduled argument dates due to a lack of pending \ncases.\n  For these reasons I am an original cosponsor of S. 699, the Court \nEfficiency Act, which was introduced last month. The bill does not \ndirectly impact today's nominee, but it will reallocate unneeded \njudgeships from the D.C. Circuit to other Federal appellate courts \nwhere caseloads are many times higher than that of the D.C. Circuit.\n  Especially after we have confirmed Mr. Srinivasan, I hope Members on \nboth sides of the aisle will join me in ensuring that these unnecessary \nD.C. Circuit judgeships are reallocated to courts that need those judge \nslots.\n  I certainly hope neither the White House nor my Democratic colleagues \nwill instead decide to play politics and seek--without any legitimate \njustification--to pack the D.C. Circuit with unneeded judges simply in \norder to advance a partisan agenda.\n  Now, importantly, it was stated earlier in debate that we should stop \n``playing games'' with this nomination. We agree. In fact, we could not \nagree more. Unfortunately, the only game played was by the majority \nleader in manufacturing a false impression by filing cloture one day \nafter the nominee was listed on the Executive Calendar and after Senate \nRepublicans agreed to a vote.\n  It has also been suggested that Senate Republicans have somehow \nrefused to fill this seat or any other on the D.C. Circuit since 2006. \nApparently, this is representative of a memory lapse or perhaps they \nwant to rewrite history.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n\n[[Page S3813]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The nomination of Srikanth Srinivasan to the \nD.C. Circuit Court.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am glad to hear what my friend from Utah said about voting for this \nnominee because this is the second time this year the majority leader \nhad to file cloture on one of President Obama's well-qualified nominees \nto the D.C. Circuit. Sri Srinivasan is not a nominee who should require \ncloture, and I am glad he is not going to now that cooler heads have \nprevailed, but neither was Caitlin Halligan. Caitlin Halligan is a \nwoman who is extraordinarily well qualified and amongst the most \nqualified judicial nominees I have seen from any administration. It was \nshameful that Senate Republicans blocked an up or down vote on her \nnomination with multiple filibusters and procedural objections that \nrequired her to be nominated five times over the last three years.\n  Had she received an up or down vote, I am certain she would have been \nconfirmed and been an outstanding judge on the United States Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia. Instead, all Senate Republicans \nbut one supported the filibuster and refused to vote up or down on this \nwoman, who is highly-qualified and would have filled a needed judgeship \non the D.C. Circuit. Senate Republicans attacked her for legal advocacy \non behalf of her client, the State of New York. It is wrong to \nattribute the legal positions a lawyer takes when advocating for a \nclient with what that person would do as an impartial judge. That is \nnot the American tradition. That is not what Republicans insisted was \nthe standard for nominees of Republican Presidents but that is what \nthey did to derail the nomination of Caitlin Halligan.\n  Also disconcerting were the comments by Republicans after their \nfilibuster in which they gloated about payback. That, too, is wrong. It \ndoes our Nation and our Federal Judiciary no good when they place their \ndesire to engage in tit-for-tat over the needs of the American people. \nI rejected that approach while moving to confirm 100 of President \nBush's judicial nominees in just 17 months in 2001 and 2002.\n  Like Caitlin Halligan, Sri Srinivasan has had an exemplary legal \ncareer and has the support of legal professionals from across the \npolitical spectrum. Born in Chandigarh, India, he grew up in Lawrence, \nKS, and earned his B.A., with honors and distinction, from Stanford \nUniversity. He also earned his M.B.A. from the Stanford Graduate School \nof Business along with his J.D., with distinction, from Stanford Law \nSchool, where he was inducted to the Order of the Coif. At Stanford Law \nSchool, Sri Srinivasan served as the Note Editor of the Stanford Law \nReview. After completing law school, he clerked for Judge J. Harvie \nWilkinson III on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and \nfor Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Sri Srinivasan has experience in private practice, where he served as \na partner and chaired the Appellate Practice at O'Melveny & Myers LLP. \nHe has also served in the Office of the Solicitor General during both \nthe Bush and Obama administrations, where he is currently the Principal \nDeputy Solicitor General. He has argued more than 25 cases before the \nU.S. Supreme Court and several cases before the U.S. Courts of Appeal. \nThe ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated \nhim ``well qualified'' to serve on the D.C. Circuit, its highest \nrating. The Judiciary Committee reported him a week ago by a unanimous \n18-to-0 vote. That means every single Republican on the committee who \nhad a chance to review the nominee's record and to ask him questions \nsupported him.\n  He was first nominated almost 1 year ago--a longer wait than any \nother current judicial nomination. His Committee hearing was delayed by \n4 months from when I first planned on holding it, at the request of the \nRepublicans. Sri Srinivasan has waited long enough, and, given his \nunanimous support in Committee, there was no reason to delay his \nconfirmation. The Senate confirmed 18 of President Bush's circuit \nnominees within a week of being reported by the Judiciary Committee, \nwhile not a single one of President Obama's circuit nominees has \nreceived a floor vote within a week of being reported. Senate Democrats \neven allowed a vote on a controversial Fourth Circuit nominee within \njust 5 days of being reported. By that standard, there is no reason not \nto vote now on Sri Srinivasan. When confirmed, he will be the first \nAsian American in history to serve on the D.C. Circuit, and the first \nSouth Asian American to serve as a Federal circuit judge.\n  But, regrettably, even after their unwarranted filibuster of Caitlin \nHalligan, and even after their efforts to delay Sri Srinivasan's \nconfirmation, Senate Republicans are expanding their efforts through a \n``wholesale filibuster'' of nominations to the D.C. Circuit by \nintroducing a legislative proposal to strip three judgeships from the \nD.C. Circuit.\n  I am almost tempted to suggest they amend their bill to make it \neffective whenever the next Republican President is elected. I say that \nto point out they had no concerns with supporting President Bush's four \nSenate-confirmed nominees to the D.C. Circuit. They did this even \nthough for the previous President--a Democrat--they said we had too \nmany judges there. But as soon as a Republican came in they suddenly \nfound the need and did confirm four judges to the D.C. Circuit. Those \nnominees filled the very vacancies for the 9th, 10th, and even the 11th \njudgeship on the court that Senate Republicans are demanding be \neliminated now that President Obama has been reelected by the American \npeople. In other words, filling those seats was okay with a Republican \nPresident but not okay with a Democratic President. The target of this \nlegislation seems apparent when its sponsors emphasize that it is \ndesigned to take effect immediately and acknowledge that \n``[h]istorically, legislation introduced in the Senate altering the \nnumber of judgeships has most often postponed enactment until the \nbeginning of the next President's term'' but that their legislation \n``does not do this.'' It is just another one of their concerted efforts \nto block this President from appointing judges to the D.C. Circuit.\n\n  In support of this effort, Senate Republicans are citing a \nsubcommittee hearing they held back in 1995 on the D.C. Circuit's \ncaseload in an attempt to eliminate the 12th seat during President \nClinton's tenure. They are fond of citing the testimony of Judge \nLaurence Silberman, a Reagan appointee, that he felt the 12th seat was \nnot necessary. What Senate Republicans do not mention is that Judge \nSilberman believed that 11 judgeships was the proper number on that \nCircuit, and that the notion that the D.C. Circuit should have only \nnine judges was ``quite farfetched.'' I would echo those comments, and \nnote that it is beyond farfetched that the same Senate Republicans who \ncite Judge Silberman's view on the 12th seat are ignoring the rest of \nhis statement and seeking to reduce the court to eight seats. In fact, \nwe have already acted to eliminate the 12th seat from the D.C. Circuit. \nWhat Senate Republicans are now proposing during this President's \ntenure is the elimination of the 11th, 10th, and 9th seats, as well.\n  In its April 5, 2013 letter, the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates, chaired by Chief Justice John Roberts, sent us recommendations \n``based on our current caseload needs.'' They did not recommend \nstripping judgeships from the D.C. Circuit but state that they should \ncontinue at 11. Four are currently vacant. According to the \nAdministrative Office of U.S. Courts, the caseload per active judge for \nthe D.C. Circuit has actually increased by 50 percent since 2005, when \nthe Senate confirmed President Bush's nominee to fill the 11th seat on \nthe D.C. Circuit. When the Senate confirmed Thomas Griffith--President \nBush's nominee to the 11th seat in 2005--the confirmation resulted in \nthere being approximately 119 pending cases per active D.C. Circuit \njudge. There are currently 188 pending cases for each active judge on \nthe D.C. Circuit, more than 50 percent higher.\n  This falls into a larger pattern that we have seen from Senate \nRepublicans over the past 20 years. While they had no problem adding a \n12th seat to the D.C. Circuit in 1984, and voting for President Reagan \nand President George H.W. Bush's nominees for that seat, they suddenly \n``realized'' in 1995, when a Democrat served as President, that the \ncourt did not need that judge. When Judge Merrick Garland was finally \nconfirmed in 1997, many Senate\n\n[[Page S3814]]\n\nRepublicans voted against him, because they had decided that the 11th \nseat was also unnecessary. Senate Republicans then refused to act on \nPresident Clinton's final two nominees to the D.C. Circuit, one of whom \nnow serves on the Supreme Court.\n  In 2002, during the George W. Bush administration, the D.C. Circuit's \ncaseload had dropped to its lowest level in the last 20 years. During \nthat Republican administration, Senate Republicans had no problem \nvoting to confirm President Bush's nominees to the 9th, 10th, and 11th \nseats. These are the same seats they wish to eliminate now that Barack \nObama is President, even though the court's current caseload is \nconsistent with the average over the past 10 years. Maybe they are \nsuggesting people work harder and more effectively if there is a \nDemocrat in the White House than a Republican, but I suspect they may \nhave a different motive. Even on its own terms, it is apparent this has \nnothing to do with caseload; it has everything to do with who is \nPresident.\n  Contrary to what Senate Republicans are arguing, the D.C. Circuit \ndoes not even have the lowest caseload in the country. The circuit with \nthe lowest number of pending appeals per active judge is currently the \nEighth Circuit, to which the Senate recently confirmed a nominee from \nIowa, supported by the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. I do not recall seeing any bills from Senate Republicans to \neliminate that seat.\n  So I think it depends more on politics than on judicial independence, \nand that is not a path to follow. The Federal courts have been too \npoliticized as it is. There have been more filibusters and more \nblocking of judicial nominations by President Obama, than of \nnominations by any President of either party in the past. It makes me \nwonder, what is different about this President from all these other \nPresidents that he is given such a more difficult time--even the \nblocking, the filibustering of judges supported by home State \nRepublican Senators.\n  This kind of political falderal with our Federal judiciary has come \nat a price. The Federal judiciary is losing the perception of \nindependence it had before because it is being seen as being \npolitically manipulated, even though virtually every Federal judge I \nhave met--almost every Federal judge I have met--nominated by either a \nRepublican or a Democratic President has shown independence.\n  The public gets a view otherwise, especially when they see a number \nof judicial vacancies where nominations have been made and even \nnominees who get through the Judiciary Committee unanimously or \nvirtually unanimously then have to wait for months and months, even a \nyear, to finally get a vote, and then only after we have either had a \ncloture vote or a threat of a cloture vote.\n  As I have said, I was Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee for \n17 months at the beginning of President George Bush's term, and we put \nthrough 100 of his nominees. Now, in the other 30 months of his first \nterm, with Republicans in charge, they did better. They put through \n105. My point being, of course, that we actually moved his judges \nfaster even than Republicans did when they were in the majority. But \nnow the willingness to cooperate demonstrated there has broken down. \nNow the rules that worked for a Republican President, we are told, \ncannot apply for a Democratic President--especially this President.\n\n  Moreover, the unique character of the D.C. Circuit's caseload means \nthat it is misleading to compare its caseload to that of the other \nCircuits as part of this effort to eliminate its judgeships. The D.C. \nCircuit Court of Appeals is often considered ``the second most \nimportant court in the land'' because of its special jurisdiction and \nbecause of the important and complex cases that it decides. The Court \nreviews complicated decisions and rulemaking of many Federal agencies, \nand in recent years has handled some of the most important terrorism \nand enemy combatant and detention cases since the attacks of September \n11. These cases make incredible demands on the time of the judges \nserving on this Court. It is misleading to cite statistics or contend \nthat hardworking judges have a light or easy workload. All cases are \nnot the same and many of the hardest, most complex and most time-\nconsuming cases in the Nation end up at the D.C. Circuit.\n  Former Chief Judge Harry Edwards has said:\n\n       [R]eview of large, multi-party, difficult administrative \n     appeals is the staple of judicial work in the D.C. Circuit. \n     This alone distinguishes the work of the D.C. Circuit from \n     the work of other Circuits; it also explains why it is \n     impossible to compare the work of the D.C. Circuit with other \n     Circuits by simply referring to raw data on case filings.\n\n  Former Chief Judge Patricia Wald has written:\n\n       The D.C. Circuit hears the most complex, time-consuming, \n     labyrinthine disputes over regulations with the greatest \n     impact on ordinary Americans' lives: clean air and water \n     regulations, nuclear plant safety, health-care reform issues, \n     insider trading and more. These cases can require thousands \n     of hours of preparation by the judges, often consuming days \n     of argument, involving hundreds of parties and interveners, \n     and necessitating dozens of briefs and thousands of pages of \n     record--all of which culminates in lengthy, technically \n     intricate legal opinions . . . The nature of the D.C. \n     Circuit's caseload is what sets it apart from other courts.\n\n  Judge Laurence Silberman has said: ``I very much agree . . . as to \nthe unique nature of the D.C. Circuit's caseload, and therefore do not \nbelieve a direct comparison to the other circuits is called for.''\n  And Chief Justice Roberts, who formerly served on the D.C. Circuit, \nhas noted that ``about two-thirds of the cases before the D.C. Circuit \ninvolve the federal government in some civil capacity, while that \nfigure is less than twenty-five percent nationwide,'' and that less \ntime-consuming ``prisoner petitions which make up a notable portion of \nthe docket nation-wide on other courts of appeals--are a less \nsignificant part of its work.'' He also described the ``D.C. Circuit's \nunique character, as a court with special responsibility to review \nlegal challenges to the conduct of the national government.''\n  The arguments now being made by Senate Republicans to eliminate three \nseats on the D.C. Circuit are not based on the reality of that court's \ncaseload. Even if we do make these misleading comparisons to other \ncircuits, the arguments ultimately do not withstand scrutiny since \nother circuits have caseloads that are lower than the D.C. Circuit's. \nAnd most do not have the complexity of the cases that come to the D.C. \nCircuit. So the D.C. Circuit's need for judges will not be met by Sri \nSrinivasan alone. We must work hard to fill the three additional \nvacancies currently on that court so the D.C. Circuit can have its full \ncomplement of judges to decide some of the most important cases to the \nAmerican people.\n  Some have called the D.C. Circuit a court second only to the Supreme \nCourt in its importance. Let's not politicize it. Let's not say here is \nthis rule that applies to a Republican President, and we want an \nentirely different one with a Democratic President. That does not do \nthe court any good, it does not do the country any good, and it \nactually is beneath this great body, the U.S. Senate.\n  Sri Srinivasan is a superbly-qualified, consensus nominee. I am glad \nthe Republican filibuster has come to an end and the Senate is being \npermitted to vote on this nomination. I will, again, vote in favor of \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. President, I understand we have a vote scheduled for 2 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in support of \nthe nomination of Sri Srinivasan to the D.C. Circuit Court.\n  Mr. Srinivasan is an exemplary nominee to the Federal bench, and I am \nhere to encourage my colleagues to confirm him without delay.\n  Sri Srinivasan is currently the Principal Deputy Solicitor General at \nthe Department of Justice and was previously a partner at the law firm \nof O'Melveny & Myers LLP.\n  Born in India, Mr. Srinivasan grew up in Lawrence, KS, and earned his \nB.A., with honors and distinction, his M.B.A, and his J.D., Order of \nthe Coif, all from Stanford University. After completing law school, \nMr. Srinivasan served as a clerk on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFourth Circuit, and then for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  Mr. Srinivasan has extensive Federal appellate court experience \nrepresenting pro bono clients, private sector clients, and, in his \ncurrent post, the U.S. government.\n\n[[Page S3815]]\n\n  Over the course of his 17-year legal career, Mr. Srinivasan has \nargued an impressive 24 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and 9 cases \nin the Federal courts of appeal. His arguments before the Supreme Court \ninclude a wide range of subject matters ranging from the First \nAmendment, criminal procedure, and foreign sovereign immunity to \nbanking, immigration, and Native American law.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Srinivasan will be the first Asian American in \nhistory to serve on the D.C. Circuit, and the first South Asian \nAmerican to serve as a Federal circuit judge, which is a very \nsignificant milestone.\n  The non-partisan American Bar Association committee that reviews \nevery Federal judicial nominee gave Mr. Srinivasan its highest possible \nrating. And a group of solicitors general and principal deputy \nsolicitors general of the United States wrote a letter saying that \n``Sri has first-rate intellect, an open-minded approach to the law, a \nstrong work ethic, and an unimpeachable character.''\n  In addition to his professional accomplishments, Mr. Srinivasan has \ndedicated substantial time to teaching, mentoring and pro bono \nrepresentation.\n  His achievements as a public servant and a private attorney are \noutstanding, and if confirmed, I have no doubt that he will serve as a \ncommitted and distinguished member of the Federal bench.\n  Mr. Srinivasan has received considerable praise from all parts of the \nlegal community including former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor.\n  In an interview with The New Yorker last year, Ms. O'Connor said she \nremembers Sri, ``as a very skilled, intellectually gifted clerk.'' She \nwent on to say that Mr. Srinivasan deserves a smooth ride to \nconfirmation. She said, ``he's not anybody who's been politically \nactive, he's been very serious in his work habit, and people have had \nan ample opportunity to see his work.''\n  With a strong vote of confidence from Sandra Day O'Connor, an \nesteemed former Supreme Court Justice, Mr. Srinivasan has garnered the \none of greatest endorsements any nominee to the Federal bench can \nreceive in my view.\n  Not only is Mr. Srinivasan remarkably credentialed and widely \nsupported, he is nominated to serve on one of the most important courts \nin the Nation, a court that currently has four of its eleven judgeships \nvacant.\n  The D.C. Circuit is widely regarded as the second-most important \ncourt in the United States, behind only the U.S. Supreme Court, because \nof the complexity and significance of the cases it decides.\n  The court has significant responsibility in deciding cases regarding \nthe balance of powers of the branches of government and actions by \nFederal agencies that affect our health, safety, and industry.\n  With the court's current vacancies, the D.C. Circuit caseload per \nactive judge has increased 50 percent from 2005, when the Senate \nconfirmed a nominee to fill the eleventh seat on the D.C. Circuit \nbench.\n  Vacancies on this court should only be filled by the best and the \nbrightest legal minds in the country--those who have demonstrated the \nmost sophisticated legal and analytical skills, those who have \ncommitted their careers to justice, and those who personify \nprofessional excellence and impeccable character.\n  Based on his impressive qualifications and stature in the legal \ncommunity, it is clear that Mr. Srinivasan embodies those ideals. I \nstrongly support his nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nnomination of Sri Srinivasan to serve on the D.C. Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  There is no question that Mr. Srinivasan has the qualifications and \nexperience to be an outstanding Federal judge. He earned undergraduate, \nbusiness and law degrees from Stanford. He clerked for Supreme Court \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor. He worked at the prestigious law firm \nO'Melveny & Myers where he chaired the firm's appellate practice group. \nHe has worked for nearly a decade in the United States' Solicitor \nGeneral's office, where he currently serves as the Principal Deputy \nSolicitor General. He has argued 20 cases before the United States \nSupreme Court and worked on many more briefs before that court.\n  Mr. Srinivasan has also been praised for his independence and his \nintegrity. He has worked for the Solicitor General's office under both \nDemocratic and Republican administrations. His nomination has been \nstrongly endorsed by former Democratic Solicitors General such as \nWalter Dellinger, Seth Waxman and Neal Katyal, and by former Republican \nSolicitors General such as Paul Clement, Ted Olson and Ken Starr.\n  Mr. Srinivasan was reported out of the Judiciary Committee in a \nunanimous vote. Democrats and Republicans from across the ideological \nspectrum came together to support his nomination.\n  I would also note that Mr. Srinivasan's nomination is a historic one. \nUpon confirmation he will be the first Indian-American to serve on a \nFederal circuit court. I am glad that the Senate is soon going to vote \non Mr. Srinivasan's nomination. This vote is coming not a moment too \nsoon.\n  The D.C. Circuit urgently needs the Senate to confirm judges to serve \non that court. Right now, there are only 7 active status judges on the \nD.C. Circuit. There are supposed to be 11.\n  This vacancy situation is untenable. Retired D.C. Circuit Judge \nPatricia Wald, who served as the chief judge of the Circuit for 5 \nyears, recently wrote in the Washington Post that ``There is cause for \nextreme concern that Congress is systematically denying the court the \nhuman resources it needs to carry out its weighty mandates.''\n  In 2010 the President nominated another well-qualified attorney, \nformer New York solicitor general Caitlin Halligan, to serve on the \nD.C. Circuit, but she was filibustered twice by Senate Republicans.\n  There were no legitimate questions about Ms. Halligan's \nqualifications, her judgment, her temperament, or her ideology. She was \nfilibustered simply because some lobbying interests--mainly the gun \nlobby--did not agree with positions she argued on behalf of her client. \nShe eventually withdrew her nomination.\n  It is truly unfortunate that Ms. Halligan's nomination was \nfilibustered to death. She deserved better. She would have served with \ndistinction on the Federal bench.\n  The Senate urgently needs to address the vacancy situation on the \nD.C. Circuit. We can start by confirming Mr. Srinivasan. We should then \nwork to confirm other qualified nominees to fill vacancies in the D.C. \nCircuit and across the Federal judiciary.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Mr. Srinivasan's nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do not see anyone else seeking \nrecognition.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Srikanth Srinivasan, of Virginia, to be United States Circuit Judge \nfor the District of Columbia Circuit?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to the managers of the bill, and they have \none vote scheduled right now. They expect--they hope--they can have a \ncouple more today, maybe even three today, but they are not sure. It \nwill have to be done by consent. They are confident they can get that \ndone. We will have to wait and see.\n  When this vote is over, we should have in the near future an idea of \nwhat we are going to finish today. If we are here and we have a few \nmore votes, it should not be past 5:00. We will see. We are going to \nfinish today sometime--hopefully soon.\n  A decision is being made as to what we are going to do when we get \nback. The managers of this bill are trying to come up with a finite \nlist of amendments. They hope to be able to do that today.\n  Then we will make a decision on whether we are going to move to \nimmigration when we get back or wait a week. I have spoken to the Gang \nof 8 today, and they are going to give me some indication of what they \nwant to do. I have also spoken to the chairman of the committee, and \nthat decision should be made very soon. We will have a vote on the \nMonday we get back.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 923\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 923, offered by the Senator from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, this amendment is offered on behalf \nof Senator McCain and myself.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, tobacco is not just another crop. It is the \nlargest preventable cause of cancer deaths in this country. Exactly \n443,000 people die every year. It costs Medicaid an additional $22 \nbillion.\n  In 2004 a special assessment of $9.6 billion was authorized to buy \nout tobacco farms in the United States. That has 1 more year to run.\n  We subsidize tobacco crop insurance. We should not. This country \nshould become tobacco-free. It will save lives.\n  I urge you to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. I speak in opposition to the amendment.\n  Let me say to my dear friend from California, whom I really respect, \nthe tobacco buyout was not paid by taxpayers, it was paid by the \ntobacco companies. It happened several years ago. The only program \ntobacco farmers participate in today is crop insurance, like every \nother agricultural product in America. Without that safety net, those \nfarmers can't go to the bank and get capital to plant their crops.\n  Although I think we can all agree that tobacco is not healthy for \nyou, some Americans make the decision to do it because it is legal. \nEliminate the American tobacco farmer and you will replace them with \ntobacco grown in Zimbabwe and Brazil--around the world. If we want to \noutlaw tobacco, let's have that vote, but don't walk away and believe \nthat a vote eliminating crop insurance is going to change the health \ncare of the American people as it relates to this product.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, I request 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I request 1 minute to respond to Senator Burr, if I \nmay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request, as \nmodified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, I too rise to express strong opposition \nto the amendment. This amendment would prevent our tobacco growers from \nbeing eligible for Federal crop insurance. This amendment would do \nsignificant harm to the small tobacco farmers in North Carolina and in \nother parts of the country. There are 2,000 farmers in North Carolina \nwho would be affected, and it would be devastating to them and their \nfamilies. Without access to crop insurance, they wouldn't be able to \nborrow money from the banks to receive financing.\n  It does nothing to alter the amount of tobacco used in our country. \nDemand will be filled by foreign imports, probably from Brazil and \nother countries. It would put our American farmers out of work.\n  For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote no on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, we are not talking about eliminating \ncrop insurance. There are plenty of crops that don't have crop \ninsurance, but this crop does. We are talking about eliminating the \nFederal subsidy, which amounts to $30 million-plus a year for crop \ninsurance.\n  With respect to my distinguished friend and colleague on the other \nside of the aisle, I misspoke once today. This is an assessment from \nthe tobacco industry. I thought I straightened that out. But the \nassessment that paid for the buyout of $9.6 billion is what I am \nspeaking of.\n  But this is a Federal subsidy on crop insurance. You can still get \ncrop insurance, but it won't be federally subsidized.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), \nthe Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg) and the Senator from \nMichigan (Mr. Levin) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To authorize the use of the insurance fund to reduce fraud \n     and maintain program integrity in the crop insurance program)\n\n       On page 1076, between lines 17 and 18, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 110__. CROP INSURANCE FRAUD.\n\n       Section 516(b)(2) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 \n     U.S.C. 1516(b)(2)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(C) Reviews, compliance, and program integrity.--For each \n     of the 2014 and subsequent reinsurance years, the Corporation \n     may use the insurance fund established under subsection (c), \n     but not to exceed $5,000,000 for each fiscal year, to pay the \n     following:\n       ``(i) Costs to reimburse expenses incurred for the review \n     of policies, plans of insurance, and related materials and to \n     assist the Corporation in maintaining program integrity.\n       ``(ii) In addition to other available funds, costs incurred \n     by the Risk Management Agency for compliance operations \n     associated with activities authorized under this title.''.\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nmake sure we are doing all we can to prevent fraud and abuse in the \nFederal Crop Insurance Program. The issue of fraud in this program hit \nhome for me in March of this year when the Justice Department announced \na $100 million crop insurance fraud case in eastern North Carolina, the \nlargest ever of its kind. Forty-one defendants were found guilty and \nmany are serving prison time for profiting from false claims for losses \nof soybeans, tobacco, wheat, and corn.\n  Following this incident I regularly have farmers coming up to me, \ntelling me they are nervous, nervous that the actions of a few bad \nactors will lead the Federal Government to cease providing crop \ninsurance assistance. In these difficult budget times, these are valid \nconcerns. For Federal assistance to continue, the integrity of these \nprograms must be rock solid. Crop insurance fraud not only harms the \nintegrity of Federal safety net programs and increases the cost to \ntaxpayers, it also drives up the cost of the insurance program for our \nhonest, law-abiding farmers.\n  The amendment I am offering would provide additional tools to the \nRisk Management Agency to analyze and combat fraud, waste, and abuse. \nThe Risk Management Agency can expand the sampling requirements to test \nfor and address the concerns with these improper program payments. This \nis in accordance with the Federal Improper Payments Information Act and \nthe Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act, as recommended by \nthe office of the inspector general. The Risk Management Agency can \nincrease the number of reviews of the approved insurance providers \nconducted each year. Currently we are able to review only about one-\nthird of these providers due to our resource constraints. It also will \nprovide additional support for data-mining activities to detect the \nfraud and abuse in the program and develop proactive underwriting and \nloss adjustment applications to minimize the scope for such activities \nto occur.\n  The farm bill before us now includes extensive reforms to create a \nhost of new safety net programs. As the complexity of these programs \ngrows, the resources needed to oversee these programs are actually \nshrinking. This amendment will provide the resources necessary to \nproactively detect and combat fraud and abuse. Funding for this \namendment will come out of the general savings contained in the \nunderlying bill. The cost of this amendment is minimal and I believe \nthis investment will generate substantial savings for taxpayers, \nexpanding our efforts to tackle the fraud and abuse in the crop \ninsurance program. Protecting the integrity of these programs is \ncritical to ensuring the safety net programs are available for the vast \nmajority of our farmers who are honest, and to avoid undermining public \nconfidence in these programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I support the amendment offered by the \nSenator from North Carolina. This amendment would provide additional \nsupport for data-mining activities to detect fraud. It would develop \nproactive underwriting and loss adjustment applications to minimize the \nscope for such activities to occur. It would help reduce improper \npayments through better controls and reviews of policies. All of these \nwill result in saving taxpayer money and ensuring program integrity in \nthe long run.\n  I urge approval of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 953\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time remains for the Durbin-\nCoburn amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Please notify me when I have used 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the Chair will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Durbin-Coburn amendment says this: We have the Crop \nInsurance Program in America. Farmers buy crop insurance because they \ncould have a drought, flood, lose their crop, or the market price could \nfall down to nothing, so they buy insurance to cover the loss. However, \nit isn't really insurance as we understand insurance. It is not like \nfire or auto insurance because farmers don't pay enough in premiums to \ncover the actual losses paid out by crop insurance.\n  In fact, the farmer's contribution to crop insurance is only 38 \npercent of the actual premium cost. Who pays the rest? Hold up your \nhand, America. All the taxpayers in this country subsidize crop \ninsurance--62 percent. What did it cost us last year? Over $7 billion, \nand then an additional $1 billion to administer the program.\n  Here is what this amendment says: We stand behind crop insurance. We \nbelieve in crop insurance, but for that\n\n[[Page S3818]]\n\ntiny 1 percent of farmers across America making over $750,000 a year, \ntheir Federal subsidy will be cut from 62 percent, on average, to 47 \npercent. They can afford it, and over the span of 10 years we will save \nover $1 billion. That is money we can better spend either to reduce our \ndebt or on critical programs for this country.\n  I want farmers to have crop insurance, but I want those who are doing \nso well in this system and getting hundreds of thousands of dollars of \nFederal subsidy to show a little bit of sacrifice on their part. Keep \nthis program sound and keep it fair. The Durbin-Coburn amendment moves \nin that direction.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor to my friend from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, 4 percent of the farmers in this country \nreceive 33 percent of the benefits from crop insurance. I don't think \nit could be said any better than Senator Durbin has said it. The point \nis, what we ought do is make sure there is a safety net, and crop \ninsurance is the way to do that. But like every other program, we \neventually are going to ask those who have more to participate more.\n  I have the location and how much the top five farmers in this country \nactually get. The No. 1 farmer in the country gets $1.9 million worth \nof subsidies a year. All we are going to do is cut his subsidy to $1.6 \nmillion. His income is far in excess of $750,000.\n  The No. 2 farmer is from Washington State. We will cut his subsidy \nfrom $1.7 million to $1.4 million, and, of course, he made far more \nthan that in the last year and in the previous years.\n  No. 3, located in Minnesota, we are going to cut from $1.6 million to \n$1.4 million. We are still going to subsidize $1.4 million a year for \nthis one individual who is going to make in excess of $2 million this \nyear.\n  All we are asking is to appropriately limit the benefits that are \ncoming from borrowed money against our children's future for the very \nwealthy in this country.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, while I very much appreciate the \namendment of Senator Durbin and Senator Coburn, I urge my colleagues to \noppose this amendment.\n  Crop insurance is insurance, and the farmer gets a bill not a check. \nThey get a bill. The question is whether we are going to provide a \ndiscount so it is an affordable policy.\n  We ended subsidies through direct payments. We want them to move to a \nvoluntary system of crop insurance. The bill they get has to be a bill \nthey can afford to be able to provide the coverage, and then there is \nno payout unless they have a loss, such as a flood, drought, or \nwhatever has happened. It is insurance.\n  There are several reasons this is not the same vote the Senate took \nlast year on this amendment. With the historic agreement to attach \nconservation compliance to crop insurance--potentially reducing the \nacres and numbers of producers covered by crop insurance--will only \nreduce the environmental benefits and could lead to draining wetlands \nand plowing highly erodable land.\n  Let me say this another way: Of course most of the crop insurance \ngoes to the largest farmers because they have the most land to insure. \nJust by definition, the larger the insurance policy, the more they are \ntrying to cover. The question is--and the reason conservationists and \nenvironmentalists have come together--is because they want the large \ntracts to become conservation compliant.\n  There is even more environmental impact on the large tracts than on \nthe small tracts, which is why we saw this historic agreement between \n30-some different farm, environmental, and conservation groups to say: \nWe will support crop insurance, but you have to do conservation \ncompliance on all of the land.\n  Limiting crop insurance support to producers will cause producers \nwith large pieces of land to leave the insurance system, losing the \nconservation benefits and possibly increasing the costs, again, to \nsmaller providers. If everybody is not in, then the cost goes up for \nwho is in.\n  In fact, we know if we take the largest purchasers out, it is \nestimated we could see premiums go up nearly 40 percent for those who \nare currently in the system, and we are more likely to go back to ad \nhoc disaster assistance.\n  In the drought of 2012, one of the worst on record for U.S. farmers, \nthere were no calls for our crops to receive ad hoc disaster \nassistance. The corn, wheat, soybean growers, and others across the \ncountry were able to survive. Why? Because of crop insurance, and it \nworked.\n  I urge colleagues to take a second look at this. We are talking about \npreserving a historic agreement that came together around conservation \ncompliance. We want to make sure all of the land that is in crop \ninsurance is covered, and we are protecting our soil and water.\n  I ask for a ``no'' vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. The No. 1 person who cares about the environmental \nquality of their land is the farmer. The bigger the farmer, the more \nthey care.\n  The No. 4 farmer, as far as crop insurance in the country, farms \n105,000 acres. The average farmer in Oklahoma has 160 acres. They will \nmake an economic decision, and if a 15-percent bump in their premium \nwill cause them to go out, they will go out. But they will not go out \nbecause it is too much of a sweetheart deal. We are still going to pay \nalmost half of their crop insurance--50 percent.\n  Does anybody else have that kind of deal going? Nobody else has that \nkind of deal going.\n  What we are saying is, let's save some money and ask those who are \nmore well endowed with benefits and profits to pay a fairer share of \nwhat they should be paying based on the benefits they get.\n  The one thing the chairwoman didn't say is these are the guys who \ncollect the big bucks when there is one. They do pay a portion of it, \nbut their payouts are hundreds of times higher than the average farmer.\n  They will make an economic decision, and they are not going to walk \naway from this because it is still--even at 48 percent--too sweet of a \ndeal for any of them to walk away. There is no study that says they \nwill walk away.\n  Wait and see. If they walk away, Senator Durbin and I will walk down \nand offer mea culpas on the Senate floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I appreciate the confidence my friend from Oklahoma has \nabout what business decisions will be made. Let's assume they don't \nwalk away from crop insurance; they will be walking away from \nconservation compliance if they are not required to do that.\n  If this agreement falls apart--and it is an agreement that was \ndelicately put together with over 30 different farm organizations, as \nwell as conservation and environmental folks, to work together to \nsupport crop insurance. But to require environmental compliance--they \nmay or may not make decisions about crop insurance. I do know if they \ndo leave, the folks in the program, which are small- and medium-sized \nprograms--as a matter of economics, like any other kind of insurance--\nwill see their costs go up. We do know that.\n  We also have this broader question that relates to the large farmers \nthe Senators are talking about where the benefit to having \ncomprehensive conservation compliance for our country is a benefit we \nwant to make sure we keep intact. It would be undermined with the \npassage of this amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators Durbin and Coburn have 5 minutes \nremaining, Senator Hagan has 1 minute remaining, and Senator Stabenow \nhas 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me just make the point. The large farmers I know in \nOklahoma really don't want the government telling them what kind of \nagreement they are going to have with their crop insurance and \nenvironmental things. We already have a ton of rules.\n  What I do know is there is nobody in Oklahoma who cares more about \nthe environment than our farmers. I disagree there is a disconnect if \nwe limit\n\n[[Page S3819]]\n\nthe crop insurance subsidy to the very large farmers in Oklahoma and \nthat they are not going to do what is in the best interests of the \nenvironment since it is a benefit to their own economic well-being.\n  We understand a deal was cut to get us to where we are on the bill, \nand we are not trying to disturb that. We don't want to disturb that, \nbut we cannot continue to subsidize the very well heeled in this \ncountry to the same level that we try to protect those who are \nmarginal. We just cannot do it.\n  We could have made this a whole lot different. We could have lowered \nit even lower. We didn't do that. The average median family income in \nthis country is less than $60,000. We are talking about almost 15 times \nmore than the average family in this country makes, and saying: If you \nmake more than that, maybe you could take a little trim off the subsidy \nof your crop insurance. That is not an unfair question.\n  I yield to my colleague from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Let's get it straight: Every farmer buying crop insurance gets a \nsubsidy. The question is, How big is the subsidy? Is it 62 percent of \nthe actual premium cost--that is what they are all receiving now--or \nwill it be 47 or 48 percent, which is what we are suggesting, for 1 \npercent of the farmers, of the wealthiest farmers.\n  How many farmers are we talking about? There are roughly 2 million \nfarmers in America. The people we are talking about number 20,000. \nThere are 20,000 farmers who would be affected by our amendment. One \nwould think we are about to destroy agriculture in America. There are 2 \nmillion farmers, and all of them get a subsidy.\n  Senator Coburn and I are saying: Let's nix the subsidy for the \nwealthiest. What we hear is that is too much to ask--it is too much \nsacrifice. I don't think so.\n  One example in Illinois--and I will not read the examples from other \nMidwestern States--a corn and soybean grower received $740,000 in \npremium subsidies to cover the crops he planted in my State in 18 \ncounties. There are 102 counties in Illinois. We would cut his subsidy \nfrom $740,000 to $639,000. Does anyone think he will notice? Does \nanyone think he will stop buying crop insurance on what he has planted \nin 18 counties? I don't think so.\n  At a time when we are asking people in the Head Start Program to make \na sacrifice across America, can we at least ask for a little bit of a \nsacrifice from the 20,000 of the wealthiest farmers out of 2 million? I \ndon't think it is asking too much.\n  Madam President, I ask that the amendment be called up for \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois, [Mr. Durbin], for himself and \n     Mr. Coburn, proposes an amendment numbered 953.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To limit the amount of premium subsidy provided by the \n  Federal Crop Insurance Corporation on behalf of any person or legal \n  entity with an average adjusted gross income in excess of $750,000, \n  with a delayed application of the limitation until completion of a \n                study on the effects of the limitation)\n\n       On page 1101, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 11___.

Madam President, I am cosponsoring this amendment that \nsays the wealthiest 20,000 farmers in America will pay slightly more \nfor their crop insurance so the program will be a sound program for all \nfarmers.\n  I urge my colleagues, in the name of deficit reduction and making \nthis a good program, to vote yes on the Durbin-Coburn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I would urge a ``no'' vote for a \nnumber of reasons, but let me simply say the problem with increasing \ncrop insurance premiums by about 40 percent, which is what this does, \nis we are going to reduce participation in crop insurance, reduce \ncoverage, and drive up premiums. Most important for me, we have a \nhistoric agreement to tie crop insurance to conservation compliance, \nand this would undermine that effort.\n  I would urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Before proceeding, I wish to thank everyone for their good work up to \nthis point and announce there will be no further votes. The next vote \nwill be at 5:30 p.m. on the Monday we return, and we will proceed and \ncomplete the bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 978\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that my amendment No. 978 be called up.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I object to the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I regret that we have heard an objection \nto pulling up this amendment. Many may not understand that to pull up \nan amendment and to have it considered in the Senate takes unanimous \nconsent. All 100 have to agree.\n  My colleague has objected, making it impossible to consider an \namendment that should be debated here on the floor of the Senate \nbecause this amendment is about good policy and good process.\n  Not so long ago, in the continuing resolution, a provision was \nslipped in by the House of Representatives. Because this was a must-\npass bill under tight time constraints, it also slipped through the \nSenate with no debate. And what did this legislation do, the Monsanto \nprotection act? This legislation does something that I think most would \nfind astounding. It allows the unrestricted sale and planting of new \nvariants of genetically modified seeds that a court has ruled have not \nbeen properly examined for their effect on other farmers, the \nenvironment, and human health.\n  Obviously, this raises a lot of concerns about the impact on farmers \nand the impact on human health, but there is even more. The fact that \nthe act instructs the seed producers to ignore a ruling of the court is \nequally troubling. It raises profound questions about the \nconstitutional separation of powers and the ability of our courts to \nhold agencies accountable to the law and their responsibilities.\n  I can tell my colleagues that this process and this policy has \nprovoked outrage across the country. When I held townhalls in Oregon \nafter this happened, at every townhall it was raised by farmers \nconcerned that this would endanger the crops they were growing and \nhoped to export overseas. I have received over 2,200 letters on this \ntopic.\n  I am very hopeful that when we come back next week, we can have a \nfull debate on this amendment, that it won't be objected to, and that \ncertainly there will be no opportunity of any kind for this policy to \nbe extended because it hurts a process of holding our departments \naccountable for enforcing the law, and it provides a policy of \noverriding the court order designed to protect other farmers, to \nprotect the environment, and to protect human health, and that is \nabsolutely unacceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I would like to respond to my friend Mr. \nMerkley.\n  This act, which I would think would more properly be called the \nfarmer assurance act, was passed by both the House and the Senate and \nsigned into law by President Obama in March of 2013, March of this \nyear.\n  Many have claimed it was never publicly debated and it was slipped \ninto the bill by the House of Representatives, as my good friend said \non the floor a minute ago, and passed the Senate without debate. Now, \nthis was a big bill, I will admit that, and there was a lot of debate.\n  While that would certainly be, I am sure, what Mr. Merkley believes \nhappened, I don't think the facts would bear that out. In fact, this \nlanguage originated, as he said, and was passed by the House after it \nwas debated in committee, and it was posted for several months. This \nwas not mystery language.\n  In fact, on June 6, 2012, the House publicly posted their resolution \nthat included this in the Agriculture appropriations bill. It was \navailable on the House Web site from that point on. Section 733 of the \nHouse bill is identical to the farmer assurance language included in \nthe final fiscal year 2013 appropriations bill that was passed by the \nCongress.\n  On June 19, 2012, the House Agriculture appropriations bill was \npassed out of committee. That bill included this exact language. That \nwas June 19, 2012.\n  The continuing resolution, actually, on the AG/FDA--the Agriculture, \nRural Development, Food and Drug Administration--bill included a coming \ntogether of these two bills.\n\n[[Page S3821]]\n\n  The CR--the continuing resolution--included items in the Senate bill \nthat dealt principally with agricultural research that the House didn't \nhave, and there were provisions in the House version like this one that \nthe Senate accepted.\n  The language was publicly available and posted as part of the agreed-\nto appropriations bill for 9 days before the vote.\n  A week before the vote, Senator Tester filed an amendment which is \nexactly like the amendment we just heard about today because it would \nhave struck this provision. On that same day, Senator Tester spoke at \nlength on the floor about his amendment. This was a week before the \ncontinuing resolution was passed.\n  I don't mind having a debate about the provisions. I do mind the idea \nthat somehow nobody knew about this. Now, I can't watch the debate for \nevery Member of the Senate and say: Here is what you should have been \npaying attention to that one of our colleagues said, but it was fairly \nsubstantial and took some time, and it was a week before we voted.\n  By the way, nobody in the Senate proposed this provision. Nobody put \nit in the House bill, as some have contended. But I do think this \nprovision, as it turns out, this policy, protects farm families. That \nis why it was supported by the American Farm Bureau Federation, the \nAmerican Council of Farmer Cooperatives, the American Soybean \nAssociation, the National Association of Wheat Growers, the \nCongressional Hunger Center, the National Corn Growers Association, and \nothers.\n  Many have incorrectly claimed that this language gives priority to \nthe needs of a small number of businesses over the rights and needs of \nthe American consumers. I don't think that is true either. This \nprovision doesn't protect any seed company--Monsanto or Pioneer Seed--\nor even the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It would help the family \nwho planted a crop that was legal to plant.\n  My mom and dad were dairy farmers. The one thing I do know about the \nfarming cycle is that once you have made a decision to plant a crop, it \nis usually too late to plant another one, and there are times when it \nis absolutely too late to plant another crop. So what does your family \ndo that year when the crop the government told you you could plant, \nsome Federal judge decides you can't plant it, only to have maybe \nanother--in the few cases where this has happened--other Federal judges \nlater say that the first Federal judge was wrong and that those crops \nwere legal to be planted and legal to be harvested.\n\n  Both challenges, by the way, were about what environmental impact \nthis might have if something happened from one property to another. \nThere was never a question in those two cases about the safety of the \nfood.\n  This provision allows the Secretary of Agriculture to create a way \nfor those farm families to sell that crop, but it doesn't require the \nSecretary do that.\n  Remember, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has already said: This \nis a crop that we have deregulated. It has heavily regulated these \nkinds of crops until the Secretary of Agriculture says it is not, and \nwhen the Secretary of Agriculture says it is not, then anybody who \nwants to can plant these crops. This gives the farmers and their \nfamilies the assurance that a legally planted crop is likely to be able \nto be harvested.\n  In addition, the authority granted to the USDA in this language was \nonly temporary. It was in the House bill, and it lasts until September \n30 of this year. The Secretary of Agriculture said he already had the \nauthority. It didn't seem to me that the return for ag research and \nother things we had in our bill--that repeating the authority the \nSecretary of Agriculture said he had and had used was a bad thing.\n  It basically tells the Secretary of Agriculture: If you agree with \nthe court, by the way, and don't think you did your job and you don't \nintend to appeal the case, you don't have to do anything that allows a \ncrop to be harvested. But if you still think you were right and you are \ngoing to appeal that case, you have the authority, if you want to use \nit, to figure out how to let that crop be harvested for that year and \nthat time.\n  USDA can determine at any time that a biocrop should not be approved, \nand USDA can pull its approval on a crop that it has approved. FDA also \nhas to approve the food value of these things before they can go into \nfood.\n  This language doesn't require USDA to approve biotech crops. It \ndoesn't prevent individuals from suing the government over a biotech \ncrop approval. Ultimately, this language simply codifies the authority \nthe Secretary believes he had.\n  As recently as May 9 of this year, Secretary Vilsack testified before \nthe Appropriations Agriculture Subcommittee and said this language \n``doesn't necessarily do anything I can't already do. We're going to \nmake these decisions based on the science and based on the law, which \nis the way they ought to be made.''\n  Unfortunately, if you took a quick search of the Internet, you \nwouldn't find out these facts. But we have the advantage that we can \nsearch actually what the law said, not what somebody else said it might \nhave said.\n  These provisions protect farm families and their livelihoods, and \nthat is why they are supported by some groups I have already mentioned \nand some I haven't: the American Farm Bureau Federation, National \nCouncil of Farmer Cooperatives, National Soybean Association, National \nAssociation of Wheat Growers, the Congressional Hunger Center, National \nCorn Growers Association, National Cotton Council, American Sugarbeet \nGrowers Association, the Agriculture Retailers Association, the \nBiotechnology Industry Organization, the American Seed Trade \nAssociation, and many other groups.\n  Facts are stubborn, and the law here is easy to find and read, and it \ndoesn't say anything about protecting anybody because, frankly, you \ncan't sue these companies anyway. They sold you a legal product. The \nonly people protected here are the people who have put the seeds in the \nground. A farmer can't put those seeds in the ground in August or \nSeptember and expect to harvest a crop that year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \nthank colleagues for their work this week, to thank my partner Senator \nCochran and both of our staffs, who have been working very hard to \ncomplete the process of this very important jobs bill called the farm \nbill.\n  Let me take a moment to remind everyone that we are talking about 16 \nmillion jobs in America that come because of agriculture, because of \nwhat we do in the food industry altogether. It is incredibly important \nwe complete this work. I am very confident when we come back into \nsession in another week that we will complete our process.\n  I thank our majority leader and the Republican leader for their \nsupport in our moving through this process, and certainly our majority \nleader, Senator Reid, who has been incredibly supportive in working \nwith us and giving us the time to come directly from committee to the \nfloor of the Senate and to work with colleagues through amendments on \nboth sides of the aisle to get this done. We are doing this the way we \nhave always done it, which is in a bipartisan fashion, working through \nboth Democratic and Republican amendments. At the end we will have \nproduced what I believe is the most reform-minded farm bill in decades.\n  Let me also remind my colleagues we have before us a bill that is \ndifferent than anything I can think of actually in terms of deficit \nreduction. We have a bill that has over $24 billion in spending cuts \nput forward by our committee and supported by the communities that are \naffected--$24 billion in deficit reduction, which is much more than we \nwould be required to do if we went with the across-the-board cuts that \nhave been so debated with the sequester. The Agriculture Department and \nthe farm bill are responsible for $6 billion in deficit reduction \nthrough the sequester. We have added four times to that amount in \ndeficit reduction, but we are doing it in a smart, focused way, making \ntough decisions, setting priorities, eliminating subsidies that don't \nmake sense anymore, and strengthening risk management, market-oriented \nprograms.\n  We have debated, and will debate more, something called crop \ninsurance, which I will remind my colleagues does\n\n[[Page S3822]]\n\nnot allow for someone getting a check. They get a bill. They pay for \ncrop insurance. We do it in a partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and farmers to help them have affordable risk management. \nThat is what we strengthen in this bill. We have been told by farmers \nall across the country that the most important risk management tool for \nthem is insurance--crop insurance that is affordable.\n  We have also in this legislation done something that is historic, \nwhich is as we have moved from subsidies to insurance, we are tying \nconservation compliance to the purchase of insurance. This is a very \nimportant policy, and we have many groups--over 30 groups--that have \ncome together, and I want to commend all the commodity groups and the \nFarm Bureau and the Farmers Union and all those that came together, \nalong with environmentalists and conservation organizations, to put a \nreal priority on both a strong risk management system called crop \ninsurance and a strong conservation policy called conservation \ncompliance. This is a very important part of our bill as we look to \nsavings.\n  Frankly, we have looked at savings in every single part of this bill. \nWe have 12 different bills all put together called titles in this thing \nwe call a farm bill, and we have looked at savings in each area of the \nbill. We have, for instance, taken a hard look at our conservation \nprograms and decided that instead of 23 different kinds of programs, we \nactually could consolidate and streamline down to 13. We put them in \nfour different buckets of activities, with a lot of flexibility, \nworking with community groups and grassroots groups on conservation, \nand saw that we could save money, which we have done.\n  We listened to mayors and rural communities around Michigan and \naround the country--those who represent townships and counties--who \nsaid make sure you continue to have a strong rural economic development \npresence. Because once you get outside the cities in Michigan or around \nthe country every community is partnering with rural development for \nbusiness loans, water and sewer projects, transportation, firetrucks, \npolice cars, housing, and all those efforts working through rural \ndevelopment. But we heard from our local officials that it was \ncomplicated. We currently, in law, have 11 different definitions of \n``rural.'' That made no sense. They said: Could you please give us one? \nWe looked through all the different programs and streamlined it and now \nwe have one definition, so it is easier to work with, less paperwork, \nand it makes much more sense.\n  We have continued to strengthen the part of our agricultural economy \ncalled ``specialty crops.'' This is near and dear to me in Michigan--\nfresh fruits and vegetables and other areas that are very important to \nmany States, including mine. The organic community is a fast-growing \npart of agriculture, and so we strengthen that as well.\n  We have looked from Mississippi to Michigan, California to Delaware, \nand everything in between, to make sure this is a bill that works for \nall parts of agriculture, and I am pleased to say we have been able to \ndo that.\n  We have also made sure the energy title is strong, both in supporting \nfarmers and ranchers who want to be focused on energy efficiency on the \nfarm or the ranch, and also in expanding efforts beyond our traditional \nbiofuel efforts to something that is near and dear to my heart which is \ncalled bio-based manufacturing.\n  We have very exciting opportunities in America. I know our Presiding \nOfficer is as passionate about manufacturing as I am, and we now have \nthe opportunity, working with our agricultural groups, to create ways \nto replace petroleum in plastics and other types of materials that we \nhave today--synthetic fibers and so on--with agricultural by-products.\n  If you buy many of our great American automobiles today, you might \nfind you are sitting on foam that is actually made from soybean oil \ninstead of petroleum oil. So you might be sitting on soybeans in the \nseats. Many parts of the interior of the automobiles that folks are now \nbuying actually have some kind of agricultural by-product, whether it \nis wheat chaff or corn husks or soybean oil. So we know we can use \nthese new opportunities to not only create markets but create \nsituations that are much better for our environment and that create \njobs. This is a new and exciting part of what we are doing to expand \nopportunities through the energy title as well.\n\n  We also are very pleased and proud of the efforts around nutrition \nfor folks in this country who, through no fault of their own, have \nfound themselves hit hard by the economy. We want to make sure they \ncontinue to have the support they need around food assistance. That is \nabsolutely critical, and I am pleased we have stood together in \nopposing very damaging amendments to the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program. Because just as crop insurance is important for our \nfarmers when they have a disaster, food assistance is important for our \nfamilies when they have a disaster. I think it reflects the best about \nus as Americans that we want to make sure we are providing that \nassistance.\n  We also are making sure we are doing more around farmers markets, and \nfresh fruits and vegetables in schools, making local food hubs a \npossibility so we have local farmers being able to come together to \nmarket their products as well.\n  There are many pieces in this farm bill that all relate back to jobs, \nall relate back to reforms we have put in place, and relate to making \nsure we have a continuation of the safest, most affordable food supply \nin the world here in America. When you go home tonight, if you sit down \nto have supper, thank a farmer. We all understand this is the riskiest \nbusiness in the world, and the job of the farm bill is to provide \nsupport and risk management tools for our growers when they need them, \nbut also to be great stewards of taxpayer dollars and to do what is \nright for rural communities across America and for families that need \nsome temporary help as well.\n  There are many pieces, and I haven't even mentioned all of them. But \nI did want to remind people why we take the time on the floor to work \nthrough these issues and these amendments. We have more work to do, but \nwe see the light at the end of the tunnel. We will be putting together \na list for final votes on amendments when we come back into session, \nand we are looking forward to doing that and to completing this effort.\n  Again, I would remind colleagues, we did this last year. The House \ndid not do their job. They did in committee, on a bipartisan basis, but \nnot on the floor. We did our job. Last time around I remember doing 73 \ndifferent votes on this particular bill. We wrapped in almost every \nsingle one of those amendments that were passed into the bill we \npresented to the Senate this time, and we are continuing to work \ntogether on other amendments as well. But it will be time, when we get \nback, to bring this to closure and to once again demonstrate the Senate \ncan work together on a bipartisan basis to do the right thing for the \nfamilies and the businesses and the farmers and the ranchers we \nrepresent. Sixteen million people in this country are counting on us to \nget our job done, and I am sure we will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague from Michigan in predicting that we are moving in the right \ndirection. We have covered a lot of important issues during the debate \nover the last couple of days and taken up a good many amendments. We \nhave had recorded votes and free and full discussion of a lot of issues \nthat are affected by this legislation, and I must say it has been a \nremarkable performance in terms of the subjects that have been covered \nand amendments disposed of. True progress has been made in developing \nwhat I think can be a very important contribution toward a legal \nframework and support structure to help enable American farmers to \ncompete in the international marketplace and to sustain the jobs that \nflow from these important activities throughout the United States.\n  At a time when, in some places, jobs are hard to find, this is a job \ncreator and it is a step toward strengthening our economy not just in \nrural America but throughout the country--in municipalities as well.\n  I hope everybody recognizes what a strong leader our committee \nchairman\n\n[[Page S3823]]\n\nhas become, as she has demonstrated in her performance as chairman of \nour committee. She has done an excellent job. I commend her and all of \nour colleagues on the committee for helping shape this product so it \ncan be adopted by the Senate and signed into law by the President. I \nlook forward to that day and to celebrating and helping salute those \nwho have been responsible for this good work.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle in condemning the Internal Revenue Service for \nintentionally singling out dozens of nonprofit organizations for no \ncause other than their political leanings. This is not an issue of \nDemocrat versus Republican. Indeed, the actions of the IRS have brought \nrare bipartisan accord. There are lessons for us all in this scandal.\n  One is that a government that is too big, too powerful, and too all-\nencompassing is prone to overstep its bounds. It becomes unwieldy and \ninefficient. And sometimes, it tramples upon the rights of the people \nit is supposed to serve. We have seen those maxims in action over these \nlast few weeks.\n  We have an IRS that targeted groups of American citizens, threatening \nthem with the force of law and imprisonment, for no other reason than \nthey had certain political affiliations. We know now the IRS selected \nthese groups by zeroing in on certain words and phrases.\n  And what were these words and phrases that elicited such concern in \nthe halls of the Internal Revenue Service? Words like ``patriot'' and \n``we the people.''\n  It seems to me that we can draw only one of two conclusions from the \nactions of the IRS. Either some in the administration intentionally \nattempted to use the power of the Federal Government to target and \ncripple their political enemies, or they lack the competence to oversee \na bureaucracy that has grown too big not to fail.\n  One thing is for sure, though. The reputation of the IRS has been \ntarnished in ways that will take years to repair, and it is imperative \nthat we restore the trust that has been lost between the American \npeople and our government. That work begins with getting to the bottom \nof this scandal.\n  We have many questions that need answers. Did these IRS officials act \non their own, or did they have direction from their superiors? How high \nup does this scandal go? What did the White House know, and when did \nthey know it?\n  This scandal comes as Washington is preparing to hand over even more \npower and authority to the IRS. It will be the IRS that enforces the \nmandates of the new health care law. It will be the IRS that will have \ncontrol over some of our most private, personal decisions.\n  It is not too late to change course. But if we insist on placing the \nblame for the IRS's actions on a few low-level staffers without looking \nat the root cause of the abuse--corruption, or a government that, as \nthe President's former Senior Advisor David Axelrod recently admitted, \nhas become too vast to manage and oversee--then we will continue to \nwitness scandals like this.\n  Big government comes with bigger problems, bigger scandals, and \nbigger dangers for our liberties. The Tea Party and organizations like \nit have been arguing that position since they were founded. And while I \nknow there are some in this chamber that will hate to hear this, it \nturns out the Tea Party's fears were justified.\n  We need more than just an audit of what happened at the IRS. We have \ngiven the IRS every opportunity to deal with this issue internally. \nMore than a year ago, Senator Hatch and I sent a letter to the IRS \nexpressing our concerns about the targeting of conservative groups. We \nreceived a response assuring us that our concerns were unfounded.\n  We now know that this response was false, and perhaps intentionally \nmisleading. Tuesday, former-Commissioner Steven Miller appeared before \nthe Homeland Security and Government Affairs committee on which I \nserve. During that hearing, Mr. Miller claimed that while he had \ndispatched a team to investigate our concerns a month before he \nresponded to our letter, the response was sent without input from that \nteam. He claims he did learn that targeting had occurred, but not until \na week after misinforming the Senate that all was fine. He said he was \n``outraged.'' And yet he never corrected the record, choosing instead \nto allow his false response to stand. At the very least we have a \nsituation where the IRS, knowing what had happened a week after they \nsent a response saying everything was fine, refused to correct the \nRecord. I believed them at the time. Unfortunately, we were \nmisinformed. And yesterday, Lois Lerner, the head of the IRS's tax-\nexempt organizations division, declined to answer questions regarding \nthis scandal, deciding instead to invoke her Fifth Amendment rights \nagainst self-incrimination.\n  Despite all this, the IRS asks us to trust them when they tell us \nthat this scandal was simply the result of a few misguided, low-level \nemployees, and that no senior officials were involved. With all due \nrespect, I am done taking the IRS's word for it. We need an indepth \ninvestigation, one that fully documents the what, when, and who of this \nscandal. Only when we get to the bottom of this incident can we begin \nto rebuild the bridge of trust between us as citizens and our Federal \nGovernment here in Washington, DC.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk a little bit \nabout the farm bill which is before the Senate. Notwithstanding all the \nrhetoric we have had around the budget over the last 4 years or so \naround here, last year the Senate Agriculture Committee was the only \ncommittee, to my knowledge in either House, the Senate or the House, \nthat passed a bipartisan deficit reduction plan. We did it together, \nDemocrats and Republicans, working together on the committee with the \nvarious constituencies around the United States of America. That bill \nultimately passed the Senate in a broad bipartisan vote right here on \nthis floor.\n  The House of Representatives was unable, for whatever reason, to \nenact a version of the farm bill over there, which was an incredible \ndisservice to rural America. Farmers in my State, ranchers in my State, \nthe State of Colorado, faced an unprecedented drought throughout this \nentire period. Throughout the summer of 2012, when I was traveling the \nState, no one was talking about the Presidential election--particularly \nin these rural areas, which was on the mind of everybody in Washington. \nWhat they wanted to know was why a farm bill had not been passed and \nfor good reason--because the Senate had passed a bill that was \nsupported by both Republicans and Democrats, by producers of all types \nacross the country, and it was a good piece of legislation.\n  Fast forward to this week, when the Senate Agriculture Committee has \nonce again passed a bipartisan bill with meaningful deficit reduction. \nI thank Chairwoman Stabenow from Michigan and the ranking member \nSenator Thad Cochran for their leadership on this bill. This bill now \nhas gone through two different ranking members on the Republican side \nand has been supported in a bipartisan way, as I said earlier. This \nfarm bill, similar to the last version we passed, reflects the values \nand the process we want to see in other areas of our budget. We \nidentify priorities in this bill. We streamline duplication in this \nbill. We break away from old, inefficient ways of doing business in \nthis farm bill.\n  We eliminate direct payments in one of the most significant reforms \nwe have seen in a farm bill in a very long time. These payments are \nissued to farmers regardless of economic need or market signals. We do \naway with that abuse. This bill prioritizes what is working for \nproducers and it strengthens crop insurance as a result, which is what \nmy farmers have said is most important to them.\n  I have spoken on this floor before about Colorado's battle against \nhistoric drought conditions. Some farmers\n\n[[Page S3824]]\n\nlost over half their corn yields in 2012 alone. It is hard to imagine, \nwhen you think about it, any business losing half of its production in \n1 year, but that is what happened to Colorado's corn growers. Crop \ninsurance is what is keeping farmers and rural economies in business \nand that is why this should be a priority. That is why this bill should \nhave been passed 2 years ago when it first came to the floor of the \nSenate. It is why we should pass it next month.\n  Beyond crop insurance, another key highlight of this bill for those \nof us from Colorado is conservation. The title carries over the reforms \nfrom last year's bill, and this year's bill includes a provision to \nensure that recipients of government-supported crop insurance comply \nwith basic conservation requirements. This measure is the result of a \nhistoric agreement between the commodity groups and the conservation \ngroups in this country. It is supported by a wide variety of \nstakeholders--from the Farm Bureau to the National Wildlife Federation.\n  This revamped conservation title is huge for rural America and for my \nState. It is critical for farming and ranching families looking to keep \ntheir land in agriculture generation to generation. It is incredibly \nimportant for our hunters and sportsmen. It is important for anybody--\nwhich is most of us--who cares about the long-term health of our soil, \nour air, and our water. These conservation measures help us improve the \nefficiency of production agriculture and improve the quality of the \nenvironment in farm country. We recognize that keeping these landscapes \nin their historical, undeveloped state is an economic driver for our \nentire State and for our entire region--for tourism, for wildlife \nhabitat.\n  As I have traveled Colorado over the last several years, farmers and \nranchers constantly were talking to me about the importance of \nconservation. They highlighted, in particular, conservation easements \nwhich provide Department of Agriculture assistance to help landowners \nwho are interested in voluntarily conserving the farming and ranching \nheritage of their land.\n  I wish to spend a few minutes sharing stories that Coloradans have \nshared with me. This is a photo--you don't have this as much in \nDelaware. I know you have other things. Here is a photo of a ranch in \nColorado, the Music Meadows Ranch. It is outside of Westcliffe, CO, \nelevation 9,000 feet.\n  I have a version of this picture in my office here in Washington. It \nis 4,000 acres. The rancher's name is Elin Ganschow. It is some of the \nfinest grass-fed beef in the country, raised by Elin and her family at \nthis ranch. Thanks to the Grassland Reserve Program, Elin's ranch now \nhas a permanent conservation easement. It provides wildlife habitat for \nelk, mule deer, pronghorn antelope, black bear, and mountain lions, \nspecies prized by Colorado sportsmen. They contribute millions of \ndollars to our State's economy, and she has been able to continue \nhaving her family ranch.\n  Thanks to an amendment adopted by the Agriculture Committee this \nyear, we will see even more of these easements happen on high-priority \nlandscapes such as the Music Meadows Ranch. I thank Chairwoman Stabenow \nand Senator Cochran for working so hard with me to get that amendment \napproved.\n  Private lands conservation such as this, the type aided by the farm \nbill, is absolutely critical for so many reasons. It is poorly \nunderstood in the East, but it is an incredibly important tool for \nthose of us in the West to keep our family farms and ranches family \nfarms and ranches and provide the habitat needed for our sportsmen and \nfor tourism.\n  Here is another example of why this bill is so crucial for our \nsportsmen and outdoor recreation economy. This is a photo taken of a \nfriend, John Gale, hunting pheasants in Yuma County, CO. The \nConservation Reserve Program, CRP, provides important habitat for \npheasants and other upland birds all across the country. The land \nsurrounding this is all CRP land--everything you can see and far beyond \nthat--and it has enabled this pheasant hunting to happen in our State.\n  The CRP program protects habitats in addition to holding in place \nhighly erodable soil--something we have a lot of history with in \nColorado. For instance, the soil in Baca County, CO, has over 250,000 \nacres enrolled in CRP. Baca County was absolutely devastated by the \nDust Bowl of the 1930s, as chronicled in Tim Egan's ``The Worst Hard \nTime,'' and other books. Thanks to CRP, Baca County has weathered \nrecent droughts much better than it otherwise would have.\n  Healthy grasslands, open landscapes, and abundant wildlife are a \nfundamental part of what it is to be in the West. We need to preserve \nthose grasslands, those open spaces, and those species, and that is \nwhat the conservation title of the farm bill does.\n  I strongly support this new conservation title as reported out of the \ncommittee in a bipartisan vote. I know some are going to try to amend \nthis bipartisan consensus.\n  One of the great things about serving on the Agriculture Committee is \nthere is so little partisanship. The differences we have are not \nRepublican versus Democrat. We have some differences, but they tend to \nbe regional and understandable. We have a way, a process, and the \nleadership to actually work through issues together. It would be nice \nif we did more of that around here.\n  I am worried there will be some amendments that will come forward, \namong other things, in the name of deficit reduction, which, as I \nmentioned earlier, is already reflected by this committee's work, \nunlike every other committee in the Congress.\n  As far as Lee amendment No. 1017 and No. 1018, I appreciate my \nneighbor's effort on deficit reduction. These programs repeal the \nimportant programs I talked about here on which our farmers and \nranchers rely, and they keep our soil on the ground, not in our wind \nand air.\n  Lee amendment No. 1017 repeals the CRP program I spoke about earlier. \nI have been on this floor many times to talk about cutting our deficit. \nI am glad we have been part of a process which has actually led to \ndeficit reduction. We need to put the entire budget under a microscope, \nincluding agriculture, to cut waste and eliminate redundancies.\n  Let me say again, including agriculture, the bill we have on this \nfloor makes those cuts--$24 billion in all. Some $6 billion of these \ncuts come from conservation. Not all of those cuts are cuts I like, but \nI agreed to them in the package we were moving forward. We made \ndifficult compromises at the committee level, and now we have a more \nefficient conservation title as a result that won support from both \nsides of the aisle. Over 650 conservation groups support the \nconservation title before us, and I urge my colleagues to support it \nand oppose amendments which would weaken the title and undermine the \ngood work of Republicans and Democrats on the committee.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss some of the \namendments I offered to the 2013 farm bill. First of all, let me start \nby thanking the chairwoman and the ranking member for their leadership \nand listening to the voices of the members of the Agriculture Committee \nwhen it comes to reauthorizing the farm bill which is set to expire at \nthe end of September. We have not been able to agree on all aspects of \nthe farm bill, but our chairwoman and ranking member should, however, \nbe recognized for their tireless work in getting a farm bill done this \nyear.\n  One way or another, we need to move this process forward. We came \nclose when the Senate passed a farm bill, but we were unable to get the \nHouse to move it. I hope this year we can complete the process and get \na bill we can put on the President's desk so we are able to give the \nproducers around this country the certainty they need when it comes to \nplanting and making decisions about the future of their farming \noperations.\n  While this bill is commonly called the farm bill, the majority of \nspending is not for the agricultural producers. The nutrition title of \nthis bill, which is primarily food stamps, or what we refer to as SNAP, \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, accounts for 77 percent of \nthe spending in the farm bill programs over the next 10 years. Let me \nrepeat that: Seventy-seven percent of all spending in this farm bill\n\n[[Page S3825]]\n\ndoesn't have anything to do with production agriculture, but is in what \nwe refer to as the nutrition title of the farm bill.\n  It is important we subject all areas of Federal spending to close \nexamination, and that includes the nutrition title of the farm bill. \nThere should be no exceptions.\n  I recently introduced legislation that will reform several components \nof the nutrition title and save more than $30 billion from the $760 \nbillion nutrition title, and that is a 10-year number.\n  These commonsense reforms to SNAP generate significant savings \nwithout altering benefits to needy families. The SNAP is exceedingly \ncomplex. We should be vigilant to ensure that taxpayers' money is \nindeed going to help lift those in need out of poverty instead of going \nto ineffective programs that are mired in bureaucracy.\n  I have offered several parts of the amendments of this reform package \nto the farm bill currently on the floor. My amendment No. 991, which I \nhope to have an opportunity to get voted on after we return following \nnext week, reforms the nutrition, education, and obesity prevention \ngrant program. While well-intended, the current structure of this \nprogram funnels 52 percent of the funding to only four States. This is \nan inequitable use of funds which should be spent more equitably among \nprogram participants.\n  My amendment restructure of these grants will allow the States to \nreceive up to $5 per SNAP enrollee indexed for inflation. Five dollars \nis the median value of what is currently spent on this education \nprogram per capita across all the States.\n  This amendment in no way limits the capacity of the States to \nleverage those dollars with their own funding to deliver more nutrition \neducation services. By reforming these grants, all recipients of SNAP \nbenefits will have more equal access to nutrition education and obesity \nprevention resources that will help them make healthy choices when \nshopping on a budget.\n  This amendment will save $2 billion over the next 10 years without \nimpacting SNAP's benefits for those in need. Again, I want to stress \nthis: Reforming this program does not affect the true mission of SNAP, \nwhich is providing food assistance to needy families. There is nothing \nin this amendment that changes eligibility requirements for SNAP \nbenefits. Even after this nutrition education program is reformed, \napproximately $250 million a year will still be available to the States \nfor these education programs.\n\n  The priority of the SNAP should be providing food assistance to needy \nfamilies while they work to get back on their feet. Unfortunately, the \nnutrition, education and obesity grant program has become so partial to \njust a few large States that these States are expanding the use of \nthese grants to fund lobbying campaigns instead of reaching out to \neducate SNAP families on making healthy choices while shopping on a \nbudget.\n  Clearly, this program is in need of reform. Making commonsense \nchanges to the SNAP shows the American people we are holding each \nFederal program up to the light and making sure the taxpayers' money is \nbeing spent for the public good.\n  Again, these are largely administrative changes to the SNAP that do \nnot impact SNAP benefits for those who are truly in need of food \nassistance. A $2 billion cut represents less than \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of \nwhat the Federal Government will spend on SNAP over the next 10 years.\n  I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me today in \ntelling the American people we are committed to program integrity and \nquality among SNAP beneficiaries.\n  In the course of the next few weeks when we get back on this bill, I \nlook forward to engaging my colleagues in a fair and open debate about \nhow we can improve all farm bill programs that strengthen the stability \nand safety of our Nation's food supply for the next 5 years and beyond.\n  This is a commonsense amendment that saves us a couple of billion \ndollars which we can add to the savings in this bill in a time when we \nhave rising deficits and debt and budgetary constraints we are \noperating with.\n  I hope we will be able to come together in the interest of reform--\nreform that actually targets the administrative costs of a program and \ndoes not impact benefits that are so needed for people who truly do \nneed food assistance. I hope to get that amendment voted on when we \nreturn to the bill.\n  The second amendment I want to mention today is another one I have \nfiled, and that deals with the commodity title of the farm bill.\n  Last year this body passed a farm bill by a vote of 64 to 35. This \nwas a farm bill that most of us believed offered a level of reform we \ncould support and defend to the American taxpayer.\n  Several of my colleagues and I pointed out in the Agriculture \nCommittee debate that we have deep concerns regarding what we believe \nis a step backward in the commodity title of this bill with the \ncreation of the Adverse Market Payments, or what we now call the AMP \nProgram.\n  This program takes us a step backward from last year's farm bill by \nrecreating a program with countercyclical payments and fixed target \nprices which the Senate farm bill completely eliminated last year.\n  Our concerns are not crop specific, but they are policy specific. \nMost Agriculture Committee members were told by our producers that they \ndon't need an additional commodity title program, and that a sound crop \ninsurance program is a much higher priority.\n  My amendment No. 1092 is a response to the wishes of most of the \nfarmers in the United States. It simply strikes the newly created and \nunneeded Adverse Market Payments or AMP Program and places peanuts and \nrice back into the ARC Program. To put it simply, this amendment \nrestores the reform-minded, market-oriented commodity title included in \nthe farm bill we passed in the Senate last year.\n  This amendment also saves taxpayers more than $3 billion relative to \nthe bill that is on the floor today.\n  High target prices are an outdated concept from past farm bills. They \ndistort planning decisions, raise trade compliance issues, and they are \nnot an effective use of limited taxpayer dollars.\n  While I appreciate the work our chairwoman and ranking member have \nput into this farm bill, I believe the inclusion of target prices is a \nstep backward from a market-oriented farm policy that is anchored by a \nstrong crop insurance program.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment that recaptures the \nlevel of reform we achieved in last year's farm bill, and at the same \ntime saves more than $3 billion over the bill that is on the floor \ntoday.\n  Both of these amendments have been filed. I hope as the debate moves \nforward we can get these amendments up and voted on.\n  If we are serious about moving farm policy in this country in a \ndirection of reform that is market oriented and is about the future and \nnot the past, then this commodity title amendment makes all the sense \nin the world and, again, saves $3 billion over the bill that is on the \nfloor today.\n  I simply say with regard to the nutrition title amendment that too \nsaves a couple of billion dollars. It makes reforms that I think create \ngreater efficiency in the food stamp program and helps to address what \nI think is a very serious need which I think we all need to be aware \nand conscious of in the times we are in, and that is the out-of-control \nspending and out-of-control debt we are passing on to our children, \ngrandchildren, and future generations. Passing a farm bill to achieve \nthe highest level possible of additional savings, to me, seems to be a \nvery high priority, and both of these amendments address those \nparticular objectives.\n  I look forward to getting these amendments hopefully voted on when we \nreturn.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cowan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments \nbe in order: Moran No. 987 and\n\n[[Page S3826]]\n\nCoons-Johanns No. 1079; that at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, June 3, the Senate \nproceed to votes in relation to the two amendments in the order listed; \nthat there be no second-degree amendments in order to either amendment \nprior to the votes, and that there be 2 minutes equally divided between \nthe votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in recent years the farm bill has changed \nand become more about welfare than providing a safety net for America's \nagriculture producers. Because this is so frustrating to me, I offered \nan amendment that would have restored the integrity of the farm bill. \nIt would have cut the food stamp program by about $250 billion over ten \nyears and converted it into a discretionary block grant. I am \ndisappointed the Senate rejected my amendment by a vote of 36-60.\n  But the crop insurance program remains the heart of the farm bill. \nMany of my colleagues believe it is appropriate to reduce the program's \neffectiveness by imposing means testing and other limitations on \nparticipation. These restrictions are counterproductive and result in \ncrop insurance becoming more expensive for family farmers. I agree \nthere are many issues that should be addressed to make the farm bill \nmore about farming, but I am opposed to efforts to limit the \neffectiveness of the crop insurance program.\n\n\n                            Vote Explanation\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I wish to start by thanking Senator \nWhitehouse who has shown such strong leadership on the issue we are \ngoing to be discussing this afternoon, which is how do we get out of \nthe sequestration box we are now in. I also wish to thank him for \njoining with me in sponsoring the Cut Unjustified Tax Loopholes Act, \nwhich could do so much to address the problems we will be discussing \ntoday, including the need to move forward on solutions to our budget \ndeficit and to ending sequestration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, the Senator from \nRhode Island be recognized for his remarks on this subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, at the beginning of March, when Congress's \nfailure to reach a compromise on deficit reduction triggered \nsequestration, some in Congress were ready to declare victory. \n``Sequestration will take place . . . [and] I am excited,'' said one \nMember of the House of Representatives. ``It's going to be a home \nrun,'' said another Member of the House of Representatives. ``This will \nbe the first significant tea party victory,'' said a third Member of \nthe House of Representatives.\n  Well, sequestration may be a victory for the tea party, but it isn't \na victory for the American people. It is not a victory for the men and \nwomen of our military and their families.\n  Over the past 2 months, the Senate Armed Services Committee has heard \ntestimony from our highest ranking military leaders, including the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Army Chief of Staff, the \nChief of Naval Operations, the Air Force Chief of Staff, the Commandant \nof the Marine Corps, and the Combatant Commanders who are responsible \nfor our forces in Afghanistan and Korea and around the world. Each of \nthese military leaders told us that continued sequestration will damage \nour security and harm the troops they lead.\n  General Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff, warned \nus:\n\n       If sequestration occurs, it will severely limit our ability \n     to implement our defense strategy. It will put the Nation at \n     greater risk of coercion, and it will break faith with men \n     and women in uniform.\n\n  He warned us that continued sequestration would ``destroy'' military \nreadiness. General Amos, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, told us: \n``Sequestration will leave ships in ports, aircraft grounded for want \nof necessary maintenance and flying hours, units only partially trained \nand reset after 12 years of continuous combat, and modernization \nprograms canceled.'' The result, he stated, would be ``a lapse in \nAmerican leadership.''\n  General Odierno, the Chief of Staff of the Army, told us:\n\n       Sequestration will result in delays to every one of our 10 \n     major modernization programs, the inability to re-set our \n     equipment after 12 years of war, and unacceptable reductions \n     in unit and individual training. . . . It will place an \n     unreasonable burden on the shoulders of our soldiers and \n     civilians. . . . If we do not have the resources to train and \n     equip the force, our soldiers, our young men and women, are \n     the ones who will pay the price, potentially with their \n     lives.\n\n  The Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force warned:\n\n       Lost flight hours will cause unit stand-downs which will \n     result in severe, rapid, and long-term unit combat readiness \n     degradation. We have already ceased operations for one-third \n     of our fighter and bomber force. Within 60 days of a stand \n     down, the affected units will be unable to meet emergent or \n     operations plans requirements.\n\n  The Vice Chief of Naval Operations told us:\n\n       In FY13, we will reduce intermediate-level ship \n     maintenance, defer an additional 84 aircraft and 184 engines \n     for depot maintenance, and defer eight of 33 planned depot-\n     level surface ship maintenance availabilities. At our shore \n     bases, we have deferred about 16% of our planned FY13 shore \n     facility sustainment and upgrades, about $1 billion worth of \n     work. . . . By the end of FY13 . . . nearly two thirds of the \n     fleet . . . will be less than fully mission capable and not \n     certified for Major Combat Operations.\n\n  We rely on the men and women of our military to keep us safe and to \nhelp us meet the U.S. national security objectives around the world. We \nexpect our men and women in uniform to put their lives on the line \nevery day, but in return what we tell them is that we will stand by \nthem, we will stand by their families, we will provide them the best \ntraining, the best equipment, and the best support available to any \nmilitary anywhere in the world. Sequestration in fiscal year 2013 is \nalready undermining that commitment to the men and women in the \nmilitary and their families.\n  There may be a few people who, hearing all of this, might still \nconsider sequestration a ``victory.'' But members of the Armed Services \nCommittee who have heard the testimony--Democrats and Republicans--\nbelieve the continued sequestration is a grave mistake.\n  These cuts will damage our military readiness, restrict our ability \nto respond when crisis erupts, and restrict our flexibility in \nconfronting national security threats from Iran to North Korea to \ninternational terrorism. These cuts will cost taxpayers in the long run \nbecause maintaining our military readiness today is far less expensive \nthan rebuilding our military readiness tomorrow after it has been \nsquandered.\n  The devastating effects of sequestration are also felt in other of \nour agencies and departments. These effects are going to harm students \nand seniors and farmers and families across this Nation. Continued \nsequestration will set back our slow climb out of recession, as well as \neducation and medical research and health care and public safety.\n  As former Defense Secretary Panetta told our committee in February:\n\n       It's not just defense, it's education, loss of teachers, \n     it's childcare. . . . It's about food safety, it's about law \n     enforcement, it's about airport safety.\n\n  The desire to avoid this outcome is, I believe, bipartisan. That is \nwhy it is so baffling to me that some of our Republican colleagues \nstill refuse to allow us to take the necessary next step to avert this \ncontinued damage. By refusing to allow a House-Senate conference\n\n[[Page S3827]]\n\ncommittee to meet--a meeting in which Members of both Chambers and both \nparties would work to resolve differences between the Senate- and \nHouse-passed budgets--a few Senate Republicans are objecting to the \nsearch for a solution to sequestration. For reasons I do not \nunderstand, they are objecting now to the normal budget process they \npreviously urged us on with such energy to follow.\n  It is truly baffling because 2 months ago we heard from some \nRepublicans that it was a travesty that we had failed to pass a budget. \nThey called failure to pass a budget an outrage. Now that we have \npassed a budget, a few of our colleagues across the aisle are \npreventing us from going to conference so we can work out our \ndifferences with the House and finalize a budget.\n  Those colleagues want a guarantee in advance of a conference in which \nthey will get their way on a number of issues or else, they say, they \nare going to prevent the conference from even occurring. They want the \nrules of the game to guarantee they are going to win even before they \nagree to play. The budget resolution is no game, but the analogy is \napt.\n  I cannot understand the reasoning--I simply cannot understand that \nreasoning--but at a time when our national security is challenged on so \nmany fronts and we face the effects of sequestration that I have \noutlined, this is not just illogical, it makes responsible governing \nimpossible. It is harmful to our Nation. Getting to conference and \nworking out our differences is simply essential.\n  I am very much encouraged that some of our Republican colleagues have \ncome to the floor to point this out. They have spoken forcefully, \nadmirably, courageously about the need for the Senate to move forward. \nThey give me hope. Those Senate Republicans who have come to the floor \nand urged us to go to conference and urged those who are blocking our \nmove to conference to remove the blockage have a mission which I hope \nsucceeds.\n  I have spoken on this floor on a number of occasions about what I see \nas the proper path to sensible deficit reduction, and that is the \nreverse of sequestration. A significant majority of Americans believes \nwe need a balanced deficit reduction plan to dig us out of the hole we \nare in. Such an approach would include some additional discretionary \nbudget cuts, but prudent, prioritized cuts, replacing the hatchet which \nis sequestration with a scalpel instead.\n  Such an approach would include reforms to entitlement programs, and \nit would include revenue. Budget experts of all ideological stripes \nknow additional revenue must be part of our deficit solution. By \nclosing unjustifiable tax loopholes, such as those my Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations has outlined in detail on a bipartisan \nbasis, we can provide tens of billions of dollars for deficit \nreduction--deficit reduction that does not require us to raise the \nburden on working families or on the men and women in uniform who put \ntheir lives on the line to keep us safe. That kind of revenue will help \nus reverse sequestration--part of a solution to this budget crisis we \nare in.\n\n  A balanced approach to deficit reduction is the approach to the \nbudget which this body passed on March 24. I hope this position \nprevails in conference when we get to conference with the House. I \nwould hope the Senate position prevails. But I cannot even believe that \nMembers of this body would consider obstructing the budget process \nuntil they were given a guarantee they could get their way. It is the \nwrong way to govern. Most of us know it. You cannot guarantee in \nadvance of a conference that the conference is going to have your \noutcome. If you want to instruct conferees, fair enough, and that is \nwhat the effort has been here on the part of the Democratic majority \nleader. But for some Members of this body to insist that unless they \nare guaranteed they will get their way in conference or else they are \ngoing to block us going to conference is not the way we are able to get \nanything done here. If we all took that position, we would never get \nanything done.\n  This obstruction does a disservice to the men and women who serve in \nour military and to the people of this great Nation whom they protect. \nTheir position is as damaging as it is illogical. I hope they will soon \nrelent to logic, to the needs of the Nation, and end the objection to \nproceeding to conference with the House of Representatives, because \nthat is the way we can try to work out our differences, finalize a \nbudget, and take the necessary steps toward deficit reduction and the \nend of sequestration.\n  I thank our Presiding Officer.\n  Again, I thank Senator Whitehouse. It is his initiative that brings \nus to the floor today. It is his initiative which has cast a light in \nso many ways on the budget dilemmas we face, but also the solution to \nthese challenges.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, let me first thank Chairman Levin for \nthe immense amount of work and passion and good thought he has put into \ntrying to accelerate the day when we can say good riddance to the \nsequester. He sees firsthand, as chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, how much damage the sequester is doing to the military, to \nthe soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines who honor us by their \nservice, to the talented and loyal civilians who support their efforts. \nBut families all across the country also are feeling the painful \nconsequences of this sequester.\n  Just in my small State, Rhode Island, 8,100 folks have already seen \ntheir weekly unemployment checks reduced by $50. For a family \nstruggling to get by, losing $50 can hurt. Federal rental assistance \nhas been eliminated for 500 low-income Rhode Island families, which may \ncause some even to lose their homes.\n  Economy-wide, our nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates \nthat the $85 billion in sequester cuts this year will cost us 750,000 \njobs nationwide. We have 12 million Americans out of work already. Why \non Earth would we want to cut 750,000 more jobs?\n  As Chairman Levin said, it does not have to be this way. In fact, \nLeader Reid tried twice to bring up measures that would get rid of the \nsequester, but twice Republicans filibustered. Now they refuse even to \nallow the process to go forward that would negotiate a solution through \nthe regular legislative process. They will not even let us appoint \nSenators to negotiate a compromise between the Senate and the House \nbudgets.\n  It has been 61 days since we passed our budget, and each time we try \nto move the process along, Republicans object. If their rule is: I have \nto have it my way before I am willing to enter into negotiations and I \nneed a guarantee, I would like some of that deal too. I have some \nthings I feel pretty passionately about, and if they want to play by \nthose rules, then we should all be playing by those rules. If not, then \nlet's follow the regular order and let the process of democracy work.\n  From government shutdowns to Federal default, the other party has a \nstrategy: to manufacture one crisis after another, each time holding \nour economy hostage to demands for radical policies that the vast \nmajority of the American people reject.\n  They demand the end to Medicare as we know it. The American people \nwant no part of that. They demand cuts to Social Security. The American \npeople want no part of that. They refuse to close a single--not one, \nnot a single--corporate tax loophole. Well, huge majorities of \nAmericans want that to happen. But our friends do not care. They are \nextremists.\n  It is not just the American public, by the way, that rejects the \nextremist tea party agenda. So do economists. What economists say has \nbeen confirmed in practice by the experiences of other nations that \nfollowed the Republican austerity strategy.\n  Republicans say budget cuts are necessary to reduce the deficit, but \ntheir fervor ignores the established economic effect that has during a \nrecovery. Right now, for every $1 we cut, the economy shrinks by more \nthan $1. Their theory is when you cut $1 in government spending, that \nreleases the economy to grow more rapidly. Well, the fact is, during a \nrecovery the exact opposite is true. The way this is measured is \nthrough an economic phenomenon called the fiscal multiplier.\n  There have been a number of recent studies that try to identify what \nthe fiscal multiplier is right now, and they range from 1.4 to 3.7, \nwhich means that\n\n[[Page S3828]]\n\nfor every $1 you cut, the economy takes a $1.40 hit. There is an extra \n40-cent harm for each $1 cut to our national economy.\n  If this one is right, 3.7, then every $1 cut is $3.70 worth of harm \nto our economy. It is a multiplier of damage from government cuts. So \nshrink the GDP, which we do if we have a fiscal multiplier of 1, and \ncollect less taxes. Less taxes means less of the deficit reduction that \nis supposedly achieved by the budget cuts. It is a vicious cycle that \ncould keep our economy weak and our deficits high. We can go backward, \nand Europe proves it from Spain to Portugal to Greece.\n  Countries slashed their budgets and things got worse, double-digit \nunemployment and negative growth. We have a U.S. unemployment rate of \nabout 7.5 percent. That is way too high, but it is way better than 27 \npercent in Spain, 27 percent in Greece, and 16 percent in Portugal. We \nhad 2.3 percent growth last year. They had negative growth rates. \nNegative growth rates. Their economies contracted.\n  The evidence from the austerity experiment is in countries that cut \nthe deepest hurt themselves the worst. As we can see, employment in the \neurozone is worse by about 20 percent since the major austerity \nprograms kicked in.\n  Over that same time period unemployment in the United States is \nbetter by about 25 percent. Their policies, unemployment worse by 20 \npercent; our policies, employment better by 25 percent. A lot of these \nRepublican calls for harmful U.S. austerity cited a 2010 paper called \n``Growth in a Time of Debt'' by Harvard economists Reinhart and Rogoff. \nRepublicans loved Reinhart and Rogoff. They cited them at least five \ndozen times on the House and Senate floors to justify their demands for \nbudget cuts.\n  They cannot get enough of Reinhart and Rogoff. It turns out there is \na big problem. There were numerous errors in Reinhart and Rogoff's \ncomputations; math errors, programming errors, dropping a column of \ndata. Oh, oops. With the fiscal multiplier over 1, the best thing we \ncan do to accelerate our recovery is to lift the harmful European-style \nsequester cuts. The Job Preservation and Sequester Replacement Act of \n2013 would do just that, through September 30, giving us time to \nnegotiate a broader compromise.\n  Cosponsored by Chairman Levin, Chairman Harkin, Senator Lautenberg, \nSenator Merkley, Senator Schatz, and Senator Warren, it would replace \nthe sequester from the Buffet rule and from closing corporate tax \nloopholes, sensible tax changes that on their own we should do because \nthey make the Tax Code fairer.\n  The Buffet rule would ensure that multimillion-dollar earners pay at \nleast a 30-percent effective Federal tax rate. Last year we debated \nwhether the top income tax rate should be 35 percent or 39.6 percent. \nBut the fact is that many at the top, people making hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in a single year, will not pay anything close to \nthat rate. Why? Because the Tax Code is riddled with special provisions \nthat favor ultra-high-income earners.\n  For example, investment income is taxed at the special rate of 20 \npercent. The so-called carried interest loophole allows billionaire \nprivate equity fund managers to pay this low rate. So many of them pay \nthe same tax rate or even less than a hard-working average firefighter \nor brick mason in Rhode Island making $50,000 a year. So at $200 \nmillion a year, they are paying the same tax rate as folks making \n$50,000 a year. The Buffet rule follows the common sense that people \nearning millions of dollars a year, even hundreds of millions of \ndollars a year, should pay higher tax rates than middle-class families. \nIt would also cut the deficit by $71 billion.\n  Another loophole, the so-called Edwards-Gingrich loophole, lets high-\nearning professionals dodge paying payroll taxes by calling themselves \ncorporations. We close that too, saving another $9 billion. We save \nanother $3 billion by going after a deduction that allows private jet \nowners to depreciate their planes faster than commercial aircraft are \nallowed to be depreciated, another commonsense change.\n  The fourth part of the proposal would contribute $24 billion to \nlifting the sequester by ending tax breaks for Big Oil. Over the past \ndecade, the five largest oil companies have reaped over $1 trillion in \nprofits. That is trillion with a ``t''--$1 trillion in profits. While \nthey are making that massive profit, they nevertheless pull strings in \nCongress to keep billions of dollars a year that regular taxpayers have \nto cough up for them in tax giveaways. As with all of the elements in \nthis bill, repealing Big Oil giveaways is something we should be doing \nanyway, just because it is the right thing to do.\n  Finally, we end a tax break for companies that ship jobs overseas. \nBelieve it or not, the Tax Code allows manufacturers to indefinitely \ndelay paying taxes on profits in overseas operations. Ending this \nunfair and un-American advantage would lower the deficit by another $20 \nbillion. Each one of those five reforms would make the Tax Code fairer \nfor all Americans. They are each worth passing for that reason alone. \nThey are embarrassments in our Tax Code. Getting rid of them could stop \nthe sequester while Democrats and Republicans work together on a \nbalanced deficit reduction package; that is, of course, if we could get \nRepublicans to actually work with us and negotiate and go through the \nregular order they have claimed for so long to seek, to get to a \nbalanced and negotiated deficit reduction package.\n  But as Chairman Levin pointed out, at the moment they refuse to even \nappoint conferees to begin the process. They want to be assured they \nwill have it their way before they even begin to negotiate. As I said \nearlier in the speech, if that is the way they are going to behave, I \nwant some of that action myself. I have many things I feel very \nstrongly about.\n  I could be in a position to say I will not allow us to go to \nconference either until we are clear that we are never going to do \nchained CPI and put that burden on our Social Security-receiving \nseniors. I could do that and say we are never going to go to conference \nunless I get a guarantee that we are going to get a carbon fee so the \nbig polluters are paying their share and we are not having to subsidize \nwhat they are doing to our atmosphere and oceans. I could say those \nthings. Any one of us could say those things.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator would yield for a question, if that \nposition were taken by all of us, that is a guarantee of inaction?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. That is a guarantee of total gridlock and failure. \nThat is why it is so important that no one in this body try to use that \nkind of hostage-taking extremist tactic, rather than allowing the \nregular order to continue.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Since I have interrupted the Senator, let me ask one \nadditional question. I notice that even though the Senator's menu \nyields $127 billion, that he only requires $85 billion for the 1-year \nsequester replacement, which means that, for instance, if just the \nBuffet rule were put in place, which is a tax fairness approach, plus \nthe bottom one, a tax break for offshoring, those two items out of this \nmenu--and there are many other items which are not on the Senator's \nmenu, those two items alone could reverse sequester for 1 year?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wish to make one more comment about offshoring. My dear \nfriend from Rhode Island knows that my permanent subcommittee has done \na lot of work on the tax breaks for offshoring. In addition to what the \nSenator said about delaying the tax on profits, under our Tax Code, \ncompanies which move jobs overseas get a tax deduction for the cost of \nthe moving?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. They do.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If they are building a plant overseas, the cost of that \nplant can be deducted currently?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It can.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This is perhaps the most stunning thing I have learned \nfairly recently. It is even possible under our Tax Code for the cost of \noperations of that facility to be deducted currently, while the tax on \nthe profits or the income of that operation is delayed, which means \nthey can cut domestic taxes by the cost of running a foreign operation \ncurrently. That takes a little bit of gimmickry to do it, but that is \nwhat is going on. I just wanted to kind of fill in that one little \nelement of some of these offshore bonanzas, these incredible loopholes \nthat are in the Tax Code.\n  As the Senator from Rhode Island said, we should get rid of some of \nthese\n\n[[Page S3829]]\n\nthings even if we had no deficit because, as the Senator put it, they \nare embarrassments.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Nobody has spent more time and more energy and put \nmore effort into the way in which American income gets hidden offshore \nso people can avoid paying taxes and corporations can avoid paying \ntaxes than Chairman Levin. He is our expert. There are indeed other \nloopholes that are exploited, primarily by corporations but also by \nvery high-income taxpayers, hiding money in the Cayman islands, putting \nassets into Ireland and other tax havens, and refusing to treat them as \nAmerican, even though it is nominally an American company. There are \nenumerable tricks.\n  I will close by making one point. Very often people look at what we \nare trying to accomplish, and even actually pretty honest reporters \nwill say the Democrats actually want to raise taxes. That is the fight. \nRepublicans want to cut spending; Democrats want to raise taxes. No. We \nraised taxes once already. We raised the rates for people over $450,000 \nthousand a year in the last big agreement. What we want to do now is to \ngo into the Tax Code and close down the loopholes. That is all we are \nlooking for.\n  What most Americans do not understand is that if we look at how much \nmoney goes out the backdoor of the Tax Code through loopholes, through \nspecial rates, through exemptions and so forth, it is very nearly the \nsame amount of money that is actually collected through the Tax Code \nand becomes the revenue of the United States of America. We let almost \nas much money out the backdoor of the Tax Code as we collect through \nthe Tax Code. If we take a look at the areas where Chairman Levin has \ndone so much good research, that money actually never gets into the Tax \nCode to go out the backdoor.\n  If we were to count that, in addition to the money that is allowed \nout the backdoor of the Tax Code, there is actually more that goes out \nthe backdoor of the Tax Code and is avoided coming through the Tax Code \nthan is actually collected as the revenues of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  So it is a big number. The refusal of the Republicans to let us \nattack one single loophole, not one loophole--every loophole is sacred \nright now to them--I think is unjustified. I hope the people of America \nunderstand we are not looking at more tax rate increases; we are \nlooking only at closing these loopholes. It is a rich field to pursue \nbecause more money goes through that than actually gets collected. You \ncan bet, if you are an average American, that when those loopholes were \nbeing carved into the Tax Code, you were not in the room. The special \ninterests were in the room.\n  That is why a lot of people want to defend them. But it is also a \nvery good reason for making a more honest Tax Code that gets rid of \nthese loopholes. But our friends want to crisis manufacture. They want \nto do crisis manufacture so they can force-feed on all of us bad \neconomic ideas that Americans do not want. I think we need to resist \nthat.\n  I yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Again, if my friend would yield, the name of the bill \nwhich the Senator cosponsored is called Cut Unjustifiable Tax \nLoopholes.\n  There are plenty of tax deductions which are totally justified. \nMortgage interest is justified, accelerated depreciation, there are all \nkinds of contributions.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Charitable deductions.\n  Mr. LEVIN. These are justifiable tax deductions. What we are talking \nabout are the unjustifiable ones which shouldn't be there. As the \nSenator points out, we are not proposing tax rate increases. The way I \nphrase it is I am talking about collecting taxes which should be paid.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Not increasing taxes or the rates for taxes, but \ncollecting the taxes which, in all justice, really should be collected \nby Uncle Sam.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Let me thank the chairman for allowing me to join him \ntoday. He has shown great leadership in this area, and I am privileged \nto be here with him today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/23/senate-section/article/S3829-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3829-S3830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, after several hearings and five lengthy \nmarkup sessions, the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday evening voted \nwith a strong bipartisan vote of 13-5 to report the Border Security, \nEconomic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act to the full \nSenate. This vote demonstrated our commitment to bring millions of \npeople out of the shadows and into American life by establishing a \npathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in \nthis country. It addresses the lengthy backlogs in our current \nimmigration system that have kept families apart sometimes for decades. \nIt grants a faster track to the ``dreamers'' and to the agricultural \nworkers who are an essential part of our communities and our economy. \nIt makes important changes to the visas used by dairy farmers, \ntourists, and investors who create American jobs that spur our economy. \nIt improves the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers so that the \nUnited States will remain the beacon of hope in the world.\n  I am immensely proud of the process through which the Judiciary \nCommittee considered this bill. The Committee held more than 37 hours \nof debate in five markup sessions spread over almost 2 weeks. We \nconsidered 212 amendments offered by Republican and Democratic \nSenators, and voted to accept 141 of those amendments. The committee \naccepted amendments from nearly every member of the Judiciary \nCommittee. Every Republican member but one offered amendments the \ncommittee voted to accept by a bipartisan majority. Senator Cruz is the \nlone exception and his amendments were all defeated by bipartisan \nmajorities.\n  Of the more than 300 amendments filed, more than 200 were debated. By \ncontrast, during the committee's consideration of the Immigration \nReform and Control Act of 1986, the number of amendments voted on was \n11. In 2006, the committee's consideration of the Securing America's \nBorders Act voted on approximately 60 amendments. The quality of the \ndebate and the effort that went into it is a testament to the committee \nand each of its members, even those who ultimately voted against the \nbill.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I ensured more process \nand transparency than any previous committee consideration of \nimmigration reform. Committee members filed their amendments 2 days \nbefore our first markup, giving members, their staffs and the public \nample time to review those amendments so they could be thoroughly \ndebated. For the first time in the committee's history, amendments were \nposted online on our committee website for the public to review. The \nmarkup meetings themselves were broadcast online and on public \ntelevision so that they could be viewed across the country. Many \nmembers of the public also lined up early each morning to attend the \nmeetings in person. Families, faith leaders, advocates and community \nleaders were present to witness the committee's deliberations. This was \nan open, thorough, and thoughtful debate.\n  In real time, as members accepted and rejected amendments, the \ncommittee's website was updated to reflect which amendments were \nmodified, accepted or defeated. In addition to the live webcast and \ngavel-to-gavel coverage on C-SPAN, I provided regular updates through \nthe Judiciary Committee's website, Twitter and other means. I was \nheartened to see a Vermont editorial describe the Judiciary Committee \nmarkup as a ``lesson in democracy.''\n  The committee unanimously approved my amendment to permanently \nauthorize and further strengthen the EB-5 Regional Center Program which \nwill benefit the economy. The United States Citizenship and Immigration \nServices, USCIS, estimates that the EB-5 Regional Center Program has \ncreated tens of thousands of American jobs and has attracted more than \n$1 billion in investment in communities all across the United States \nsince 2006. Senator Sessions spoke in support of my amendment before it \nwas adopted without a single vote in opposition.\n  Another example of the Committee's bipartisan efforts to improve this \nlegislation was offered by Senators Hatch, Coons and Klobuchar, to \nincrease certain immigration fees and direct a portion of the proceeds \nto the States to\n\n[[Page S3830]]\n\nfund science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education and \ntraining that will help drive American competitiveness. Senator Schumer \noffered a second degree amendment to ensure that a percentage of the \nfunding is used to promote STEM education in groups that are \nunderrepresented in the sciences, such as women and racial minorities. \nBoth amendments were accepted by the committee by unanimous consent.\n  The committee considered 35 amendments to strengthen the bill's \nborder security provisions offered by both Republicans and Democrats. \nOf the 26 amendments accepted to this section, 10 were offered by \nRepublicans. Senator Grassley offered an amendment to expand the \nComprehensive Southern Border Strategy to include all border sectors, \nnot just high-risk sectors. The committee accepted amendments by \nSenators Flake and Grassley to increase oversight of DHS enforcement \nstrategies, and amendments by Senators Sessions and Cornyn to protect \nborder communities. These amendments add to, and strengthen, the strong \nenforcement provisions already included in the bill.\n  These amendments are just a few of the amendments offered to \nstrengthen provisions in the pre-Title and Title I border security \nprovisions and promote jobs and innovation in the non-immigration visa \nprovisions in Title IV of the bill. Other bipartisan proposals to \nprovide assistance for American workers to apply for jobs in the \ntechnology sector and establish employee reporting requirements to \naddress potential abuse of the visa system have also been adopted.\n  The Judiciary Committee debated and accepted 48 amendments offered by \nRepublican members. I was encouraged by the committee's open and \nrespectful debate. In a time where partisan brinksmanship has become \nthe norm, the Judiciary Committee was able to demonstrate the need for \ncompromise and find common ground to stand on in pursuit of \ncomprehensive immigration reform. The result of our committee's \nconsideration is a stronger, more bipartisan bill, and I look forward \nto working with the rest of the Senate to ensure its passage.\n  The bill is not the one that I would have drafted. I voted for \namendments that were rejected and against amendments that were \naccepted. The bill mandates more than $1.5 billion of more southern \nborder fencing, which I believe a mistake. My greatest disappointment \nis that the legislation that comes from the Senate Judiciary Committee \ndoes not recognize the rights of all Americans, including gay and \nlesbian Americans who have just as much right to spousal immigration \nbenefits as anyone else. I will continue my efforts to end the needless \ndiscrimination so many Americans face in our immigration system. This \ndiscrimination serves no legitimate purpose and it is wrong.\n  Since the beginning of this Congress, I have tried to make \ncomprehensive immigration reform our top legislative priority in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. In January at Georgetown University Law \nCenter, I outlined my expectation that comprehensive immigration reform \nwould be the matter to which the Judiciary Committee would devote \nitself this spring and announced an early hearing to highlight the \nnational discussion. I followed through. The committee held three \nhearings on comprehensive immigration reform in February and March.\n  I have said since the beginning of the year that I was looking \nforward to seeing principles turned into legislation. The Judiciary \nCommittee has now advanced such a bill. We completed our work a month \nlater than I had hoped, but we had to begin much later than I had \nhoped. We were able to make up ground by concentrating our efforts \nduring the 5 weeks since the bill was introduced in which we held three \nmore hearings and five extended markup sessions.\n  I have favored an open and transparent process during which all 18 \nSenators serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee had the opportunity \nto participate and to propose or oppose ideas for reform. The Majority \nLeader agreed that we needed regular order in the consideration of \ncomprehensive immigration reform. The process took time and was not \neasy. There were strongly-held, differing points of view.\n  I am encouraged that after two resounding presidential defeats, some \nRepublican politicians are concerned enough about the growing Hispanic \nvoting population that they are abandoning their former demagoguery and \ncoming to the table. In what is being called its ``autopsy'' of the \nlast election, the Republican National Committee wrote: ``Hispanic \nvoters tell us our Party's position on immigration has become a litmus \ntest, measuring whether we are meeting them with a welcome mat or a \nclosed door.'' After slamming the door on our efforts for comprehensive \nimmigration reform during the Bush administration, I welcome \nRepublicans to this effort. I continue to fear that some merely want to \ntalk the talk while looking for excuses to abandon what needs to be a \nbipartisan effort.\n  Few topics are more fundamental to who and what we are as a Nation \nthan immigration. The Statue of Liberty has long proclaimed America's \nwelcome: ``Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning \nto breathe free. . . . Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I \nlift my lamp beside the golden door!'' That is what America has stood \nfor and what we should continue to represent. Immigration throughout \nour history has been an ongoing source of renewal of our spirit, our \ncreativity and our economic strength.\n  In the course of our deliberations I have quoted my friend of many \nyears, Ted Kennedy. In the summer of 2007, as our effort at \ncomprehensive immigration reform was being blocked in the Senate, he \nspoke about his disappointment and our resolve. He said: ``A minority \nin the Senate rejected a stronger economy that is fairer to our \ntaxpayers and our workers. A minority of the Senate rejected America's \nown extraordinary immigrant history and ignored our Nation's most \nurgent needs. But we are in this struggle for the long haul. . . . As \nwe continue the battle, we will have ample inspiration in the lives of \nthe immigrants all around us.'' I have taken inspiration from many \nsources, from our shared history as immigrants and as Americans, from \nthe experiences of my own grandparents, and from our courageous \nwitnesses Jose Antonio Vargas and Gaby Pacheco and from the families \nthat can be more secure when we enact comprehensive immigration reform.\n  The dysfunction in our current immigration system affects all of us \nand it is long past time for reform. I hope that our history, our \nvalues, and our decency can inspire us finally to take action. We need \nan immigration system that lives up to American values and helps write \nthe next great chapter in American history by reinvigorating our \neconomy and enriching our communities. Together we can work to pass a \nbill that repairs our broken immigration system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/23/senate-section/article/S3830-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3830-S3831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             POSTAL REFORM\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this year, as I do every year, I have met \nwith many Vermonters who have come up to me to express their views \nabout the future of the U.S. Postal Service. But this year, these \nmeetings have taken a different tone. Today, rather than asking me how \nthe Senate can make a durable and effective institution even stronger, \nVermonters ask me how the Senate can stave off the impending default of \nthe Postal Service. I hear these questions from businesses, from \nprivate citizens, and from postal employees. I am stopped by Vermonters \nin the grocery store or at the gas pump, wanting to know what we in the \nSenate will do. Vermont, because of our mostly rural population, is \nmore dependent on the Postal Service than are urban and densely \npopulated States. Vermonters, almost to a person, subscribe to Ben \nFranklin's vision of a public Postal Service that guarantees the \ndelivery of mail to everyone.\n  These questions about the coming collapse of the Postal Service are \nstrange to say the least. The USPS posted a $100 million profit from \nits business operations during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. \nSo how is it that a company that made $100 million in the first quarter \nof this fiscal year is in financial trouble? As in far too many other \ninstances, the problem is not with the Postal Service, the problem is \nwith the United States House of Representatives.\n\n[[Page S3831]]\n\n  In 2006, by unanimous consent, the Senate took up and passed the \nHouse's Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act. One of the \nprovisions of this bill, meant to shore up the long-term security of \npostal retiree health benefits, required that the Postal Service begin \nthe prepayment of health benefits 75 years in advance. While no other \npublic agency or private business stipulates this degree of prepayment, \nI consented in 2006 because the economy was strong, the Postal Service \ncould manage these prepayments, and I believed that any needed changes \nto the proposal could be made with the same level of bipartisan comity \nas in 2006. How wrong I was.\n  Of course, since 2006, the economy has collapsed, first-class mail \nvolume has fallen precipitously, and bipartisanship in the Congress has \ntaken a nose dive. These factors together explain how the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives has converted a $100 million profit in the first \nquarter of fiscal 2013 into a $1.3 billion loss. While many American \nbusinesses have gone under during the Great Recession and others have \nstruggled just to stay afloat, House Republicans have refused to budge \non the health benefits prepayment.\n  You may ask why the onus resides at the feet of House Republicans. \nAfter all, the Senate consented to the 2006 House Republican-sponsored \nbill. But since that time, only the U.S. Senate has taken measures to \nsolve the problem. Last year we took up and passed the 21st Century \nPostal Service Act of 2012, which would have lightened the fiscal \nburden on the Postal Service until its lost revenues from the economic \nslump and reductions in first-class mail could be offset by growth into \nthe package delivery market. This bill was passed on a bipartisan basis \nhere in the Senate despite record-breaking partisanship by the Senate \nminority. I should note, as with any bipartisan measure, there were \nprovisions in this bill with which I disagreed. Yet it turned out to \nmake little difference, since the Senate bill languished in the House. \nIn fact, the House even failed to take up its own bill and pass it as \nan alternative to the Senate proposal.\n  Meanwhile, the Postal Service continues to stagger under the crushing \nburden of 75 years of prepayments for retiree health benefits. This \neffort, which originally looked like a reasonable effort to shore up \nretiree benefits, has become the proverbial albatross.\n  Rather than addressing this problem, the strategy of the House of \nRepresentatives appears to be to force the Postal Service into default, \nat which point their draconian demands for slashing cuts will look \nreasonable by comparison to their manufactured crisis. If this strategy \nsounds familiar, it should--it is the same strategy Republicans used to \nnegotiate the Budget Control Act of 2011, using U.S. credit worthiness \nas a hostage they seemed more than willing to kill. This strategy \nultimately cost the United States its triple-A rating with Standard and \nPoor's and an estimated $1.3 billion in additional interest payments in \n2011 alone, according to the Government Accountability Office. And that \nfigure will escalate with time. That's $1.3 billion more that taxpayers \nwill pay to Chinese lenders and Wall Street banks in order for \nRepublicans to secure sequestration cuts to Medicare cancer treatments, \ncut National Guard technicians' salaries through furlough, and reduce \nHead Start programs for needy children.\n  The strategy worked so well in the summer of 2011 that it has \novertaken everything else in the Republican playbook. Unable to sell a \nshrinking vision of America to voters in 2012, Republicans are left \nwith procedural mechanisms to obtain their desired outcome. Ironically, \nif they are successful, they are likely to simultaneously celebrate \nvictory and blame President Obama and Senate Democrats for letting them \nget their way. If that seems like an absurdity, compare the conflicting \nstatements of the Speaker of the House John Boehner and Chairman of the \nNational Republican Congressional Committee Greg Walden on proposed \ncuts to Social Security in the President's 2014 budget proposal. The \nPresident finally proposed reductions to entitlement programs after \nRepublicans had long demanded such cuts, eliciting muted praise from \nSpeaker Boehner while Chairman Walden accused the President of ``going \nafter seniors.'' I should note that as part of House leadership, \nChairman Walden works for Speaker Boehner.\n  So do not be surprised when a new rendition of this plan causes a \ndefault by the Postal Service, after which Republicans demand \nreductions in the Postal Service's competitive product line and massive \nlayoffs of postal employees. I supported last year's Senate postal \nreform bill in the hope of striking a compromise. But there are better \nways to balance the Postal Service's books, and recognizing that the \nHouse has refused compromise, I am glad to join Senator Sanders and \nother Democratic Senators in a full-throated articulation of a better \nvision for the USPS.\n  This vision is articulated by our bill, the Postal Service Protection \nAct of 2013. This bill would allow the Postal Service to recover huge \nretirement pension overpayments estimated by the Inspector General of \nUSPS to be $75 billion. It would alleviate the remaining health \nbenefits prefunding requirement. It would protect postal customers from \nhaving their local postal facilities closed without the Postal Service \nfollowing proper criteria. The bill would permit the Postal Service to \nsell non-postal products and services. It would allow the mailing of \nbeer or wine by a licensed manufacturer in accordance with the laws of \nthe States. It would permanently protect one of the Postal Service's \ngreatest commercial advantages over its competitors, Saturday delivery. \nAnd it would set the table for long-term growth into the package \ndelivery market by establishing a Chief Innovation Officer and a Postal \nInnovation Advisory Commission.\n  Like any business enterprise, the Postal Service cannot cut its way \nto greatness. It must find areas where it can grow. The Postal Service \nProtection Act of 2013 would give the Postal Service the financial \nbreathing room and innovation mechanisms it needs to chart a new and \nsustainable course in the next century, when email and package delivery \nwill supplant first class mail. These changes do not diminish our \ncommitment to Ben Franklin's vision; they facilitate its renewal, \nrecognizing that while change is not easy, it is also unavoidable. In \nthat spirit, I call on all Senators to join me in cosponsoring Senator \nSanders' Postal Service Protection Act and in keeping faith with \nAmericans by protecting an indispensable American institution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/23/senate-section/article/S3831-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3831-S3832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JOHN VARRICCHIONE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to recognize a man who is a leading \ncontributor to the preservation of the Italian community in Burlington, \nVT.\n  John Varricchione grew up in a former Italian neighborhood adjacent \nto downtown Burlington. I have my own fond memories of that \nneighborhood, travelling with my mother--a first generation Italian-\nAmerican--from Montpelier to Burlington to shop in the small, family-\nowned, Italian markets there. Only remnants of the neighborhood remain, \nas most of it was lost to urban renewal in the 1960s.\n  I had the pleasure of joining John and other members of the Vermont \nItalian Club for the dedication of a historic marker, which serves as a \nreminder of the wonderful neighborhood in which he grew up, and of the \npeople who lived there. John was instrumental in making the marker \npossible. We all shared wonderful Italian food after the dedication \nceremony. I was honored to be part of such a special event.\n  John never moved far from the old neighborhood. He stayed in Vermont \nand became an outstanding teacher and coach at Rice Memorial High \nSchool--a Catholic school in South Burlington--where he became \naffectionately known among students as ``Mister V.'' Many Rice \ngraduates consider him a favorite teacher.\n  John's contributions to the Vermont Italian Club, and his efforts to \npreserve our State's Italian heritage, are many. In honor of his work, \nI ask unanimous consent that an article published in The Burlington \nFree Press on May 10, 2013, ``Fragrant memories of Burlington's deep \nItalian roots,'' be printed into the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3832]]\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 10, 2013]\n\n          Fragrant Memories of Burlington's Deep Italian Roots\n\n                          (By Melissa Pasanen)\n\n       John Varricchione, 66, has strong memories of growing up in \n     the heart of Burlington's Little Italy, he said last Monday \n     while he and his wife helped their friend Mary Anne Gucciardi \n     make a batch of her famous meatballs in their Burlington \n     kitchen.\n       At one point, Varricchione donned an apron imprinted with \n     the name of the Vermont Italian Club and three photos from \n     the early 1900s of three families who were among the pillars \n     of the community: the Eveltis, the Varricchiones and the \n     Merolas.\n       His grandfather, Luigi Varricchione, originally came to \n     Burlington in 1912 at the suggestion of the Merolas who \n     preceded him and who hailed from the same town about an hour \n     east of Naples back in Italy.\n       The family first lived on Cherry Street at the core of the \n     Italian neighborhood, and Luigi Varricchione made wine in his \n     basement like many of the area's Italian families. He was a \n     member of the Vermont Italian Club in the 1930s when it was \n     men-only, although the club hosted regular meals for \n     everyone, charging 50 cents for men and a quarter for women \n     and children. The club maintains the tradition with an annual \n     fundraising dinner in late winter or early spring. (See \n     vermontitalianclub.org for more information.)\n       Varricchione remembers back to when he was 9 or 10 ``going \n     to mass with my father at the old Cathedral of the Immaculate \n     Conception'' and then walking a block to where his \n     grandmother lived on South Union Street with one of her sons \n     after her husband passed away.\n       ``There were grapevines growing up the wall and a garden in \n     the back for herbs,'' Varricchione recalled. ``Grandma would \n     often be making pasta from scratch and it would be hanging \n     all over on wooden drying racks or laid out on the bed on a \n     clean sheet. She would serve me a bowl of pasta with sauce or \n     a bowl of her greens and beans. On occasion,'' he added, \n     ``she'd pull out the anisette and little Johnny got to \n     taste.''\n       Both Varricchione and Gucciardi recalled the bustling \n     Italian stores with cheeses and salamis hanging from the \n     ceiling and shelves holding big jars of olives and boxes of \n     torrone, Varricchione's favorite nougat candy.\n       ``We'd go to the store for penny candy,'' said \n     Varricchione. ``There was Merola's and also Izzo's Market. \n     Both stores were very generous in allowing people to buy on \n     credit.'' The whole neighborhood was lost to urban renewal by \n     the late 1960s, Varricchione explained sadly.\n       Looming large in his recollections was the image of the \n     Italian mama ``with plenty of love and food to share,'' \n     Varricchione said. There were always many mouths to feed, he \n     said with a chuckle: ``There weren't too many small Italian \n     families.''\n       Varricchione's parents, Francesco and Simone (known as Si), \n     raised their eight children at 85 Bank St. and then 78 Pine \n     St. (now a law office).\n       ``We would have crowds to eat,'' said Varricchione, \n     recalling with relish how his mother browned pork chops and \n     then slow-braised them in red sauce. Even though his mother, \n     like Gucciardi's mother, was originally French-Canadian, she \n     learned all the Italian recipes and became a true Italian \n     mama and then nonna.\n       In a family history written by Varricchione's wife, Joanne, \n     she describes the scene:\n       ``Everyone managed to squeeze around the kitchen table \n     while Nona [sic] stood watch over the stove, stirring her \n     delicious sauce. The menu seldom varied: spaghetti and \n     meatballs, chicken or pork, salad, wine, garlic bread and ice \n     cream. The laughter and commotion only added to the wonderful \n     aromas and meals she prepared . . .

Mr. President, Vermont is home to many treasures, from our \nnatural beauties to our manufactured goods to our award-winning \nagricultural industry. It is also home to many spirited personalities, \nand today I would like to honor one of them: a good friend and talented \ncook, Mary Anne Gucciardi. Affectionately known as ``Mama Gucc'' to \nthose who have had the good fortune of sitting at her dining room \ntable, she makes newcomers feel like old friends. For more than two \ndecades, she has opened her home to hundreds of University of Vermont \nsports teams, from skiing to soccer, hockey to basketball. Her menu \nincludes classics like baked stuff mushrooms, chicken cacciatore, and \nof course meatballs and sauce. The mere mention of her name makes both \ncoaches' and athletes' mouths water.\n  Mama Gucc grew up in Haverhill, Massachusetts, the daughter of an \nItalian-American father and a French-Canadian mother. It was her \nmother's Italian mother-in-law who served as the inspiration for Mama \nGucc's gourmet Italian favorites. As the grandson of Italian immigrants \nmyself, I have benefited from Mama Gucc's lavish feasts. She has made \nme feel right like I was right back in my own mother's kitchen. Mary \nAnne's heart is even bigger than her generous portions. She has not \nonly cooked for hundreds of athletes, hosted distinguished guests such \nas bishops, senators and governors, but she has prepared countless \ncharity dinners, raising over $50,000 in scholarships in memory of a \nUVM student, Kevin Roberson, tragically killed in a car accident. Her \nlove for cooking and for hosting has made ``Mama Gucc'' a surrogate \nmother for the lucky student-athletes to come through her door, making \nthose students, sometimes hundreds of miles from their families, feel \nright at home. In 1999, The University of Vermont honored Mama Gucc and \nher husband by naming a new fitness facility the Richard and Mary Anne \nGucciardi Recreation and Fitness Center, a tribute most rightfully \ndeserved.\n  From every Vermonter who has indulged in Mama Gucc's famous cooking, \nand has been blessed with her warm hospitality and generous support, we \nthank Mary Anne Gucciardi for providing a home-away-from-home to all \nwho have passed through her doors.\n  I ask unanimous consent that The Burlington Free Press article, \n``Celebrating the Italian Mama,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 10, 2013]\n\n                    ``Celebrating the Italian Mama''\n\n       Among iconic maternal figures, the Italian mama or nonna \n     (grandmother) hovering over a fragrant pot of tomato sauce \n     ranks high--and few bring the legend to life better than \n     South Burlington's Mary Anne Gucciardi.\n       Recently in the Burlington kitchen of friends, Gucciardi, \n     80, known as Mama Gucc (pronounced ``gooch''), arrived not \n     only with ingredients to make her famous meatballs and sauce, \n     but also containers of meatballs and sauce, Italian wedding \n     soup and sausage Calabrese to give away.\n       ``You get back what you give out,'' said the mother of four \n     and grandmother of four with a smile and a shrug.\n       If that were literally the case, Gucciardi would be \n     swimming in an ocean of herb-flecked tomato sauce with \n     meatballs.\n       For more than two decades until just a few years ago, \n     Gucciardi regularly cooked huge Italian feasts for a number \n     of University of Vermont sports teams with the support of her \n     husband and family. Her multi-course dinners--usually once a \n     season for the ski, soccer, hockey and basketball teams--\n     included a variety of home-cooked Italian classics like \n     minestrone, baked stuffed mushrooms, chicken cacciatore, \n     meatballs and sauce, and lasagna for as many as 40 team \n     members.\n       ``She opened up her home to us,'' said longtime UVM men's \n     ice hockey coach, Mike Gilligan. ``She just treated the kids \n     and the coaches like they were her own family.''\n       ``Mama Gucc was just wonderful,'' agreed former men's \n     basketball coach, Tom Brennan. ``She took care of us before \n     we got pretty,'' he joked, referring to the pre-championship-\n     era of his team. ``The food was always so lavish, from soup \n     to nuts . . . You know these kids, they eat like horses. \n     Everybody would eat until they couldn't stand up.''\n       ``She was always there for us,'' Brennan continued, \n     recalling how Gucciardi accompanied the team to the 1993 \n     funeral of their recently graduated teammate, Kevin Roberson, \n     who had been tragically killed in a car accident. ``It was so \n     comforting to have her there and she brought a big pile of \n     food.''\n       In addition, the Gucciardi family held frequent dinner \n     parties for distinguished guests including coaches, senators, \n     governors, professors and bishops, and also cooked countless \n     benefit dinners, which raised more than $50,000 for a UVM \n     scholarship fund in Roberson's name. In September 1999, UVM \n     honored Gucciardi and her husband by naming a new 6,000-\n     square-foot fitness facility the Richard and Mary Anne \n     Gucciardi Recreation and Fitness Center.\n       It all began after Gucciardi met some student-athletes \n     while helping with a Newman Catholic Center fundraiser, she \n     explained while mixing together a double batch of meatballs. \n     (``I never make a single batch,'' she said.) During winter \n     break, when athletes often had to stay on campus to train, \n     she said, ``they were away from home, looking for a good \n     meal. There was a lot of joy in seeing them enjoy the food.''\n       Gucciardi also shared a more personal motivation to give \n     back after her youngest son, now 50, survived a very serious \n     car accident when he was 3\\1/2\\. The family was in the \n     process of moving to Burlington where her husband had landed \n     a job with General Electric.\n\n[[Page S3833]]\n\n     For six weeks, Gucciardi slept by her son's bedside in the \n     hospital and prayed daily in the chapel at UVM. The local \n     Italian community warmly welcomed them, she recalled, and \n     offered support. ``I just always said I would give back for \n     what was given to us,'' she said.\n\n\n                             Family recipes\n\n       Scraping the fat and caramelized bits from a pan of roasted \n     Italian sausage into her sauce pot, Gucciardi explained that \n     she has taken family recipes and ``made them my own over the \n     years.''\n       She grew up in Haverhill, Mass., with an Italian-American \n     father and a French-Canadian mother, but her mother learned \n     to cook Italian from her mother-in-law, Gucciardi's paternal \n     grandmother, ``a great cook,'' Gucciardi said.\n       After frying the onions and garlic in the sausage fat \n     (``You just get such flavor from that,'' she explained), \n     Gucciardi added tomato paste and canned Italian tomatoes \n     along with a little water and generous amounts of dried \n     parsley and basil, which would come fresh from her garden in \n     the summer, she said.\n       ``I never measure anything,'' she added apologetically.\n       Luckily for her fans, Gucciardi taught a series of cooking \n     classes in the mid-'80s for which she had to write down her \n     recipes. It was in that class that Gucciardi met John \n     Varricchione, in whose Burlington kitchen she was cooking \n     last week.\n       Varricchione, 66, a retired teacher and football coach at \n     Rice Memorial High School, grew up in the center of \n     Burlington's Italian community where, just like in \n     Gucciardi's family, his paternal grandmother taught his \n     French-Canadian mother to cook family favorites.\n       ``But I never got my grandmother's recipes,'' he said with \n     regret.\n       Last week, Varricchione and his wife, Joanne, helped \n     Gucciardi form meatballs while her sauce simmered on the \n     stove. The Varricchiones' 3-year-old grandson, Carlo \n     Pizzagalli, popped in and out of the kitchen to visit with \n     his grandparents and ``Mama Goose,'' as he called her.\n       The cooks used a small ice cream scoop to measure out each \n     meatball, a tool Gucciardi said she adopted years ago when \n     student-athletes helped her to produce meatballs for \n     fundraising dinners during which they would feed more than \n     800. ``I had it down to a science,'' she said proudly.\n       Gucciardi watched her helpers with a kind but careful eye. \n     ``If they have any cracks in them, I reject them,'' she said, \n     explaining that they would fall apart in the sauce.\n       As they worked, the scent of meatballs and simmering sauce \n     filled the kitchen. ``I can smell those meatballs cooking,'' \n     said Gucciardi happily.\n       ``That's always a good thing,'' agreed Varricchione.\n       The first batch of meatballs emerged from the oven, brown \n     and sizzling, and the second batch went in. Gucciardi stirred \n     a generous pinch of sugar into her sauce to balance the \n     acidity of the tomatoes.\n       When the meatballs had cooled a little, Carlo tasted one \n     and gave his full approval, followed by a big hug for the \n     cook.\n       The next generation had fallen in love with the cooking of \n     Mama Gucc.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/23/senate-section/article/S3833-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3833-S3834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Monday, May 27, is Memorial Day--the \nday Americans set aside to honor the brave men and women in uniform who \nhave made the greatest possible sacrifice for their country.\n  Memorial Day was informally begun by MG John A. Logan, the head of an \norganization of Union Army Civil War veterans, in 1868. It is believed \nMajor General Logan chose a date in late May because flowers would be \nin bloom all over the country. He asked the Nation to decorate the \ngraves of the war dead with flowers.\n  Mr. President, 1.1 million Americans have died defending the country \nin our Nation's wars. Freedom as we know it--here at home and around \nthe world--would not exist without their heroism.\n  The Commonwealth of Kentucky has played a vital role in this Nation's \ndefense during our history. I am honored to represent Kentuckians in \nthe Armed Forces, including those stationed at Fort Knox, Fort \nCampbell, the Blue Grass Army Depot, and members of the Reserves and \nKentucky National Guard.\n  At Fort Knox, the Memorial Day ceremony this year will continue a \ntradition of honoring the memory of one particular fallen soldier. This \nyear, that soldier is PFC David P. Nash of Daviess County, KY.\n  While serving in Vietnam on December 29, 1968, 20-year-old Private \nFirst Class Nash valiantly rolled on top of an exploding grenade to \nsave the lives of three other soldiers. We must not forget the deeds of \nPrivate First Class Nash, or the many other men and women in uniform \nwho gave their lives in service.\n  Memorial Day is a day to honor their memories, and to let their loved \nones know our country has not forgotten them. I know my fellow \nKentuckians agree that we are honored to fly the flag which these brave \nheroes sought to protect.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the importance of \nMemorial Day, a day that means so much to me, the Nation, and those I \nrepresent in Alaska. For many Alaskans, Memorial Day means the \nunofficial beginning of summer, sunlight, and enjoying the great \noutdoors.\n  But let us never forget the deep, true meaning of Memorial Day. It is \nabout taking time to pay respect, and appreciating the sacrifices of \nmen and women who have defended the rights and privileges we enjoy \ntoday. On this solemn day in which Americans unite to remember our \nNation's fallen, we also pray for our military personnel and their \nfamilies, our veterans, and all who have lost loved ones.\n  For over two centuries, brave men and women have laid down their \nlives in defense of our great Nation. These heroes have made the \nultimate sacrifice so we may uphold the ideals we all cherish. Ordinary \nmen and women of extraordinary courage have, since our earliest days, \nanswered the call of duty with valor and unwavering devotion. America's \nsons and daughters have served with honor and distinction, securing our \nliberties and laying a foundation for lasting peace.\n  Memorial Day officially began nearly 100 years before Alaskan \nstatehood, but even in our territorial days we had Alaskans who fought \non our own soil against foreign enemies--one of the few States that can \nsay such a thing. It is because of those early successes--and the \nsuccess of Alaskans from then to those deployed today--that we salute \nour flag.\n  Although we may not be able to fully measure the cost of our heroes' \nsacrifice, we can commit ourselves to preserving their memory. So on \nMemorial Day 2013, I ask that we honor our fallen heroes, comfort the \nloved ones of those we lost, and carry on our lives in a manner that is \nworthy of their sacrifice. May God continue to bless our great Nation.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as Memorial Day 2013 approaches, as our \nfellow Americans are making plans to have cookouts, enjoy the outdoors, \nand spend precious time with their loved ones, I believe we should \nremember that the reason we are able to enjoy these moments is because \nof the military servicemembers who have given ``the last full measure \nof devotion'' in the service of our great Nation. From the American \nRevolution to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, brave young men and \nwomen have always answered the call to fight for our country and for \nour freedom. They have made many sacrifices, and as we remember in \nparticular those who have fallen, I am inspired by their courage and \ndedication to freedom. The death of each one of these service men and \nwomen represents not only a tragic loss to their loved ones, but to \ntheir community and to the country.\n  This Memorial Day should be observed as a time for all Americans to \nreconnect with our history and core values by honoring those who gave \ntheir lives for the ideals we cherish. In addition to remembering the \nservicemembers who have fought and died in our Nation's wars, I believe \nthat we must also take care of the servicemembers and veterans who are \nstill with us. There are, regrettably, serious issues that still need \nto be addressed with regard to our military and veteran communities. \nActive-Duty military and veteran suicides are at record rates, Veterans \nAdministration disability claims continue to be severely delayed, \nprograms that assist discharged servicemembers transition to civilian \nlife are still inadequate, and many of our servicemembers and veterans \nstill lack the healthcare they need--and are entitled to--after a \ndecade of war. I believe that we in the Congress must do everything we \ncan do to remedy these problems. As George Washington famously said \n``The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in \nany war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how \nthey perceive veterans of early wars were treated and appreciated by \nour Nation.'' I believe this statement has added weight and meaning and \ntruth with our\n\n[[Page S3834]]\n\nNation's movement to an all-volunteer military after the Vietnam War.\n  With fewer than 1 percent of our Nation's population on active \nmilitary duty, the gap between those who have served in uniform and \nthose who have not has never been greater. These differences in life \nexperiences have led to misguided perceptions of how each group views \nthe other. The widening of this ``civilian-military gap'' makes it less \nlikely that our servicemembers and veterans will properly reintegrate \nback into our society, and less likely that our best and brightest will \npursue military service. As a society, we must address the problem. If \nwe can't care for the service men and woman and their families who have \nmade so many sacrifices on our behalf, then holidays such as Memorial \nDay end up having little relevance. One veteran I recently met with \nsaid to me, ``I fought proudly for my country in Afghanistan, but when \nI came back I didn't feel like I came back. I'm still waiting to feel \nlike I came back.'' No American who has worn the uniform of this \ncountry should have to feel this way.\n  Memorial Day is a day we Americans hold close to our hearts because \nin the sometimes hectic pace of our daily lives, we can forget just how \nfortunate we are. Memorial Day reminds us. Throughout this holiday \nweekend we will see many American flags and flowers adorning the graves \nof those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation. I will \nespecially remember in my thoughts and prayers the 127 Marylanders who \nhave been killed in our most recent conflicts, and I will remind myself \nthat our freedom isn't free. And I will remember that the best way to \nhonor their ultimate sacrifice is to ensure that we are unwavering in \nour support to care for those who do return to us wounded, ill, and \ninjured. This Memorial Day, let us affirm our commitment to those who \nhave returned from the fields of battle as the best way to honor their \nfallen comrades.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/23/senate-section/article/S3834-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3834-S3835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PUERTO RICO\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, it is important for the United States to \ncontinue its efforts to promote a close relationship with Puerto Rico \nand its citizens. That includes supporting a fair and democratic \nprocess for Puerto Ricans on the perennial and controversial issue of \nstatehood.\n  I commend Puerto Rico's new Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla on his \nwork to tackle the current challenges facing the island, particularly \non the economic front. Congress has long supported reciprocity between \nPuerto Rico and the United States, with very positive results. When the \nPuerto Rican economy flourishes, trade with the United States \nincreases, helping promote job creation here at home.\n  I am disappointed the most recent budget proposal submitted to \nCongress by the White House recommends $2.5 million in fiscal year 2014 \nto conduct yet another referendum on Puerto Rico's political status. \nAllocating U.S. taxpayer dollars for this purpose is wasteful and \nunnecessary, since a plebiscite was just held in Puerto Rico last \nNovember on this very question.\n  The vote on Election Day specifically called for Puerto Ricans to \nexpress their views on the island's political status. Its backers \nsought to show that popular support exists for turning Puerto Rico into \na State. But it is widely acknowledged that the ballot was not \ndeveloped in a fair and inclusive manner. It instead presented \nstatehood alternatives with a predetermined result in mind, to force \nPuerto Ricans toward an option they have rejected time and again, and \nto stack the deck in favor of statehood.\n  The first part of the ballot asked whether or not Puerto Rican voters \nwanted to continue their territorial status. The second portion then \nprovided three different non-territorial alternatives: statehood, \nsovereign free associated state, or independence. Keeping the island's \ncurrent Commonwealth status was not even listed as an option in the \nsecond round.\n  As expected, a slim majority--nearly 51.7 percent of the 1.9 million \nwho voted--opted for changing the current status. However, in response \nto the second question, 834,191 voters chose statehood, 498,604 left \nthe second question blank, 454,768 selected sovereign free associated \nstate, and 74,895 favored independence. Any way you slice it, \n1,028,267--or nearly 55 percent--of the Puerto Ricans who traveled to \nthe polls voted for options other than statehood.\n  As Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez, the first woman of Puerto Rican \nheritage elected to the United States House of Representatives, \ncorrectly pointed out: ``Casting a blank ballot is part of traditional \nform of objecting to an unfair process in Puerto Rican political \nhistory.'' In accordance with this tradition, the Commonwealth Party in \nPuerto Rico adopted a resolution calling on Puerto Rican voters to \nprotest last November's plebiscite process by casting blank ballots.\n  When you include the nearly half a million voters who left the second \nquestion on the ballot blank, it is clear--despite the claims of some \nstatehood proponents--that a majority of voters do not support \nstatehood for Puerto Rico. In fact, more than 1 million, or nearly 55 \npercent, of Puerto Rican voters who participated in the plebiscite \nactually demonstrated support for something other than statehood.\n  A concurrent resolution was adopted last week by the legislature in \nPuerto Rico stating that the plebiscite on November 6, 2012, portrayed \na false majority in favor of statehood and prevented an accurate vote \non the option of Commonwealth status. I ask unanimous consent to insert \ninto the Record the text of that resolution.\n\n       The Senate and The House of Representatives of Puerto Rico\n\n                      COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO\n\n\n                              THE CAPITOL\n\n       We, EDUARDO BHATIA-GAUTIER, President of the Senate, and \n     JAIME R.

The results of such \n     plebiscite were inconclusive because none of the options on \n     Puerto Rico's political status that received a majority of \n     votes. Said plebiscite consisted of two separate questions, \n     formulated by the preceding pro-statehood government \n     administration, which favored statehood for Puerto Rico, in \n     order to portray a false majority in favor of statehood and \n     prevent such formula from competing against the Commonwealth \n     option that had been favored by the people of Puerto Rico in \n     all previously-held plebiscites.\n       The results were the following: the first question asked \n     voters whether or not Puerto Rico should maintain its current \n     form of political status. Nine hundred seventy thousand nine \n     hundred ten (970,910), that is, fifty-one point seven percent \n     (51.7%) of the people voted ``NO''; whereas eight hundred \n     twenty-eight thousand seventy-seven (828,077), that is, \n     forty-four point one percent (44.1%) of the people voted \n     ``YES.'' However, a total of sixty-seven thousand two hundred \n     sixty-seven (67,267) voters cast a blank ballot, which \n     accounted for three point six percent (3.6%) of voters.\n       The second question asked voters to choose from options \n     that excluded the current political status. Statehood \n     received eight hundred thirty-four thousand one hundred \n     ninety-one (834,191), or forty-four point four percent \n     (44.4%) of the votes cast; sovereign free associated state \n     received four hundred fifty-four thousand seven hundred \n     sixty-eight (454,708), or twenty four point three percent \n     (24.3%) of the votes cast; and independence received seventy \n     four thousand eight hundred ninety-five (74,895), or four \n     percent (4) of the votes cast. However, such question \n     received a total of four hundred ninety-eight thousand six \n     hundred four (498,604)blank votes, which accounted for \n     twenty-six point live percent (26.5%) of the votes cast. \n     These results should not surprise us, since the preceding \n     Legislative Assembly approved the\n\n[[Page S3835]]\n\n     plebiscite disregarding the procedural and substantive \n     consensuses required to legitimize any plebiscite held.\n       The Party that supported the Commonwealth option, which was \n     the political opposition at the time, objected this process. \n     It also argued that the process was contrary to the \n     provisions of H.R. 2499, as amended, approved by the United \n     States House of Representatives, which included the \n     Commonwealth among the options in the second question. \n     Moreover, it stated that the process had been criticized by \n     the White House because it was designed with the intent to \n     conceal the true expression of the people of Puerto Rico.\n       Commonwealth supporters employed two methods to express \n     their opposition. On the one hand, the Governing Board of the \n     Party supporting the Commonwealth option adopted a resolution \n     asking voters to protest the process by casting a blank \n     ballot, On the other hand, a significant number of pro-\n     Commonwealth leaders openly conducted campaigns in favor of \n     the Sovereign Free Associated State option.\n       There is no doubt that the voters who wish to express their \n     dissatisfaction with the proposals or the candidates in the \n     ballot, traditionally do so by spoiling their ballots, \n     casting a blank ballot, or voting for a fictional character.\n       If the United States Congress wishes to know the amount of \n     Puerto Rican voters against statehood for Puerto Rico, the \n     blank ballots should be taken into account because such votes \n     clearly express the intent of voters against statehood. Thus, \n     it should be understood that votes cast in favor of statehood \n     did not exceed forty-four point four percent (44.4%), which \n     shows a two percent (2%) decrease in the historical peak it \n     achieved in 1998. In other words, fifty-five point six \n     percent (55.6%) of Puerto Rican voters rejected statehood in \n     the 2012 plebiscite.\n       Previously, in 1998, the pro-statehood party had also \n     designed a unilateral and exclusionary plebiscite; \n     nonetheless, voters had the option to vote for ``None of the \n     Above.'' The ``None of the Above'' option received fifty \n     point three percent (50.3%) of the votes cast, followed by \n     Statehood and Independence, which received forty-six point \n     five percent (46.5%) and two point five percent (2.5%) of the \n     votes cast, respectively. The results of the 1998 plebiscite \n     were consistent with those of the 1993 plebiscite, in which \n     the Commonwealth option received forty-eight point six \n     percent (48.6%) of the votes cast, whereas Statehood and \n     Independence received forty-six point three percent (46.3%) \n     and four point four percent (4.4%) of the votes cast, \n     respectively. The only other event of this kind held since \n     the establishment of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in 1952, \n     took place in 1967. In the 1967 plebiscite, the Commonwealth \n     received sixty point three percent (60.3%) of the votes cast, \n     while Statehood received thirty-nine percent (39%).\n       Unfortunately, the preceding government administration in \n     Puerto Rico, whose term ended in December 2012, failed to \n     sponsor a process that would include the recommendations of \n     the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status appointed \n     by President Barack Obama. Such Task Force proposed--on a \n     Report released in March 2011--various methods to ask Puerto \n     Ricans about their political status in a manner that is fair \n     for the supporters of all options. Furthermore, it also \n     failed to address the issue of Puerto Rico's political status \n     in an inclusive and responsible manner,\n       On April 10, 2013, President Barack Obama included in the \n     budget proposal for the fiscal year 2014, an appropriation of \n     $2.5 million to the State Elections Commission in order to \n     conduct a voter education campaign and a plebiscite which \n     would include all constitutionally viable status options. The \n     action taken by the President of the United States shows that \n     the plebiscite designed by the preceding government \n     administration lacks legitimacy or credibility before the \n     government of the United States of America.\n       In light of the history of imposed and exclusionary \n     plebiscites that only attest to our people's division with \n     regard to this issue, it is necessary to inform the President \n     and the Congress of the United States about the true results \n     of the plebiscite held on November 6, 2012.\n     Be it resolved by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico:\n       Section 1.--To inform the President and the Congress of the \n     United States about the results of the plebiscite held on \n     November 6, 2012, and support the request of the President of \n     the United States of America for the Congress to appropriate \n     $2.5 million to the State Elections Commission for a \n     federally-sponsored plebiscite, after conducting the \n     appropriate voter education campaign, which incorporates all \n     options, including the enhanced Commonwealth, based on the \n     principles of fairness and equality; to authorize the \n     disbursement of funds; and for other purposes.\n       Section 2.--The results of the 2012 plebiscite were the \n     following: in the first question, which asked voters whether \n     or not Puerto Rico should continue to have its current form \n     of political status, the ``NO'' option received fifty-three \n     point nine percent (53.9%) of the votes cast, whereas the \n     ``YES'' option received forty-six percent (46%). The results \n     of the second question, which asked voters to choose from the \n     options that did not included the current status, were the \n     following: the statehood option received forty-four point \n     four percent (44.4%) of the votes cast (834,191); the \n     ``sovereign free associated state'' received twenty-four \n     point three percent (24.3%) of the votes east (454,768); the \n     independence option received four percent (4%) of the votes \n     cast (74,895), and blank ballots accounted for twenty-six \n     point five percent (26.5%) of the votes cast (498,604).\n       Section 3.--The foregoing shows that the representations \n     made before the United States Congress stating that the \n     statehood option was favored by the majority of Puerto \n     Ricans, does not accurately reflect the results of the \n     plebiscite on Puerto Rico's status held on November 6, 2012.\n       Section 4.--A copy of this Concurrent Resolution shall be \n     delivered to the President, the Vice President, and the \n     Secretary of State of the United States, to all the Members \n     of the 113th United States Congress, as well as to all \n     pertinent government and nongovernmental organizations, human \n     rights organizations, and the local, national, and \n     international media, among others.\n       Section 5.--A certified copy of this Concurrent Resolution \n     shall be translated into English and delivered by the \n     Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives of Puerto Rico to the members of the United \n     States Congress.\n       Section 6.--This Concurrent Resolution shall take effect \n     immediately after its approval.\n       In witness whereof we hereunto sign and affix the Seal of \n     the Senate and the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico. \n     Issued this Tuesday, 14th of May of 2013, at our offices at \n     the Capitol Building, San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n                                           Eduardo Bhatia-Gautier,\n                                              President of Senate.\n                                          Jaime R.

SCOTT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to take a few minutes to recognize a true \nAmerican hero from my home State of Illinois. George W. Scott of \nWilliamsville, IL, was an airman in the U.S. Army Air Corps during \nWorld War II and is a survivor of a group of airmen who were imprisoned \nat the Buchenwald Concentration Camp by the Nazi government.\n  Many people have heard of Buchenwald, one of the first and one of the \nlargest concentration camps in Germany. But few people have heard the \nstory of the Lost Airmen of Buchenwald, of which George was one.\n  In 1944, George was flying a Douglas A-20 Havoc aircraft barely 500 \nfeet off the ground over France when he was shot down by German anti-\naircraft guns. He was able to escape the aircraft before it crashed, \nand he escaped capture for a short time. George hid in bushes and in \nbarns. He even milked a few cows for nourishment. He was fortunate to \nbe taken in by a French family who provided food and shelter. But soon \nafter, he was discovered by the Nazi patrols scouring France for \nresistance fighters or Allied soldiers and airmen.\n  George was transported to Buchenwald Concentration Camp in Germany, \nwhere he joined 168 Allied airmen from six countries. These airmen were \nnot afforded the Prisoner of War protections outlined in The Hague and \nGeneva Conventions. Instead, they were classified as ``Terrorflieger,'' \nor terror flyers, considered criminals and spies, and were not given a \ntrial.\n  At Buchenwald, the conditions were unimaginable. Many prisoners \nstarved to death within 3 months of imprisonment. Prisoners were \nbeaten, scarcely fed, and forced to work grueling shifts. But the \nAllied airmen organized themselves into units based on their \nnationality, appointed commanding officers, and instilled discipline \nand order. This self-imposed military hierarchy helped them to build \nmorale, work as a team, and increase their chances of survival.\n  But those chances remained low. George and his fellow airmen were \nscheduled to be executed at Buchenwald on the orders of Adolf Hitler. \nFacing their impending execution, the airmen managed to pass a note \ndetailing their captivity in the camp to the nearby Luftwaffe. After \nvisiting the camp, German Luftwaffe officers demanded that the airmen \nbe transferred to their custody. George and his fellow airmen were \ntransferred to a POW camp and liberated when the Russian Army reached \nthe camp in 1945.\n  It is a remarkable story and one that the U.S. Government kept quiet \nafter the war. Yet George and his fellow airmen deserve immense credit \nand long-overdue recognition for their immeasurable contribution to the \nAllied war effort and their unimaginable pain and suffering.\n  When asked how George managed, at 19 years old, to survive in the \nunbearable conditions of Buchenwald, he says\n\n[[Page S3836]]\n\nthat he thought often of his mother and maintained the resolve that \n``every time they hit you, you just get back up.''\n  Now, some 69 years later, George lives just outside of my hometown of \nSpringfield, in Williamsville, IL. He is blessed with a wonderful \nfamily, who is steeped in pride and loves him deeply.\n  I am particularly impressed by George's dedication to our nation, and \nI hope to express the thanks of a grateful Nation for his service. \nGeorge is a shining example of the American ideal, fighting for what is \nright in the face of immense adversity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/23/senate-section/article/S3836-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING ANNE G. MURPHY\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Ms. Anne G. Murphy.\n  Ms. Murphy, a Rhode Islander by birth and a strong advocate for the \narts, passed away in April at the age of 74.\n  Throughout her distinguished lifetime and career, Ms. Murphy worked \nto defend Federal investments in the arts. After graduating from Rhode \nIsland College in 1959, she volunteered on the presidential campaign of \nSenator John F. Kennedy and taught elementary school in Rhode Island \nbefore relocating to Washington, DC to work on the staffs of two \nRepresentatives from Rhode Island, Congressmen John Fogarty and Robert \nTiernan. While in Congressman Fogarty's office, she helped contribute \nto legislation that led to the creation of the National Endowment for \nthe Arts, NEA.\n  After leaving Capitol Hill, Ms. Murphy continued serving in the arts \narena. She worked at both the NEA and the Public Broadcasting Service, \nand then joined the American Arts Alliance, where she served as \nexecutive director in the 1980s and early 1990s. As the leader of this \nmajor arts advocacy group, now known as the Performing Arts Alliance, \nMs. Murphy defended arts programs from budget cuts and other attacks.\n  Ms. Murphy also served on the board of the Corcoran Gallery of Art \nand was a co-chair of the annual Washington Project for the Arts Gala. \nDuring the 2000s, she served as the director and co-chair of the \nnonprofit digital technologies research organization, Digital Promise.\n  I know how proud Congressman Tiernan remains of the important work \nthat Anne did while working in his office and in her endeavors that \nfollowed in the arts community, and I want to share and echo his \nsentiments. We remember and thank Anne for her tireless efforts to \nsupport and protect federal investment in the arts. We are all \nbeneficiaries of her advocacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/23/senate-section/article/S3836-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CHARLES E. WELCH\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Mr. \nCharles E. Welch, who I have had the privilege of knowing for more than \nthree decades. Known to his many friends as Chuck, he is a World War II \nveteran, humanitarian, lawyer and leader in the business community in \nthe State of Delaware.\n  Born in 1925, Chuck is a native of Columbus, OH. He graduated with a \nB.S. in Business Administration in 1949 from The Ohio State University, \n19 years ahead of me, and went on to receive his Juris Doctor in 1951 \nfrom the same institution. He served in the United States Army from \n1943 to 1946 as a rifle platoon leader and later served as a company \ncommander in the Judge Advocate General Corps from 1952 to 1955. During \nthis time, he was also employed by the Ohio Tax Department as Chief \nCounsel from 1951 to 1958.\n  Chuck later moved to Delaware to work for the DuPont Company. There, \nhe rose through the ranks and held the position of General Counsel \nuntil 1979 when he was appointed by DuPont CEO Irving S. Shapiro to the \nnewly created position of Vice President for External Affairs. After a \ndistinguished 26-year career with DuPont, Chuck retired from the \ncompany. He did not retire from an active life as a husband, father, \ngrandfather and community leader. At an age when a lot of people are \nready to slow down, Chuck picked up the pace.\n  Chuck's commitment to the community and State was demonstrated most \nclearly through his passion for education and helping the disabled. \nChuck and his late wife Charma understood the struggles of special \nneeds children and were the driving forces behind the development of \nThe Mary Campbell Center, a remarkable facility for individuals with \nphysical and cognitive disabilities. Chuck and Charma, who themselves \nwere parents of a special needs child, had the shared vision to develop \na safe, loving place for children and young adults, and since its \nopening in 1976, The Mary Campbell Center has touched the lives of \nliterally thousands of people.\n  Chuck and Charma were the parents of six children: Ed, Patricia, \nJohn, Mary Beth, and the late Jeff and Charmie, the inspiration for The \nMary Campbell Center. Chuck is now married to Barbara G. Welch.\n  In addition to his work with The Mary Campbell Center, Chuck was a \nmember of the Mt. Pleasant Board of Education from 1967-1973, Chair of \nthe Vocational Education Task Force in 1986, Chair of the Delaware \nCompensation Review Commission, Member of the Judicial Nominating \nCommission, Chair of the Committee to Reorganize Farmers Bank, Head of \nthe Commission to study New Castle County Government, Director of the \nWilmington Medical Center, Past President of the Delaware Foundation \nfor Retarded Children and of United Cerebral Palsy, and was appointed \nby the Governor as President of the State Board of Education in 1986 \nwhere he served for 3 years. He was also a member of the committee for \nthe Delaware Justice Center, President of the Rockledge Community \nAssociation and Chairman of the Advisory Board of The Mary Campbell \nCenter where he continues to serve to this day.\n  Over the years, Chuck's guidance to both Democratic and Republican \nparty leaders has proven pivotal to Delaware's success. He served as \nco-chair of Governor Mike Castle's transition team and a member of my \ntransition team when I was elected Governor. For both Mike and me, \nChuck has been an invaluable adviser and a wonderful friend.\n  Chuck's lifetime of serving others has attracted many prestigious \nawards and distinctions including The Marvel Cup from the Delaware \nState Chamber of Commerce, The J. Thompson Brown Award for Family \nService, The Good Government Award from the Civic League for New Castle \nCounty, the Heart Association's Gilliam Award, an award from the \nNational Conference of Christians and Jews and the First State \nDistinguished Service Award from the Delaware State Bar Association.\n  I am proud to congratulate my longtime friend on a lifetime of \nachievement. He is a role model for us all. The people of Delaware, and \nespecially the many children and adults who have benefitted from his \ngood work, are certainly fortunate to count Chuck as a fellow \nDelawarean. The First State is a far better place in which to live and \nwork because of his stewardship and his leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/23/senate-section/article/S3836-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3836-S3837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING STEVE McGOWAN\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate my \nfriend Steve McGowan for receiving this year's Silver Buffalo Award \nfrom the Boy Scouts of America. This is the highest commendation \nScouting extends to individuals for their distinguished service to the \norganization, and I am so proud that the Boy Scouts have honored Steve \nfor his extraordinary efforts on their behalf.\n  Steve McGowan is a very successful lawyer in Charleston, WV, with the \nlaw firm of Steptoe & Johnson. And even though his law practice is \ndemanding, Steve has devoted countless hours to the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica as a volunteer. This should come as no surprise to anyone who \nknows Steve. He was, after all, an Eagle Scout long before he ever was \na lawyer.\n  The Boy Scouts of America inaugurated the Silver Buffalo Award in \n1926, and in its 87-year history only 732 awards have been presented. \nThis year, Steve is one of 12 Americans chosen to receive the award--\nand the first ever from West Virginia to be so honored. And in \nreceiving the Silver Buffalo Award, Steve now holds all three of the \nBoy Scouts highest commendations for\n\n[[Page S3837]]\n\nadult Scout leaders and volunteers, having already been awarded the \nSilver Beaver and Silver Antelope Awards.\n  Steve's background in Scouting was one of the reasons I reached out \nto him in 2007 when the Boy Scouts decided to move their National \nJamboree from a Virginia military base to a permanent location. As \nGovernor, I assembled a team of government officials and private \nvolunteers to identify the best site in West Virginia and market it to \nthe Boy Scouts. I called the group the West Virginia Project Arrow Task \nForce, and it was headed by Steve McGowan.\n  The competition with other States was tough. Proposals were submitted \nfor 82 sites in 28 States. But with Steve as its chief, the West \nVirginia Project Arrow Task Force hit the bull's eye. The Boy Scouts \nchose a home in West Virginia--a 10,600-acre site in the New River \nGorge, with easy access to whitewater rafting, hiking, bicycling and \nrock climbing.\n  And this July, this permanent new home for the National Jamboree, the \nSummit Bechtel National Family Scout Reserve, will welcome more than \n40,000 Boy Scouts and their leaders from all across the country to \ntheir 10-day long gathering of Scouts. This is going to be a wonderful \nexperience for the Scouts. But it's also going to be an unprecedented \nopportunity for the entire world to see West Virginia hospitality at \nits best.\n  Steve McGowan helped to make all of this happen. And on Friday, when \nhe accepts his Silver Buffalo Award at the Boy Scouts of America \nNational Annual Meeting in Dallas, I hope he will take a well-deserved \nbow for all his contributions to Scouting. The Boy Scouts oath begins \nwith a promise to do one's best and to do one's duty to God and \ncountry, and that is a promise Steve McGowan has kept every day.\n  Again, I extend my sincerest congratulations to him on being honored \nwith the Silver Buffalo Award, and I thank him for all he has done for \nthe Boy Scouts of America, for God and country and for the great State \nof West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/23/senate-section/article/S3837-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO COLONEL KEITH KLEMMER\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate Arkansas's native son, Col. Keith Klemmer, for attaining \nto the rank of Brigadier General. On June 1 of this year, Col. Klemmer \nwill receive this well-deserved promotion to the rank of Brigadier \nGeneral at a ceremony in Arkansas.\n  Colonel Klemmer has served in a variety of positions in the 39th \nInfantry Brigade, 142nd Fires Brigade, and 87th Troop Command including \nBattery Commander, Battalion S3, Battalion XO, Battalion Commander, \nBrigade FSO, Brigade XO, and Brigade Commander. He is a veteran of both \nOperation Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Colonel Klemmer \nentered Title 32 Active Guard/Reserve service as a full-time soldier in \nMarch 1994. His full-time assignments have included Battalion Training \nOfficer, Battalion and Brigade Administrative Officer, Recruiting and \nRetention Executive Officer, Recruiting and Retention Manager, Deputy \nProperty and Fiscal Officer for Arkansas, State Training Officer, and \nChief of Staff for the Arkansas Army National Guard.\n  Since October of 2011, Colonel Klemmer has served as the Chief of \nStaff for the Arkansas Joint Force Headquarters, where he is \nresponsible for synchronizing efforts of unit readiness, force \nstructure, and the sustainment of the National Guard for mobilization \nand domestic missions, a position which he has commanded with \ndistinction.\n  Colonel Klemmer is a graduate of Arkansas State University and \nreceived a master's degree from the United States Army War College in \n2007. He has received numerous awards and decorations for his service \nto our country, which include two Bronze Star Medals, the Meritorious \nService Medal, the Army Commendation Medal with four Oak Leaf Clusters, \nthe Army Achievement Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the Arkansas \nCommendation Medal, and the Ancient Order of Saint Barbara. His career \nhas been so impressive that he was inducted into the Arkansas \nRecruiting and Retention Hall of Fame in 2003.\n  In addition to his excellent military career, Colonel Klemmer is also \nan assistant scoutmaster for the Boy Scouts, serves as a deacon at his \nchurch in Russellville, AK, and is often a featured speaker for \nnumerous local Memorial Day and Veteran's Day events. He and his wife, \nSandra, have raised two wonderful children, Rachel and Gunner. Rachel \ngraduated Summa Cum Laude from Harding University in 2010 and served as \nan intern in my Washington, D.C. office, while Gunner is currently a \nTrustee Scholar at Harding University.\n  Colonel Klemmer is a valued servant to the people of Arkansas and the \nUnited States of America. Our State and Nation have been fortunate to \nhave Colonel Klemmer's 30 years of service, and I can only hope he can \nserve another 30 years. I thank him again for his dedication and \ncommitment to keeping our Nation and State safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/23/senate-section/article/S3837-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3837-S3838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NORM BROWNSTEIN\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today, I wish to speak \nabout a very special Coloradan on the occasion of his 70th birthday--\nMr. Norm Brownstein. I am joined by two of my esteemed colleagues, who \nassociate themselves with these remarks today: Majority Leader Harry \nReid and my fellow Colorado senator Michael Bennet.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S3837, May 23, 2013, the Record reads: Mr. Udall of \nColorado. Mr. President, today, I rise on behalf of .  .  \n.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: Mr. Udall of \nColorado. Mr. President, today, I wish to speak about .  \n.  .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n  Norm Brownstein is someone who many Americans may not know, but he is \nsomeone who has had an indelible effect on our Nation's public policy \nover the past several decades.\n  At root, Norm's story is an American success story. A Coloradan, a \nhusband, a father of three, and a grandfather of four, Norm is someone \nwho advocates passionately on behalf of the causes in which he \nbelieves. He is a man who rose from nothing to be involved at the apex \nof many of our country's most important political debates.\n  We are proud today to speak on the floor of the United States Senate \non behalf of a man known by many of us as the ``101st Senator,'' to \nwish him a happy birthday, and, on behalf of so many of our colleagues, \nto let the American people know a little bit about this man.\n  The son of a Russian immigrant, and an orphan in his teenage years, \nNorm was not afforded the opportunities granted to many others who find \nsuccess. And yet, despite his hardships, Norm excelled at academics, \nand, while working part time at a bicycle shop, became the first in his \nfamily to graduate from college. After getting his degree at the \nUniversity of Colorado in Boulder, he went on to get a law degree \nthere.\n  Norm may have done well in school, but in the late 1960s the Nation's \ntop firms were not as hospitable as they should have been to talented \nJewish lawyers. But that did not stop him. Norm and his childhood \nfriend Steve Farber decided to open up their own firm in 1968 and away \nthey went. Today, that firm--Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck--has 240 \nlawyers and consultants and 10 offices.\n  At first, Norm was not involved in politics--instead focusing on \nbuilding his firm through real estate and other traditional legal work. \nBut as Norm's legal practice grew, so too did his community \ninvolvement, as well as his interest in policy and politics.\n  Norm's firm already was involved very much in Denver and Colorado \nfrom a civic standpoint as well as with Colorado's political leaders. \nBut Norm decided to take it to the next level and work with as many \npolitical leaders in the country as he could, both Democrats and \nRepublicans. But, unlike so many who develop political relationships to \npursue a narrow personal agenda, Norm pursued these political \nrelationships based on his love of Israel and his desire to promote \nAmerica's relationship with our most important ally in the Middle East. \nHe joined the board of AIPAC, the American/Israel Public Affairs \nCommittee, and if a Member of Congress supported Israel, Norm worked \nwith that Member, to help them help the United States and Israel. This \nwent on for decades. After a while, Norm knew so many Senators so well, \nhe was presented in 2003 with a photograph of this Chamber, with the \nsignature of every senator in the body at that time, to go with a \nplaque previously signed by several of our colleagues with the title \n``our 101st Senator''.\n\n[[Page S3838]]\n\n  Over the years, folks would ask for Norm's help in Washington, DC, \nand eventually he decided to open an office in Washington in the late-\n1990s. Like his challenging childhood, and his rough introduction to \nthe legal community, Norm faced numerous obstacles in opening a DC \noffice operating out of Denver. But as with everything else he set his \nmind to, this effort also thrived. Today, Brownstein's DC office has \nrisen from a meager shop of two people in 1997 to being at the top of \nits field.\n  In a tribute to Norm's many decades of work and successes, the \nSmithsonian Institution recently honored him in a permanent exhibit \ndisplaying 89 Americans who have had a profound impact on America's \npolitics and policy. His colleagues in this exhibit include a who's who \nof major American political figures and business leaders including: our \nformer Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, the current House \nMajority Leader Eric Cantor, our current U.S. Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, the business icon and \nentrepreneur Steve Case, and the list goes on. It is not easy to be \nmentioned on a list of the most influential people in our Nation's \npolitical discourse when you are not in government. So it makes us \nproud that such a list would include a homegrown lawyer from Denver.\n  And through all of his policy and political work, Norm has always \nremained true to his core--helping Israel and helping the people of \nColorado. For example, in our home State, Norm has worked with the U.S. \nCongress to, among other things: help the University of Colorado build \nits Health Sciences Center as well as obtain federal funding to \nresearch Down Syndrome; help the City of Denver obtain federal funding \nto build the Denver International Airport; and help National Jewish \nHealth obtain federal funding for life saving respiratory projects.\n  This next example is instructive of where Norm's heart is--finding \nopportunities that intersect with good business, good public policy, \nand good benefits to everyday Americans. A number of years ago, some of \nour colleagues were talking about changing the laws involving \nfoundations, because they thought there were a lot of abuses there. \nThese were well-intentioned changes, but they would have prevented a \nparticular philanthropist in Colorado from providing full-ride \nscholarship programs to students who could not otherwise afford to go \nto college in the State. Norm worked tirelessly on this issue. He \neducated numerous Members and staffs about the anomalous effect the \npending proposals would have. His efforts led to a restructuring of the \nproposed law that allowed the bank that this philanthropist owned to \nstay private, and more importantly, stay involved. This bank is now the \nlargest bank in Colorado, and it houses one of the largest scholarship \nprograms in the United States--and literally thousands of students will \nget to go to college because of Norm Brownstein's work.\n  Norm's incredible life story is one that could and should be \ninstructive to us in these partisan times. His talent and work ethic \nare enormous. His love of the United States and Israel is limitless. \nAnd his affection for so many of us here in Congress is 100 percent \ngenuine. And while his passion for politics and public policy is \nboundless, Norm does not care if you are a Democrat or a Republican. \nInstead, he just cares about you the person. Partisanship is a dirty \nword to Norm. We should all take a page from his playbook.\n  There are many of us here in the Congress who know Norm Brownstein as \na friend and we are truly blessed. We hope we have helped you get to \nknow him a little bit better too. Happy birthday to a great Coloradan--\nand a truly great American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/23/senate-section/article/S3838-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. William, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/23/senate-section/article/S3838-2", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/23/senate-section/article/S3838-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:40 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Merkley, and Mr. \n        King):\n  S. 1030. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor an energy investment credit for energy storage property connected \nto the grid, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am being joined by my colleagues \nSenators Collins, Merkley, and King on the introduction of the Storage \nTechnology for Renewable and Green Energy Act of 2013 or the STORAGE \n2013 Act. The purpose of the bill is to promote the deployment of \nenergy storage technologies to make the electric grid operate more \nefficiently and help manage intermittent renewable energy generation \nfrom wind, solar, and other sources that vary with the time of day and \nthe weather.\n  Traditionally, peak demand has been met by building more generation \nand transmission facilities, many of which sit idle much of the time. \nThe Electric Power Research Institute's White Paper on storage \ntechnology observed that 25 percent of the equipment and capacity of \nthe U.S. electric distribution system and 10 percent of the generation \nand transmission system is needed less than 400 hours a year. Peak \ngeneration is also often met with the least efficient, most costly \npower plants. Energy storage systems offer an alternative to simply \nbuilding more generation and transmission to meet peak demand because \nthey allow the current system to meet peak demands by storing less \nexpensive off-peak power, from the most cost-efficient plants, for use \nduring peak demand.\n  The growth of renewable energy from wind and solar and other \nintermittent renewable sources, like wave and tidal energy, raises yet \nanother challenge for the electric grid that storage can help address. \nThese renewable sources deliver power at times of the day or night when \nthey might not be needed or fluctuate with the weather. Energy storage \ntechnology allows these intermittent sources to store power as it is \ngenerated and allow it to be dispatched when it is most needed and in a \npredictable, steady of stream of electricity no longer at the vagaries \nof weather conditions. And equally important, it allows this \nintermittent generation to more closely match demand. Instead of trying \nto find a place to sell power at 3:00 am in the morning when demand is \ndown, wind farms for example would be able to sell their power at 3:00 \npm in the afternoon when demand is up.\n  The STORAGE 2013 Act is substantially similar to the STORAGE Act of \n2011 I introduced last Congress. It offers investment tax credits for \nthree categories of energy storage facilities that temporarily store \nenergy for delivery or use at a later time. The bill is technology \nneutral and does not pick storage technology ``winners'' and ``losers'' \neither in terms of the storage technology that is used or in terms of \nthe source of the energy that is stored. The electricity can come from \na wind farm or it can come for a coal or nuclear plant. Pumped hydro, \ncompressed air, batteries, flywheels, and thermal storage are all \neligible technologies as are smart-grid enabled plug-in electric \nvehicles.\n  First, the STORAGE 2013 Act provides a 20 percent investment tax \ncredit of up to $40 million per project for storage systems connected \nto the electric grid and distribution system. A total of $1.5 billion \nin these investment credits are available for these grid connected \nsystems. Developers would have to apply to the Treasury Department and \nDOE for the credits, similar to the process used for the green energy \nmanufacturing credits the ``48C'' program. This is a 20 percent credit \nso that means the actual cost of the project that would be eligible for \nthe full credit would be $200 million.\n  The act also provides a 30 percent investment tax credit of up to $1 \nmillion per project to businesses for on-site storage, such as an ice-\nstorage facility in on office building, where ice is made at night \nusing low-cost, off-peak power and then used to help air-condition the \nbuilding luring the day while reducing peak demand. This is a 30 \npercent credit so the cost of the actual projects that would get the \nfull credit amount would be around $3.3 million.\n  One change from last year's version of the bill is that the minimum \nsize for storage systems to be eligible for this credit is now 5 kWh, \nwhereas it was 20 kWh before. 20 kWh is a reasonable size or industrial \nenergy consumers and big-box stores, but a 5 kWh limit is a size that \nmakes sense for small businesses. This change will allow small \nbusinesses to participate in pioneering storage on the grid, and will \nincentivize storage companies to create leasing models for residential \nusers. Leasing models are proving very successful at increasing grid-\nconnected residential solar, and this credit will open up a whole new \nmarket for storage to follow suit.\n  But if homeowners want to install storage on their own, they will be \nable to. The Act also provides for 30 percent tax credit for homeowners \nfor on-site\n\n[[Page S3848]]\n\nstorage projects to store off-peak electricity from solar panels or \nfrom the grid for later use during peak hours.\n  As the EPRI white paper noted ``(d)espite the large anticipated need \nfor energy storage solutions within the electric enterprise, very few \ngrid-integrated storage installations are in actual operation in the \nUnited States today.'' The purpose of the STORAGE 2013 Act is to help \njump start the deployment of these storage solutions so that renewable \nenergy technologies can increase their economic value to the electric \ngrid while reducing their power integration costs as well as to improve \nthe overall efficiency of the electrical system.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a closer look at what storage \ntechnologies can do to help reduce the cost of electricity and improve \nthe performance of the electric grid and renewable energy technologies. \nIf they do, I am confident my colleagues will join Senators Collins, \nMerkley, and King in supporting this bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1030\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2014 for \nmilitary activities of the Department of Defense and for military \nconstruction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal \nyear, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator Inhofe and I are introducing, by \nrequest, the administration's proposed National Defense Authorization \nAct for fiscal year 2014. As is the case with any bill that is \nintroduced by request, we introduce this bill for the purpose of \nplacing the administration's proposals before Congress and the public \nwithout expressing our own views on the substance of these proposals. \nAs Chairman and Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee, we look \nforward to giving the administration's requested legislation our most \ncareful review and thoughtful consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. \n        Coons, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Levin, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Ms. Warren, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, and Ms. Hirono):\n  S. 1038. A bill to eliminate racial profiling by law enforcement, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation in \nthe Senate that would prohibit the use of racial profiling by Federal, \nState, or local law enforcement agencies. This legislation is entitled \nthe End Racial Profiling Act, ERPA, 2013. I thank my colleagues who \nhave joined me as original cosponsors of this legislation, including \nSenators Durbin, Blumenthal, Coons, Harkin, Menendez, Stabenow, Levin, \nMikulski, Warren, Boxer, Gillibrand, Lautenberg, and Hirono.\n  Last year, the Nation's attention was riveted to the tragic, \navoidable death of Trayvon Martin in Florida in February 2012. As we \nall know from the news, an unarmed Martin, 17, was shot in Sanford, FL, \non his way home from a convenience store, while carrying a can of iced \ntea and a bag of skittles.\n  After the tragedy, I met with faith and civil rights groups at the \nCenter for Urban Families in Baltimore to discuss the issue of racial \nprofiling. Joining me were representatives from various faith and civil \nrights groups in Baltimore, as well as graduates from the center's \nprogram. I heard there first-hand accounts of typical American families \nthat were victims of racial profiling. One young woman recounted going \nto a basketball game with her father, only to have her dad detained by \npolice for no apparent reason other than the color of his skin.\n  That is why I was pleased that the Justice Department, under the \nsupervision of Attorney General Eric Holder, announced a Civil Rights \nDivision and FBI investigation into the shooting death of Trayvon \nMartin. I join all Americans in wanting a full and complete \ninvestigation into the shooting death of Trayvon Martin to ensure that \njustice is served. There are many questions that we need answered.\n  Was Trayvon targeted because he was black? The State of Florida has \nalready charged the shooter with second-degree murder, and the \ndefendant will be given a jury trial of his peers, which begins next \nmonth in State court.\n  Trayvon's tragic death leads to a discussion of the broader issue of \nracial profiling. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing \nentitled ``Ending Racial Profiling in America'' in April 2012, which \nwas chaired by Senator Durbin.\n  At the hearing I was struck by the testimony of Ronald L. Davis, the \nChief of Police of the City of East Palo Alto, CA. I want to quote part \nof Chief Davis' testimony, in which he stated that:\n\n       [T]here exists no national, standardized definition for \n     racial profiling that prohibits all uses of race, national \n     origin, and religion, except when describing a person. \n     Consequently, many state and local policies define racial \n     profiling as using race as the 'sole' basis for a stop or any \n     police action. This definition is misleading in that it \n     suggests using race as a factor for anything other than a \n     description is justified, which it is not. Simply put, race \n     is a descriptor not a predictor. To use race along with other \n     salient descriptors when describing someone who just \n     committed a crime is appropriate. However, when we deem a \n     person to be suspicious or attach criminality to a person \n     because of the color of his or her skin, the neighborhood \n     they are walking in, or the clothing they are wearing, we are \n     attempting to predict criminality. The problem with such \n     predictions is that we are seldom right in our results and \n     always wrong in our approach.\n\n  After the hearing I was joined at a press conference by Baltimore's \nRev. Dr. Jamal Bryant, a leading youth activist and advisor to the \nTrayvon Martin family. He echoed the call to end racial profiling by \nlaw enforcement in America:\n\n       This piece of legislation being offered by my senator, \n     Senator Cardin, is the last missing piece for the civil \n     rights bill from 1965 that says there ought to be equality \n     regardless of one's gender or one's race. Racial\n\n[[Page S3850]]\n\n     profiling is in fact an extension of racism in America that \n     has been unaddressed and this brings closure to the divide in \n     this country.\n\n  I have called for putting an end to racial profiling, a practice that \nsingles out individuals based on race, ethnicity, national origin, or \nreligion.\n  My legislation would protect minority communities by prohibiting the \nuse of racial profiling by law enforcement officials.\n  First, the bill prohibits the use of racial profiling by all law \nenforcement agents, whether Federal, State, or local. Racial profiling \nis defined in a standard, consistent definition as the practice of a \nlaw enforcement agent relying on race, ethnicity, religion, or national \norigin as a factor in their investigations and activities. The \nlegislation creates an exception for the use of these factors where \nthere is trustworthy information, relevant to the locality and time \nframe, which links persons of a particular race, ethnicity, or national \norigin to an identified incident or scheme.\n  Law enforcement agencies would be prohibited from using racial \nprofiling in criminal or routine law enforcement investigations, \nimmigration enforcement, and national security cases.\n  Second, the bill would mandate training on racial profiling issues, \nand requires data collection by local and State law enforcement \nagencies.\n  Third, this bill would condition the receipt of Federal funds by \nstate and local law enforcement on two grounds. First, under this bill, \nstate and local law enforcement would have to ``maintain adequate \npolicies and procedures designed to eliminate racial profiling.'' \nSecond, they must ``eliminate any existing practices that permit or \nencourage racial profiling.''\n  Fourth, the bill would authorize the Justice Department to provide \ngrants to State and local government to develop and implement best \npolicing practices that would discourage racial profiling, such as \nearly warning systems.\n  Finally, the bill would require the Attorney General to provide \nperiodic reports to assess the nature of any ongoing discriminatory \nprofiling practices.\n  The bill would also provide remedies for individuals who were harmed \nby racial profiling.\n  The legislation I introduce today is supported by the Leadership \nConference on Civil and Human Rights, NAACP, Rights Working Group, \nACLU, and numerous other national, state, and local organizations.\n  Racial profiling is bad policy, but given the state of our budgets, \nit also diverts scarce resources from real law enforcement. Law \nenforcement officials nationwide already have tight budgets. The more \nresources spent investigating individuals because of their race, \nreligion, national origin, or ethnicity, the fewer resources directed \nat suspects who are actually demonstrating illegal behavior.\n  Using racial profiling makes it less likely that certain affected \ncommunities will voluntarily cooperate with law enforcement and \ncommunity policing efforts, making it harder for our law enforcement \ncommunity to combat crimes and fight terrorism.\n  Minorities living and working in these communities in which racial \nprofiling is used may also feel discouraged from traveling freely, \nwhich corrodes the public trust in government. This ultimately \ndemonizes entire communities and perpetuates negative stereotypes based \non an individual's race, ethnicity, or religion.\n  Racial profiling has no place in modern law enforcement. The vast \nmajority of our law enforcement officials who put their lives on the \nline every day handle their jobs with professionalism, diligence, and \nfidelity to the rule of law.\n  However, Congress and the Justice Department can and should still \ntake steps to prohibit racial profiling and finally root out its use.\n  I agree with Attorney General Holder's remarks to the American-Arab \nAnti-Discrimination Committee where he stated:\n\n       In this Nation, security and liberty are--at their best--\n     partners, not enemies, in ensuring safety and opportunity for \n     all . . . In this Nation, the document that sets forth the \n     supreme law of the land--the Constitution--is meant to \n     empower, not exclude . . . Racial profiling is wrong. It can \n     leave a lasting scar on communities and individuals. And it \n     is, quite simply, bad policing--whatever city, whatever \n     state.\n\n  The Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the \n``equal protection of the laws'' to all Americans. Racial profiling is \nabhorrent to that principle, and should be ended once and for all.\n  As the late Senator Ted Kennedy often said, ``civil rights is the \ngreat unfinished business of America.'' Let us continue the fight here \nto make sure that we truly have equal justice under law for all \nAmericans. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BLUMENTHAL:\n  S. 1041. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to afford \ncrime victims' rights to victims of offenses under the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Military \nCrime Victims Rights Act of 2013. There are 26,000 victims of sexual \nassault in the military every year; at least last year there were that \nnumber estimated. But only a fraction, some 3,000-plus, were reported.\n  This measure encourages more accurate and complete reporting of all \nkinds, by guaranteeing all victims of crimes in the military the basic \nrights that victims have in civilian courts under current law. These \nrights are not a matter of discretion, they are a legal right that \nvictims of crimes in our Federal courts enjoy. My proposal is \nessentially to apply these same rights, guarantee them, in the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice.\n  The Uniform Code of Military Justice fails to afford these basic \nrights. They are rights of decency and fairness to crime victims. It \nrequires many of these victims to endure humiliating and insulting \nobstacles in their quest for justice, so it naturally discourages them \nfrom coming forward and reporting these acts, most especially the act \nof sexual assault.\n  Those rights that I believe should be applied under the Uniform Code \nof Military Justice are, for example, the right to protection from the \naccused, notice and opportunity to speak at trial, the right against \nunreasonable delay in trial proceedings. Those are a few of the rights \nthat would be guaranteed. They are standards of decency and fairness \nthat are essential to effective prosecution and the goals of good order \nand discipline in the military.\n  These fundamental rights are well-established in the civilian courts \nand well-esteemed by prosecutors and defendants as well as the victims, \nbecause they enable the justice system to function more fairly and \neffectively. Few would imagine going into a civilian court in a \ncriminal trial without the statutory right to be protected from the \naccused, protection against physical threats or intimidation. Few would \nimagine going into a civilian court and being denied the right to \nappear and to speak when one's history, one's personal and sexual \nhistory is an issue in the trial. Few would imagine the denial of a \nright to be heard in the course of sentencing. Few would imagine \nunreasonable delay and permission for the accused to actually leave the \ncountry and be unavailable for the trial and thereby have that \nunreasonable delay. Yet in the military court, these events are routine \nand expected. This bill would correct that failing.\n  There is no reason military sexual assault victims should be given \nless respect or fewer rights than civilian victims of the same offense. \nThe key to deterring crime is prosecuting and punishing it effectively, \nwhich requires reporting by victims. More than reporting, it requires \ncooperation. We know for a fact that victims denied rights and respect \nwill simply not report sexual assault in the military. They fear \nretaliation and discouragement of many kinds in reporting serious \ncrimes of all kinds. If sexual assault is not reported, it cannot be \nprosecuted. If it is not prosecuted, it certainly cannot be punished or \ndeterred.\n  I became involved in this issue of victims rights in the military \nbecause of a constituent who came forward to me. I became involved in \nher case because she was denied basic justice. Her case was delayed. \nShe was a victim of sexual assault in the apartment of an officer \nstationed in Rhode Island. She never had the opportunity to speak in \ncourt in a timely way. Her credibility was directly put at issue. She \nhad no opportunity to rebut, in effect, the charges\n\n[[Page S3851]]\n\nbrought against her. So often the victim is the one on trial. So often \nshe or he is forced to relive that brutal, vicious predatory act of \ncriminal conduct simply to bring charges and seek justice.\n  She is seeking justice not only on her own behalf but on behalf of \nthe Nation, because it is clearly the experience, as proven by solid \nevidence, that a sexual offender repeats that offense. The rate of \nrecidivism is higher for sexual offenses than any other kind of crime.\n  Last year I requested that the Department of Defense investigate both \ntheir failures to afford victims the right to be heard during public \nproceedings and victims' rights to be free from unreasonable delay and \nthe lack of remedies available to victims. The report I received as a \nresult of that request explained, in February, that the Department of \nDefense does not include the full list of crime victims rights in its \ndirective because it references a repealed statute, one from 1990, \nrather than the more recent one passed by Congress, the United States \nJustice for All Act of 2004.\n  That is why still today our military services, each of them, is \noperating on out-of-date and inadequate victim protection. The reason \nis not military necessity; it is simply ignoring the law that exists \nright now in spirit if not in letter. My bill would correct the letter \nof the law to guarantee these rights.\n  I appreciate the investigation conducted by the Department of Defense \nGeneral Counsel Robert Taylor and the military's commitment to revising \ntheir out-of-date directives and instructions, but we need a statutory \nremedy now, so people whose rights are violated will have a remedy, so \nthey will have a recourse and relief when their rights are violated.\n  This victims bill of rights has proved feasible and effective in the \ncivilian justice proceedings involving the very same offenses.\n  The rights are not novel or untested, they are well established and \nesteemed.\n  I ask today for support from my colleagues in passing this measure. \nIt is a basic, commonsense measure. It requires a military judge--just \nlike their civilian counterparts--to take up and decide any motion \nasserting a victim's rights right away. It requires an ombudsman within \nthe Department of Defense just like the ombudsman for crime victims' \nrights in the Department of Justice. It requires training for judge \nadvocates and other appropriate members of the Armed Forces and \npersonnel of the Department to assist them in responding more \neffectively to the needs of victims' rights. It requires trial counsel \nin a military case to advise the victim that he or she can seek the \nadvice of their own attorney with respect to these rights.\n  We have an opportunity and an obligation to stand for those who stand \nfor us and defend us, and I refuse to disappoint them. I look forward \nto working on enacting this proposal with my colleagues in the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, the Department of Defense, and the U.S. \nmilitary. And I would welcome the views of the response systems panel \nestablished by Congress when they have views they wish to impart.\n  We have the best and strongest military force in the history of the \nworld, in the history of our Nation. Our men and women in uniform \ndeserve a military justice system worthy of their excellence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHATZ (for himself, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Tester, and Ms. \n        Hirono):\n  S. 1046.

A bill to amend title 37, United States Code, to ensure that \nfootwear furnished or obtained by allowance for enlisted members of the \nArmed Forces upon their initial entry into the Armed Forces complies \nwith domestic source requirements; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bipartisan \nbill cosponsored by Senator King that would ensure the Department of \nDefense provides military recruits with athletic footwear made in the \nU.S.A.\n  The Berry Amendment, established by Congress in 1941, requires the \nDepartment to give preference to clothing and other items made in the \nUnited States for any contract valued at $150,000 or more.\n  For decades, the military issued American-made uniforms, including \nathletic footwear, for our troops. However since fiscal year 2002, the \npurpose and intent of the Berry Amendment have been undermined by a \nchange in DOD policy. The Army, Air Force, and the Navy now provide a \ncash voucher that incoming servicemembers use to purchase athletic \nfootwear, without providing any preference for domestically \nmanufactured footwear.\n  DOD claims that a soldier's individual purchase of athletic footwear \nwith a DOD-provided cash allowance is not subject to the Berry \nAmendment because such individual purchases fall below the simplified \nacquisition threshold of $150,000.\n  Yet, the cash allowances provided with Federal funds for athletic \nshoes are valued at about $15 million annually, an amount that is 100 \ntimes the minimum contract value at which the Berry Amendment applies.\n  Like all other clothing items issued directly by the military \nservices, athletic footwear should be made in the U.S.A. by American \ncompanies. It is time for DoD to treat athletic footware like every \nother uniform item, including boots, and buy them from American \nmanufacturers.\n  This bill would require DOD to comply with the Berry Amendment for \nfootwear either issued directly to or through a cash allowance to \nservicemembers upon initial entry into the Armed Forces. In other \nwords, athletic footwear would be treated like boots and all other \nuniform items.\n  In the past, opponents of ensuring compliance with the Berry \namendment have argued there is an insufficient domestic market for \nathletic shoes, that Berry compliant shoes somehow would not provide \nadequate comfort or safety, and that athletic shoes are not uniform \nitems. None of these objections withstands scrutiny.\n  After the Senate Armed Services Committee required DOD to conduct a \nmarket survey to determine vendor interest, DOD found that vendor \ninterest and capacity do exist to support a Berry compliant shoe \nmarket. The report also found that at least two American companies can \nproduce high-quality Berry compliant footwear right now in the quantity \nand at the price point needed. Today, a 100 percent Berry compliant \nshoe is on the market at a price of $68, $6 less than the current Army \nallowance of $74, and without requiring waivers.\n  The comfort argument is also based on the unfounded premise that \nrecruits somehow would not enjoy the same degree of comfort or safety \nwith a Berry compliant shoe. Yet the military makes no distinction for \nboots or other uniform shoes, to no adverse effect upon recruits. To \naddress this concern, however, the amendment would exempt \nservicemembers requiring a waiver for medical reasons.\n  Finally, I dispute the characterization that athletic shoes are not \nuniform items. Federal funds are used to\n\n[[Page S3852]]\n\npurchase the shoes, and recruits are required to wear them. If this is \nnot a uniform item, why are we allocating Federal funding at all? I \nwould also suggest that any initial entry trainee who arrives at a \nphysical training formation without athletic shoes would also dispute \nthe characterization.\n  This bill is consistent with several Congressional interventions that \nhave corrected a pattern of Federal agencies ignoring or narrowly \ninterpreting domestic sourcing statutes contrary to Congress's intent.\n  During the Senate Armed Services Committee markup of the fiscal year \n2013 NDAA, the Committee unanimously adopted an amendment offered by \nSenator Graham to require the fabric of clothing provided to \nAfghanistan security forces comply with the Berry Amendment without \nexception or exemption.\n  In July 2012, 12 Senators introduced legislation to require the \nUnited States Olympic Committee adopt a policy that ceremonial athletic \nuniforms, including accessories such as shoes, be produced in the \nUnited States.\n  If American-made uniforms are appropriate for U.S. Olympic athletes \nand Afghan security personnel, surely our servicemembers deserve the \nsame. Federal funds for clothing worn by new recruits should benefit \nAmerican workers and American companies rather than workers overseas.\n  This is about supporting American manufacturing jobs and having \nAmerican soldiers fight and train in American-made footwear. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill to provide military recruits with \nathletic footwear made in the U.S.A.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 1053.

A bill to establish Golf Butte National Conservation Area in \nClark County, Nevada in order to conserve, protect, and enhance the \ncultural, archaeological, natural, wilderness, scientific, geological, \nhistorical, biological, wildlife, educational, and scenic resources of \nthe area, to designate wilderness areas, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Gold Butte \nNational Conservation Area Act of 2013. This legislation will designate \nthe Gold Butte National Conservation Area in Southern Nevada and \ndesignate wilderness within Gold Butte.\n  I am proud to introduce this important bill, which has been in the \nmaking for at least a decade. The establishment of the Gold Butte \nNational Conservation Area has been supported by Clark County, the City \nof Mesquite, Friends of Gold Butte, the Moapa Band of Paiutes, the \nNevada Resort Association, and thousands of Nevadans.\n  By establishing the Gold Butte National Conservation Area as a unit \nof the National Landscape Conservation System, managed by the Bureau of \nLand Management, we will conserve, protect and enhance this unique part \nof Southern Nevada's landscape.\n  The proposed National Conservation Area is located in Clark County, \nsouth of the City of Mesquite and surrounded on three sides by the Lake \nMead National Recreation Area and the Grand Canyon Parashant National \nMonument in Arizona. Gold Butte, deemed by locals as ``Nevada's piece \nof the Grand\n\n[[Page S3853]]\n\nCanyon'', is recognized for its amazing sandstone formations, critical \nhabitat for desert tortoise, mining heritage and the ancient Native \nAmerican rock art that is so prevalent throughout the area. The land is \nhome to a number of rare plants and animals such as desert tortoise, \ndesert bighorn sheep, golden eagles, and bear poppies. The legislation \nwill also protect current uses which include camping, hunting, hiking \nand riding off-highway vehicles on previously designated routes.\n  Gold Butte is named for the mining town of the same name comprised of \napproximately 1,000 miners in the early 1900s. Long since abandoned, \nGold Butte shows the remnants of an early pioneer history of ranching \nand mining. Even before the early settlers, however, Native Americans \ndepended on this area. The evidence of ancient people can be found \nnearly everywhere in Gold Butte--petroglyphs, agave roasting pits, \nhunting blinds, rock shelters, stone tools, pottery shards and charcoal \nare found across the landscape.\n  For decades, the Gold Butte area has been a special place for those \nin the surrounding community. Over 10 years ago people started noticing \nthe impacts of increased unmanaged visitation such as litter, fires, \nwaste and degradation of cultural and natural resources. Unfortunately, \nthese human impacts were becoming a common occurrence in Gold Butte. It \nwas then that a group of conservationists, sportsmen, archaeologists, \ntribal members, ranchers and community members formed Friends of Gold \nButte and started advocating for a higher level of protection for the \narea. Since 2000, Friends of Gold Butte has worked to create and shape \na proposal for protection of these important resources.\n  The National Conservation Area will also benefit the local economy by \nbringing tourists and outdoor enthusiasts to explore the natural beauty \nof this desert landscape. Nevada already benefits from $14.9 billion \nannually in consumer spending directly related to the outdoor \nrecreation industry, which directly supports 148,000 jobs. Designation \nof the Gold Butte National Conservation Area will draw more people to \nthe area and bring in vital tourist dollars to the City of Mesquite and \nto Clark County.\n  The legislation also designates wilderness areas within the Gold \nButte National Conservation Area. These wilderness areas provide key \nhabitat for a number of critical species, protects the cultural \nresources and the many primitive places in Gold Butte.\n  The Gold Butte National Conservation Area Act is an ambitious piece \nof legislation, built on years of hard work by local advocates and \nstakeholder input. It protects vital natural and cultural resources and \npreserves an important area of recreation for future generations.\n  I understand that more work will need to be done on this bill and I \nanticipate feedback by stakeholders to improve the legislation.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this important \nlegislation through the legislative process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1054\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to deem \nany person who has received an award from the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States for engagement in active combat or active participation \nin combat to have satisfied certain requirements for naturalization; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that waives \nthe naturalization requirements for non-citizen recipients of our armed \nforces' combat service awards. When a soldier, sailor, airman, or \nmarine puts their life on the line for the United States, it only makes \nsense that we reciprocate their commitment to this nation by awarding \nthese heroes U.S. citizenship as expeditiously as possible.\n  These awards include the Combat Infantryman Badge, the Combat Medical \nBadge, the Combat Action Badge, the Combat Action Ribbon, the Air Force \nCombat Action Medal, or any equivalent award recipients. They recognize \na servicemember's presence under hostile fire or engagement in combat \nmissions.\n  According to the Center for Naval Analysis, roughly 70,000 non-\ncitizens enlisted in the active duty military between 1999 and 2008. \nThese men and women have served in Operations New Dawn and Iraqi \nFreedom, and continue to serve today in Operation Enduring Freedom and \nelsewhere around the world.\n  The contributions of these men and women to the character of our \nmilitary are unquestionable, and they possess language and cultural \nskills that are critical to the Department of Defense's mission. This \nlegislation honors their service, and I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 1062. A bill to improve quality and accountability for educator \npreparation programs; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we rely on our public schools to prepare the \nnext generation for success as citizens, workers, and innovators. We \nhave asked educators to raise the bar and educate all students to \ninternationally competitive college and career-ready standards. To \nachieve these goals, we need to focus on the professionals who have the \ngreatest impact on student learning at school--teachers and principals.\n  Today, I am pleased to be reintroducing the Educator Preparation \nReform Act with Representative Honda to improve how we prepare \nteachers, principals, and other educators so that they can be effective \nright from the start. We have also reintroduced the Effective Teaching \nand Leading Act to support teachers, librarians, and principals \ncurrently on the job through a comprehensive system of induction, \nprofessional development, and evaluation.\n  The Educator Preparation Reform Act builds on the success of the \nTeacher Quality Partnership Program, which I helped author in the 1998 \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act. The legislation we are \nreintroducing today places specific attention and emphasis on \nprincipals with the addition of a residency program for new principals.\n  Improving instruction is a team effort, with principals at the helm. \nThis bill better connects teacher preparation with principal \npreparation. The Educator Preparation Reform Act will also allow \npartnerships to develop preparation programs for other areas of \ninstructional need, such as for school librarians, counselors, or other \nacademic support professionals.\n  The bill also revamps the accountability and reporting requirements \nfor teacher preparation programs to provide greater transparency on key \nquality measures such as admissions standards, requirements for \nclinical practice, placement of graduates, retention in the field of \nteaching, and teacher performance, including student learning outcomes. \nAll programs--whether traditional or alternative routes to \ncertification--will be asked to report on the same measures.\n  Under our legislation, states will be required to identify at-risk \nand low-performing programs and provide them with technical assistance \nand a timeline for improvement. States would be encouraged to close \nprograms that do not improve.\n  The Educator Preparation Reform Act refocuses the state set-aside for \nhigher education in Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct on technical assistance for struggling teacher preparation programs \nand the development of systems for assessing the quality and \neffectiveness of professional development programs. At the same time, \nit allows for activities to support the development and implementation \nof performance assessments to measure new teachers' readiness for the \nclassroom and enhance professional development in the core academic \nareas.\n  We have been fortunate to work with many stakeholders on this \nlegislation. Organizations that have endorsed the Educator Preparation \nReform Act include: The Alliance for Excellent Education, American \nAssociation of Colleges for Teacher Education, American Association of \nState Colleges and Universities, American Council on Education, \nAmerican Psychological Association, Association of American \nUniversities, Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, \nAssociation of Public and Land-grant Universities, Council for \nChristian Colleges and Universities, First Focus Campaign for Children, \nHigher Education Consortium for Special Education, Hispanic Association \nof Colleges and Universities, National Association of Elementary School \nPrincipals, National Association of Independent Colleges and \nUniversities, National Association of Secondary School Principals, \nNational Association of State Directors of Special Education, National \nCouncil of Teachers of Mathematics, National Science Teachers \nAssociation, National School Boards Association Opportunity to Learn \nAction Fund, Public Education Network, Rural School and Community \nTrust, Silicon Valley Education Foundation, Teacher Education Division \nof the Council for Exceptional Children, American Association of \nColleges of Teacher Education, The Higher Education Task Force, \nNational Association of Elementary School Principals, and National \nAssociation of Secondary School Principals.\n  I look forward to working to incorporate this legislation into the \nupcoming reauthorizations of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nand the Higher Education Act. I urge my colleagues to join in this \neffort and support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 1063. A bill to improve teacher quality, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Effective \nTeaching and Leading Act to foster the development of highly skilled \nand effective educators.\n  In the upcoming reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, ESEA, building the capacity of our Nation's schools to \nenhance the effectiveness of teachers, principals, school librarians, \nand other school leaders must be among our top priorities.\n  Decades of research have demonstrated that improving educator and \nprincipal quality as well as greater family involvement are the keys to \nraising student achievement and turning around struggling schools. To \nstrengthen teaching and school leadership, the Effective Teaching and \nLeading Act would amend Title II of ESEA to provide targeted assistance \nto\n\n[[Page S3858]]\n\nschools to develop and support effective teachers, principals, school \nlibrarians, and school leaders through implementation of comprehensive \ninduction, professional development, and evaluation systems.\n  Every year across the country thousands of teachers leave the \nprofession--many within their first years of teaching. An estimate by \nthe National Commission on Teaching and America's Future of the \nnationwide cost of replacing public school teachers who have dropped \nout of the profession is $7.3 billion annually.\n  There are proven and well-documented strategies to support teachers \nthat will keep them in our schools. Evidence has shown that providing \nteachers with comprehensive mentoring and support during their first \ntwo years of teaching reduces attrition by as much as half and \nincreases student learning gains. The Effective Teaching and Leading \nAct would help schools implement the key elements of effective multi-\nyear mentoring and induction for beginning teachers.\n  The bill also significantly revises the definition of ``professional \ndevelopment'' in current law to foster an ongoing culture of teacher, \nprincipal, school librarian, and staff collaboration throughout \nschools. All too often the available professional development still \nconsists of isolated, check-the-box activities instead of helping \neducators engage in sustained professional learning that is regularly \nevaluated for its impact on classroom practice and student achievement. \nEffective professional development is collaborative, job-embedded, and \ninformed by data.\n  It is also clear that evaluation systems have an important role to \nplay in educator development. Through Race to the Top, ESEA waivers, \nand other initiatives many states and school systems are focusing on \nreforming their evaluation systems. When evaluation is done right, it \nprovides educators with individualized ongoing feedback on their \nstrengths and weaknesses and offers a path to improvement. The \nEffective Teaching and Leading Act would require school districts to \nestablish rigorous, fair, and transparent evaluation systems that use \nmultiple measures, including growth in student achievement.\n  Principals and school leaders also play a leading role in school \nimprovement efforts and managing a collaborative culture of ongoing \nprofessional learning and development. Research has shown that \nleadership is second only to classroom instruction among school-related \nfactors that influence student outcomes. As such, this bill would \nprovide ongoing high-quality professional development to principals and \nschool leaders, including multi-year induction and mentoring for new \nadministrators.\n  Recognizing the importance of creating career advancement and \nleadership opportunities for teachers, the Effective Teaching and \nLeading Act supports opportunities for teachers to serve as mentors, \ninstructional coaches, or master teachers, or take on increased \nresponsibility for professional development, curriculum, or school \nimprovement activities. It also calls for significant and sustainable \nstipends for educators that take on these new roles and \nresponsibilities.\n  The bill also requires school districts to conduct surveys of the \nworking and learning conditions educators face so this data could be \nused to better target investments and professional development support.\n  Improving teaching and school leadership is not simply a matter of \nsorting the good teachers and principals from the bad. What is needed \nis a comprehensive and integrated approach that supports new teachers \nand leaders as they enter the profession; provides on-going \nprofessional development that helps them improve and their students \nachieve; and that fairly assesses performance and provides feedback for \nimprovement. This is the approach taken by the Effective Teaching and \nLeading Act.\n  I worked with a range of education organizations in developing this \nbill, including the Alliance for Excellent Education, American \nFederation of School Administrators, American Federation of Teachers; \nAmerican Association of Colleges for Teacher Education; Association for \nSupervision and Curriculum Development; National Association of \nElementary School Principals; National Association of Secondary School \nPrincipals; National Board for Professional Teaching Standards; \nLearning Forward; the National Commission for Teaching and America's \nFuture, and the New Teacher Center. I thank them for their input and \nsupport for the bill.\n  I thank Congressman Mike Honda of California for introducing the \ncompanion bill in the House. I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor the \nEffective Teaching and Leading Act and work for its inclusion in the \nupcoming reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 1074. A bill to extend Federal recognition to the Chickahominy \nIndian Tribe, the Chickahominy Indian Tribe-Easter Division, the Upper \nMattaponi Tribe, the Rappahannock Tribe, Inc., the Monacan Indian \nNation, and the Nansemond Indian Tribe; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Thomasina E. \nJordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act of 2013.\n  This legislation is critically important, because it is a major step \ntowards reconciling an historic wrong for Virginia and the Nation. \nWhile the Virginia Tribes have received official recognition from the \nCommonwealth of Virginia, acknowledgement and officially-recognized \nstatus from the federal government has been considerably more difficult \ndue to their systematic mistreatment over the past century.\n  The identities of the tribal members of Virginia's Indian Tribes were \nstripped away by Virginia's Racial Integrity Act, a State law in effect \nfrom 1924 to 1967. Racial identifications of those without white \nancestry were changed to ``colored'' on birth certificates during that \nperiod. In addition, 5 of the 6 courthouses that held the vast majority \nof the Virginia Indian Tribal records needed to document their history \nto the degree required by the Bureau of Indian Affairs Office of \nFederal Acknowledgement were destroyed in the Civil War.\n  Furthermore, Virginia Indians and England signed the Treaty of Middle \nPlantation in 1677. This predated the creation of the United States of \nAmerica by just short of 100 years. This Treaty was never recognized by \nthe founding fathers of the United States. Therefore, the Tribes were \nnot granted Federal recognition upon signing treaties with the federal \ngovernment like tribes in other states did.\n  I am proud of Virginia's recognized Indian Tribes and their \ncontributions to our Commonwealth. The Virginia Tribes are a part of \nus. We go to school together, work together, and serve our Commonwealth \nand nation together every day. These contributions should be \nacknowledged, and this Federal recognition for Virginia's native \npeoples is long overdue.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will act upon my legislation this year, \nto give these 6 Virginia Native American Tribes the Federal recognition \nthat is long overdue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Carper, Mr. Warner, \n        Mr. Coons, and Mr. Kaine):\n  S. 1077. A bill to amend the Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act of 1998 to \nprovide for the reauthorization of the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and \nWatertrails Network; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, authorized under P.L. 105-312 in 1998 and \nreauthorized by P.L. 107-308 in 2002, the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and \nWatertrails Network helps several million visitors and residents \ndiscover, enjoy, and learn about the special places and stories of the \nChesapeake Bay and its watershed. Today I am introducing legislation to \nreauthorize this successful program.\n  For visitors and residents, the Gateways are the ``Chesapeake \nconnection.'' The Network members provide an experience of such high \nquality that their visitors will indeed connect to the Chesapeake \nemotionally as well as intellectually, and thus to its conservation.\n  The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure. The Chesapeake ranks as \nthe largest of America's 130 estuaries and\n\n[[Page S3859]]\n\none of the nation's largest and longest fresh water and estuarine \nsystems. The Atlantic Ocean delivers half the bay's 18 trillion gallons \nof water and the other half flows through over 150 major rivers and \nstreams draining 64,000 square miles within six states and the District \nof Columbia. The Chesapeake watershed is among the most significant \ncultural, natural and historic assets of our nation.\n  The Chesapeake is enormous and vastly diverse--how could you possibly \nexperience the whole story in any one place? Better to connect and use \nthe scores of existing public places to collaborate on presenting the \nmany chapters and tales of the bay's story. Visitors and residents go \nto more places for more experiences, all through a coordinated Gateways \nNetwork.\n  Beyond simply coordinating the Network, publishing a map and guides, \nand providing standard exhibits at all Gateways, the National Park \nService has helped Gateways with matching grants and expertise for 200 \nprojects with a total value of more than $12 million. This is a great \ndeal for the Bay--it helps Network members tell the Chesapeake story \nbetter and inspires people to care for this National Treasure--and it's \na good deal for the Park Service. In this legislation, we cap the \nGateways authorization at just $2 million annually. It serves all 150+ \nGateways and their 10 million visitors. No other National Park can \nprovide such a dramatic ratio of public dollars spent to number of \nvisitors served.\n  With the National Park Service's expertise and support, Gateways have \nmade significant progress in their mission to tell the bay's stories to \ntheir millions of members and visitors, extend access to the bay and \nits watershed, and develop a conservation awareness and ethic. It is \ntime to reauthorize the Chesapeake Gateways and Watertrails program. It \nis my hope that the Congress will act quickly to adopt this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of th bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1077\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Chesapeake Bay Gateways and \n     Watertrails Network Reauthorization Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       Section 502(c) of the Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act of 1998 \n     (16 U.S.C. 461 note; Public Law 105-312) is amended by \n     striking ``fiscal years'' and all that follows through the \n     period at the end and inserting ``fiscal years 2014 through \n     2018.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Kirk):\n  S. 1083. A bill to provide high-quality public charter school options \nfor students by enabling such public charter schools to expand and \nreplicate; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \ndesigned to improve educational opportunities for students. The All \nStudents Achieving Through Reform Act, or All-STAR Act, would provide \nFederal resources to the most successful charter schools to help them \ngrow and replicate their success. I thank Senator Kirk, for joining me \nin this effort.\n  Across the nation, public charter schools are achieving promising \nresults in low-income communities. I have been particularly impressed \nby the Noble Street schools in Chicago. Since opening its first campus \nin 1999, Noble Street has expanded to 12 charter high schools educating \nover 7,600 students from more than seventy communities, including some \nof Chicago's most difficult neighborhoods.\n  Noble Street has achieved phenomenal results. Even though seventy-\nfive percent of students enter school with below grade level skills, \nNoble juniors have the highest ACT scores among Chicago open-enrollment \nschools. Moreover, 99 percent of Noble Street's seniors graduate and 90 \npercent go on to college. I see this success in action when I visit \nNoble Street schools. As soon as you walk in the door, you can tell \nthat everyone in the building is focused on academic success. The \nstudents are actively engaged in their learning. Their teachers and \nprincipals are demanding and inspiring. Noble Street would like to \ncontinue to grow and educate more students in Chicago.\n  Every day 2.3 million students attend approximately 6,000 public \ncharter schools nationally. Let us be honest, not all charter schools \nare excellent. Poor-performing charter schools should be closed. But we \nalso need to replicate and expand the ones that are beating the odds, \nand we need to learn from them. The 2013 U.S. News and World Report's \nBest High Schools list included three public charters in its top ten \nand twenty-eight charter schools in its top 100. We need more excellent \ncharters, like these and the Noble Street schools, in Illinois and \naround the country.\n  The bipartisan bill I am introducing today would help make that \npossible. My bill would allow the existing charter school program to \nfund the expansion and replication of the most successful charter \nschools. Schools that have achieved positive results with their \nstudents will be able to apply for Federal grants to expand, allowing \nthem to include additional grades or to replicate the model at a new \nschool. Successful charters across the country will be able to grow, \nproviding better educational opportunities to thousands of students.\n  The bill also incentivizes the adoption of strong charter school \npolicies by states. We know that successful charter schools can thrive \nwhen they have autonomy, freedom to grow, and strong accountability \nbased on meeting performance targets. The bill would give grant \npriority to States that provide that environment. The bill also \nrequires new levels of charter school authorizer reporting and \naccountability to ensure that good charter schools are able to succeed \nwhile bad charter schools are improved or shut down.\n  This bill will improve educational opportunities for students across \nthe nation. Charter schools represent some of the brightest spots in \nurban education today, and successful models have the full support of \nthe President and Secretary Duncan. We need to help these schools grow \nand bring their best lessons into our regular public schools so that \nall students can benefit. Supporting the growth of successful charter \nschools should be a part of the conversation when we take up \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I look \nforward to being a part of that discussion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of th bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1083\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am submitting a resolution to \ncommemorate the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Lake Erie.\n  In the history of United States, the War of 1812 is often an \noverlooked chapter. However, for any visitor intrepid enough to forego \nthe elevators in the Senate side of the Capitol, it is impossible not \nto notice one important day within those years of turmoil and war. \nDominating the staircase is a massive rendition of the Battle of Lake \nErie, painted by William Henry Powell in 1873.\n  The Battle of Lake Erie was one of the few unquestioned American \ntriumphs in the war. In the center of Powell's painting is the young \nand courageous Oliver Hazard Perry. On September 10, 1813, after two \nhours of intense fighting, defeat stared Commodore Perry dead in the \nface, yet he refused to succumb. The painting depicts the famous point \nin the battle when Perry transfers his command from his disabled \nflagship to the U.S. Brig Niagara to begin the fight anew. His \ndetermination would pay off as the confused and battered enemy fleet \nwould be unable to sustain the ongoing punishment from the Niagara's \ncannonade. One by one each enemy vessel would strike their colors as \nthey were forced to relinquish control of the Great Lake of Erie.\n  The dramatic encounter breathed new life into a damaged American war \neffort and captured the imagination of our young nation. Contributing \nin no small way to this victory was Pennsylvania's own city on the \nlake, Erie, that provided the safe locale, supplies, and muscle \nnecessary to build the victorious fleet in limited time.\n  Just as the Battle of Lake Erie would test the resolve of the young \ncommander Perry and his fleet, the overall war would test the resolve \nof our young nation. For those who think that partisan division is \nsomething unique to our country's current condition, I encourage you to \nlook back to the bitter struggles between the Republicans and \nFederalists at the beginning of the 19th century. Those years would \nproduce not only disagreement on the direction of our nascent union but \nalso uncertainty of the ultimate success of this great experiment in \nrepresentative government and the war very nearly tore us apart.\n  This upcoming bicentennial affords us the opportunity to reflect on \nthe challenges overcome by our forefathers to shape and preserve this \ngreat nation that we have inherited. My friends in Erie and the Perry \n200 Commemoration Commission will spend this summer paying tribute to \nthis great battle and its participants, and I thank them for their hard \nwork and dedication to ensure their appropriate recognition. I am \nhopeful this resolution can help bring attention to this remarkable \nevent that so moved our Nation 200 years ago.\n\n[[Page S3864]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/23/senate-section/article/S3864-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 154--SUPPORTING POLITICAL REFORM IN IRAN AND FOR \n                             OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN (for himself and Mr. Blumenthal) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 154\n\n       Whereas democracy, human rights, and civil liberties are \n     universal values and fundamental principles of the foreign \n     policy of the United States;\n       Whereas an essential element of democratic self-government \n     is for leaders to be chosen and regularly held accountable \n     through elections that are organized and conducted in a \n     manner that is free, fair, inclusive, and consistent with \n     international standards;\n       Whereas governments in which power does not derive from \n     free and fair elections lack democratic legitimacy;\n       Whereas the Supreme Leader of Iran is unelected, has the \n     power to veto any decision made by the president or \n     parliament of Iran, and controls the foreign and defense \n     policy of Iran;\n       Whereas the current Supreme Leader of Iran has been in \n     power since 1989 and has never been subject to a popular \n     referendum of any kind;\n       Whereas elections in Iran are marred by the \n     disqualification of candidates based on their political \n     views, the absence of credible international observers, \n     widespread intimidation and repression of candidates, \n     political parties, and citizens, and systemic electoral fraud \n     and manipulation;\n       Whereas elections in Iran consistently involve severe \n     restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly, and \n     association, including censorship, surveillance, disruptions \n     in telecommunications, and the absence of a free media;\n       Whereas the current president of Iran came to office \n     through an election on June 12, 2009, that was widely \n     condemned in Iran and throughout the world as neither free \n     nor fair and provoked large-scale peaceful protests \n     throughout Iran;\n       Whereas authorities in Iran continue to hold several \n     candidates from the 2009 election in indefinite detention;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     banned more than 2,200 candidates from participating in the \n     March 2, 2012, parliamentary elections and refused to allow \n     domestic or international election observers to oversee those \n     elections;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     seeks to prevent the people of Iran from accessing news and \n     information by disrupting access to the Internet, including \n     blocking e-mail and social networking sites, limiting access \n     to foreign news and websites, and developing a national \n     Internet that will facilitate government censorship of news \n     and information, and by jamming international broadcasts such \n     as the Voice of America Persian News Network and Radio Farda, \n     a Persian language broadcast of Radio Free Europe/Radio \n     Liberty;\n       Whereas authorities in Iran have announced that a \n     presidential election will be held on June 14, 2013;

and\n       (E) allowing the Internet to remain free and open and \n     allowing domestic and international media to operate freely;\n       (7) calls on the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     to allow international election monitors to be present for \n     the June 14, 2013, election;\n       (8) notes that the legitimacy of the June 14, 2013, \n     election will be further called into question if--\n       (A) candidates are disqualified for political reasons;\n       (B) international election monitors are not present;

Res. 156\n\n       Whereas, on June 19, 2003, NATO's Allied Command \n     Transformation (ACT), was formally established to increase \n     military effectiveness and prepare the Alliance for future \n     security challenges;\n       Whereas, on June 19, 2013, the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO) will celebrate the 10-year anniversary of \n     the establishment of NATO ACT;\n       Whereas the security of the United States and its NATO \n     allies have been enhanced by the establishment and continued \n     work of NATO ACT;\n       Whereas, for the past 10 years, ACT has been leading the \n     charge for NATO military transformation, and providing \n     relevant and timely support to NATO operations, and \n     developing partnerships around the globe to adapt to the \n     changing global security environment;\n       Whereas ACT is the only NATO headquarters in the United \n     States, and the only permanent NATO headquarters outside of \n     Europe;\n       Whereas ACT provides state of the art education, training, \n     and application of best practices and lessons learned from \n     past operations, and equips Alliance troops with the tools \n     they need to win today's wars;\n\n[[Page S3865]]\n\n       Whereas ACT improves NATO's defense planning and develops \n     compatible equipment and common standards necessary to keep \n     Alliance capabilities aligned;\n       Whereas NATO ACT has been integral to a NATO mission of \n     promoting a Europe that is whole, undivided, free, and at \n     peace;\n       Whereas NATO ACT strengthened the ability of NATO to \n     perform a full range of missions throughout the world;\n       Whereas NATO ACT has provided crucial support and \n     participation in the NATO International Security Assistance \n     Force in Afghanistan, as NATO endeavors to help the people of \n     Afghanistan create the conditions necessary for security and \n     successful development and reconstruction;\n       Whereas ACT employs personnel from 26 NATO member nations \n     and 6 NATO Partner nations and contributes more than \n     $100,000,000 annually to the local economy;\n       Whereas NATO has been the cornerstone of transatlantic \n     security cooperation and an enduring instrument for promoting \n     stability in Europe and throughout the world for over 60 \n     years, representing the vital transatlantic bond of \n     solidarity between the United States and Europe, as NATO \n     nations share similar values and interests and are committed \n     to the maintenance of democratic principles;\n       Whereas the Chicago Summit Communique affirms that all NATO \n     members ``are determined that NATO will continue to play its \n     unique and essential role in ensuring our common defense and \n     security'' and that NATO ``continues to be effective in a \n     changing world, against new threats, with new capabilities \n     and new partners'';\n       Whereas, through the Alliance, the United States and Europe \n     are effective and steadfast partners in security, and ACT is \n     well positioned to contribute to the strength of the Alliance \n     on both continents;\n       Whereas NATO ACT has done much to help NATO meet the global \n     challenges of the 21st century, including the threat of \n     terrorism, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, \n     instability caused by failed states, and threats to global \n     energy security;

Res. 157\n\n       Whereas all people in the United States rely on quality, \n     efficient, and dependable telephone service in many aspects \n     of life, including conducting business, securing the safety \n     of the public, and connecting families;\n       Whereas multiple surveys conducted by the National Exchange \n     Carrier Association revealed that complaints of uncompleted \n     telephone calls persist, with the most recent survey in \n     October 2012 indicating a 41 percent increase in uncompleted \n     calls between March and September of the same year;\n       Whereas the National Exchange Carrier Association and rural \n     telecommunications carriers in April 2012 supplied \n     information that--\n       (1) 6.4 percent of calls to rural areas failed, but only \n     0.5 percent of calls to urban areas failed; and\n       (2) 11 percent of calls to rural areas were either poor \n     quality or were delayed, compared to only 5 percent in urban \n     areas;\n       Whereas the Federal Communications Commission was made \n     aware of an issue regarding telephone service connection in \n     rural areas in November 2010 and has since issued a \n     declaratory ruling and a notice of proposed rulemaking with \n     respect to the issue and has reached a settlement with one \n     telecommunications carrier;\n       Whereas, in a declaratory ruling in February 2012, the \n     Federal Communications Commission made it clear that blocking \n     or otherwise restricting telephone service is a violation of \n     section 201(b) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     201(b)), which prohibits unjust or unreasonable practices, \n     and section 202(a) of that Act (47 U.S.C. 202(a)), which \n     outlines the duty of a telecommunications carrier to refrain \n     from discrimination;\n       Whereas actions by the Federal Communications Commission \n     have not significantly decreased the prevalence of telephone \n     calls being rerouted by telecommunications carriers and some \n     States are seeing an increase in complaints as of April 2013;\n       Whereas telephone communications are vital to keeping rural \n     areas of the United States competitive in the economy, and a \n     low rate of telephone call completion results in economic \n     injury to rural businesses, including farmers, trucking \n     companies, and suppliers who have seen thousands of dollars \n     in business lost when telephone calls are not completed;\n       Whereas the safety of the public is at risk from a lack of \n     quality telephone communications, including 911 services;\n       Whereas schools depend on telephone calls to notify \n     students and parents of emergencies, and health care centers \n     depend on telecommunications services to save lives and to \n     communicate with rural patients;\n       Whereas small, local telecommunications carriers are losing \n     valuable, multi-line business subscribers because of a lack \n     of quality telecommunications services, which is financially \n     detrimental to those carriers and adversely affects the rural \n     communities served by those carriers; and\n       Whereas it may cost a telecommunications carrier serving a \n     rural area hundreds of dollars to investigate each complaint \n     of an uncompleted telephone call: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) all providers must appropriately complete calls to all \n     areas of the United States regardless of the technology used \n     by the providers;\n       (2) no entity may unreasonably discriminate against \n     telephone users in rural areas of the United States;

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING UNITED STATES FARM \n                   POLICIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) farming is a uniquely high-risk undertaking that is \n     vital to the United States economy and well-being, as well as \n     to the ability to feed a growing and hungry world;\n       (2) commodity prices are inherently linked to the laws of \n     supply and demand;\n       (3) Congress has never demonstrated that Congress knows \n     better than the market regarding what the proper price for a \n     commodity should be in any given year and, especially, over \n     the course of multiple years in the future;\n       (4) historically, when Congress has set fixed floor prices \n     for commodities at artificially high levels to address low \n     prices and depressed markets, the policies have created \n     market-distorting cycles under which farmers have planted \n     excessive acres of an over-supplied commodity in order to \n     capture Government assistance, which significantly increased \n     Federal outlays at taxpayer expense as prices continued to \n     decline;\n       (5)(A) commodities are traded worldwide, and the United \n     States is the leading producer of many of the basic \n     commodities in the world; and\n       (B) therefore, the planting decisions American farmers make \n     can impact prices farmers receive around the world;\n       (6) Federal assistance provided when Congress has set fixed \n     floor prices for commodities at artificially high levels \n     linked to planting decisions creates oversupplied and \n     depressed markets affecting farmers in the United States and \n     overseas and raises concerns regarding--\n       (A) United States commitments to international trading \n     partners, as agreed to in the World Trade Organization \n     Uruguay Round; and\n       (B) whether such policies could lead to disputes before the \n     World Trade Organization;\n       (7) the United States recently lost a dispute before the \n     World Trade Organization, costing United States taxpayers \n     millions of dollars to maintain current farm policy and avoid \n     retaliation;\n       (8) recent crop prices have reached record highs, but \n     market demands are signaling a trend for lower price levels;\n       (9) future Federal farm policies that create artificially \n     high crop price floors, especially if the price floors are \n     linked to planting decisions, may result in a new era of \n     taxpayer-funded Federal farm program outlays rather than a \n     market-driven farm economy; and\n       (10) addressing market-based risks, such as declining or \n     depressed prices, is difficult because providing assistance \n     in a declining or depressed market can make the situation \n     worse and cause significant unintended consequences for the \n     farmer, the Federal taxpayer, the land, and markets in the \n     United States and around the world.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the Sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is critical to reform Federal farm policy to make \n     that policy--\n       (A) more market-oriented; and\n       (B) an effective risk management tool for United States \n     farmers;\n       (2) Congress should develop market-oriented programs that--\n       (A) assist with price or market risks only when needed;\n       (B) treat crops equitably; and\n       (C) limit the potential risk for market distortion that may \n     make disputes before the World Trade Organization more \n     difficult to defend;\n       (3) Congress should not establish any farm assistance \n     program that includes high fixed target prices or planting \n     requirements, especially in combination, due to the risk that \n     such a program will--\n       (A) distort markets;\n       (B) influence planting decisions; or\n       (C) jeopardize vital natural resources, such as soil and \n     water, particularly in sensitive areas prone to natural \n     disasters or with fragile ecosystems; and\n       (4) Congress should not require farmers to choose between \n     assistance programs that cover fundamentally different risks \n     as it forces farmers to make choices based on an \n     unforeseeable future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1120.

KELLY TO BE A JUDGE OF THE UNITED STATES COURT \n                         OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to consider \nCalendar Nos. 11 and 12; that the Senate proceed to vote on the \nnominations listed with no intervening action or debate, the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with no \nintervening debate; that no further motions be in order to the \nnominations; that any statements related to the nominations be printed \nin the Record, and President Obama be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the nominations.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Mark A. \nBarnett, of Virginia, to be a Judge of the United States Court of \nInternational Trade, and the nomination of Claire R. Kelly, of New \nYork, to be a Judge of the United States Court of International Trade.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we vote today on two nominations to the \nCourt of International Trade, I want to note that this week we reached \na milestone. It is 5 months into President Obama's second term, and we \nhave just now reached the same number of circuit and district \nconfirmations that President George H.W. Bush achieved in his 4 years \nas President. Of course, we remain nearly 20 confirmations behind the \npace we set when President George W. Bush was in office. While some \nhave argued that this is because President Obama has not made enough \nnominations, the fact is that he has sent up more district nominees at \nthis point in his presidency than President George W. Bush had at the \nsame point. The reason the Senate confirmations are lagging behind is \nbecause Senate Republicans have engaged in unprecedented obstruction of \ndistrict court nominees. At this point in 2005, over 97 percent of \nPresident Bush's district nominees had been confirmed, but just 86 \npercent of President Obama's have been confirmed.\n  Today's vote on Mark Barnett is also a milestone of a sort. He was \none of the 11 judicial nominees who were stalled at the end of last \nyear because Senate Republicans refused to allow him a vote. We are \napproaching the Memorial Day recess and the Senate is still working on \nnominations that could and should have been completed last year. These \nunnecessary delays on confirmations are bad for the Senate, bad for our \nFederal courts, and bad for the American people.\n  After today's votes, there will be another seven nominees pending on \nthe Executive Calendar, and all but one were reported unanimously by \nthe Judiciary Committee. There is no reason to further delay action on \nthese nominees: We should follow Senate tradition and vote on all of \nthem before the recess. Nitza Quinones Alejandro, Luis Restrepo, \nJeffrey Schmehl, Kenneth Gonzales, Gregory Phillips, Ray Chen, and \nJennifer Dorsey are awaiting confirmation.\n  These nominees would fill important vacancies. For example, three of \nthese nominees would fill vacancies in the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania, where there are seven current vacancies. These are \nvacancies we need to fill, and, since the nominees are supported by \nevery Republican on the Judiciary Committee, as well as their home \nState Republican Senator, there is no reason not to vote on them today.\n  Mark Barnett is currently the Deputy Chief Counsel in the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce, Office of Chief Counsel for Import \nAdministration, where he has worked since 1995. From 2008 to 2009, he \nwas on detail to the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, \nSubcommittee on Trade. Prior to his government service, Mr. Barnett was \nan associate in the Washington, DC office of Steptoe & Johnson.\n  Claire Kelly is a professor of law at Brooklyn Law School, where she \nteaches classes on international trade, international business law, and \nadministrative law. Prior to entering academia, she spent 4 years as an \nassociate and 3 years as a consultant specializing in customs and trade \nlaw at the law firm Coudert Brothers in New York City.\n  I congratulate both nominees. Nominations to the Court of \nInternational Trade have historically been noncontroversial and have \nbeen moved quickly by the full Senate. The most recent confirmation to \nthat court came less than a month after the nominee had been reported, \nso it is unfortunate that Mark Barnett and Claire Kelly have been \nunnecessarily stalled for more than 3 months.\n  Earlier this week I placed in the Record a Wall Street Journal \narticle titled ``Open Judgeships Show D.C. Dysfunction.'' I, again, \nurge Senate Republicans to work in a bipartisan way and show that the \nSenate can make real progress. All Senate Democrats are ready to vote \non all these judicial nominees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \nnomination, the question is, Will the Senate advise\n\n[[Page S3878]]\n\nand consent to the nomination of Mark A. Barnett, of Virginia, to be a \nJudge of the United States Court of International Trade?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \nnomination, the question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the \nnomination of Claire R. Kelly, of New York, to be a Judge of the United \nStates Court of International Trade?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/23/senate-section/article/S3878-1", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 129\n\n       Whereas the United States joins together each May to pay \n     tribute to the contributions of generations of Asian \n     Americans and Pacific Islanders who have enriched the history \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas the history of Asian Americans and Pacific \n     Islanders in the United States is inextricably tied to the \n     story of the United States;\n       Whereas the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community \n     is an inherently diverse population comprised of more than 45 \n     distinct ethnicities and more than 100 language dialects;\n       Whereas, according to the Bureau of the Census, the Asian-\n     American population grew faster than any other racial or \n     ethnic group in the United States during the last decade, \n     surging nearly 46 percent between 2000 and 2010, which is a \n     growth rate 4 times faster than that of the total population \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas the 2010 decennial census estimated that there are \n     approximately 17,300,000 residents of the United States who \n     identify as Asian and approximately 1,200,000 residents of \n     the United States who identify themselves as Native Hawaiian \n     or other Pacific Islander, making up approximately 5.5 \n     percent and 0.4 percent, respectively, of the total \n     population of the United States;\n       Whereas the month of May was selected for Asian/Pacific \n     American Heritage Month because the first immigrants from \n     Japan arrived in the United States on May 7, 1843, and the \n     first transcontinental railroad was completed on May 10, \n     1869, with substantial contributions from immigrants from \n     China;\n       Whereas 2013 marks 70 years since the repeal of the Act of \n     May 5, 1892 (27 Stat. 25, chapter 60) (commonly known as the \n     ``Geary Act'' or the ``Chinese Exclusion Act''), and 25 years \n     since the passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (50 \n     U.S.C. App. 1989b et seq.) that granted reparations to \n     Japanese Americans interned during World War II, both cases \n     in which Congress acted to address discriminatory laws that \n     targeted people of Asian descent;\n       Whereas section 102 of title 36, United States Code, \n     officially designates May as Asian/Pacific American Heritage \n     Month and requests the President to issue an annual \n     proclamation calling on the people of the United States to \n     observe the month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and \n     activities;\n       Whereas, in 2013, the Congressional Asian Pacific American \n     Caucus, a bicameral caucus of Members of Congress advocating \n     on behalf of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, is \n     composed of 40 Members, including 13 Members of Asian or \n     Pacific Islander descent;\n       Whereas, in 2013, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are \n     serving in State legislatures across the United States in \n     record numbers, including in the States of Alaska, Arizona, \n     California, Connecticut, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, \n     Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, \n     Vermont, Virginia, and Washington;\n       Whereas the number of Federal judges who are Asian \n     Americans or Pacific Islanders more than doubled between 2009 \n     and 2013, reflecting a commitment to diversity in the Federal \n     judiciary that has resulted in the confirmations of high \n     caliber Asian-American and Pacific Islander judicial \n     nominees;\n       Whereas there remains much to be done to ensure that Asian \n     Americans and Pacific Islanders have access to resources and \n     a voice in the Government of the United States and continue \n     to advance in the political landscape of the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas celebrating Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month \n     provides the people of the United States with an opportunity \n     to recognize the achievements, contributions, and history of \n     Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and to appreciate the \n     challenges faced by Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the significance of May 2013 as Asian/\n     Pacific American Heritage Month as an important time to \n     celebrate the significant contributions of Asian Americans \n     and Pacific Islanders to the history of the United States; \n     and\n       (2) recognizes that the Asian-American and Pacific Islander \n     community enhances the rich diversity of and strengthens the \n     United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/05/23/senate-section/article/S3878-3", "month": "05", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORIZING DOCUMENT PRODUCTION\n\n  Mr. REID.
