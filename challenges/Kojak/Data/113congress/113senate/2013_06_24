Mr. President, I have often said that Speaker Boehner has a \nhard job. That was obvious last week when the House Republican caucus \nrevolted to defeat the Speaker's farm bill. Even though the Speaker \ntook the unusual step of announcing his support for the measure ahead \nof the vote, this bill went down in flames. It was the first time the \nHouse of Representatives has defeated a farm bill since the program was \ncreated in the 1930s.\n  I admit I was sorry to hear the House Republican leadership blame the \nbill's defeat on Democrats, but I was not surprised. They had to blame \nsomeone. They could not blame themselves, even though they should. It \nwas no surprise that House Democrats opposed this mean-spirited bill. \nThe legislation would cut $20 billion from the safety net that keeps \nmillions of Americans, including millions of children, from going \nhungry every year. That is what it was about. The farm bill eliminated \n8 billion meals for hungry American families and children. That is what \nthe House bill did. So it is no surprise that Democrats did not vote \nfor a bill that whacked America's most vulnerable citizens.\n  We have seen this film before. The Speaker should have known he could \nnot pass legislation that amounts to a partisan love note to the tea \nparty. He will be forced to take up a more bipartisan measure. He \nshould do it now. There is no need to reinvent the wheel. The Senate \nhas already done the work that was necessary to be done. We passed a \ngood bipartisan bill. The Speaker should dispense with the drama and \nthe delay and take up the Senate farm bill now. The bill passed on an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote in this Chamber. In fact, it did twice. We \npassed it last year. The Speaker refused to bring up the bill in the \nHouse. Passing the Senate farm bill will create jobs, will reduce the \ndeficit by some $23 billion, and it will make important reforms to both \nfarm and food stamp programs without balancing the budget on the backs \nof hungry Americans.\n  I spoke over the weekend to Tom Vilsack, the Secretary of \nAgriculture. We agreed that maintaining the status quo is not an \noption. Doing nothing means no reform, no deficit reduction, and no \ncertainty for America's 16 million farm industry workers.\n  I want everyone within the sound of my voice as well as my colleagues \non the other side of the Capitol to know that the Senate will not pass \nanother temporary farm bill extension. It is time for real reform that \nprotects both rural farm communities and urban families who need help \nfeeding their children.\n  If the Speaker took up the Senate's bipartisan measure, it would \neasily pass the House with both Republican and Democratic votes. There \nis no shame in passing a bill that moderates in both parties support. \nWe have seen time and time again that the tea party's ``my way or the \nhighway'' approach to legislating does not work. The only way to pass a \nbill in either the House or the Senate is to do so with votes from both \nDemocrats and Republicans. The Senate farm bill passed with 66 votes in \nthis Chamber. It was a perfect example of a bipartisan bill. The \nSpeaker should allow a vote on this measure in the House now--today.\n  The immigration bill before the Senate is another example of \nbipartisan legislation. The immigration bill will pass this Chamber \nwith Democratic and Republican votes. When the immigration bill passes, \nthe Speaker should quickly bring it up for a vote in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  So I say, Mr. Speaker, rather than twisting the arms of tea party \nextremists, work with moderates in both parties to pass bipartisan \nlegislation. Mr. Speaker, rather than trying to force legislation \ndesigned to please only the\n\n[[Page S4988]]\n\nright wing, you should take away the obstacles we have and take the \neasy way out, actually. Do the right thing. Seek votes from Democrats \nand Republicans. America deserves the commonsense approach. That is \nwhat we used to do. We should do it once again.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are currently in leader remarks. No bill is \ncurrently pending.\n  Mr. REID. I would ask the Chair to close morning business and move to \nwhatever the business of the day is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/24/senate-section/article/S4988-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I rise today to speak on the immigration \nbill presently before the Senate.\n  First, I wish to congratulate the leaders who have been able to bring \nthis bipartisan bill to the floor. The Gang of 8, of course, gets all \nthe attention, but Senator Leahy, the majority leader, and so many \nothers who have added both merit and momentum to this bill deserve to \nbe praised as well.\n  I particularly wish to congratulate Senator Leahy, the majority \nleader, and the authors of the bill for the transparent process with \nwhich we have debated this bill. I don't know the sum total of all the \namendments that were considered by the Judiciary Committee, but it was \na long markup with virtually every idea and every amendment vetted.\n  We have been standing on the floor of the Senate for nearly 2 weeks \ndebating this bill. That is right and that is good. This is one of the \nmost important bills the Senate will talk about. This matters to \nmillions of undocumented people all across this country, but it also \nmatters to millions of other individuals, families, and businesses who \nhave been weighed down by an immigration system that doesn't work any \nlonger.\n  Today we will be debating a new amendment on border security that \nwill, for many of us, be overkill. In order to make sure the perfect \ndoesn't become the enemy of the good, this will bring this very \nimportant debate near to a close.\n  I rise to talk about one additional amendment I am offering that I \nhope the Senate will consider, amendment No. 1451. It would, very \nsimply, prohibit the Department of Homeland Security from housing \nchildren in adult detention facilities.\n  There is already fairly good law and some good regulation on the \nbooks today that protect a lot of immigrant children from being held in \ndifficult detention facilities. Many of these children who are \nclassified as ``unaccompanied alien children'' are required to be \ntransferred to HHS custody within 72 hours. There is some good law and \ngood regulation built up around this issue already.\n  The data we have been getting over the last several years does tell \nthat current law doesn't work for every child in the system. As we \nlearned recently, ICE data says as many as 1,336 children were placed \nin adult facilities between 2008 and 2012. Of these children, \napparently 371 of them spent more than 3 months in an adult facility--3 \nmonths in an adult facility.\n  I want you to put yourself in the shoes of a little 12-year-old boy \nwho may just be learning how to speak the English language, who maybe \ncame here with his parents and his family but was picked up by himself, \nsomehow through the system was separated from his family, locked up, \nand his family may have some reluctance to come and claim him because \nthey, themselves, are undocumented. They worry they will be deported \nalong with the child.\n\n  Think about sitting, as a 12-year-old little boy, alone, perhaps \nuncomfortable about communicating, in an adult facility for 1, 2, or 3 \ndays and then imagine that for 1, 2, and 3 months. It is unacceptable.\n\n[[Page S4989]]\n\n  While DHS disputes some of these numbers and is certainly doing what \nit can to make sure these children don't spend time in adult lockups, \nthe law can be clear and we can create, with this amendment, a very \nclear line for all children, no matter how they are categorized, to \nmake sure they do not spend time in adult facilities.\n  There are some very harsh realities for children who are locked up \nwith adults. We know this because we, unfortunately, do this for \ndocumented children--for American citizens. Too often when children are \narrested on the streets of this country, they get housed in adult \ncriminal facilities within the American justice system. The National \nPrison Rate Elimination Commission Report found incarcerated minors are \nmuch more likely than adults to be sexually abused, especially when \nthey are locked up with adults.\n  Sometimes, to try to prevent this from happening, these children are \nput in isolation in ICE detention facilities. That may protect the \nchild from abuse, but the isolation itself, which can go on for days \nand days and days, causes serious psychological problems and sometimes, \nthe data shows, can lead to suicide.\n  Think also of one particular case--Mariana, we will call her--of a \n17-year-old who came from Guatemala. Mariana was brought through the \nMexican desert by one of these coyotes. The journey was so difficult, \nthe coyote just abandoned her, 17 years old, by herself in the middle \nof the desert. She managed to find her way to a highway and at that \nhighway the Border Patrol picked her up and took her to one of the \nholding facilities and threw her in with a bunch of adults.\n  She was 17 years old, but the Border Patrol officers insisted she \nlooked like she was in her twenties, and she didn't have her birth \ncertificate with her. So the default was to put her in an adult \nfacility and to not believe her. Finally, a couple of kind women in the \nfacility intervened and allowed her to call her mother in Guatemala and \nget a copy of her birth certificate. Finally, after all this, she was \ntransferred to HHS.\n  This shouldn't happen. With this amendment we can create a clearer \nline to make sure children such as Mariana, and the hundreds who are \neven younger than she, when they are picked up for whatever reason, are \nnot housed with adults. The amendment would require DHS to determine \nthe child's age when there is any notice or suspicion the detainee is a \nchild under the age of 18. Then DHS would have to transfer or release \nthe child, after determining the child's age, so children such as \nMariana would not have to wait and struggle themselves to get out of an \nadult detention center.\n  My amendment also would make it clear the best interest of the child \nshould be the main concern in transferring or releasing the child. \nFinally, building on some of the data reporting requirements that are \nin the underlying bill, my amendment would include a couple of \nadditional categories that DHS is required to report so we know where \nall these children are, the conditions in which they are being housed, \nand whether they have a lawyer trying to look out for their interests.\n  I think this is an amendment that can get bipartisan support. No \nmatter where we stand on issues of border enforcement or a pathway to \ncitizenship, we all believe a child that has been detained by ICE, \nlikely through no fault of their own, deserves to be treated like a \nchild; that they deserve to be housed with other children, if they \ncan't be returned to their family. This amendment would do that and I \nthink would be another way, as we conclude the debate on one of the \nmost important bills this body will take up this year, for Republicans \nand Democrats to come together around our common values.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the time during the quorum be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, under the rule, I believe I am allowed \nto use the time of Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the vote we will be having later this \nafternoon is not on a Corker-Hoeven amendment, as I think most Senators \nmay have thought when they left town Thursday and Friday. In fact, \nThursday night we were told the Hoeven-Corker amendment would be filed \nand, presumably, we would then be debating that amendment. As we went \ninto the night, every hour being told it would soon be filed, it turned \nout it wasn't filed until almost noon Friday, and it wasn't filed as \nthe Corker-Hoeven amendment dealing with Border Patrol officers and \nfencing and some other issues, it was filed as a complete substitute to \nthe whole bill.\n  This vote this afternoon will give Majority Leader Reid procedural \ncontrol of the debate. It is his motion to shut off debate on a 1,200-\npage substitute--200 pages more than the bill we were looking at last \nweek and that no one has read.\n  Our Senators haven't had a chance to read the bill to see how the \nmerged language falls throughout the legislation and to see what other \nchanges may have been made over the weekend. I was here. We have been \ntrying to get through this, but it is not easy. I am sure my colleagues \nhaven't been able to do so.\n  The majority leader has filed cloture and is blocking any further \namendments from being in order unless he personally approves them. That \nis the parliamentary situation we are in today. We are in a situation \nin which the majority leader will approve, personally, any and all \namendments that get voted on. So he has once again created a situation \nwhere Senators have to play ``Mother May I'' to get a vote on an \namendment they feel is important. This is not how the Senate should be \nrun.\n  A duly elected Senator from any State in America should be able to \ncome to the floor and get an amendment voted on without having to have \nthe personal approval of the majority leader. This trend has \naccelerated in recent years where it is truly damaging the whole role \nof the Senate, and we need more attention to that issue. This is \nexactly what happened with ObamaCare. The majority rushed through a \ncomplex bill so there would be no time to digest what was in it.\n  Just yesterday, on one of the Sunday programs, Bob Woodward, the \nfamed writer who dealt with the Nixon scandal and other issues over the \nyears, said this:\n\n       When you pass complicated legislation and no one has really \n     read the bill, the outcome is absurd.\n\n  I think that is too true, unfortunately. Senator Reid has said many \ntimes we have to pass this bill by July 4. Why is that? Is that his \ndecision to make?\n  Is it the other Senators' decisions to make? So to accomplish that \ngoal, he has filed cloture immediately on this new substitute bill. He \nfiled cloture as soon as it was filed to shut off debate. That is the \neffect of what we are doing.\n  Why is there such urgency to pass legislation of this importance by \nFriday? I am not aware that we have any big business after the July 4th \nrecess. We could stay here through the July 4th recess, for that \nmatter. As Bill Kristol, the writer and commentator, noted yesterday on \none of the programs:\n\n       There's no urgency. Can we at least let people read it for \n     a week?\n\n  The last thing Republicans should do is be enablers in the majority \nplan to rush through the bill before people know what is in it. Why \nshould we enable that? If this bill is so good, what is the harm of \nletting the Senators and the American public have a while to digest \nwhat is in it? Why not commit to open and extensive debate? We have an \nobligation to read a bill before we pass it. If Senators have not read \nthe 1,200-page substitute bill, they shouldn't vote to cut off debate. \nThey should vote against that.\n  Let me say what the problem is here. This is a new technique. Senator \nLamar Alexander said some time ago, that the truth is the Senate \ndoesn't do comprehensive well. I think that was a very serious comment \nafter the failure of this last bill and after ObamaCare and its massive \npower and overreach.\n\n[[Page S4990]]\n\n  So what has happened? What has happened is Senators got together, as \nthey did with ObamaCare, basically in secret, they wrote a 1,200-page \nbill in this case, and they did talking points. The talking points in a \nbig bill like this--and particularly this one--have had political \nconsultants, pollsters, all kinds of people organizing this campaign to \ndrive this legislation through the Senate. They have had a response to \nevery criticism; they have had spin in every different way. They are \nrunning TV advertisements right now, I suppose, still promoting this \nlegislation as something it is not.\n  The talking points are designed to be very popular. The talking \npoints are designed to be very much in accord with most people's views \nabout what good legislation is. Indeed, I liked most of the talking \npoints myself. I would vote for legislation that did most of that, for \nsure--if it did what it said. That is what is sold because nobody can \narticulate and explain the details of it, and people's eyes glaze over \nwhen you talk about it and people don't understand it fully. So they \npromote the bill as if it is the talking points, when the talking \npoints do not comply with what is in this legislation.\n  That is why we have an obligation to study it, read it, and vote on \nthe bill, and not the talking points. A few weeks ago, former Attorney \nGeneral and Reagan's close friend, Ed Meese, wrote a letter to the \neditors of the Wall Street Journal and said:\n\n       On legislation as important as this, lawmakers must take \n     the time to read the bill, not rely on others' \n     characterizations of what it says. We can't afford to have \n     Congress ``pass the bill to find out what's in it.''\n\n  So at this point in the legislative process, a ``yes'' vote on \ncloture tonight means Senator Reid will have gained complete control of \nthe process. No amendments will be voted on he does not approve. His \ngoal is to drive the train to passage by this Friday. Public policy, \npublic interest is beside the point.\n  So the vote this afternoon is to proceed again to the altered \nsubstitute--the entire substitute--of the Gang of 8 legislation, and \nthe flawed framework of this bill remains immediate amnesty, which will \nnever be revoked. That will occur within weeks, with no enforcement \nmeasure ever effectively having to occur. In reality, it will not have \nto occur.\n  According to the June 7 Rasmussen Report, the American people want \nenforcement first by a 4-to-1 margin. The Gang of 8 initially promised \ntheir bill would be enforcement first, but that is not what the bill \nsaid. Today, no one disputes that it is amnesty first. In fact, the \nlead sponsor of the bill, Senator Schumer, on ``Meet the Press'' \nconceded this point shortly after the bill was filed, saying:\n\n       . . . first, people will be legalized. . . . Then, we will \n     make sure the border is secure.\n\n  ``Then, we will make sure the border is secure.'' This is important \nbecause this is what happened in 1986, and Senator Grassley is so clear \nabout that. He voted for the 1986 bill, and he saw the enforcement \nnever occur.\n  Under the substitute, illegal immigrants can still receive amnesty--\nnot when the border is actually secure but when Secretary Napolitano \ntells the Congress she is starting to secure the border. So it occurs \nwhen Secretary Napolitano--who is now not enforcing our laws--tells \nCongress she is starting to secure the border.\n  Within 6 months of enactment, Secretary Napolitano need only submit \nto Congress her views on a comprehensive southern border strategy and \nsouthern border fencing strategy and give notice that she has begun \nimplementing her plans.\n  At that point--which will likely occur earlier, as Secretary \nNapolitano indicated during her testimony before the Judiciary \nCommittee--she may begin processing applications for and then granting \nlegal status, granting amnesty, and granting work and travel permits. \nShe will grant Social Security account numbers, the ability to obtain \ndriver's licensing, and many Federal and State public benefits, all \nwithout a single border security or enforcement action having been \ntaken.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be notified after 20 \nminutes. How much time has been consumed at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 11 minutes.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, if I could, I had a time of 12:50 that I \nhave actually done to accommodate the Senator from Alabama who was \ncoming down at 1:00. My understanding is the Senator showed up 20 \nminutes early, which I applaud him for being prompt and early. But I do \nwonder what is happening. I would be glad to go back and forth.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I didn't understand it. I am sorry. Was there a UC on \nthe Senator taking the floor? If so, I will certainly yield and wrap \nup.\n  Mr. CORKER. I think we had an agreement with those who manage the \nfloor as to how we were to come down and talk. But I would be more than \nglad to give a moment or two to let the Senator finish and then go on. \nBut I want to make sure this is going to allow me the opportunity to \nspeak.\n  Actually, the Senator has been so involved, I would love for him to \nlisten to what I might have to say and then respond because I think \nthere have been a lot of myths out there that seem to be continuing.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I will conclude by 5 till and yield to \nthe Senator at that time. I think that will get us on the right track.\n  I know there were discussions, and I was told earlier that would be \nthe time that I would have. Then I was told they want you to come \nearlier, and I didn't realize the Senator was in on part of that \nagreement. So that is perfectly all right, and I will accommodate the \nrepresentations we have been given.\n  Madam President, Senators have been talking a good bit about the \nenforcement that would occur under the substitute that has been \noffered, but the substitute does not change the fact that no reduction \nin illegal immigration is ever required.\n  In the beginning, proponents touted the bill's requirements that the \nSecretary achieve and maintain 90 percent effectiveness in apprehending \nillegal border crossers. We don't hear so much about that anymore. That \nis because all that the bill requires now is that the Secretary submit \na plan for achieving and maintaining that rate, not that it actually be \nachieved. Even if this was a real requirement, it wouldn't matter \nbecause it does not account for those who evade detection at the \nborder.\n  During her testimony before the Judiciary Committee, Secretary \nNapolitano all but acknowledged the effective rate is meaningless \nbecause by definition Homeland Security has no idea how many border \ncrossings go completely undetected. So it is not subject to real \nenforcement.\n  I appreciate my colleagues, Senator Corker and Senator Hoeven, and \nthose who have set forth their goals to produce legislation that would \nbe good for America. I appreciate the vision that has been stated. But \nhaving been involved in this now for quite a number of years--not \nbecause I desire to, but because I felt an obligation to do so, having \nbeen a Federal prosecutor for almost 15 years--I want to see the system \nactually work.\n  I am aware this bill is an authorization bill. It may authorize \nBorder Patrol officers. It may even authorize fencing. But until \nCongress appropriates the money over a period of a decade, the way it \nis set up, it will never happen. I am confident all the promises made \nin the legislation underlying and in the additions that have been made \nto it, it will not be accomplished in their entirety; and under this \nlegislation we will be sure to have a vast increase in illegal entry \nunder the entry-exit visa system, as the Congressional Budget Office \nhas stated, and we will still have illegal entrants from the border.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the \ntime that is reserved for Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  On whose time is the Senator proceeding?\n  Mr. CORKER. As I understand it, Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The Senator from Alabama has done an outstanding job in talking about \nthe many frailties that exist in the base bill. I do want to say that \nthe vote tonight is not on the base bill; the vote tonight is on an \namendment.\n  Many people on our side of the aisle have had concerns about border \nsecurity. The way the base bill reads is the\n\n[[Page S4991]]\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, would decide what \nborder security measures would be put in place, and she would implement \nthose after 180 days. Candidly, that calls for people on both sides of \nthe aisle to be somewhat concerned about what kind of border security \nmeasures would be implemented.\n  The base bill, as the Senator from Alabama just mentioned, leaves all \nof that discretion 100 percent to the person who leads Homeland \nSecurity. On the Senate floor we have had numbers of measures that we \nvoted on to try to strengthen border security. All of those measures \nhave failed. I have voted for almost every single one of those that has \ncome up. As a matter of fact, almost every Member on our side of the \naisle other than the Gang of 8 has voted for those measures.\n  What we have before us tonight, though, is another border security \namendment. This amendment puts in place five triggers that are \ntangible. It says if these five triggers are not implemented, then \nthose who are here who are undocumented and who become in temporary \nstatus do not receive their green cards. Let me go through those five \nmeasures that have to be put in place before that occurs.\n  First of all, there have to be 20,000 more Border Patrol agents \ndeployed and trained and on the border. That is one of the triggers, a \ndoubling of our Border Patrol.\n  Second, the additional 350 miles of fencing that Republicans have \nlonged for has to be in place. That is very tangible.\n  Third, we have to have bought and deployed over $4 billion worth of \ntechnology on the border, which will give our Border Patrol 100 percent \nawareness. This is a list that they have been seeking for years, and \nbefore anybody can achieve their green card status this list has to be \nbought and deployed.\n  Fourth, we have to have a fully implemented exit and entrance visa \nprogram--something that, again, Republicans have pushed for for years; \nand fifth, we have to have a fully deployed E-Verify system. All five \nof those measures have to be in place before somebody can move from a \ntemporary status to a green card status. Those are tangible triggers.\n  When I was in the shopping center business--before coming to the \nSenate, I used to build shopping centers around the country. It was \nvery evident in the community that I was in when I was completed. \nAlways when I completed those shopping centers I was paid. I didn't \nhave to go through some kind of process that said: Did we meet 90 \npercent of the retail needs of the community? We tried to design the \ncenter so that it met the needs, but it was very tangible when I was \ncompleted, and I was paid.\n  What this amendment seeks to do is to put in five very tangible \nelements as triggers. These elements are all elements Republicans have \npushed for for years. So it is my hope that this evening Republicans \nwill join me in putting in place the toughest border security measures \nwe have ever had in this Nation.\n  The Senator from Alabama has talked about the length of this \namendment. The length of this amendment is 119 pages long. Because of \nSenate procedure, it had to be added to the base bill, which made it a \nlittle bit over 1,200 pages. But the base bill has been around since \nMay. It has gone through committee. Most every one of us who is serious \nabout this bill has gone through its many provisions.\n  The amendment we offered on Friday--which has given people 75 hours \nto look at it--is 119 pages long. For those who are listening in, in \nlegislative language we write pages such that they are triple-spaced \nand they are very short, so 119 pages is really 25 or 30 pages in \nnormal people's reading. I would say to the Presiding Officer that any \nmiddle school student in Tennessee or Alabama could read this amendment \nprobably in 30 to 40 minutes. To ask Senators given an amendment on \nFriday that deals with five basic things and a few others, to ask them \nto read the amendment over the weekend--again, the equivalent of 25 or \n30 pages, really--is certainly not something major to ask when you are \nserving in the Senate. So the length issue is something that is a total \nmyth.\n  Some people have talked about the cost. Let's talk about that. First \nof all, the cost would only happen if the bill passes, but it is \nestimated that the cost of these border security measures and the other \nmeasures in the base bill would be about $46 billion. That only happens \nif the bill passes. I think you have seen that the CBO score on this \nbill is $197 billion. So if this amendment were to pass and the bill \nwere to pass, we would have a situation where over the next 10 years we \nwould be investing $46 billion in border security--almost all of which \nare measures Republicans have pushed for years--but we would have $197 \nbillion coming back into the Treasury.\n  I have been here 6\\1/2\\ years, and never have I had the opportunity \nto vote for something that costs $46 billion over a 10-year period and \nwe received $197 billion over a 10-year period and we did not raise \nanybody's taxes and it promoted economic growth. To those people who \nare talking about the cost, I would just say show me one piece of \nlegislation we have had the opportunity to vote for that has that kind \nof return. I think every private equity, every hedge funder in the \nUnited States of America would take those odds.\n  Finally, let me say to the Senator from Alabama, Governor Brewer from \nArizona was just on the television. She read this amendment over the \nweekend. As I mentioned, it only takes about 30 to 40 minutes, and she \ntook the time to read it. What she just said on national television is \nthat this amendment is a win, a total victory for the State of Arizona. \nAnd she knows more about border security probably than any Governor and \nany person in the United States of America.\n  Let me say one more time what we are voting on tonight. We are voting \non a very tough border security amendment. If you vote for this \namendment, it will mean that five very tangible triggers have to be in \nplace. Whether the money is appropriated or not, they have to be in \nplace before you can have a green card. So if it is not appropriated, \nno green card. When people say that Congress may not spend the money on \nthis, if Congress does not spend the money on it, people will not move \nfrom the temporary status into green card status. So it is totally up \nto us.\n  But the fact is that if you vote for this amendment tonight, you will \nbe voting that all five of those provisions have to be in place--tough \nborder security measures. They are very tangible. The entire American \npopulation can see whether they are in place. And until those are in \nplace, people do not move to the green card status.\n  If you vote against this amendment--which I am getting the indication \nthe Senator from Alabama and others may be thinking about--what you \nwill be saying is, no, I would rather not have these five tough \nmeasures in place. I would rather let Janet Napolitano, the head of \nHomeland Security, decide what our border security is going to be. I \ndon't think that makes anybody in this body particularly comfortable.\n  People have talked about the fact that Congress needs to weigh in on \nthis border security measure, and we have with this amendment.\n  What I would say is that if you really believe in making sure we \naddress our border security, this amendment is something you should \nsupport. If you would rather go to the status quo, if you would rather \nleave it to the administration--which I agree has not done the things \nthey should do to secure the border--then don't vote for this \namendment; vote for Janet Napolitano to secure the border.\n  I have a feeling people on this side of the aisle will see the light. \nAnd to people on the other side of the aisle who may resist this, what \nthis amendment does is it balances out the bill. It balances it out. It \nsays: Yes, we are going to put the kind of border security in place \nthat will cause the American people to trust us. At the same time, in \ndoing so we are going to put in place very tangible triggers, triggers \nthat cannot be moved. You cannot move the goalposts because of \ninterpretation. They are there. They are concrete. If we meet them, \npeople will have the pathway to be the kinds of productive citizens \nthey would like to be.\n  To me, this amendment satisfies people on our side of the aisle who \nwant border security. To me, it ought to satisfy people on the other \nside of the aisle who acknowledge that we need to do both.\n\n[[Page S4992]]\n\n  With that, I yield the floor. I would love to enter into a colloquy \nwith the Senator from Alabama. I know there has been a lot said, but I \nurge every Member of this body to take the 30 to 40 minutes--not much, \nas a Senator on one of the biggest issues we have dealt with in the \nSenate--to read the amendment to see how superior it is to the base \nlanguage. I applaud the folks who created the base language, but this \nis an effort to improve a bill.\n  Read the amendment and then decide: Do you really want to vote \nagainst an amendment that the Governor of Arizona, who has dealt with \nthis issue more closely than any of us in the body, has declared as a \ntotal victory for their State? Do you want to vote against this? Do you \nwant to vote against this really, I ask this body. I think we ought to \nsend this amendment onto the base bill with a tremendous majority. Then \nwe can debate the other pieces. We have an entire week. There are all \nkinds of votes.\n  I would like to see a vote on the Portman amendment. As a matter of \nfact, my understanding is that some of the people who disagree with \nthis bill do not want to see a vote on the Portman amendment. They are \nblocking the Portman amendment. The Portman amendment will actually \nmake this bill even better. I hope we will hear from him on the \namendment. I hope we will hear from other Senators as they seek to \nimprove this bill. But I hope we will do that after voting cloture \ntonight on a border security amendment that I know strengthens this \nbill, puts it in balance, creates trust with the American people, and \ncreates the kind of pathway many people are seeking.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Senator will acknowledge that his \namendment was filed Friday afternoon, at a time when probably 90 \npercent of our Senators had left town. It was not his 200-page \namendment or just his interests; all kinds of special interests and \nSenators' interests have been added to the bill. It was filed as part \nof the overall bill. So the Senator would acknowledge that the \nreplacement that we would be voting cloture on tonight is 1,200 pages, \na little less than 200 pages more than the bill was on Friday morning?\n  Mr. CORKER. May I respond?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, in responding to the good Senator--the \nSenator with one of the best temperaments in the Senate, the Senator \nfrom Alabama, someone I enjoy working with--I respond that there is no \nquestion that our amendment is 119 pages long and that it does \nincorporate input from other Senators.\n  What I would say is that the Senator was a great jurist from the \nState of Alabama. He worked on all kinds of legal documents, I am sure, \nbefore he came to serve in such a distinguished way in this body. I \nknow that he understands well--because I know he has had to do it many \ntimes--that when you have an amendment that touches many parts of a \nbill or you have a contract that has changes that touch many parts of \nthe contract, what people do to cause people to understand how it is \nwritten better--and actually it has to be a rule of construction here \nin the Senate--is add those 119 pages throughout the text of a bill \nthat has been around since May that the Senator from Alabama was able \nto go through in detail as a member of the Judiciary Committee and \noffer all kinds of amendments. He has seen that base text now for a \nlong, long time. He went through it more--I know more than most here in \nthe Senate.\n  So, yes, we added an amendment. It does have other concerns. That is \nwhat you do when you try to write a piece of legislation that solves \nthe problem. It is 119 pages, and it was added to the base text. That \nis true. I would have to say on any measure for somebody who cares \nabout border security, it is much stronger than the base language.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am going to talk about what the \namendment does. The Senator has not seen quite as much--although he is \nan experienced and very able addition to this Senate but has not, \nperhaps, seen how over decades promises about enforcement at the border \nare not fulfilled, and that is important. I will go through the \namendment the Senator has offered, and make some comments about why I \nthink it does not do what my colleague believes it does, why we should \nnot pass this, and why we absolutely should not move forward on the \nsubstitute which is basically the bill that has been put out by the \nGang of 8, which fails in a whole host of ways. I would also be \nconcerned--and I will ask the Senator, does he believe that Senators \nwho have concerns about the bill should be given the right to have \namendments voted on in an up-or-down way as long as reasonably \nnecessary, to be able to offer amendments to fix the legislation?\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I could not agree more with the Senator \nfrom Alabama. As I mentioned in my comments, I hope this body--I hope \nSenators on my side of the aisle--will not block Senator Rob Portman's \namendment on E-Verify, which greatly strengthens the bill. But, yes, I \nagree with the Senator. I hope we have a plethora of amendments offered \nthis week, debated this week, and voted on this week.\n  I would say to the good Senator from Alabama, with whom I really \ncherish serving, I have not blocked one single amendment from being \nvoted on. I do not know if the Senator from Alabama has blocked any. \nBut the fact is, I say let's let it roll. I would love to see another \n50 or 80 amendments this week if time will allow, so let's let it roll. \nI am all for that. I agree 100 percent.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the Senator saying that, but it is not \ngoing to happen because when we have cloture tonight, Senator Reid is \ngoing to be in complete control of the voting process. Amendments will \nbe at his pleasure. There will be the amendments he is willing to vote \non, and the ones he doesn't approve of will not be up for a vote.\n  So that is where we are, and that is a fact. We are going to have \nother cloture motions, and the goal will be to drive this bill to \npassage by or before Friday. There will be far less votes than the last \ntime the immigration bill came up.\n  The last time the big immigration bill came up, there were 45 or so \namendments that we voted on. So far we have had nine votes on \namendments. There were discussions Wednesday and Thursday night that we \nwould have another 16 amendments. I was advocating for more amendments \nto be brought up. I thought we had an agreement to do that, and we were \nmoving that way until this great amendment--the grand amendment that \nfixes things--came up.\n  I will point out a few things I think are troubling with the \nlegislation, and we can then go to Senator Corker for his remarks. I \njust want to make my points now.\n  First of all, Senator Corker said there is a trigger, and that \ntrigger is 10 years from now. It has to do with whether individuals are \ngoing to get permanent legal status in 10 years. What if it turns out \nthe Congress has not appropriated money to complete the fencing as \npromised? What if it turns out Congress has not funded the Border \nPatrol agents they promised?\n  Are we are going to end up saying to these people: You don't get your \nstatus.\n  They are going to say: What's the problem? We did everything we were \ntold to do, and Congress didn't do it. Give us our green cards.\n  People are going to say: We cannot deny people their green cards. \nThese are people who have been here for 10 years, not to mention the \ntime they have already been here and probably had children born in this \ncountry who are citizens. This is not a practical or realistic \nguarantee this will ever happen.\n  Based on my experience, I don't believe we are going to add 20,000 \nagents. We probably don't need that many, although we do need more \nagents and better effectiveness at the border. The impact of the \ntrigger is the legal status and the Social Security card. The right to \nwork anywhere in America is given within 2 months of the passage of the \nlegislation. They are making promises 10 years down the road that I am \nsaying are not likely to ever happen. In fact, I don't think it will \nhappen in the way it was said.\n  The Secretary has the power to reallocate personnel under this bill, \nand it gives her broad power to do that. She\n\n[[Page S4993]]\n\nwill say she has done what is required--or the next Secretary will say \nthat--and I am concerned about that.\n  As far as the costs, Senator Schumer and the Judiciary Committee \npromised that the bill was paid for by the fees, the punishment, and \nthe fines--and I will talk about that at some length later--from the \npeople who entered the country illegally. They claim they will have as \nmuch as $8 billion, and maybe that is so. I am not sure.\n  They would not say how many people would be legalized. I asked that \nquestion twice to Senator Schumer. He refused to say how many people \nwould be given green card status in the next 10 years in America. Maybe \nhe doesn't want us to know. If he doesn't know, that is a big gap for \nsomebody who is writing a 1,000-page bill and doesn't know how many \npeople are going to be legalized.\n  This is what he said: What we are simply doing is making sure all the \nexpenses in the bill are fully funded by the income the bill brings in. \nThis is to make sure this bill does not incur any costs on the \ntaxpayers to make it revenue neutral.\n  He said: It provides startup costs to implement the bill repaid by \nfees that come back later. So what we are basically doing is setting up \ntwo pots of money that have startup money, and it is repaid. Both the \ncompanies pay when they get new workers, and the immigrants who get RPI \nstatus pay in terms of their fines as they go through the process.\n  That is what we were told in their talking points. This is their \npoll-tested talking points when they were drafting the original version \nbefore Senator Corker was involved. Now it is $46 billion. Where is the \nmoney coming from? Well, they say the bill creates more revenue.\n  The Congressional Budget Office--our budget accounting firm--said \nbefore Senator Corker's bill raised the cost from $8 billion to $46 \nbillion, it would increase the on-budget deficit by $14 billion, and \nthen it would reduce the off-budget deficit by $211 billion. So isn't \nthat good news? It improved our off-budget deficit.\n  What is the off-budget deficit? The off-budget deficit is the Social \nSecurity withholding the newly legalized persons will pay when they get \ntheir Social Security cards. So they will be paying withholding on \ntheir checks that maybe they were not paying before, and they score \nthat as increased revenue, and it certainly is increased revenue. One \nform of our accounting will show that as an increased revenue, and that \nmoney in that form of accounting, unified-budget accounting, allows us \nto think we can spend it for anything we want.\n  Wait a minute. What is the reality? The person is paying their Social \nSecurity and Medicare withholding, and it doesn't go to the U.S. \nTreasury. It goes to the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. It \nis not available simultaneously to be used to pay for a new bill. This \nis how this country has been going broke.\n  The same thing happened during ObamaCare. The night before the vote, \nDecember 23--we voted on Christmas Eve to pass that bill--I got Mr. \nElmendorf to say: You can't simultaneously strengthen Social Security \nand Medicare with this new money and pay for something else with it. He \nused this phrase: It is double counting the money. That is where they \nare coming up with the money here.\n  So the Social Security and Medicare payroll withholding that people \nwill pay when they are legalized and given a Social Security card is \ntheir retirement. We have to have that money to pay for their \nretirement when they get ready to withdraw Medicare and Social \nSecurity. We cannot spend it now and pretend we have free money. The \nCBO score from just last week shows that is the situation. I am just \nnot happy about the counting of money in that form.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator would let me \nrespond in a generous way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. First of all, I respect the leadership the Senator from \nAlabama has given on the Budget Committee, and I know he knows all of \nthese things well. I have offered a very detailed piece of legislation \nto deal with Medicare, and he knows the average American today is \npaying one-third of the cost of Medicare over their lifetime. In other \nwords, they pay only one-third of the cost of their Medicare Program.\n  So the fact that we have people who began paying taxes--I mean one of \nthe things the Senator is mentioning is if we pass this bill, those who \nare here today who have been undocumented and not paying taxes, will be \npaying taxes. I would think the Senator from Alabama would think that \nis an outstanding idea.\n  Most of them are younger, and the fact is they are going to help the \nbaby boomers and senior population in America we have because Americans \ntoday are only paying one-third of the cost of Medicare. I know the \nSenator from Maine is very knowledgeable on this subject. The Medicare \nfund is going to be insolvent in 2024.\n  Senator Sessions is exactly right--by forcing these folks who are in \nthe shadows today to come out of the shadows for 10 years and pay taxes \nand not receive, by the way, Federal benefits--no means-tested Federal \nbenefits--until we do the five things that are in our bill.\n  By the way, the Senator should know that the money for this is \nappropriated now. If this bill passes, the money is appropriated. It is \nnot subject to appropriations down the road.\n  I will say one last thing, and I will yield the floor. I appreciate \nthe Senator from Alabama letting me do this.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I want to make sure whose time is being used, but go \nahead.\n  Mr. CORKER. As I understand, this is under Senator Leahy's time.\n  The cloture vote tonight is not as was described a minute ago. The \ncloture vote tonight is only on this amendment. It is not on the bill. \nSo for someone to say they are losing some kind of cloture rights down \nthe road, it is not true. The cloture vote we are having tonight is on \nan amendment that has five strong border security measures that every \nRepublican has talked about for years. It doesn't mean we vote for the \nbill. We are talking about the amendment. The moneys are appropriated. \nThe cloture vote is only on the amendment. I just wanted to clear that \nup.\n  The CBO--which the great Senator from Alabama works with daily and \nquotes daily--has said if this bill passes, it will help tremendously \nwith this deficit we know is weighing our country down today.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair, but the cloture will be on the \nsubstitute which is 1,200 pages, not just the Senator's amendment, most \nof which I am supportive of. I think I could be supportive of much of \nit if we could make it effective.\n  The Senator is correct when he says the people who are paying into \nSocial Security and Medicare are not paying enough to produce the \nrevenue that would take care of them for the rest of their lives. The \nSenator is right, and I certainly don't dispute that people who are \ngiven Social Security and start to work under this bill, which provides \nthem amnesty and legal status, that they are going to pay Social \nSecurity and Medicare money they were not paying before, but that is \ntheir money. That money has to be used to pay for their retirement. \nWhere is the money going to come from to pay for that?\n  All I am saying is that it is quite plain, and that is why the CBO \nscore said the on-budget deficit gets worse. In the 10-year window, the \nSocial Security account looks better, but they are not counting the \nyounger--the average age is 35. Workers will be retiring in the years \nto come and will demand their Medicare and Social Security. If the \nmoney is spent now, it will not be there in the future. That is how a \ncountry goes broke.\n  Senator Corker is one of the most knowledgeable, hard-working, \ncourageous, and determined people in the Senate in trying to fix the \nfinancial path we are on, but I think the Senator is misinterpreting \nthat issue.\n  Mr. President, how much time has been used on my side?\n  I am going to have to save some time for other people who are due.\n  Maybe the question should be, how much time have I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 60 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Sixty? Senator Corker said he was using some of his \ntime.\n\n[[Page S4994]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I better wrap up. I know others want to \nspeak in opposition to the legislation.\n  With regard to the fence, there is a statement from the sponsors of \nthe Corker-Hoeven amendment that we are going to have a bunch of new \nworkers at the border--Border Patrol officers that will be guaranteed. \nI pointed out how that is going to be funded for over 10 years. This is \nnot an appropriations bill; it is a promise. The legality--the \namnesty--occurs first. Just like so often happens in the past, the \npromises are never fulfilled when competing interests start fighting \nover money. It just doesn't happen.\n  There are some people who have opposed fences and opposed Border \nPatrol agents religiously by using every excuse possible in this body. \nIt will not be easily accomplished in the future. In fact, in my \nopinion, it will not be fully accomplished.\n  With regard to the promised fencing that is in the bill, the new \nsubstitute requires the Secretary submit her southern border fencing \nstrategy to Congress and certify that 700 miles of pedestrian--not \ndouble-layered, reinforced fencing, is in place. Congress first passed \na law requiring double and triple layer fencing in 1996. In 2006, \nCongress overwhelmingly passed a law requiring a double layer fence. \nThat never happened. Then-Senator Obama voted for it and then-Senator \nBiden voted for it. It never happened. Only 36 miles of that ever got \nbuilt because there was discretion given somewhere a little later and \nall of a sudden they talked about a virtual fence that never occurred. \nSo this weakens current law, or it weakens the law we passed \npreviously.\n  The new bill says the second layer is to be built only if the \n``Secretary deems it necessary or appropriate.'' That is what happened \nin 2008. The new bill keeps the language from the Gang of 8 bill \naddressing limitations on the requirements for strategy. This was \noffered in the Judiciary Committee by Senator Leahy. I was rather taken \naback by it because they had been promoting the bill as being a bill \nthat had fencing in it. Senator Leahy offered the amendment. The Gang \nof 8 all supported it--those on the committee. It said this:\n\n       . . . notwithstanding [the requirement that the Secretary \n     come up with a Southern Border Fencing Strategy], nothing in \n     this subsection shall require the Secretary to install \n     fencing, or infrastructure that directly results from the \n     installation of such fencing, in a particular location along \n     the Southern border, if the Secretary determines that the use \n     or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate \n     means to achieve and maintain effective control over the \n     Southern border at such location.\n\n  I think that is a fatal flaw in the language. It allows Senators to \nbelieve, perhaps, and advocate that their bill guarantees we are going \nto have 700 miles of fencing when it is not there. Senator Leahy knew \nexactly what he was doing when he offered that amendment in committee. \nAnd the 1,200-page substitute includes this exact Leahy amendment \nlanguage. It has not changed by the Senator's offer of legislation.\n  I have spoken more than I intended to. There are a number of other \nissues I would raise if we had the time. I believe this is close to \nwhat we ought to be doing, but we don't have the mechanisms in place to \nget us there and we can't count in any realistic way on this all \nhappening. As a result, we are going to have, as we had before, the \nlegalization now and a promise of enforcement in the future that does \nnot occur.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator \nfrom Alabama for his comments.\n  I want to rhetorically ask any of those who might share the views of \nSenator Sessions, if you will, on this amendment, that would this \namendment--I would ask this question: If one doesn't like the status \nquo, would this amendment, even if it weren't fully achieved--and I \nknow the language states it has to be achieved before one achieves \ngreen card status; it is very specific in that regard--I would ask: \nDoes the Senator from Alabama and do other Senators not believe that if \nthis amendment passes, we would be much farther down the road toward \nour goals than if this amendment doesn't pass? I would ask that \nquestion rhetorically.\n  What we do a lot of times on the floor is we seek to improve a piece \nof legislation. I know the Senator from Alabama is not going to vote \nfor this bill regardless of what the security measures are, in all \nlikelihood. But I would ask if he and others who share his views, which \nare critical of this overall legislation, would they not support an \namendment that certainly is a vast improvement over the status quo?\n  I think the Senator has pointed out it is very unlikely that Homeland \nSecurity is going to do the things we would all wish for them to do. \nBut in this amendment we have five of the things that for years \nRepublicans have hoped to achieve, and the administration clearly \nstates we cannot move from this temporary status into green card status \nuntil these things are tangibly done. Again, it is much better than a \ntrigger that has some superfluous thing where nobody knows what it \nmeans, and Democrats are worried we are going to move the goalpost in \none direction and the Republicans are going to move the goalpost in \nanother. Instead, we have something here that is very tangible.\n  Every American who is observing will know whether we have 20,000 more \nBorder Patrol agents deployed and trained first. Every American will \nknow whether we have an exit-entry visa program fully deployed. Every \nAmerican--every employer, for sure--throughout our country will know \nwhether we have an E-Verify system that is fully deployed. Every \nAmerican, whether we have 350 miles of fencing--which I would say to \nthe Senator from Alabama, there is no chance in the world--no chance--\nthat any additional border security measures are going to be created \nthat way unless this amendment passes. Then I would say: Think about \nthe $4.5 billion in technology that will cause us to have situational \nawareness on the border that is a part of this bill.\n  Congress constantly talks about the fact that we punt too much to the \nexecutive branch. I know many people on my side of the aisle do not \nwant to punt, if you will, the border security plan to the head of \nHomeland Security, whomever that might be. They want to weigh in. So \nthis amendment gives everyone in this body the ability to weigh in and \nfor the other side of the aisle to ensure we have tangible measures \nthat cannot be moved.\n  Again, I realize that no matter what this bill says--no matter what \nit says--as long as the title of it relates to immigration reform, \nthere are going to be people in this body who won't support it. There \nare measures I don't even want to--I don't want to get myself in \ntrouble by stating the kind of measures that if they were in this bill \npeople would say, No, it has to be even tougher. The fact is we in this \nbody, generally speaking, have worked together to try to come up with a \npiece of legislation that meets the balance. This amendment, to me, \nadds that component that meets the balance.\n  I know some people on my side of the aisle would criticize because \nthey would say, Well, you worked with the other side of the aisle to \nmake this happen. I think that is what we all came here to do. I know \nthe Presiding Officer, who is an Independent, came here to do it, \nbecause without working with Republicans and Democrats he couldn't get \nanything done. So what we have done over the last couple of weeks now \nis work very closely on both sides of the aisle to come up with a \nmeasure that hits that balance. It doesn't move the goalpost because we \nall know it is tangible.\n  As I mentioned, I used to build shopping centers all around the \ncountry, retail projects in 18 States, and when I finished the project, \npeople could see it. I didn't have to go out and get a survey in the \ncommunity: Did I meet 90 percent of the retailing needs of this \ncommunity? And if it was a grocery center they might have said: Well, \nyou did on the grocery side but you didn't on the florist or some other \npiece. I built something that was tangible and called for and it was \npaid for.\n  Let's face it. The reason we have had this trouble is we have been \ndebating a trigger for months that everybody knows can be monkeyed \nwith. If a person sees a Cheetos bag in a crevice some place in Arizona \nor someplace\n\n[[Page S4995]]\n\nelse, somebody could say, Well, there were 10 people eating out of that \nCheetos bag so we are going to change the denominator. That is what \nthis debate has been about and everybody knows that. This side of the \naisle doesn't trust that side because they are afraid we are going to \nadd 10 more folks with that Cheetos bag and we are going to change the \ndenominator, and this side over here is saying we don't trust it \nbecause we want to see results. This amendment gives results. It gives \nresults. Every American can see the results.\n  Again, I cannot imagine how anybody on this side of the aisle who is \nserious about border security could want the text that is in the base \nbill that doesn't stipulate anything--it stipulates nothing--I don't \nknow how they could want the text that is in the base bill over the \ntext that is in this amendment, which clearly lays out those five \nthings we have discussed over and over. They include 20,000 trained and \ndeployed border agents; 350 miles of additional fencing on top of the \n350 that is there. Republicans have tried for years to get 700 miles. \nWe add the $4.5 billion in technology. The chief of the border control \narea, Chief Fisher, has been in our offices for years wanting this \nequipment to do what he needs to do, and it is in this bill. There is \nan entry-exit visa program. We have 40 percent overstays on our visa \nprogram. That is terrible. But it has to be fully deployed before a \nperson moves to green card status. And, again, E-Verify, which, let's \nface it: Why are people coming across the border? They are coming \nacross the border to take care of their families. They want to work \nhard. That is what we want our kids to do. They are walking across the \nborder to work hard and to do all kinds of things, including to create \ncompanies. They are entrepreneurs. But they also raise our kids, they \nserve us meals, they bring our crops in, they build our homes, they \nbuild our buildings. They want to participate in the American dream. \nAnd what this bill--not our amendment--lays out is a path for them to \nbe able to do that. It is a tough path. They get at the back of the \nline. They pay taxes for 10 years and receive no means-tested Federal \nbenefits and, somehow, we have people opposing that, even though these \ntriggers have to be in place.\n  All I can say is this is a great Nation. This is a Nation that has \nlaws, and we are laying out in this amendment the way those laws have \nto be.\n  I hope people will look at this amendment for what it is. It is an \nopportunity for both sides of the aisle to succeed, for Republicans to \nhave those tough border control measures people want.\n  I was in a restaurant Saturday night in my neighborhood, a place I go \noften, a place that serves great hamburgers. When I walked in, what do \npeople say? They want border security. So we have an amendment that \nputs in place what is, as Governor Brewer of Arizona has said, ``a \nvictory for Arizona.'' It is a victory for Arizona. On the other side \nof the aisle, what people have pushed for is a clear path. They want to \nknow that we are not going to wait 10 years and then move the goalpost. \nLet's have tangible goals people can see.\n  I hope everybody will get behind this amendment--people on our side \nbecause of border control and people on both sides because it achieves \nthe balance, if passed, that a piece of legislation such as this ought \nto have.\n  I want to say again I have enjoyed working on this amendment and this \npiece of legislation over the last 10 days more than anything I have \ndone in the Senate. We have an opportunity to do something great for \nthis Nation--great for this Nation--and the passage of the cloture vote \nthis night on this amendment is something that takes us a step closer. \nEven if a Member opposes the underlying bill, those people who hear \nconcerns all over the country about border security should support \nthis. This is better than in the base bill.\n  This is a 119-page amendment. People know the way we write \nlegislative language. It is triple-spaced, big letters. We have a lot \nof seniors in this body. We write in big letters. About 3 or 4 pages of \nlegislative language is the average page for most Americans and what \nthey read on a daily basis. A middle school class person in Tennessee \ncould read this amendment in 30 to 45 minutes--30 to 45 minutes. It has \nbeen available for 75 hours. It has tangible goals we have all sought.\n  Voting for cloture tonight does not end debate on the base bill. That \nis not true. It ends debate on this amendment. There are still cloture \nvotes into the future that close off the debate, if you will, for those \npeople listening in, that close off debate on the overall bill. So \nnobody has given up rights. Why not strengthen the bill even if a \nMember opposes it? If a person is for the bill, why not vote for a \nmeasure that might add people to this piece of legislation and send it \nover to the House of Representatives where they will create their own \nbill--and there are improvements they can make--why not do that?\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote tonight. I hope people will actually read this \nlanguage and see what it does to the underlying bill.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his time this afternoon.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Treasonous Behavior\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I would like to speak about the \nimmigration bill, but first I wish to make a comment about this \ninternational drama that is going on from Hong Kong to--well, I guess \nit started in Hawaii--from Hawaii to Hong Kong, now Hong Kong to \nMoscow. Then the question is, Where does the fugitive go from there?\n  I think we ought to face facts that the Government of China would not \nhave let him go without making the decision with regard to Hong Kong. I \nwould not have been surprised if they did not get certain information \nfrom him if, in fact, he has anything. But the fact that he is now in \nMoscow and did not get on the airplane for Cuba tells me that the old \nKGB officer--now President of Russia--Putin is directing the show. I \nwould not be surprised if the President of Russia is giving the orders \nto milk him for every piece of information he has. If he does not have \nanything, then I think the President of Russia is going to decide \nwhether he wants to have a good relationship with the United States and \nmight allow him to be extradited to the United States.\n  It may well be that since he was released from Hong Kong--which is \nunder the direction, in this case, of President Xi of China--that he \nmay not have all the information he is claiming to have.\n  Presumably, he is carrying a bunch of laptops. One would have thought \nthey would have taken them into custody, and maybe that is what is \nhappening right now in Moscow.\n  However it plays out, as I have said from the beginning, I think his \nbehavior is treasonous behavior and that the full extent of the law \nought to be applied and those countries that have a formal legal \nrelationship with the United States ought to obey the law and have him \nextradited to the United States so he can face the charges.\n  By virtue of his escapades all over the globe, I think it is clearly \nindicative that he does not want to face the full extent of the law. I \nthink all the more that would justify the Department of Justice in the \ncharge they have brought already on espionage.\n  I wish to say a word or two about the immigration bill. Clearly, on \nthe first day of the debate I came out here and embraced it. Clearly, \nwe need comprehensive immigration reform.\n  When I was a young Congressman back in the 1980s, I voted for it \nthen. The big difference back then was that we only had about 2 million \nillegal folks in the country. Now the new term is ``undocumented.'' Of \ncourse, that has swelled now to over 11 million undocumented.\n  In large part, the law that was passed back in the 1980s was never \nobserved. Businesses did not obey the law, and that is one of the \nthings we are looking at in this comprehensive immigration package--\nthat businesses will have to obey the law and still will be able to get \nthe labor source they need in order to conduct business and that \nthrough a series of E-Verify and other provisions they can then have \nthe security of knowing that the individual they have hired is in legal \nstatus.\n\n[[Page S4996]]\n\n  I think it is clearly the right thing to do. There are 11 million \npeople here. These folks who are saying, oh, well, deport them, that is \nnot common sense. We cannot deport 11 million people; the economy would \ncollapse. Just look at the agricultural community. We have to have the \nsource of labor to pick the crops when the crops are ripe; otherwise, \nthe whole crop is lost. So too as we go through so many of the nuances \nof this bill--it is all put together, and I think they have done a good \njob.\n  I have one bone of contention. I came to the floor today absolutely \nshocked that the amendment Senator Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, \nand I have offered is--it is questionable whether, with all this \nfalderal that is going on about not accepting any additional \namendments, if it is going to be accepted.\n  This amendment says that in addition to the land border security, \nwhich has been the story for the last week, laboring over how do we \nincrease border security--and the estimate on this new amendment we are \ngoing to vote on today is that it is costing an additional $20 to $46 \nbillion; that will really tighten up border security--but if you have \nmade the land border almost foolproof, what do you think is going to \nhappen? How are the smugglers going to get the illegal immigrants \nacross? How are the smugglers going to continue to try to get across \nall the illegal drugs?\n  Similar to water, if you dam it up in one place, it is going to try \nto go around. Where is ``going around''? The maritime border. If you \nmake the land border on the southern United States foolproof, where do \nyou think the smugglers and the illegal immigrants are going to go? \nThey are going to go to a very porous border that is from Texas to \nLouisiana, to Mississippi, to Alabama, to my State of Florida, which \nhas the longest coastline of the continental United States, and then up \nthe eastern seaboard: Georgia, the Carolinas, Virginia, et cetera. They \nare going to do it also by going in through some of the Caribbean \nIslands, including U.S. territories--Puerto Rico and the Virgin \nIslands--because if they get there, then they are on U.S. territory.\n  So if we are spending--this is where the common sense comes in--if we \nare spending $46 billion additional to secure the land border, why \nwouldn't we want to spend an additional $1 billion to help secure the \nmaritime border? California would be another one. You can come up the \ncoast of Central America into California. It, perhaps, is a more \ndaunting task because of the waters of the Pacific. But look at all the \nopportunities on the coast of a State such as mine, Florida, of \nbringing in smugglers. Of course, we have seen this over the years. So \nwhat do we do? What is the $1 billion for? Simple, real simple. We \nalready have an unmanned aerial vehicle like a drone, such as we read \nabout over in Afghanistan--a Predator or some version thereof, unarmed.\n  Today, it is flying out of the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. But \nthat is one. When it is down for maintenance, there is zero. So why \nwouldn't we enhance one UAV with more stationed strategically around \nthe coastal maritime border to stop what is supposedly going to happen \nif this impregnable land border is there?\n  No. 2, the U.S. Navy is experimenting with a stable platform that is \nvery cheap to operate called a blimp. I have flown in this blimp. You \ncan station blimps with a long dwell time because the amount of fuel \nthat is used in a blimp from start to finish for upward of a 24-hour \nmission, if you had two crews on board--that amount of fuel is the same \nthat it takes to crank up an F-16 just to get it out there on the \nrunway. It is a huge cost savings, and it gives us a lot of dwell time. \nSo why wouldn't we enhance for the U.S. Navy the blimp that is being \ntested for the 4th Fleet headquartered at Mayport Naval Station? We \nshould.\n  Thirdly, the U.S. Coast Guard. Why wouldn't we enhance the Coast \nGuard's ability to patrol not just for drugs, but for some of those who \nare trying to come into the United States illegally now through the \nmaritime border, so why wouldn't we enhance the Coast Guard?\n  With $20 billion to $46 billion extra for this amendment that we are \ngoing to vote on this afternoon, why wouldn't we add another $1 billion \nto stop the illegal immigration and drug smuggling that is going to \noccur on the maritime border? Just think about it. Just think, when you \ntry to stop water from rushing forward and you put some kind of dam \nthat stops it, if there is any break or leak or hole, where is that \nwater going to go? It is going to go in the place of least resistance. \nSo, too, smuggling of illegal aliens and drugs. If they do not get \nacross the land border because of my friends insisting that it become \nimpregnable, why would they want to block Senator Wicker's and my \namendment that says we are going to enhance modestly because we can \nhandle it with overhead and on-the-sea assets through the Department of \nHomeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Navy?\n  It is common sense. Common sense ought to rule.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Would the Senator yield. The Senator--the esteemed \nchairman whose leadership has brought us to this point, that we are on \nthe brink of passing a major immigration reform bill--the Senator heard \nmy comments earlier. Does it not make common sense that if we are \nmaking as secure as possible the southern land border of the United \nStates for illegal immigration--which also includes drugs, by the way--\nwould it not make sense that we would want to increase the maritime \nborder security?\n  Mr. LEAHY. In answer to my friend from Florida, who has been a friend \nfor decades and knows the coastal area far better than anyone else, the \nmore secure we make the land border for those who want to have illegal \nentry into the United States, the more they are going to look for other \nways. Water is one of them.\n  The distinguished Senator from Florida has seen everything from boat \nlifts on through coming into his State. Without naming the countries, \nwe know them all. So that is long way around of saying ``of course.''\n  Mr. NELSON. I thank the Senator, the esteemed chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. It is common sense. I appreciate him underscoring \nthat. I hope our brethren and sistren on the other side who are \nquestioning whether they are going to allow my and Senator Wicker's \namendment to be considered will reconsider their decisions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would note that there are some in this \nbody, I am sure, who want no immigration bill. I get the feeling that \nis a smaller and smaller group. I imagine they would love to just keep \nkiller amendments going for weeks and weeks and hope the bill might \ndie.\n  On the other hand, we have some very legitimate requests made on both \nsides of the aisle. I have been told that some of the ones we might \nwant to bring up that we would pass probably unanimously, the other \nside will not allow them to come up unless we allow these other \namendments.\n  I would hope that during the next 2 days both sides would allow the \ndistinguished ranking member and me to sit down and go through and \naccept--as we normally do on a bill such as this--a package of \namendments that are acceptable.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I know that when I come to the floor and remind my \ncolleagues about my involvement in the 1986 immigration bill, it sounds \nlike a broken record. I said early on this year that I wanted to \neducate my colleagues about the mistakes we made in 1986 so those \nmistakes were not repeated in the first immigration bill to pass the\n\n[[Page S4997]]\n\nSenate since 1986. Because I was here in 1986, I thought I could share \nthe experience we had. I know firsthand that we screwed up in that 1986 \nlegislation. I was certain other Members in this body could learn from \nour mistakes.\n  However, today we are right back to the same place, talking about the \nsame problems, proposing the same solutions.\n  In 1981, as a freshman Member of the Senate, I joined the Judiciary \nCommittee and was very active in the subcommittee process. We sat down \nand wrote the legislation. We had 100 hours of hearings and 300 \nwitnesses before we marked up that bill in May of 1982. Hundreds more \nhours and a dozen more hearings would take place before the bill \nactually became law in 1986. This year we had 6 days of hearings. We \nspent 18 hours and 10 minutes listening to outside witnesses.\n  The Judiciary Committee received the bipartisan bill at 2:24 a.m. \nApril 17. We held hearings April 19, 22, and 23. We heard from 26 \nwitnesses in those 3 days. We heard from the head of the Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement agency union. We heard from economists and \nemployers, law enforcement and lawyers, professors and advocacy groups. \nWe even heard from people who are undocumented, proving that only in \nAmerica would we allow somebody who has violated our laws, is not right \nwith the laws, to be heard by the American people.\n  One of the witnesses on April 23 was Secretary Napolitano. We \nattempted to learn about how the bill would affect the functions of the \nexecutive branch--after all, that is where it is going to be carried \nout--and whether she saw some flaws, the same flaws many of us were \nfinding in the legislation.\n  We asked follow-up questions of the Secretary that were thoughtful \nand focused on the mechanics of the legislation. We wanted to know the \nSecretary's thoughts since she would be implementing the legislation. \nUnfortunately, we still have not received responses to questions we \nraised. Today it has been 2 months since the Secretary has failed to \nanswer our questions--in a sense, ignoring us. She has refused to \ncooperate. She has refused to tell us how the bill would be implemented \nby her department. Is it amazing--at least it is to me--that the \nmajority puts up with this, let alone some of my own Republican \ncolleagues?\n  After the committee hearings, we started the markup process on May 9. \nWe held five all-day sessions where Members were able to raise \nquestions, voice concerns, and offer amendments. Commonsense amendments \noffering real solutions were repeatedly rejected. Those that were \naccepted made some necessary improvements. But the core provisions of \nthe bill have remained the same yet to this very day.\n  I respect the process we had in committee. It was open, fair, and \ntransparent, even though the end result was almost determined. We had a \ngood discussion and debate on how to improve the bill. It was a \nproductive conversation focused on getting immigration reform right for \nthe long term, not to make the same mistakes we did in 1986. Yet I was \ndisappointed that alliances were made that actually ensured nothing \npassed in that committee process that would make substantial changes \nand improvements to the bill. Those alliances remain in effect when we \nare out here on the floor of the Senate.\n  As of this morning, 349 amendments have been filed to the underlying \nbill. We started off the debate on the Senate floor with my amendment \nthat would require the border to be effectively controlled for 6 months \nbefore the Secretary could process applications for registered \nprovisional immigrant status, RPI, or another way of saying it: \nlegalizing those who crossed the border without papers. That is pretty \ndarn important because we have been told since this bill was put to the \npublic by the Gang of 8 that we were going to secure the border. Well, \nwe are going to secure the border after legalization because a plan put \nbefore Congress is not securing the border. Securing the border is only \nif that plan actually secures the border. But legalization is going to \ntake place before the plan is put into effect. That is what I consider \na major shortcoming of this legislation because it makes the same \nmistakes we did in 1986. We thought we secured the border. We did not \nsecure the border, but we legalized.\n  My amendment was surely feared by the other side because it would \nfundamentally change the bill. It would not fundamentally change what \nthe authors of the bill said they were going to do--secure the border \nand then legalize--but it changed what was actually in the language of \nthe bill. So in order to keep my amendment from being adopted, they \ninsisted on a 60-vote threshold for the amendment to pass, which I \nrefused. So in response they moved to table my amendment.\n  We were promised an open and fair process. Why wasn't that promise \nkept? We learned on day one that all the talking about making the bill \nbetter was just hogwash. It was a phony and empty promise. They would \ntake to the floor and they would say they were ready to move and vote \non amendments. Boy, that sounds very fair and open, doesn't it? Yet, in \nreality, they were afraid of all of the amendments that could be \noffered. They refused to let Members offer any amendment of their own \nchoosing. They wanted to pick which amendments would be considered on \nthe floor of the Senate. Does that sound fair and open? Well, it \nobviously does not. They wanted to decide who, what, when, and how it \nwould be disposed of. That is not right.\n  What is even more disturbing is the fact that the alliances made \nthwarted the ability of the minority to have any say whatsoever. \nRepublicans were obstructed even by Members of our own party. They \nvoted to table amendments, and they refused an open amendment process. \nOne Republican said:\n\n       I am confident that an open and transparent process, one \n     that engages every Senator and the American people, will make \n     it even better. I believe this kind of open debate is \n     critical in helping the American people understand what's \n     in the bill, what it means for you, and what it means for \n     our future.\n\n  That was never carried out here on the floor of the Senate.\n  The same Senator also wrote Chairman Leahy on March 30, saying:\n\n       I write to express my strong belief that the success of any \n     major legislation depends on the acceptance and support of \n     the American people. That support can only be earned through \n     full and careful consideration of legislative language and an \n     open process of amendments.\n\n  That was a letter to Senator Leahy on March 30. It was well-intended, \nbut I don't see a defense of that position out here on floor of the \nSenate as we are steamrolled.\n  In a letter to me on April 5, the Senator wrote:\n\n       If the majority does not follow regular order, you can \n     expect that I will continue to defend the rights of every \n     Senator, myself included, to conduct this process in an open \n     and detailed manner.\n\n  As we are being steamrolled with just a few amendments being \nconsidered, we can see that may have been well-intended, but it is not \ncarried out.\n  When the bill was introduced, the senior Senator from New York said:\n\n       One of the things we all agree with is that there ought to \n     be an open process so that the people who don't agree can \n     offer their amendments.\n\n  Well-intended. The Gang of 8 called for a robust floor debate. They \nsaid they supported regular order. I asked them do they think that \nhaving only considered nine amendments equates to a robust and open \nprocess.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will yield for a question. I may not answer it, but I \nwill yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is it not a fact that the first amendment that was brought \nup was a bipartisan one of Senator Hatch's and mine? Shortly \nthereafter, the Senator from Iowa came with an amendment. Following the \nnormal courtesy done, I allowed mine to be set aside so he could bring \nup his, but isn't it a fact that when we asked if we could set that \naside for some noncontroversial amendments on either side, he told me \nhe could not?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We only had nine amendments. Is that a robust and open \nprocess? Do they think the majority has allowed regular order? From my \npoint of view, the answer is a clear and resounding no.\n  We are at a point where the process has been halted. It is unclear if \nany more amendments will be debated and\n\n[[Page S4998]]\n\nvoted on. The only amendment that is in order is the one that was \nconcocted behind closed doors and is loaded full of provisions that are \nshockingly close to what can be called earmarks.\n  We are back where we started--with a gang of Members promising that \ntheir legislative text is the best thing to happen to immigration \nreform, that their solution is the end of future illegal immigration. \nDoes anyone really think this will solve the problem once and for all? \nFrom my point of view, based upon my experience in 1986 and since, the \nanswer is a clear and resounding no.\n  There are fundamental flaws in this amendment we call the Schumer-\nCorker-Hoeven amendment--legalization first. I am going to take the \nopportunity to walk through some changes.\n  The authors claim the amendment is a border ``surge'' that leaves no \nmore doubt about whether the border will be secure. Yet the border \nchanges only account for about half of the total amendment. There are \nchanges to every title. There are changes to exchange visitor programs, \nthe future guest worker program, and visas for the performing arts. \nThis isn't just a border amendment; there are provisions in the bill to \nattract other Senators to support its passage. I will dive into those \nprovisions in detail in a moment, but first I wish to focus on border \nmeasures.\n  The sponsors of this bill want you to believe it is different from \nthe 1986 legislation. They say it will be a tough and expensive road \nand it would be easier for individuals to go home than to go through \nthe process. What the sponsors don't like to admit is that the bill is \nlegalization first, enforcement later--and I have to add, enforcement \nlater, if ever.\n  Take, for example, the fact that one of the sponsors who went on \nSpanish television tried to apologize for speaking the truth. He said:\n\n       Let's be clear, nobody is talking about preventing the \n     legalization. The legalization is going to happen. That means \n     the following will happen: First comes the legalization. Then \n     come the measures to secure the border. And then comes the \n     process of permanent residence.\n\n  He spoke the truth.\n  The fundamental flaw underlying the bill has not changed with this \namendment. Let's be clear. No one is preventing the legalization. It is \ngoing to happen, as opposed to the promise when this bill was put \nforward that the bill was going to secure the border first.\n  There is a lot of money in this bill, there is a lot of micromanaging \nin this amendment, and there are more waivers. Remember, this is \nalready on top of--I think one Member counted 222 waivers for the \nSecretary. We write a piece of legislation. We are supposed to \nlegislate. We legislate and then say to the Secretary: Well, you can \nignore what we legislate in certain conditions.\n  We ought to be making broad policy here and not delegating to the \nadministration the way that we too often do--not just in this \nlegislation but, as a matter of fact, on most everything.\n  What the amendment does is require more boots on the ground. It \nincreases the presence of Border Patrol even though the Members of the \nGang of 8 had long opposed that idea. They said it was unnecessary and \ncostly. But let's be honest with the American people. The amendment may \ncall for more Border Patrol agents, but it doesn't require it until the \nundocumented population, who are now called RPIs, apply for adjustment \nof status or a green card. It is legalization first, border security \nlong down the road.\n  I am all for putting more agents on the border, but why wait? Why \nallow legalization now and simply promise more agents in the future? \nEven then, who really believes that the Secretary, like the one we have \ntoday, will actually enforce the law?\n  Then there is the fencing. One of the conditions that must be met \nbefore the Secretary can produce green cards for people here illegally \nis that the southern border fencing strategy has been submitted to \nCongress and implemented. This fencing strategy will identify where 700 \nmiles of pedestrian fencing is in place. Note that this is not double-\nlayered, as in current law; the amendment states that a second layer is \nto be built only if the ``Secretary deems necessary or appropriate.'' \nCan the authors of this amendment say that is a promise to the American \npeople to build a fence if somehow the Secretary is given the authority \nof whether it is necessary or appropriate? Additionally, the underlying \nbill still specifically states that nothing in this provision shall be \ninterpreted to require her to install fencing.\n  The amendment also requires that an electronic entry-exit system is \nin use at all international air and sea ports but only ``where U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection are currently deployed.'' This is \nactually weaker than the bill that came before the Senate a few weeks \nago. That bill required that an electronic entry-exit system be in use \nat air and sea ports, not just internationally. It is still weaker than \ncurrent law, which requires biometric entry and exit at all ports of \nentry, including air, sea, and land. That current law has been on the \nbooks for a long period of time--not carried out by both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations. So what certainty do we have that this is \ngoing to be carried out?\n  The Schumer-Corker-Hoeven amendment border proposal adds technology \nin addition to manpower at the southern border. It authorizes the \nSecretary to purchase and deploy certain border technology. I will give \nsome examples that are included in this amendment.\n  In Arizona, the Secretary is allowed to deploy 50 fixed towers, 73 \nfixed camera systems, 28 mobile surveillance systems, 685 unattended \nground sensors, and 22 hand-held equipment devices, including night \nvision goggles.\n  In San Diego, the Secretary is allowed to deploy the same type of \nequipment but of different quantities. They also will deploy \nnonintrusive inspective systems, a radiation portal monitor, and a \nlittoral detection and classification network.\n  In El Centro, CA, the Secretary is allowed to deploy the same \nequipment, but the list also includes two sensor repeaters and two \ncommunications repeaters.\n  They will also get 5 fiber optic tank inspection scopes, a license \nplate reader, a backscatter, 2 portable contraband detectors, 2 \nradiation isotope identification devices, 8 radiation isotope \nidentification devices updates, 3 personal radiation detectors, and 16 \nmobile automated targeting systems.\n  That is not all. The list goes on. It includes certain helicopters \nand aircraft upgrades. It includes 10 Black Hawk helicopters and 30 \nmarine vessels.\n  I would like to know what some of these items are. Who provided the \namendment sponsors with this list? We had a hearing in January, and not \nonce did the list appear. Secretary Napolitano did not provide the \ncommittee with any list. Did Sikorsky, Cessna, and Northrop Grumman \nsend a wish list to certain Members of the Senate?\n  While the Senate micromanages what technology is to be purchased and \ndeployed, we should take note that the bill allows the Secretary to \n``reallocate'' the personnel, infrastructure, and technologies laid \nout. It is pretty simple: A Secretary who says the border is secure \nright now can change all of this stuff specifically mentioned in this \namendment.\n  Let's also not forget about the litigation exception. The triggers or \nconditions may never have to be met. Green cards can be issued if the \nSupreme Court grants review of litigation on the constitutionality of \nthe implementation of the conditions. Under the bill, if any court in \nthis country issues a stay on implementing one of the conditions, then \ngreen cards are to be issued after 10 years. The bill does not specify \nwhat sort of ruling must prevent implementation or even that the ruling \nbe on the merits, nor does the bill require that appeals run their \ncourse, even if the appeal upholds the conditions.\n  We still maintain this toothless commission called the southern \nborder security commission, but it retools it a little bit. It still \ndoes not give it any teeth whatsoever. The amendment requires the \ncreation of the commission 1 year after the enactment, which is \nprobably better than the 5 years that is in the bill. They would also \nbe required to hold public hearings once a year. Under the original \nversion of the bill, the commission would be in existence until they \nsubmitted a plan. Under this amendment, the commission will live for 10 \nyears. Yet, the recommendations they provide still do not hold any\n\n[[Page S4999]]\n\nweight. They can be ignored. They are nonbinding.\n  There is a lot of spending in this amendment as well. In addition to \nmicromanaging resources in each sector, the amendment increases \ntaxpayer spending by $40 billion over the introduced version of the \nbill before this amendment was added to it. Originally, the legislation \ncalled for spending $100 million for startup costs and $6.5 billion for \nthe Secretary to carry out the law. When we got to committee, there was \na technical amendment that increased that startup cost from $100 \nmillion to $1 billion. During markup, Senator Schumer and his allies \nincreased the trust fund allocation from $6.5 billion to $8.3 billion. \nThe Schumer-Corker-Hoeven amendment increases the trust fund to $46.3 \nbillion. Now, think, going from $8.3 billion to $46.3 billion. Add the \n$3 billion for the Secretary to have startup costs, and we are at $50 \nbillion. That is over a 500-percent increase in spending. You know, a \nbillion here and a billion there, and it soon adds up to real money.\n\n  Note that this isn't shifting money from the trust fund, such as the \nCornyn amendment would have done. And that amendment was defeated on \nthe floor of the Senate. Instead, it is just plain old brand new \nspending. The sponsors found a money tree to pay for the wish list \nprovided by Secretary Napolitano and the aerospace industry.\n  Based on reports of how this deal was struck, we have a pretty good \nidea of why spending has increased. According to a Politico article \nfrom last week, negotiations for this deal were at a standstill until \nthe Congressional Budget Office's score was released. The CBO's score \nstated if the bill becomes law it would cut the deficit by almost $1 \ntrillion over the next 20 years.\n  Thus, with this estimate in hand, the Politico report tells us how \nthe negotiators were able to find a solution: ``Throw money at it.'' \nAccording to the article, it was suggested Senators could funnel some \nof the savings into border security, and that is what has been done. \nAgain, as is often the case in Washington, the solution always seems to \nbe just throw more money at the problem. But the money has to come from \nsomewhere.\n  Furthermore, paying for the agents requires raiding the Social \nSecurity trust fund. Indeed, the bill sets aside $30 billion to pay for \nBorder Patrol agents. But when asked on the floor how the Gang of 8 \nfound the money, Senator Hoeven said he and Senator Corker were able to \nadd the $30 billion in spending because the CBO projects that S. 744 \nwill bring in more revenue than it requires in expenditures. Upon \ncloser examination, it is clear the projected revenue under CBO \nanalysis is due to an increase in Social Security and Medicare taxes.\n  This money must be set aside if Social Security and Medicare are to \nremain solvent. Thus, taking that tax revenue and using it for the \nfence means raiding the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. You \nknow how the Medicare trust fund was raided for health care reform? \nSounds like the same thing is happening here.\n  On the date of enactment, the Treasury will transfer $46.3 billion to \nthe trust fund. The sponsors claim the Treasury will be repaid. But \nwhen will the funds be paid back to the Treasury? When will the \nAmerican people be reimbursed? The sponsors of the bill are saying \ntaxpayers would not bear the burden. Yet there is no requirement the \nfunds be paid back. There is no time limit or accountability to ensure \nthey are repaid.\n  The Schumer-Corker-Hoeven amendment increases fees on the visas for \nlegal immigrants in order to replenish the trust fund and the Treasury. \nIt happens that employers, students, and tourists will pay the price. \nThe bill allows the Secretary to increase those fees, so employers who \nbring in high-skilled workers will bear the burden. Students and \ntourists who come in the legal way will bear the burden.\n  But guess what. The amendment goes on to say the fees for those who \ncross the border in violation of our laws cannot be charged more than \nwhat is allowed. The Secretary cannot adjust fees and penalties on \nthose who apply for or renew RPI status or even blue card status.\n  There is no interior enforcement in here, and there is a real problem \nwhen we don't have more interior enforcement than is here because we \nwill have more people coming here who are undocumented. The amendment \nin the underlying bill will not end undocumented immigration. The \nCongressional Budget Office reports that illegal immigration will only \nbe reduced by 25 percent due to the increased number of guest workers \ncoming into the country. The amendment does nothing to radically reduce \nillegal immigration in the future and does not provide any resources to \ninterior enforcement agents whose mission it is to apprehend, detain, \nand deport undocumented immigrants. Just like with the 1986 \nlegislation, we will be back in the same position in 10 years facing \nthe same problems.\n  The amendment, for instance, in section 1201, attempts to address \npeople who overstay their visas. It says the Secretary shall, one, \ninitiate removal proceedings; two, confirm that immigration relief or \nprotection has been granted or is pending; or, three, otherwise close \n90 percent of the cases of nonimmigrants who were admitted and extended \ntheir authorized period of admission by more than 180 days.\n  So while it appears to be tough on overstays, it only affects people \nwho overstay their visa by 180 days or 6 months. It also allows the \nSecretary to close the cases.\n  What does it mean for the Secretary to close these cases? Under \ncurrent law, an immigration judge has the power to administratively \nclose a case. It is used to temporarily remove a case from the \ncalendar. Sometimes a judge waits for further action to be taken. An \nadministrative closure is not a final order. Closure does not mean \ntermination. It does not mean deportation. So I think it is unclear \nwhat this language does and who it is applying to.\n  Moreover, it is unclear how the Secretary would know who has \noverstayed if no exit data or tracking system exists. Also, why doesn't \nthe amendment require the Secretary to deal with 100 percent of the \npeople who overstay their period of authorization? Given there are no \nramifications for the Secretary if she does not capture 90 percent of \nvisa overstays, this, again, is another law that will not be followed.\n  It does nothing to end this administration's anti-enforcement \npolicies but, instead, gives the Secretary of Homeland Security vast \ndiscretion to ignore serious criminal convictions of immigration \nviolators, including gang-related crime, domestic violence, drunk \ndriving, and child abuse.\n  The bill would not only create an immediate legalization program for \nthose here illegally today but also a permanent legalization program \nfor future undocumented immigrants. The Schumer-Corker-Hoeven amendment \nincludes a provision that would make individuals admissible despite the \n3- and 10-year bars.\n  I would like to know more about the rationale from the sponsors as to \nwhy this language was included. There is no doubt this amendment was \ncrafted in the back rooms on Capitol Hill, and it is no secret some \nMembers were able to insert provisions in the Schumer-Corker-Hoeven \namendment while the rest of us attempted to work out an agreement on \npending and filed amendments.\n\n  While some of us were trying to legislate and bring up amendments for \nvotes on the floor, others were taking advantage of the pay-to-play \ngame. Clearly, some of the amendments filed were included. Let me share \nsome examples.\n  No. 1, the amendment now authorizes funds for an educational campaign \nto help deter illegal crossings into Mexico from the South. This \namendment would put American taxpayer money toward training for law \nenforcement officials in Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, and \nother countries. It would allow for taxpayer expenditures to educate \nnationals of other countries ``about the perils of the journey to the \nUnited States.''\n  This amendment should have been considered under regular order.\n  No. 2, the amendment now includes a provision that would require \nCustoms and Border Protection officials to reduce airport wait times.\n  This amendment which was filed should have been considered under \nregular order.\n  No. 3, the amendment now makes it harder for Border Patrol agents to \nenforce U.S. immigration law along the\n\n[[Page S5000]]\n\nnorthern border by limiting the mileage or distance agents can search \nvehicles or other forms of transportation.\n  This amendment which was filed should have been considered under \nregular order.\n  No. 4, the Schumer-Corker-Hoeven amendment includes amendment No. \n1283 that creates a ``Youth Jobs Fund'' using $1.5 billion from the \nU.S. Treasury to be repaid through fees. The goal of the fund is to \n``provide summer and year-round employment opportunities to low-income \nyouth.''\n  This amendment should have been considered under regular order.\n  No. 5, the Schumer-Corker-Hoeven amendment includes amendment No. \n1493, which designates zones 1, 2, and 3 occupations involving seafood \nprocessing in Alaska as shortage occupations. It also includes \namendment No. 1329, which extends the J visa Summer Work Travel Program \nto seafood processing positions only in Alaska.\n  These amendments should have been considered under regular order.\n  No. 6, the amendment now includes amendment No. 1183, which was \nactually pending before the Senate. It would allow for fee waivers on \ncertain visa holders, namely O and P nonimmigrants, who come to the \nUnited States to work in Hollywood or play professional sports.\n  We could have voted on this and had regular order on that amendment.\n  Well, there are a lot more amendments I could go through, but I will \njust suggest some clarifying amendments. And there probably should have \nbeen more clarifying amendments.\n  The amendment by Schumer, Hoeven, and Corker also includes so-called \n``technical fixes.'' One fix is related to the H-1B visa cap. The \nsponsors of the bill, and those who worked behind closed doors to \ndevise an H-1B visa package, stated the annual cap would not exceed \n180,000. Yet the language didn't do what they said it did. As written, \nit provided 20,000 more than they claimed. So this amendment includes a \nclarification to say the cap shall not exceed 180,000.\n  The second clarifying change in the amendment is related to visas for \ncountries that have entered into free-trade agreements with the United \nStates. During committee consideration, the Senator from New York added \nan amendment that would provide 10,500 visas for countries in the \nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act and the Caribbean Basin Economic \nRecovery Act. The change in this amendment clarifies that only a total \nof 10,500 may go to those countries rather than to each country that is \ndescribed under the act. Still, it is not 100 percent clear the \nclarification achieves the goal.\n  So it is legitimate with these clarifications and fixes, but how many \nmore clarifying amendments are necessary? These two provisions were \nincluded because my staff caught them and brought them to the sponsors' \nattention. But how many more provisions are not written properly that \nwe do not know about?\n  At the end of the day the Schumer-Corker-Hoeven amendment doesn't do \nwhat the sponsors say it will. As we have seen all along, we are being \npromised one thing and sold another.\n  I am frustrated with how the majority has processed this bill. We \nshould have had 3 genuine weeks on this bill processing amendments and \nhaving votes. Yet we are forced to vote on packages that were concocted \nbehind closed doors. We were given 72 hours to read the legislative \ntext. That may be plenty of time to read it, but it is not plenty of \ntime to actually study it and know what is in it. Even then, the \nAmerican people would have had a difficult time getting their hands on \nthe bill over the weekend or understanding its true ramifications.\n  It is quite obvious I am going to vote against this amendment. It \ndoes nothing to change the legalization first philosophy and offers \nlittle more than false promises the American people can no longer \ntolerate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as if in morning business, without delaying or affecting the \ntime of the cloture vote today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy pertaining to the introduction of S. 1215 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for up to 10 minutes under Senator Leahy's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise today to address comprehensive \nimmigration reform and to talk specifically about the Hoeven-Corker \namendment.\n  The Hoeven-Corker amendment is to secure the border. Besides myself \nand Senator Corker, this is bipartisan legislation that has 11 \nRepublican and 4 Democratic cosponsors. This is all about securing the \nborder first. This is a first step for comprehensive immigration \nreform, and that is what we are seeking to do.\n  I come to the Senate floor today to address some of the \nmisperceptions that have already been circulating about our \nlegislation. Throughout the weekend some of the pundits and others have \nput out information that is incorrect with regard to the Hoeven-Corker \namendment to the new immigration bill. As the old saying goes, people \nare certainly entitled to their opinions, and we respect all opinions, \nbut they are not entitled to their own facts. So I want to separate \nsome of the myths or misperceptions from the facts in regard to our \namendment.\n  Let me say at the outset we welcome the debate, and we welcome the \nopportunity to provide information. This is truly about coming up with \nlegislation that wins the support of the American people as well as \nbipartisan support in the Senate, the House, in this Congress, and that \nis what it takes to meet a challenge of the magnitude of immigration \nreform. So I will clear up some of the misperceptions or myths that \nhave been circulating and put forth the facts.\n  Myth No. 1: Somehow people have not had time to read this 1,200-page \namendment--and somehow this myth keeps getting repeated. Well, the fact \nis it is not 1,200 pages. This new amendment is about 120 pages that \nhave been added to the underlying bill. So, yes, all told it is 1,200 \nbecause 1,100 pages is the existing bill, and we are adding an \nadditional 120 pages. The underlying bill--the 1,100 pages--has been \nout there since May for people to read. The roughly 120 pages right \nhere is it. This is the new material. This is 120 pages. We are adding \n120 pages, which I think somebody could read in a short amount of time.\n  This was filed at about 2 p.m. on Friday, and it has been available \nto all of the Members. They had all of Friday to read the 120 pages. \nThis is the new material--not 1,200 pages. They had all of Friday to \nread it, all of Saturday to read it, all of Sunday to read it, and \ntoday until now to read it. If there is anybody who still hasn't read \nit, there is plenty of time to read it before the vote at 5:30 p.m. \ntoday.\n  There is 120 pages of new material. Let's be clear about that. There \nis no purpose for folks to misunderstand or to create misunderstanding. \nWhy would anyone do that? Why would anyone want to say there are 1,200 \npages of new material when there are 120 pages of new material? Well, \nthat is the first myth.\n  Myth No. 2: The southern border fence does not need to be completed \nbefore people are eligible for green cards. That is the second thing \nthat is not correct. What is the fact? Because that is wrong. The fact: \nThe trigger explicitly states that at least 700 miles of fencing along \nthe southern border must be built before individuals can receive a \ngreen card. A subsequent provision says DHS may decide where that fence \ngets constructed, but the trigger language is clear: We have to build \n700 miles of fence before anyone gets a green card.\n  The southern border is roughly 2,000 miles from Brownsville, TX, to \nSan\n\n[[Page S5001]]\n\nDiego, CA. A minimum of 700 miles of fence has to be built before \nanyone can get a green card, and they have to go into what is called \nprovisional status for 10 years as well.\n  As for this provision, the Secretary of Homeland Security does have \nsome discretion to decide where on that 2,000-mile border they are \ngoing to put the 700 miles of fence. That makes the most sense, doesn't \nit? Shouldn't we put the fence where it does the most good? Why would \nanyone try to say the subsequent provision--which says they can put the \nfence where they need to put it and where it does the most good--get \nconstrued to somehow mean we don't have to have 700 miles of fence? It \nclearly says we have to have 700 miles of fence.\n  Again, let's make sure people understand what is in the bill rather \nthan confusing them about what is in the bill. It seems to me we can \ndebate this, and we should debate it, but let's debate it on the facts, \nnot on creating misperceptions.\n  Myth No. 3: Congress will choose not to fund the southern border \nsecurity in the amendment. Congress will choose not to fund it. Well, \nthe whole law says, in fact, they do have to fund it, and the fact is \nthe bill is fully funded. It is funded upfront. The amendment adjusts \nthe funding for border security by $38 billion, and that is over a 10-\nyear period. So it is between $3 billion and $4 billion a year we spend \nto truly secure the border. Americans want the border secure, so that \nis what we do. That cost is over a 10-year period.\n  Under this legislation, that money--upfront--is authorized and \nappropriated and put in the comprehensive immigration reform trust \nfund. Furthermore, that funding is paid for with immigration fees, \nfines, and surcharges. So the illegal immigrants pay for the border \nsecurity. I think that is something Americans should understand, and I \nthink it is something they believe should happen. That is the way it \nshould be done.\n  Again, my question is: Why is the misperception going around that \nsomehow this thing isn't funded or will not get funded when this \namendment specifically says it is funded upfront, and the money is \nappropriated into the trust fund? That is what it says in the roughly \n120 pages that constitute the new legislation in this amendment.\n  Myth No. 4: The amendment puts the American taxpayer on the hook for \n$38 billion. I think I covered this one pretty well just a minute ago, \nbut I have additional information to make sure people understand.\n\n  CBO says the underlying immigration bill will reduce the deficit by \n$197 billion in the next 10 years and by $690 billion during the second \ndecade. That is almost $1 trillion in deficit reduction over the next \ntwo decades. The total cost of security measures added by the Hoeven-\nCorker amendment is--as I said just a minute ago--about $38 billion. \nThe base bill designates $8 billion to security measures, bringing the \ntotal costs of security measures for the bill as amended to a total of \n$46 billion. The U.S. taxpayer will be more than made whole with the \nvisa fees and by the $458 billion in additional tax revenue that \nresults in the large deficit reduction.\n  Again, the point I made before: By bringing illegals out of the \nshadows, making them pay fines, fees, and taxes, we will generate the \nrevenue which not only reduces the deficit, but way more than pays to \nsecure the border. Again, Americans want border security first, which \nis what this amendment is about.\n  Myth No. 5: The new border patrol agents will never be hired or \ndeployed. Fact: The amendment mandates that 20,000 more Border Patrol \nagents be hired and deployed before individuals are eligible for a \ngreen card. Let me read that again. The amendment mandates that 20,000 \nmore Border Patrol agents are hired and deployed before individuals are \neligible for a green card. That is in addition to the almost 20,000 \nBorder Patrol agents who are on the border now. That is a total of \n40,000 Border Patrol agents on the border.\n  I have heard some of our Members talk about how they want 40,000 \nBorder Patrol agents on the border. That is what this does. It requires \nthat it be done before anyone gets a green card.\n  Myth No. 6: Section 2302 says if a person overstays their visa in the \nfuture, they can still apply for a green card and become a citizen. \nFact: That is just plain false. If a person overstays their visa, a \nremoval proceeding must be initiated unless they are in a special legal \nstatus because they cannot return to their country due to conditions \nsuch as an environmental disaster or a humanitarian crisis.\n  Myth No. 7: The amendment is only about the border and it does \nnothing to address the visa overstay issue. Fact: Visa overstays \ncurrently account for 40 percent of those unlawfully present in our \ncountry. This is an important issue. The underlying bill improves the \nidentification of overstays through a fully implemented entry-exit \nsystem.\n  Our amendment goes a step further by mandating the initiation of \nremoval proceedings for at least 90 percent of visa overstays--holding \nDHS accountable. The amendment also requires extensive reporting to \nCongress every 6 months to facilitate oversight of this important \noverstay issue.\n  Myth No. 8: The 20,000 additional Border Patrol agents won't begin to \nbe deployed until 2017. Fact: Under the Hoeven-Corker amendment, the \nBorder Patrol must deploy 20,000 additional agents before registered \nprovisional immigrants can obtain a green card. The only reference in \nthe bill to the year 2017, as it relates to the deployment of border \nsecurity resources, is to a mandate on DHS that says the 3,500 Customs \nand Border Protection officers assigned to points of entry must be \nhired by and must be in place by 2013. This is a positive provision \nthat will ensure additional Customs and Border Protection officers are \nin place as quickly as possible, and in no way delays the deployment of \nthe additional 20,000 Border Patrol agents.\n  There are other misperceptions circulating regarding the \nlegislation. That is why Senator Corker and I put out a fact sheet to \nrebut them. We do it as simply and as straightforwardly as we can. We \nsay: OK, look. They are saying there are 1,200 new pages. No, there are \n120 pages, and on we go down the list.\n\n  So I hope people understand we are trying to foster understanding. We \nwant people to understand this. We want people to know what is in it. \nAgain, we are, to the very best of our ability, trying to approach this \ncomprehensive immigration reform issue, we believe, the right way, \nwhich means secure the border first. That is what this amendment is \nabout. It is about securing the border first, and we do it as \nobjectively and in as verifiable a way as we can.\n  We ask our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in rising \nand meeting this incredible challenge we face for the benefit of the \nAmerican people and the future of our country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. With that, I yield the floor and note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any quorum \ncall time be equally divided on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the amendment at hand. \nMy understanding is Senator Leahy has allowed me to use some of his \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. I will be brief. I spoke at length earlier today on this \namendment. I wish to speak especially to my side of the aisle as it \nrelates to this amendment.\n  There is a lot of confusion over what is happening tonight, and I \njust want to make sure everybody understands. No. 1, we have a cloture \nvote this evening on the amendment. It is a border security amendment. \nIt is not the\n\n[[Page S5002]]\n\ncloture vote on the bill. There still will be the opportunity for \nadditional amendments to be considered. So people can sense--I do want \nto say the very people who seem to be wanting amendments are the same \npeople who are opposing amendments, so I hope that will get worked out \non the floor. But tonight's vote is simply a cloture vote on an \namendment that was offered on Friday, and that is all it is. So there \nwill be another cloture vote. No one is giving up rights relative to \nthis bill.\n  Secondly, this amendment we are voting on is 119 pages long. Because \nof the rules of construction in the Senate, this 119-page amendment was \nadded to the base text. A lot of people understand that is just the way \nwe do things here, when an amendment touches various pieces of a bill. \nBut this amendment is 119 pages long. It has been added to the base \nbill which makes the bill itself over 1,200 pages.\n  Members of this body have had access to the base bill since May. It \nhas been through committee. It has been amended. People have been able \nto look at it.\n  I say to people viewing in, 119 pages in legislative language is \ntriple-spaced, on small pages, and generally is about 25 to 30 pages in \nregular reading. I would just say that a middle or high school person \nin Tennessee could read this amendment in about 30 to 45 minutes. I am \nassuming staff can walk people through much more quickly if they wish \nor one could go into much more detail. But the point is it is not as if \nsomething has been dropped on people that is from outer space. This is \n119 pages. It is easy to read. All of us could read it in a very short \namount of time. I am sure people would want to spend more time than \nthat.\n  So let me go back to what this amendment does. In the base bill right \nnow it states the head of Homeland Security would lay out a plan 180 \ndays after passage of this legislation. Then, 10 years from now, this \nsame person--it might be a different person, but the head of Homeland \nSecurity--would decide whether that plan has been implemented.\n  Many people on my side of the aisle viewed that as a little abstract \nand wanted to improve it. There have been numbers of measures authored \non the floor. I voted for almost every single one of them to strengthen \nthe border. It has been something Republicans have championed for \nyears.\n  So this amendment would take away that base language saying the \nSecretary of Homeland Security would make a plan and decide and would \nput in place five very important measures.\n  The first would be deploying and training 20,000 Border Patrol \nagents. That is doubling the number of Border Patrol agents we have in \nthe country, something Republicans have wanted for a long time.\n  Secondly, the amendment authorizes $4.5 billion on technology to \ncreate the kind of technology that gives us situational awareness on \nthe border--something, again, Republicans have wanted for a long time.\n  It adds 350 miles of fencing to the 350 miles we now have, creating \n700 miles. We have had amendments to that effect that almost every \nRepublican voted for. That is a part of this amendment.\n  It puts in place an entry-exit visa program. Again, people know 40 \npercent of the immigration issues we have in this country are because \nof visa overstays. This attempts to solve that by putting in place a \nvery measurable trigger.\n  In addition to that, E-Verify has to be fully in place.\n  Again, all five of these have to be in place before people transition \nfrom a temporary status to a green card status. So if you vote for this \namendment tonight, you are voting to have those five tangible, \nmeasurable issues in place.\n\n  Let me talk about this. We have had a big debate over the trigger. By \nthe way, for what it is worth, I understand the concerns on the other \nside of the aisle about a trigger that is subjective. In essence, what \nhappens down on the border right now is the Border Patrol agent sees a \nCheetos bag, literally, and has to decide whether 10 people ate out of \nthat Cheetos bag and left it there or 1. Let's make a subjective guess. \nSo the other side of the aisle said: We do not want anything subjective \nlike that.\n  Our side has wanted some tangible triggers. I used to build shopping \ncenters around the country--retail projects in 18 States. When I \ncompleted the project, the whole community could see it was done and I \ngot paid. I would not have wanted a trigger that said: Did we meet 90 \npercent of the retail needs of the community? I built what was laid \nout. That is what this amendment does. It lays out five measurable \ntriggers that people who have wanted border security for years have \npressed for.\n  I am almost finished.\n  The cost of it. A lot of people have said: The cost of this is $46 \nbillion over a 10-year period. It is expensive. Some of them are one-\ntime costs. But as it relates to the overall bill--not the amendment--\nthe bill states--by the way, these measures do not go in place unless \nthe bill passes. But there is $197 billion in return over that 10 \nyears.\n  I wish to say to everybody in this body, I have never had the \nopportunity as a Senator--I have been here 6\\1/2\\ years--to potentially \nbe in a place to vote for something that spends $46 billion over 10 \nyears and generates $197 billion back to the Treasury over 10 years \nwithout raising anybody's taxes. I have never had that opportunity. I \nwould imagine every private equity company, every hedge fund in America \nwould want to participate in that kind of ratio.\n  I am going to close with this: The choice tonight is to vote cloture \non an amendment--not on the bill, an amendment--that has been on the \nfloor for 75 hours--everybody has had the opportunity to look at it--\nthat takes away the idea that the Homeland Security person will put out \na plan 180 days after we pass this bill and, instead, puts in place \ntangible, measurable criteria, things that every American can see in \nplace before persons transfer from a temporary status to a green card \nstatus.\n  For what it is worth, Governor Brewer, who is the Governor of \nArizona, who probably knows more about border security than anybody in \nthis body, today came out and said if we could pass this amendment as \npart of the immigration bill, it would be a tremendous victory for \nArizona, a place that probably has more issues of border security than \nany State in the country.\n  So I will just ask my Republican colleagues, why would anyone even \nconsider voting against an amendment that puts in place very stringent \nborder requirements in place of one where we have no idea what is going \nto take place?\n  Republicans have asked that Congress weigh in. I do not know how \nCongress could weigh in any more than spelling out what is going to \nhappen.\n  To my friends on the other side of the aisle, I would say to you, to \nme, this is something that allows us to know that once this process \noccurs, there is a tangible line in the sand we can measure, to know we \ncannot move the goalposts--we cannot move the goalposts--and at the end \nof the day we end up with a balanced bill.\n  I will close with this. I know I said I would close a minute ago. I \nwill say one more thing. I look at what we are trying to accomplish in \nthis bill and I look at the people who have come across our border to \nwork--to work. I know many of them have created companies and have been \nentrepreneurs and contributed in all kinds of ways. Many of them have \njust walked across to support their families. They raise our kids in \nmany cases. They pick our crops. They serve us in restaurants. They \nbuild our homes. They build our buildings. They do many other things. \nTo me, what people on both sides of the aisle have done in trying to \nagree to this motion tonight is to put in place something that is \ntangible, something that cannot be changed down the road.\n  If this amendment is passed--even though there may be people who vote \nagainst the overall bill--voting for this amendment strengthens the \nbill. It says, if we pass it, we have a bill, in my opinion, that meets \nthe test of the American people. We are securing the border, but we are \nallowing those people at the back of the line to have some pathway to \ncontinue to live the American dream, the same things we want for our \nsons and daughters all across our country.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Presiding Officer for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to also address this most recent \nbackroom\n\n[[Page S5003]]\n\ngang agreement--the Schumer-Corker-Hoeven amendment we will be voting \non in just a little while.\n  This amendment is clearly filled with lots of sort of nice shiny \nobjects to try to attract Republican votes. It is clearly supposed to \nbe about border security. But my fundamental concern is simple. I \nbelieve this amendment is designed to pass the bill. I do not believe \nit is designed to truly fix the bill. In that sense, I am concerned \nthis is a figleaf border security amendment--again, all about passing \nthe bill, not truly fixing it.\n  I say that for two simple reasons, the two basic flaws in the \nunderlying bill that this amendment does nothing to address. First of \nall, the amendment, as the bill, is amnesty now, enforcement later, \nmaybe. Secondly, on the enforcement piece--which the authors of this \namendment are arguing for so strenuously--there is no metric about \nactual effect, actual achievement. The only metric is spending money. \nWe all know the U.S. Government, the Federal Government, is great at \nspending money. It has never been better at spending money than under \nthis current administration.\n  But if that were all that mattered, then we would have a rip-roaring \neconomy with unprecedented growth. If that were all that mattered, then \nwe would have the best educational system on the planet. If that were \nall that mattered, we would have solved problems such as violent crime \nand many others. But the metric cannot be spending money. The metric \nhas to be achieving security, achieving some reasonable level of border \nand workplace security.\n  I am also very concerned about the backroom deal and the process that \ngot us here. I think it is important for the American people to know \nexactly what happened in the last few weeks and, in particular, at the \nend of last week. About 350 amendments were filed to this bill. They \ncovered all sorts of topics--certainly including every important \nenforcement matter. Many of these amendments struck to the very core of \nthe Gang of 8 compromise bill.\n  As Ranking Member Grassley has noted, the Judiciary markup was an \nopen process in which nearly all amendments were considered in a fair, \ndecent manner. However, as Senator Grassley also noted earlier today, \non the floor, it is a very different atmosphere and the fix apparently \nis in. We are seeing that on the floor. The fix seems to be in--another \nclosed-door agreement, loaded with ideas that have been accepted for \n``yes'' votes to ensure the support of particular Members.\n  The amendment is 1,100 pages long--longer, I believe, than the \noriginal bill--and because of this development, the full and fair floor \namendment process has come to a grinding halt.\n  That is exactly what is broken with the Senate. Rather than doing the \npeople's business out in the open--with floor amendments, with debate--\ninstead, so-called masters of the universe have huddled together, \nagain, behind closed doors, to hammer out a secret agreement, again, \nvirtually cutting off floor amendments and trying to pass the bill.\n  In 2007--the last time a major immigration bill came to the floor--we \nhad 46 rollcall votes on amendments. This time around we have had only \n9, and now we have the prospect of cutting off the amendment process--9 \nout of 350 amendments filed, 2.5 percent of the filed amendments.\n  Again, this is what is wrong, in the eyes of the American people, \nwith Congress, with the Senate. This is one of the things I came to \nchange. I came to the Senate to work--developing and introducing \nlegislation, working hard in the appropriate committees, voting, \noffering floor amendments, voting on those. But these gang deals, \nnegotiated behind closed doors, particularly when they cut off and \nmuffle the amendment process, are not that sort of work.\n  Again, the masters of the universe have conspired among themselves. \nThey have allowed certain Members into that back negotiating room, \nundoubtedly for the price of a ``yes'' vote. Worst of all, this \nthreatens to completely shut off the open, fair amendment process.\n  That is why this morning I coauthored a letter to Senate Majority \nLeader Reid, with 13 of my colleagues, addressing this very problem. In \nthe letter we state clearly:\n\n       We believe that there should be, AT A MINIMUM, this same \n     number of roll call votes--\n\n  That is as in the 2007 debate--\n\n     on serious, contested floor amendments on the Gang of Eight's \n     immigration bill. This can clearly be accomplished this week \n     with a little leadership and coordination through one or more \n     compact series of 10-minute votes with senators seated at \n     their desks.\n\n  Continuing with the letter, we say:\n\n       Further, we will give our consent to any reasonable consent \n     request if this is assured. This would specifically include \n     replacing the one or two cloture votes and one final passage \n     vote on the bill with one final passage vote with a 60-vote \n     threshold late Thursday, as well as clearing all truly non-\n     controversial amendments.\n\n  I hope all Members of this body look carefully at this bill we are \ngoing to vote on in about an hour regarding cloture. I hope all of us \nlook hard at the details and recognize it does not change the core \nfundamental flaws of the underlying bill. Still, as in the underlying \nbill, the amnesty is first, virtually immediately, the enforcement is \nlater, maybe. As in the underlying bill, there is no true metric of \neffectiveness, of enforcement bearing fruit. There is simply the metric \nof spending money, which the Federal Government can do very \neffectively. Surely, any Federal Government, particularly under the \nObama administration, will pass that test with flying colors.\n  The American people do not want amnesty first. They want enforcement \nfirst. The American people do not have as a test of enforcement \nspending money. They have the same tests they have for important issues \nand challenges around their kitchen table and at their place of small \nbusiness--results, actual results.\n  We should use those same tests. We should use that same approach. The \nAmerican people get it. Why can't we? The American people also get the \nvery closed backroom deal nature of the process that is going on. They \nwant us to work. They want us to debate. They want us to propose. They \nwant us to vote out in the open, not certain masters of the universe \ncoming up with gang deals outside of here and then shutting down a \nfull, open, free amendment process.\n  It is not too late. It is not too late to look clearly at this \namendment and vote no. It is not too late to have an open amendment \nprocess on the floor this week. I urge all of my colleagues--Democrats \nand Republicans--to do just that.\n  With that, I yield back the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I wish to make some observations. I \nknow several of my other colleagues will continue to pursue their views \non the floor. I did not intend, when I was asked to sit in for Senator \nLeahy for a while, to say anything. But some things just cannot go \nunresponded to.\n  I heard a lot about the 2007 bill, how that process took place. But \nwhat has failed to be mentioned is that the 2007 bill did not go to the \nJudiciary Committee. It went straight to the floor. Now, this bill, in \naddition to the time that it was out there when the Gang of 8 proposed \nit, went through weeks--weeks--of the Judiciary Committee going through \nits process: 140 amendments were heard and adopted, many of them \nRepublican and most of them bipartisan. So there were 140 changes made \nto this legislation through the regular order process.\n\n  So there is a fundamental difference between 2007 and this \nlegislation. There is another fundamental difference; that is, for the \n2 weeks this bill has been on the Senate floor, Republicans, on a \nseries of offers, opposed allowing amendments to go forward, including \namendments of their own Republican colleagues. Why? Because they \nbelieved amendments being offered by some of their Republican \ncolleagues would make the bill more acceptable to Members on their side \nof the aisle. So instead of allowing their own colleagues to have the \namendments and have their say, they opposed unanimous consent \nagreements to move forward because they did not want their colleagues \nto have an opportunity to have that amendment, and maybe if that \namendment was adopted then find a way to vote for this bill.\n  That is pretty outrageous. Then to come to the floor and suggest that \nthere has been an impediment over at least the last 2 weeks to being \nable to\n\n[[Page S5004]]\n\nconsider a variety of amendments, when they themselves opposed \namendments, including from their colleagues on their side of the \naisle----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator is probably aware of the fact that we have a \nlarge number of amendments that were from both Republicans and \nDemocrats. We suggested that they are all acceptable, could probably be \nadopted by a voice vote, both these Republican and Democratic \namendments, but that has been rejected by the other side. Is the \nSenator aware of that?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I am aware of that. I heard the distinguished chairman \nmake that offer at various times and I heard that offer rejected \nvarious times.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I might ask another question. The Presiding Officer has an \namendment involving women that would be easily accepted, but we cannot \nget that agreement. The Senator has been here a long time in both \nbodies. It is my recollection--is it correct at least in the past--that \nwhen we have a group like that, both sides should come together and \naccept them. Is that the normal practice?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. The Senator is right. When there is a series of \namendments that would improve the bill and are agreed to by both sides \nand are, in fact, noncontroversial, it has been the regular order to \nget those amendments disposed of and on the way.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I appreciate that. The Senator from New Jersey has the \nfloor. I appreciate him coming here and saying this. Nobody in this \nbody of either party has worked harder and more diligently than the \nSenator from New Jersey on comprehensive immigration reform.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. The reality is this is a different process. Now, I know \nthere are allusions that this amendment is 1,100 pages long. We all \nknow this amendment only took the underlying bill and added the \namendment to the underlying bill. So to suggest that there is a new \n1,100 pages is disingenuous. It is not the case.\n  Everybody has known what the amendment is about. The underlying bill \nhas been on the floor for 2 weeks. Before that, it came out of the \nJudiciary Committee. I think everybody knew what it was. So I think it \nis not fair to have the American people believe that somehow this \nlegislation just came onto the desks of Senators and they are voting in \nthe blind.\n  I find it interesting--you know, I have listened over the years, the \n7 years I have been here, and before that in the other body, in the \nHouse of Representatives--I hear those who want a fence. A fence is a \nsignificant part of the solution to the question of border security. \nYet here we go. There is nearly 700 miles of fencing in this \nlegislation by virtue of this amendment that will be considered. Oh, \nno, no, no, no. We do not want a fence.\n  Then we have heard that having greater Border Patrol agents at the \nborder would dramatically help us achieve border security. Well, this \namendment doubles--doubles--the amount of Border Patrol agents at the \nborder. It brings it from about 21,000 to 40,000, 41,000 Border Patrol \nagents through the course of this legislation. Now we hear: That is \njust wasting money.\n  Well, what is your plan? I have heard all of these things that this \namendment includes that were part of your plan in the past. But because \nit is not your amendment, even though it is offered by Members on your \nside of the aisle, including from border States, suddenly it is not \nacceptable. Suddenly it is not acceptable.\n  There is the suggestion that there is somehow a backroom deal. I see \nthis amendment as the personification of what the American people are \ntrying to see this body do, which is Republicans and Democrats from \ndifferent parts of the country, from different ideological views, \ncoming together in order to compromise, in this case to seek a very \nstrong compromise on border security as part of comprehensive \nimmigration reform legislation, which in poll after poll across the \nparty spectrum has been sought by the people in this country.\n  That is the essence of what this amendment is all about. So if you \nbemoan the lack of bipartisanship, then you should not be bemoaning \nthis amendment because this amendment is, in fact, the essence of that \nbipartisanship and moves us in a direction on border security that I do \nnot believe has existed in any legislative proposal that has come \nbefore the Senate. It is an incredible movement toward border security, \nand it becomes one of several triggers.\n  What do we mean by a trigger? A condition precedent. We believe these \ncondition precedents can be met because at the end of the day we want \nto achieve greater security for our country both at the border and in \nentrance-exit visa issues and interior enforcement issues and in \nworkplace verification, with the E-Verify system. All of these elements \nare in the legislation. All of them. And many of them are enhanced so \nthat we can get to where we want.\n  Now the problem is that there are colleagues here who, if 10 angels \ncame swearing from above in the heavens that this is the best \nlegislation to secure the Nation, to promote its economic opportunity, \nto make sure we have and preserve family reunification as a core value, \nthat we have the future flow of workers so that we can deal with the \nabilities of different sectors of our economy to have the human capital \nlike the high-tech industry, to be able to produce that human capital \nso that America can continue to be at the apex of the curve of \nintellect and globally competitive, they would say: No, these angels \nlied. We will never satisfy those individuals.\n\n  I respect their right to have that view. But to suggest that it is \nthe process, when really what they want to see is no comprehensive \nimmigration reform, I think they should say what they really believe. \nSo that is what is before us.\n  Finally, on a series of issues that have been raised, for example, on \nwaivers, the reality is the limited waivers do not give anyone a free \npass or take away the government's ability to say no to any given \nindividuals. They do not grant unlimited discretion to decisionmakers. \nDecisionmakers would not be able to exercise discretion in cases \ninvolving immigrants who have multiple criminal convictions, who have \ncommitted particularly serious offenses or otherwise pose a threat to \nnational security or public safety. Those restrictions, by way of \nexample, apply to terrorists, gang participants, drug traffickers, \nhuman traffickers, money launderers, international child abductors, \nunlawful voters, just to name a few. So I think there is a \nmischaracterization in order to create the fear.\n  Finally, they will question that no matter what, no matter what is \ndone in this bill, no matter how many enforcement provisions exist--\ninterior enforcement, an entrance-exit visa requirement, and systems to \ncheck that whoever comes in this country, make sure they exit and that \nthere is a follow-up in the E-Verify system, which means everyone in \nthe country, when they go for a job, now they are going to have to go \nto a system to make sure they, in fact, have the right to work in this \ncountry; all of the Border Patrol agents, all of the fencing--despite \nall of that, there are those--and that the individual who is \nundocumented in the country will have to wait a decade--a decade--\nbefore they will even have the opportunity to adjust their status to \npermanent residency, assuming, as the legislation calls for, all of \nthese elements I have just talked about are in place--are in place--who \nsuggest that that is amnesty.\n  Amnesty means you do something wrong and you get forgiven. But you do \nnot have to do anything to be forgiven, you just get forgiven. This is \nnot amnesty. These individuals have to come forth, they have to \nregister with the government, which is incredibly important because I \ncannot secure America unless I know who is here to pursue the American \ndream versus who may be here to do it harm. We have millions of people \nin the shadows, undocumented. We do not know what their purpose is.\n  Then, after they come forward and register with the government, they \nhave to go through a criminal background check. If they fail it, they \nget deported. If they pass it, then they get a temporary opportunity to \nstay here with a permit to work and visit their families.\n  They have to earn their way, pay their taxes, learn English over the \ncourse of a decade, and then, finally,\n\n[[Page S5005]]\n\nafter a course of a decade, finally be eligible when all of those \nconditions have been met. That is not amnesty; that is earned. That is \nearned opportunity toward legalizing their status in this country.\n  So this is what poll after poll of Americans say they want to fix \nthis broken immigration system. For some of my friends, there will \nnever be a fix sufficient for their view. For some of my friends, it is \nvery clear they do not support any pathway to citizenship under any set \nof circumstances. That is a view they have the right to hold, but it is \na view not supported by the American people. It is a view that does not \nhonor our Nation, which has a history of immigrants. It is a view that \nhas created enormous problems in Europe because immigrants in those \nrespective countries never find a way to earn their way to become a \ncitizen of that country, and you have seen the unrest in those \ncountries. We do not want that in America.\n  I intend to vote for cloture for the bipartisan amendment. It does a \nlot that I think in many respects goes way beyond what I contemplated. \nThat is the essence of compromise. It is the essence of moving forward. \nIt is the essence of solving a problem that has vexed us way too long. \nIt is an opportunity to fix our broken immigration system.\n  I urge my colleagues to cast their votes and be not only on the right \nside of what is necessary for the country, but be on the right side of \nhistory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, there is first a matter of fairness when \nit comes to offering suggestions to amend legislation that is on the \nSenate floor. Under the ordinary practices and procedures of the \nSenate, the majority and the minority have an opportunity to offer \namendments to modify the underlying bill. On a subject as important and \nas fundamental to who we are as a country and to our country's future \nas immigration reform, there have been nine amendments voted on in this \nbill in the last 2 weeks--nine amendments.\n  To listen to my colleagues in the majority who are happy with the \nunderlying bill because they wrote it, they act as if we have had a \nfulsome opportunity to offer amendments. We have been willing to have \nvotes as long as we get votes on our amendments. It is not just the \nmajority that has the opportunity to modify the underlying legislation \nand to debate it, the minority has rights too. Our side wants a right \nto choose our own amendments, not to have the majority leader choose \nwhich of our amendments he is going to deign to allow debate and votes \non. That is not democracy. That is not the Senate. That is a \ndictatorship.\n  We will not allow the majority to tell us which of our amendments \nwill be allowed to be considered. We can have votes on any amendments \nthe other side wants a vote on. We are ready, and we have been all \nalong. It is not true to say that the minority has been blocking \namendments to this bill. That makes no sense whatsoever. The majority \nwrote the bill.\n  The minority has all the incentives to offer amendments. Why in the \nworld would we block our own amendments, but for the fact that the \nmajority leader wants to choose which of those amendments he will \nsomehow allow us to offer. It makes no sense whatsoever. I have heard \nsome suggest that this is a minor vote we are going to have at 5:30, \nthat there are just modifications to the underlying bill.\n  This is the amendment we will vote on. It was released late Friday \nevening, and we have been poring over line by detail ever since. This \nis not a minor matter; this is a serious amendment. The Schumer-Corker-\nHoeven amendment makes enormous changes in the underlying bill. I wish \nto talk about some of those changes.\n  Back when this underlying bill was proffered, the framework for it \nwas proffered by the so-called Gang of 8, Senator Durbin, the \ndistinguished minority whip from Illinois, said in 2013 a pathway to \ncitizenship needs to be ``contingent upon securing the border.'' That \nwas the bipartisan framework for comprehensive immigration reform in \nJanuary 2013.\n  Six months later we find a different story. He says: ``We have de-\nlinked a pathway to citizenship and border enforcement.'' He was quoted \nin the National Journal on June 11, 2013. He has not suggested since \nthat time that it was taken out of context or a misquote.\n  What it demonstrates is how far we have come from what was promised 6 \nmonths ago and is now being delivered. I believe the American people \nare enormously generous and compassionate. There are circumstances \nunder which the majority of Americans would say we believe people who \nhave entered our country without complying with our immigration laws or \nwho have entered legally and overstayed, the so-called visa overstays, \nwe believe they should get a second chance--but not by demanding a \npathway to citizenship and delinking it from border security and other \nimportant measures that will make sure we don't repeat the mistakes of \n1996.\n  When Ronald Reagan signed an amnesty for 3 million people, the \nAmerican people were told this will never happen again because we are \ngoing to enforce the law this time. It didn't happen, and the American \npeople were justifiably skeptical as to whether it will happen again, \nparticularly when this sort of sleight of hand takes place where we are \ntold in January the pathway to citizenship is ``contingent upon \nsecuring the border,'' only to find out 6 months later it has been \ndelinked.\n  If Congress can't keep a 6-month-old promise, it is never going to be \nable to keep any of the promises contained in this amendment.\n  For starters, this underlying bill relies upon the same sort of \nbudgetary gimmicks that were used to pass the Affordable Care Act, now \nknown colloquially as ObamaCare. We have been told in the underlying \nbill that it reduces the Federal deficit by $197 billion over 10 years. \nI have even heard some of my Republican colleagues cite that as if this \nis somehow free money: Hey, we can spend this money because the \nunderlying bill reduces the Federal deficit by $197 billion.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has pointed out that the only way we \ncan view that as free money--which is an oxymoron if there ever was \none--is by double counting the $211 billion in off-budget revenue that \nwill be needed to fund Social Security for the newly legalized \nimmigrants. In other words, this is money they are going to pay into \nSocial Security that they are going to eventually take out. To act like \nyou can use it to pay their Social Security benefits and at the same \ntime use it to fund this bill is double counting.\n  That is a budget gimmick. That is the same sort of gimmickry that has \ngotten us $17 trillion in debt, and it is perpetuated under this bill.\n  If we were to use real-world accounting, the same sort of accounting \nevery family, every small business in America has to use, they can't \ndouble count the money. They have to use real hard numbers. If we use \nthe same sort of accounting that families and small businesses across \nAmerica have to use day in and day out, we will find that the \nunderlying bill actually increases the budget deficit by more than $14 \nbillion over the next decade. This is spending more money we don't \nhave, adding to our annual deficit, adding to our national debt, \nputting us further and further in the hole when it comes to our fiscal \ncondition.\n  One of the other problems is that even since the Congressional Budget \nOffice looked at the underlying bill, we don't yet have an official \ncost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office for this bill that \nbasically rewrote the entire underlying bill. We still don't have an \nofficial budget estimate from the Congressional Budget Office, and we \ndon't know when that is likely to come. Yet we are going to be required \nby the majority leader, because he is the one who sets the schedule \nhere by virtue of his being the majority leader, we are going to be \nrequired to vote on a cloture motion at 5:30 this evening, in about an \nhour--before we even know from the official scorekeeper for the \nCongress and the Federal Government exactly how much this costs, what \nthe assumptions are, and whether we are still going to be looking at \ndouble counting the revenue that is coming in and looking to that to \npay for the costs of this bill at the same time we are going to have to \npay it out in benefits--double counting. We don't know if that \ncontinues under this bill, but I dare guess that it will.\n\n[[Page S5006]]\n\n  Some of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle previously \nexpressed real consternation at double counting back when ObamaCare was \npassed and back during the 2009 stimulus package. Some of them issued \npress releases saying: You can't spend the same money twice. Yet today \nhere we go again. This is another reason I am so concerned about where \nwe find ourselves: being jammed into voting on this piece of \nlegislation without an official score of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, before, I daresay, every Member has had a chance to read it and \nunderstand it, and when it relies on double counting and other gimmicks \nthat have gotten us $17 trillion in debt.\n  I also worry that my colleagues who support this particular \namendment, while I stipulate to their good intentions, their approach \nis one based solely on throwing more money at the problem without \nhaving any plan, strategy, or any real mechanism for ensuring that \nmoney is spent sensibly, and it accomplishes the stated goal.\n  Last week some of my colleagues gave me a hard time because I offered \nan amendment which would raise the number of the Border Patrol agents \nby 5,000. They said: We can't afford it. The underlying bill has zero \nnew Border Patrol.\n  My amendment offered 5,000 additional boots on the ground. They said: \nWe can't afford it. That is a ridiculous suggestion.\n  Imagine my surprise when this amendment that was filed so recently \ncalls for 20,000 Border Patrol agents. This is a fourfold increase, \neven though experts across the political spectrum have said that \ndoubling the size of the Border Patrol in and of itself, while it may \nprovide some political figleaf for voting for this bill, does not and \nwill not solve the problem.\n  I wish to know, for example, where that number came from. How did my \ncolleagues turn on a dime from saying we needed zero additional Border \nPatrol, to saying 5,000 was a ridiculous suggestion, and are now saying \n20,000 is exactly right? What expert, at what hearing was the testimony \noffered to support that sort of expense and that sort of approach?\n  Don't just take my word for it. There was a story in the Arizona \nRepublic, dated June 22, quoting a number of experts on immigration and \nborder security. Doris Meissner, who used to be the head of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, the predecessor to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, called the approach in this amendment \n``detached from the reality on the ground.'' She said it is ``detached \nfrom the reality on the ground'' and said it would make more sense to \ninvest in creating ``a modern 21st century border, which includes \nenforcement but also trade and travel and facilitating crossing and \nreducing waiting time.''\n  This makes more sense to me because part of the underlying premise \nfor the bill was to create a legal way for people to come, work, \nimmigrate to the United States, and then allow law enforcement focus on \nthe criminality, the drug traffickers, the human traffickers, and other \npeople engaged in illegal conduct.\n  Ms. Meissner appears to be saying that makes a lot of sense when it \ncomes to ``a modern 21st century border.''\n  Other experts have said and quoted in the same article in the Arizona \nRepublic, June 20, Adam Isacson: ``There may be some room for more \nagents, but not for 20,000.''\n  John Whitley said: ``We should look at what we are trying to \nachieve--at the outputs instead of the inputs.''\n  In other words, what this approach does is say we are going to look \nat all the equipment we can buy, the technology we can deploy, the \nboots on the ground, but we are going to turn a blind eye to the \noutputs or the goals that we are presumably trying to achieve. Mr. \nWhitley agreed with that. He said:\n\n       We should look at what we are trying to achieve--at the \n     outputs instead of the inputs. Otherwise, seven years from \n     now we'll be sitting around saying we don't know which bits \n     work and which bits are wasteful.\n\n  I know some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle--Senator \nLeahy, for example, who is managing the bill for the majority, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, said it looks like a laundry list \nfor defense contractors. I think I am paraphrasing correctly. Then he \nsaid: If that is what it is going to take to get them to vote for the \nbill, then I am for it. I am going to support it.\n  Once again, the underlying bill puts symbolism over substance, and \nthey are hoping the American people will not notice. As I have said \nrepeatedly, the so-called border security triggers in the underlying \nbill are sheer fantasy and wishful thinking because they are activated \nby promises of more money and more promises than they are on actual \nresults. I am afraid the underlying Schumer-Hoeven-Corker amendment \ndoes nothing to change that.\n\n  Here is a comparison of the approach under the underlying Gang of 8 \nproposal, the Corker-Hoeven-Schumer amendment, and an amendment I \noffered last week which was tabled. We have the question, Is \noperational control of the border required? Under the Gang of 8 bill? \nNo. This amendment? There is no requirement.\n  Under the amendment I offered last week, an individual would not be \nable to transition from probationary status to legal permanent \nresidency until that happened. That is not to punish anybody, but what \nit does is it realigns all the incentives for everybody involved in \nthis discussion, whether Democratic or Republican or Independent, \nwhether conservative or liberal or whatever. It would have realigned \nall the incentives to make sure we would have hit this target of \noperational control of the border.\n  Is 100 percent situational awareness required? Not under the Gang of \n8 bill. Not under this amendment. There would have been under my \namendment of last week.\n  A biometric exit trigger. There is none under the Gang of 8 bill and \nnone under this amendment.\n  Here is perhaps one of the best and most obvious reasons why people \ndon't trust promises of future performance when it comes to Congress--\nbecause 17 years ago Bill Clinton signed into law a requirement for a \nbiometric entry-exit system. Now, ``biometric'' is a big word. It could \nmean just fingerprints or an iris scan or facial recognition, but it is \nsomething you can't cheat on because it depends on a bodily \ncharacteristic that is immutable and cannot be changed, such as \nfingerprints.\n  So it was 17 years ago when President Clinton signed the law which \nCongress passed, a biometric entry-exit requirement, and it still \nhasn't been implemented. And while people think that mainly illegal \nimmigration is caused by people entering the country across our \nborders, such as the 1,200-mile Texas-Mexico border, the fact is that \n40 percent of illegal immigration occurs because people come in legally \nand overstay their visa, and they simply melt into the great American \nlandscape. Unless they commit a crime or otherwise come in contact with \nlaw enforcement, we never find them again.\n  Here is the other problem in the underlying bill. Even if these \nrequirements required results rather than promises of performance, \nunfortunately, under the underlying bill and now again in this \namendment we are going to vote on at 5:30 today, the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has the unilateral discretion and \nauthority to waive all of those requirements. This is the same person \nwho said the border is secure even though the General Accounting Office \nsaid in 2011 only 45 percent of the border was under operational \ncontrol. She may well be the only person in America--the only person in \nAmerica--who believes the border is under control because it \ndemonstrably is not. Yet she is given the authority to waive these \nrequirements in this amendment we will vote on at 5:30.\n  Then there is this: Under the underlying bill an individual can beat \ntheir spouse or their partner, they can drive drunk and threaten the \nlives and livelihoods of American citizens, and they can still qualify \nfor RPI status and get on a pathway to citizenship. As a matter of \nfact, under this underlying bill they could actually have already been \ndeported, having committed a misdemeanor, and still be eligible to \nreenter the country and become the beneficiary of RPI status and put \neventually on a pathway to citizenship. That is a terrible mistake. I \ndon't know anybody who believes we ought to be taking people who have \nshown such contempt for the rule of law and the health and safety and \nwelfare of the\n\n[[Page S5007]]\n\nAmerican people and say: You know what, out of the generosity of our \nhearts, we are going to give you one of the greatest gifts anyone could \never get; that is, an opportunity to become an American citizen.\n  I would hope most of us in this Chamber would agree that immigrants \nwith multiple drunk driving or domestic violence convictions should \nnever be eligible for legalization, especially after they have already \nbeen deported. Yet the underlying bill, the so-called Gang of 8 bill, \nand the Schumer-Hoeven-Corker amendment will grant immediate legal \nstatus to criminals, including those already deported, as I said, and \nincluding people who have committed domestic violence, even with a \ndeadly weapon. I still can't quite get my mind around that, but it is \ntrue.\n  Our standards when it comes to granting legal status to people who \nhave come into our country in violation of our immigration laws and/or \nwho have come in legally and overstayed should be crystal clear. We \nshould differentiate between people who have made a mistake and are \nwilling to pay for it--pay a fine, be put on probation, and \nsuccessfully complete that probation--and people who have come in and \nshown such contempt for our laws and the rule of law as to have engaged \nin a history of drunk driving or domestic violence. They should be \nautomatically disqualified from receiving probationary status. I find \nit remarkable that we are even debating this issue in the first place.\n  A few final points. We are going to be asked to vote on legislation \nthat was crafted behind closed doors, with no chance for amendments. As \na matter of fact, I believe that once the majority leader gets cloture \non this amendment, we will have virtually no other opportunities to \noffer any additional amendments and get votes on those amendments after \nonly having votes on nine amendments so far. That is an outrage. We are \ngoing to be asked to vote on legislation filled with special interest \ngoodies, with earmarks and pet spending projects, and we still don't \nhave an official cost estimate by the Congressional Budget Office. We \nare being asked to vote for legislation that will continue the three-\ndecade pattern of broken promises on border security. In short, we are \nbeing asked to vote for more of the same.\n  I know my good friend from Tennessee Senator Corker has been one of \nthe best new additions to the Senate. He has remarkable knowledge and \nexperience and great enthusiasm.\n  He asked me: What more do you want than 20,000 Border Patrol agents \nand a commitment to spend all these billions of dollars on new \nequipment? What more could you possibly want?\n  My answer to that is this: I would like to know that the promises we \nare making in terms of border security, interior enforcement, and visa \noverstays are going to be kept; otherwise, all we will have is 11 \nmillion people granted probationary status, with the potential \neventually to earn legal permanent residency and American citizenship. \nAnd those people who might be willing to consider that sort of \narrangement if they had a guarantee that we would not be back here \ndoing this same thing again in 5 or 10 years are going to have nothing \nbut a bunch of broken promises to show for it.\n  For me, it is a very sad episode in a very important Senate debate \nthat has huge ramifications for the future of our country. At the start \nof this debate, I had high hopes that the Gang of 8 was serious about \nkeeping promises and delivering real bipartisan immigration reform that \ncould pass the House of Representatives. But now I see it is just the \nsame old beltway song and dance. What a shame. What a lost opportunity \nthat is.\n\n  Now I believe all eyes and attention will turn to the House of \nRepresentatives, where I hope the House of Representatives will take a \nmore careful, step-by-step approach in addressing our broken \nimmigration system. My hope is that ultimately we will get to a \nconference committee that will fix the underlying approach and problems \nin this amendment and in this bill and will allow us to successfully \naddress our broken immigration system that serves no one's best \ninterests.\n  I am not one who believes ``no'' should be the final answer when it \ncomes to our broken immigration system. I actually believe we need to \nfix it, and we need an immigration system that reflects our values and \nreflects the needs of our growing economy in a globally competitive \nenvironment, but this bill is not it.\n  There will be no way to enforce the promises that are so readily made \ntoday in the future. Notwithstanding the best intentions of the people \nwho offer this amendment, many of us won't be here 10 years from now. \nNo Congress can bind a future Congress. No President can bind a future \nPresident. And if we are depending for the next 3\\1/2\\ years on Janet \nNapolitano, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and President Obama to \nenforce the mechanisms in this bill, I am afraid we are going to be \nsorely disappointed. And how can we possibly know what the next \nPresident and future Congresses will ultimately do? That is why it is \nso critical, if we are going to keep faith with the American people, to \nhave a mechanism in this bill that will force all of us across the \npolitical spectrum to do everything we possibly can to make sure those \npromises are kept. And it is not in this amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of my \ncolleague from Texas and his earnest desire to confront the problems in \nfront of us. I would say at the outset that the recognition over the \nlast 8\\1/2\\ to 9 years of being in the Senate is that we have a problem \nwe need to solve, and I don't think anybody disagrees with that, but I \nthink there are two important points to which the American people \nexpect us to pay attention. One is what Reagan described as the shining \ncity on a hill and that people coming here make us better. There is no \nquestion about that. What he wanted in 1986 was not all walls, as some \npeople wanted, not all doors, as some people wanted, but a wall with \ndoors.\n  So there are two basic facts that confront us. One is that the rule \nof law is the glue that holds us together. And when we hear talk about \nthe American people having confidence as to whether we are going to \nenforce the rule of law, whether it is on immigration or anything, the \nvery fact is that fabric which is holding this Nation together is being \nstretched very thin right now, and the last thing we should do in an \nimmigration bill is to stretch that fabric further in terms of the \nconfidence of the American people and in terms of the rule of law.\n  This bill and this amendment is full of holes all throughout as far \nas the rule of law is concerned. My colleague from Texas outlined some \nof that. He also outlined the capability of the waiver--waiving the \nborder fence, waving the requirements for RPI status. It is all \nwritten, but it is written so that the Secretary of Homeland Security \ncan waive almost every portion of it. So that is not the rule of law, \nthat is the rule of rulers and whatever the rulers decide.\n  One of my great disappointments in the Senate is that we too often \ndon't follow regular order. This bill was put together. It did go \nthrough the Judiciary Committee, but not once did it come through the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Homeland \nSecurity, where Border Patrol, where ICE, USIS--where all the \nimplementation of anything that is in this bill will take place; where, \nby the way, all the knowledge, all the experience of all the members on \nthat committee for the last 10 or 12 years, with the exception of \nSenator McCain, was not utilized in putting this bill together. So what \nwe have is some very good effort and well-intentioned effort by a lot \nof people to do some things, but let me outline where they have it \nwrong.\n  The National Association of Former Border Patrol Officers wrote a \nletter denying the fact that we need 20,000 additional Border Patrol \nagents. Here are the people who know. How stupid is this?\n  What we are doing is throwing money and hoping it will stick on a \nwall and that we can convince our colleagues we have a border security \nplan when, in fact, there is no border security plan in the United \nStates today. How do I know there is no plan? Because 2 weeks ago I had \nbreakfast with Secretary Napolitano, and I asked her to send--and she \nsaid she would--sector by sector, a border plan for the United\n\n[[Page S5008]]\n\nStates, and I got a 2-page letter that had nothing in it.\n  This isn't a new border plan. This isn't a specific border plan. The \ncountry doesn't have one right now, so we have put this together, \noutside of the regular order, well-intentioned people trying to solve a \nproblem to assure the American people that in fact we are going to \nsecure our borders.\n  I will readily admit to you that if I lived in the poverty of some of \nthe Central American nations that I would make every effort on my part \nto get here--legally or illegally--because the opportunity is here, \nthat opportunity to improve yourself, that opportunity to work hard, \nthat opportunity to live in a Nation that has a justice system where \nthe rule of law reigns supreme. If I were from one of the Central \nAmerican countries and came here, the very irony would be the fact that \nI am going to break the law that is the very nurturing thing that gives \nthe opportunity to advance for me and my family.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nthe National Association of Former Border Patrol Officers.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                Former Border Patrol Officers,\n\n                                     Brunswick, GA, June 21, 2013.\n       The National Association of Former Border Patrol Officers \n     believe that the Information contained in their CIER Proposal \n     for Immigration Reform is a much better path to border \n     security than any other being discussed.\n       Just putting more Border Patrol Agents on the border would \n     be a huge waste of resources and do nothing to solve the real \n     problems of Illegal Immigration.\n       We believe that there are a sufficient number of Border \n     Patrol Agents currently on the border. The real question is \n     how many ICE Agents will need to be trained and put in place \n     to handle the sheer volume of Criminal Aliens currently \n     present in the United States. The issue being concealed by \n     the press and Congress is the clear and present danger \n     criminal aliens pose to the American people. Anything \n     resembling amnesty or a path to citizenship at this point in \n     time will ensure further endangerment of the American family \n     unit which is the foundation of American society, by enabling \n     the following type of aliens to remain in the United States:\n       (http://www.timesdaily.com/news/local/\narticle_989a9996-d4a2-11e2-a29c-10604b9f6eda.html)\n       (http://www.immigration911.org/news/2012/01/illegal-alien-\nrapes-and-murders-one-month-old-baby-in-nm/)\n       (http://www.alipac.us/content/illegal-alien-raped-killed-9-\nmonth-old-girl-california\n-1916/).\n       Real border security must begin with effective interior \n     enforcement in every jurisdiction in all fifty states. \n     Achieving real border security requires aggressive expansion \n     of 287(g) authority, closing down sanctuary cities, fair and \n     universal employer sanctions and denial of other benefits \n     such as welfare, public housing, and granting of \n     identification that would enable the criminal element to \n     continue concealing their presence in our communities to \n     include driver's licenses.\n       For years the illegal aliens being apprehended by \n     percentages ranging from 17-30 percent already have criminal \n     records inside the United States. A significant percentage of \n     these illegal aliens are violent criminals and the number \n     requiring further prosecution prior to removal may exceed \n     three million. Moreover, at this point in time the illegal \n     drug and illegal alien situation in America has spread to \n     over 2000, American cities and those engaged in both of these \n     criminal activities are virtually inseparable. This threat to \n     Public Safety must be addressed first and in that process \n     there is a reasonable likelihood that potential terrorists \n     will also be identified and removed or incarcerated. They \n     live among us.\n       The second step can be discussed when the Public Safety of \n     Americans has been assured.\n\n                                                  Zack Taylor,\n\n                                 Chairman, National Association of\n                                   Former, Border Patrol Officers.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Now, what has Senator Cornyn outlined that does not fit \nwith common sense? He said people who commit three misdemeanors, \nwhether it be child abuse or spousal abuse or drunk driving, shouldn't \nbe given RPI status. Yet, under this bill you can do that. And for \nthose who are not familiar with courts of law, it is on the date. So if \nyou got two on one date, that only counts as one. Theoretically, you \ncould have 10 or 12 misdemeanors and still qualify for RPI status. How \ndoes that fit with the rule of law? How does that fit with the glue \nthat holds us together? What that does is flaunt the rule of law.\n  The other thing that I think is very problematic in this bill is we \nhave 20,000 Border Patrol agents but no increase in ICE agents, no \nincrease in USCIS, who are the very people who are going to have to \nhandle the 11 million people here who are going to progress to RPI \nstatus. So where is the money to handle the 11 million additional \npeople for ICE and USCIS? It is not in there.\n  If in fact we want the rule of law to work, then we want the people \nwho qualify under this bill for RPI status to do so under the rule of \nlaw, which means you have to investigate and do a background check, and \nmake sure the documentation establishes them being here before December \n31 of 2011; that in fact they do have residence here, that in fact they \nhave worked here, and that has to be worked on. That can't just be a \nblanket. Because the opportunists will take advantage of that system. \nIf in fact there are no ICE agents and there are no USCIS agents to \nactually handle that, that means everything that has been set up in \nthis bill will happen without an investigation, without knowledge that \nit is true and, in fact, people qualify for RPI status.\n  The other side of the bill Senator Cornyn made a point about which I \nwish to expand upon is the fact we are not going to have an entry and \nexit visa system because 80 percent of the people go through the land \nports, and this bill exempts those land ports totally from that.\n  You heard Senator Cornyn talk about 40 percent, maybe even 50 percent \nof the people who are here illegally today came here legally, with a \nvisa. They qualified for a visa, and they overstayed their visa. If in \nfact we have no internal enforcement, no ICE agents to enforce the visa \noverstays, we won't change that. The CBO even said you are going to \nhave 7.5 million new illegals--undocumented--come across under this \nbill. If you have no internal enforcement, there is no way to drive \nthat number down. Yet this bill puts the resources in the wrong place.\n  You control a border by controlling what the situation is on the \nborder, depending on location, geography, topography, and assets. So \nthrowing 41,000 Border Patrol agents across our southern border might \nwork, but it is a tremendous waste of resources. It might be a jobs \nprogram.\n  The fact is it takes a combination of technology, fencing, Border \nPatrol, and the right combination for wherever we are talking about to \nbe effective in operational control of the border. But that is not even \na part of the bill. It is not part of the bill to have operational \ncontrol of the border with a 90-percent effective rate. One of the \nreasons we can't get there--which is one of the things Americans want \nto see us promise in this bill--is because our control of the border \ntoday is somewhere between 40 and 65 percent. That is opposite of what \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security will tell you, but that is what the \nstudies outside of government say when they go to interview those \nundocumented workers who are here today. They did a very thorough \nanalysis of that and said we are somewhere between 40 and 65 percent.\n  So the basis of allowing undocumented workers and those who are in \nour country who can contribute greatly to our country, the basis of \nputting them on some type of status to move toward a green card status \nand ultimately citizenship has to be based on some real facts.\n  Why would somebody not agree to 90-percent control of the border? The \nonly reason they would not agree to it is they don't think it is \nachievable. The only reason it is not achievable is because we don't \nhave the political will to do it. It is technically achievable. You \ncan't get to 100 percent, but with good leadership, good sector-by-\nsector planning, good internal enforcement, and great legal immigration \nso you decrease the illegal, we could get there. Why is that not part \nof this bill? It is because the rule of law does not reign supreme in \nthe Senate.\n  Let me make a couple other points. One of the big holes in this bill \nin section 1202 says the following: The Secretary shall initiate \nremoval proceedings in accordance with chapter 4 of title II of the \nImmigration Nationality Act, 8 USC 1221; two, confirm that immigration \nrelief or protection has been granted or is pending or otherwise close \nto 90 percent of the cases of immigrants who were admitted to the \nUnited States as nonimmigrants, et cetera.\n  All that means is she can waive the requirements under the bill. She \ncan\n\n[[Page S5009]]\n\nwaive the fence. All throughout this bill we are letting a nonelected \nindividual have the power to undermine every aspect of any tooth in \nthis bill.\n  When the immigration debate started, my hope was that we would do the \nprinciple most Americans want us to do, which is we need to solve the \nproblem of the undocumented in this country. We need to bring them out \nof the shadows. But the price to do that is cogent and realistic \ncontrol of our borders.\n  Let me make a point. If in fact you don't have cogent and realistic \ncontrol of your borders and you do everything else in this bill and \neverything works as the authors want it to work, guess who is going to \nbe coming across the border. The very people we actually don't want \nhere: the drug runners, the human smugglers, the criminals, the \nterrorists.\n  So when I say 90-percent operational control of the border and I am \nin Oklahoma, people look at me with askance. They say, Well, that means \n10 percent of the people are still coming. And guess what makes up that \n10 percent. The worst of what tries to get into this country.\n\n  So it is not just about getting a border security plan to secure our \nborder, it is about limiting access of the criminals and the terrorists \nand the worst from coming into our country. This bill is going to allow \nthat to continue. It is not going to stop that. It will continue.\n  To Senator Cornyn's point, what we need is to take this out of the \npolitical arena. We need to make it so the pressure is that we do what \nis best for America, and one which is best for America is having a lot \nmore people come here and contribute to our melting pot. There is no \nquestion about that. But we have to have it where it cannot be \nmanipulated by whoever is in charge for political benefit. That is why \nthe Cornyn plan is novel in terms of actually solving the problem.\n  I am not going to be here much longer, less than 3\\1/2\\ years, but I \ncan already predict what is going to happen if this piece of \nlegislation comes through: My daughters and their husbands 15 years \nfrom now are going to be listening to the same debate on the Senate \nfloor.\n  The biggest deficit the Senate has, in my mind, is failure to put \nteeth into what they know will actually fix the problems in this \ncountry. This bill has no teeth. This bill has $48 billion thrown up \nagainst the wall to buy the votes to say we are going to have a secure \nborder when in fact we are not.\n  That doesn't mean we can't get a secure border. I worked for 2 weeks \nwith my staff. I told Senator Schumer from New York I would love to try \nto do that, but in 2 weeks you can't do it. What you have done, you \nhaven't done it either, and you have done it from a deficit of \nknowledge rather than using knowledge. You didn't use any of the \nsignificant historical staff on the committee of jurisdiction to help \nwrite this legislation. The institutional knowledge is not in it. It \nwill not succeed.\n  I don't know ultimately how I will vote on this amendment, but I am \ncertainly not going to vote to proceed to this until we have had a \nchance--more than 72 hours--to actually work through and be able to \nascertain and also share the flaws in the approach.\n  For a third of that amount of money you could easily secure the \nborder, and we are going to spend $48 billion. And in there is another \njobs program adding to the 102 we have now, at $1.5 billion. GAO has \nalready said we need to redo our jobs program. Well, we have. We have \nan earmark for another youth jobs program, and we won't even fix the \nyouth jobs programs we have now.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, what is the status of the time that \nremains for each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents of the measure retain 25 \nminutes; opponents have 7 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Corker-\nHoeven amendment. I have listened carefully to those who are opposed \nwho have come to the floor today and Friday, and I have come to one \nconclusion: They won't take yes for an answer.\n  Most of the criticism that has come at this amendment is it does too \nmuch for the border. Even some of my colleagues who are opposed say it \ndoes too much, even though they proposed similar things themselves.\n  My good friend from Texas says we don't need more border agents but \nhad proposed 5,000 himself. My good friend from Texas also said, well, \nwe need technology, but there was no technology in his bill. My dear \nfriend Senator Coburn, whom I very much like and admire, first says we \nneed money for ICE agents, not Border Patrol. But ICE is funded to \ndeport about 400,000 people a year. Most of the 11 million will become \ncitizens and not be deported. We have more than enough ICE agents to \ndeal with the much smaller number who will be here illegally, certainly \nin the beginning and throughout the bill.\n\n  Dr. Coburn said we don't have more money for U.S. CIS agents. We do--\n$3.6 billion more.\n  Finally, Dr. Coburn talks about the trigger. Let's face it, for many \non the other side the No. 1 priority is securing the border. For many \non our side the No. 1 priority is achieving a path to citizenship. The \nbill proposed by the Gang of 8, we believe, did both. But, certainly, \nthere were many on the other side who thought the amount we were \nputting into border security was not enough, was not adequate, so we \nwere willing to augment that in the Corker-Hoeven amendment, which I am \ngoing to talk about in a minute.\n  Certainly, what we do not want to do is choose one in place of the \nother. The problem with the 90 percent, which Senator Cornyn proposed, \nwas that under many different types of scenarios and circumstances--an \nact of God, an administration that was decidedly against a path to \ncitizenship and counted things differently or held up the count--we \ncould envision no path to citizenship. That was out of the question for \nus.\n  What we tried to do is say we can have both. We also said we are \ngoing to do border security first. But what we made sure of in the \ntriggers--and there are five triggers now with the amendment in this \nproposal. We make sure the triggers could not be used deliberately by \nsomebody who was opposed to the path to citizenship as a way to block \nthem--whether that be a Congress or a President or somebody in the \nadministration.\n  So we have come up with the right compromise. We have not split the \nbaby in half, which is what Senator Cornyn and, I gather, Senator \nCoburn want to do. We have had both. We have satisfied those who are \nfor border security and those who are for a path to citizenship, and \nonly when we satisfy both will we get a bill. We cannot do it with one \nand not the other. So let me go over the border security part and why \nit will work.\n  First, to say the experts were not consulted, as my good friend from \nOklahoma said, is not fair, particularly to Senators McCain and Flake, \nwho are probably greater experts on what is needed at the border than \nany of us. They may not be chair or ranking member of the committee--\nalthough I believe Senator McCain is on that committee--but they live \non that border. And, to boot, Senator McCain has tremendous military \nexperience in terms of surveillance.\n  What we have done is looked at each sector. There are nine. They are \ndifferent. The sector of the Senator from Texas has a river and has \nprivate property that goes right up to the edge of the river. It would \ntake 30 years to build a fence on that side of the property because we \nwould need eminent domain, and I am sure there are some ranchers who \nwould say: I don't want a fence on my side, right by the river. That is \nwhere my cattle come to graze and drink.\n  There are parts of the Arizona sector that are heavily populated \nwhere a strong fence is needed, and there are parts that are so rugged \nthat have no roads that a fence would be a waste of money.\n  Our bill relies on different approaches in each of the nine sectors. \nBut the best approach did not just come out of the air. That came with \nSenator McCain sitting down, working with Senators Hoeven and Corker, \nbut also working with the Department of Homeland Security as well as \nthose who work in the Border Patrol as to what is needed. That is in \nthe bill.\n  We heard the objection from others that they do not trust DHS, either \nthis one or a new one, to implement what is needed. So it is in the \namendment.\n\n[[Page S5010]]\n\n  Why do we need so many men and women on the border? Let me explain. \nOur American people demand that we make the border airtight. That is \nwhy some have proposed a 2,200-mile fence, double. That is what they \nwanted. The cost would be--I think it might go to the hundreds of \nbillions, but it also would not work in many areas for the reasons I \nmentioned. But they want it airtight. So here is what we have: We have \nadequate eyes in the sky, whether it be drones or airplanes. So every \nperson, every single person, 100 percent observability, 100 percent \nsituational awareness is what it is called. Any single person crossing \nthe border will be detected, every single person, whether it is night \nor day, whether it is sunny or stormy. The technology not available 10 \nyears ago allows us to do just that.\n  Then we have proposed a large number of Border Patrol. It is true \nthere are enough agents that 24-7 we could station somebody on the \nborder every 1,000 feet, all the way from the western edge of the \nborder in San Diego, CA, to the eastern edge of the border in \nBrownsville, TX. Why? Because the minute one of those eyes in the sky \ndetects someone approaching the border, there will be adequate \npersonnel there to say we will detain them or turn them back.\n  It is obvious. It is what the experts tell us will work. It is very \nexplainable to the American people. So, yes, there are a lot of \nresources on the border. Yes, each of us, if we wrote the bill, might \ndo it a different way or put in more money or less money. But no one \ncan dispute that the border becomes virtually airtight--virtually \nairtight. That means those who cross the border will be few and far \nbetween.\n  There are two things I would like to mention. It is expensive. This \namendment does not come cheap. But the CBO report was a game changer \nbecause it said what everyone understands, but it verified it. It gave \nit the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. We all know one of the great \neconomic engines of America--or we should all know; many of us do. I \nknow, Madam President, you know it, being an immigrant yourself--that \none of the greatest economic engines America has had to propel it and \nmake it the greatest country in the world is immigrants.\n  Immigrants are willing to risk everything. They cross stormy oceans, \ntrek across deserts to come to America. What a beautiful, wonderful \nthing. I am so proud that out the window of my den in Brooklyn, NY, I \ncan see that lady who holds the torch. To the whole world she \nsymbolizes what a great country we are. And people come.\n  Anyone who doubts and says the Sun is setting on America, just look \nat how many people risk their lives to come here, how many people \nseparate from families to come here, how many people uproot themselves \nto come here. If America were not such a great, attractive place, \nwe wouldn't have a problem of so many illegal immigrants. People want \nto come here. When they come here they work. Boy, do they work. To be \nable to send $10 a week to their mother or kids in Oaxaca Province or \nin the Philippines or in Bosnia is a huge thing. It gives them joy. \nThat is why they are sometimes willing to work under the kinds of \nconditions we don't find acceptable for people who are here legally. \nBut it is the greatest economic engine there is.\n\n  Immigrants form companies because so many of the smartest and \nbrightest come here. Immigrants make our meat factories and our farms \nwork because even those who may not have such an education are willing \nto work under very difficult conditions to earn enough money to feed \nthemselves and maybe send a little home to their families. They are the \ngreatest economic engine we have--the greatest.\n  Republicans say the way to get this economy going is to cut taxes. \nDemocrats say the way to get this economy going is to spend money. You \ncan decide which one you believe in. But I tell you, no one can dispute \nthat a greater economic engine of either of those is the blood, sweat, \ntoil, and tears of our immigrant communities--not just starting today \nbut from the day in my city when the new immigrants were called \n``English'' because the Dutch had settled New York and didn't want \nthese newcomers to come in. In fact, the two oldest high schools in \nAmerica are in New York City. They are both private schools, but one is \ncalled Collegiate. It was formed by the Dutch Reform Church in 1628.\n  When the English came, they didn't want to go to a school with this \nDutch Reform Church. So they formed the Trinity School for the \nEpiscopal English, the Anglican English. There were all kinds of \ntension. Of course, there is always tension. But when these new English \npeople came, they worked hard and the Dutch saw that.\n  Peter Stuyvesant recognized it and made New York, actually--the \nreason so many have written that we have become the greatest city in \nthe world is because, unlike other cities, we would take everybody as \nlong as they worked hard. It is one of the reasons my people settled so \nheavily in New York, in America. It was a tradition that lasted a long \ntime. Boston was bigger than New York, Philadelphia, but they were \nclosed to outsiders. New York was open.\n  So the greatest economic engine America needs is immigrants and their \nhard work, whether they are Ph.D.s in nuclear physics or cutting sugar \nin Florida or Louisiana. The CBO vindicated that report. Amazing. We \nare busy talking about Mr. Bernanke and how he could twist the dials \nand GDP growth might go up 0.3 percent. Do you know what the impartial \nCBO showed? If we did our bill, which both brought 11 million workers \nout of the shadows and brought hundreds of thousands more in, in the \nnext decade--millions more in--whether through the Future-Flow Program \nor Family Unification--GDP would go up 3.3 percent. I know of no \ngovernment program or tax cut that even professes to do that much. And \nin the second decade it would go up over 5 percent.\n  Of course, this is good for America, and we want to secure our \nborders and we want to rationalize our system and we want to be fair on \na tough but earned path to citizenship for those who cross the border \nillegally. The bill, with the addition of the Corker-Hoeven amendment, \nwill convince everybody they do it all.\n  One other point. Those who said this new Corker-Hoeven amendment will \ncost money, it will. But let me read what CBO has just said in the last \nhalf hour:\n\n       The amendment--\n\n  Corker-Hoeven--\n\n     would significantly increase border security relative to the \n     committee-approved version of the bill, and it would \n     strengthen enforcement actions against those who stay in the \n     country after their authorization has expired. Therefore, CBO \n     expects that relative to the committee-approved version of S. \n     744, the amendment would reduce both illegal entry into the \n     country and the number of people who stay in the country \n     beyond the end of their authorized period.\n\n  I say that to my colleague from Texas, who is on the Senate floor, \nand others who say this will not work. CBO: Illegal immigration will \ndecline as a result of the Corker-Hoeven amendment.\n  Here is something else CBO says:\n\n       All told, CBO and JCT--\n\n  Joint Committee on Taxes--\n\n     expect that enacting the amendment would, like enacting S. \n     744--\n\n  The base bill--\n\n     reduce the federal deficit over both the next 10 years and \n     the second decade following enactment--fewer illegal \n     immigrants, higher GDP, more jobs, reduced deficit.\n\n  Who could oppose that? I don't know of anybody who could oppose that \nif they care about America.\n  Once again, on the border stuff my colleagues just won't take yes for \nan answer. This is the toughest, strongest, most expensive border \nprovision we have had. It is augmented, of course, by the entry-exit \nsystem improvements and the mandatory E-Verify, which many of my \ncolleagues, including my good friend from Alabama, have been calling \nfor for a long time. Illegal immigration will drop dramatically, GDP \nwill go up, jobs will go up, and the deficit will go down.\n  Pass this amendment and pass this bill. It is good for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, at 5:30 p.m. today the Senate is going to \nvote on the modification to the Leahy amendment, which is the package \nthat was put together by Senators Hoeven and Corker. The distinguished \nsenior Senator from New York who has led\n\n[[Page S5011]]\n\nthe so-called Gang of 8 in putting this bill together has just spoken \non the floor, as will, I believe, the distinguished majority whip, who \nis also on the floor.\n  As I indicated on Friday when I spoke about this, this is not the \namendment I would have drafted. I think every one of us, if we drafted \nthe bill, would have drafted it differently. Republicans demanded these \naggressive border measures to secure their support for the overall \nlegislation. And while it means spending an enormous amount of money, \nbecause their amendment will increase Republican support by spending \nthis money for this historic, comprehensive legislation, I will support \nit. Ultimately, the comprehensive legislation is most important.\n  I appreciate that this package includes a provision Senator Murray \nand I worked on that takes an important step toward restoring privacy \nrights to millions of people who live near the northern border. Over \nthe past decade, the Department of Homeland Security has periodically \nset up a Border Patrol vehicle checkpoint nearly 100 miles from the \nCanadian border in Vermont. Many Vermonters have questioned whether \nthis is an effective border security measure or whether it is just a \nwaste of money. Some have wondered why we are doing it when we are 100 \nmiles from the friendliest border any country has ever known.\n  My provision will make significant progress in addressing that \ncheckpoint by injecting oversight into the decisionmaking process for \noperating checkpoints so far from the border. While this is an \nimportant step in the right direction, I am disappointed that the \nversion of the Hoeven-Corker amendment is limited to the northern \nborder, and I will continue to work on this issue so that all Americans \ncan have their privacy rights protected. Most of us appreciate our \nprivacy rights and don't like to be stopped for no particular reason.\n  Today's vote for cloture on this Republican package is a vote for \nbipartisan support for comprehensive immigration reform. It is a vote \nin favor of taking the bold steps needed to confront the current \nsituation and give the many millions of people living in the shadows \nthe opportunity to come into the lawful immigration system. I applaud \nthose Senators, both Democrats and Republicans, who have come together \nto get us here. Now is the time for this whole body to come together in \nsupport of fixing a broken immigration system that hurts all of us. It \nstifles our economy and keeps our families apart. We have gotten to \nthis point through compromise, but we have not compromised on the core \nof this legislation that is intended to set so many on the path to \nbecome full and lawful participants in American life. And in that \nspirit of compromise and cooperation, which was fostered through almost \n140 amendments that were agreed to by bipartisan votes in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, I will support this amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to also support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I thank the Senator for his leadership \non this issue, and I want to make a few brief comments in support of \nthe amendment.\n  First of all, to those who have been traveling and are just coming \nin, this is a cloture vote on the amendment only. There will be further \ncloture votes down the road. This amendment is in legislative language \nand has 115 pages. It takes about 30 minutes to read. We have had it \nout there for 75 hours, so people have had plenty of time to look at \nthis.\n  I especially want to say to my colleagues on this side of the aisle \nthat what this amendment should be measured against is the base text of \nthis legislation. The border security piece would be put in place by \nthe head of Homeland Security. Right now, that is Janet Napolitano. She \nwould have 180 days to put that in place, and then the trigger 10 years \ndown the road is that Homeland Security says that it is 90 percent in \nplace.\n  What this amendment does is put in a much stronger border security \nregime that has five triggers in it before anyone can receive a green \ncard: No. 1, there will be 20,000 Border Patrol agents who will be \ndeployed, trained, and in place; No. 2, $4.5 billion worth of \ntechnology that is necessary for us to get 100 percent situational \nawareness on the border; No. 3, 350 miles of new fencing on top of the \n350 miles of fencing we now have: No. 4, the E-Verify system will be \nfully implemented and in place: No. 5, fully implementing an entry-exit \nvisa program, which is one of the reasons there have been so many \noverstays.\n  What I say to my friends on this side of the aisle: You are measuring \nthe base text which says nothing about what we are going to do to this \namendment which specifically spells out those things that have to occur \nbefore anybody can move from temporary status to green card status.\n  Some people have talked about the costs. This is a $46 billion \ninvestment. Much of it is one time. The fact is that this only goes in \nplace if the bill passes, and as everyone knows the bill generates $192 \nbillion to the U.S. Treasury over a 10-year period. I have never had an \nopportunity to vote for a bill that did that.\n  Lastly, let me state that Governor Brewer probably knows more about \nborder security than anybody on the Senate floor. She has been dealing \nwith that in Arizona for a long time. Today she said in front of a \nnational audience that this, in fact, was a victory for Arizona if this \namendment could be passed.\n  CBO has scored this today. I tell all the Members that as opposed to \nthe base text, which just says a plan will be put in place after 180 \ndays--we don't know what that is. But this will significantly reduce \nthe amount of illegal immigration we have in this Nation.\n  I know there are folks who will vote against the bill regardless of \nwhat it says. I just say: Please look at this amendment. This is a \nstrengthening amendment. This is an amendment that every Republican who \ncares about border security and people on the other side who care about \nborder security should support. I hope everyone will get behind this. \nThis puts a balance in place. I think if this amendment is passed, we \nwill be doing something great for our Nation.\n  I urge everyone to vote yes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, we are about to vote to end debate--a \ndebate that never really began on an amendment that is 1,200 pages and \nwas filed on Friday afternoon after many Senators left town. We are now \nvoting at 5:30 p.m. on Monday as many Senators are stepping off the \nairplane.\n  This is the 1,200-page amendment. We have seen this play before. It \nis reminiscent of ObamaCare--yet another bill we were told we have to \npass to find out what is in it. Unfortunately, it seems there are some \nRepublicans eager to go along with the Democrats in the mad rush to \npass this bill.\n  In the 2007 immigration debate, close to 50 amendments were \nconsidered. In this debate, only nine amendments have been debated. I \nintroduced seven substantive amendments to improve this bill. Not a \nsingle one of those amendments has been considered on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I would happily yield except we have 5 minutes left.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given \n1 minute for both the question and the answer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Assuming that the time does not come out of my own, I have \nno objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Does the Senator deny that of the 1,000 pages, about 100 \npages are new text and the rest is just the old text of the existing \nbill and that over a weekend every Senator should be able to read 100 \npages of important legislation?\n  Mr. CRUZ. As my friend from New York knows well, the amendments are \ninterspersed through a very complicated bill. Analyzing where waivers \nhave been given and what the intersection is of new provisions with old \nprovisions is not a simple endeavor. Indeed, in this particular body, \nit is not unbeknownst to this body to slide something in text.\n\n[[Page S5012]]\n\n  My point is very simple: What is the rush? Why are we proceeding \ngangbusters? The only explanation that makes sense is that it seems \nthere are many Senators in this body--perhaps on both sides of this \naisle--who very much want a fig leaf. They want something they can \nclaim they are supporting border security when, in fact, this bill does \nnot do that.\n  I suggest that if we contrast this amendment to the amendment I \nintroduced, we can see the difference between a bill that actually \nwould protect border security versus something that is merely meant to \ntell gullible constituents that we have done something.\n  The first and most important difference is that this amendment \nprovides legalization first and then border security maybe at some time \nin the future. We have seen this before. In 1986 it was the same \npromise Congress made. We got the legalization, we got the amnesty, and \nwe never, ever got border security. In contrast, the amendment I \nintroduced reflects the will of the American people to have border \nsecurity first and only then the possibility of legalization.\n  Secondly, this amendment does not require operational control of the \nborder. Current law requires that. This amendment weakens current law \non operational control. My amendment would require that the problem \nactually be solved.\n  Thirdly, this amendment does not require a biometric entry-exit \nsystem. It weakens current law. Current law requires that; this \namendment takes that out. Instead, it requires essentially a photo ID. \nFor anyone who perhaps has known a teenager, they know that the \ndifficulty of securing a fake ID with a picture on it is not very high. \nAny flea market in the land will allow it.\n  Fourth, this bill weakens the requirements of statutes on secure \nfencing, and it weakens the current law on border security.\n  Fifth, this amendment is not offset. My amendment was offset. So \nthere is brandnew spending in this amendment with no offset.\n  Sixth, this amendment has no real enforcement. The amendment I \nintroduced said: If the changes within it on border security were not \nimplemented within 3 years, 20 percent of the salary of political \nappointees at DHS would be reduced, 20 percent of the budget would be \nreduced, and it would be block granted to the State to fix the problem.\n  Fundamentally, this is about political cover. It is not about solving \nthe problem. I suggest the approach is one with which we are all \nfamiliar. It is the approach that perhaps in childhood we knew well. It \nis an approach that says: I will gladly secure the border next Tuesday \nfor legalization today. Now, if we were naive and had not been through \n1986 together and had not seen Congress play this same show game with \nthe American people, perhaps we would fall for it, but I don't think \nthe American people are that gullible. Everyone wants to fix our broken \nimmigration system, but at the same time we should not replicate \nmistakes of the past.\n  This amendment and the underlying Gang of 8 bill grant immediate \nlegalization. The border security changes will never be implemented, \nand the border will not be secured. That is not a solution of which the \nAmerican people can be proud. I urge this body to reject the amendment, \nto vote against cloture, and reject the underlying bill.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I understand there will be numbers of \npeople on my side of the aisle who are going to vote against the \nimmigration bill, in some cases regardless of what it says. But this \namendment is not about anything relative to amnesty or anything else.\n  If I could just read to all of my Members what CBO said about this \namendment: ``The amendment would significantly increase border security \nrelative''--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the proponents has expired.\n  Mr. CORKER. I ask unanimous consent for a 1-minute extension.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. This came out of CBO today. I wish to say this to all the \nMembers on my side. I urge everyone to look at the CBO language, which \nsays if this amendment is passed, it will strongly increase border \nsecurity and strongly decrease illegal immigration in this country. I \ndon't know how any Republican who says they support border security can \nvote against this amendment when they are comparing it against the base \nlanguage which is in the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining for the \nopponents.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, this is not a vote on the Hoeven \namendment; it is a vote on the complete substitute of over 1,000 pages \nthat includes all aspects of the bill before us. It includes amnesty, \nand it includes the failed entry-exit visa.\n  If we vote for cloture tonight, we will be transferring complete \ncontrol of the entire process for this immigration bill to the majority \nleader, Harry Reid. We can hear the whistle in the distance right now \nas the train is arriving in the station. If Senators Reid, Corker, and \nHoeven are able to cut off debate, the next vote will come in about 30 \nhours and another substitute vote in 30 hours after that.\n  Senator Reid has filled the tree. There will be no amendments \nallowed--\n  Mr. LEAHY. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the opponents has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Without the approval of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to \na close debate on the Leahy amendment No. 1183, as modified, to S. 744, \na bill to provide for comprehensive immigration reform, and for other \npurposes.\n         Harry Reid, Patrick J.

Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader making \nthis arrangement. I was wanting to get a little more time than that. \nHowever, let me just mention two bills that I plan one to reintroduce, \nanother to introduce, which I think are timely tonight because of \nsomething that is going to happen tomorrow.\n  Tomorrow I am going to reintroduce a bill making it clear that States \nare sole regulators of the hydraulic fracturing process, and there is a \nreason for bringing this up in the next bill.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Vitter, Portman, Roberts, Enzi, \nSessions, Coburn, Crapo, Risch, Scott, Cruz, Hatch, Johnson, and Lee.\n  Since 2008, domestic oil production has increased by 40 percent. This \nhas never happened before. That is just in the last 4 years. Because of \nthe new applications for such processes as horizontal drilling and \nhydraulic fracturing, we have been able to do this. But the most \ninteresting thing is that with a 40-percent increase, 100 percent of \nthat has been in State or in private land.\n  That is critical, because we keep hearing from this administration \nthat they somehow want to take credit for the fact that we have had an \nincrease in that period of time, when the fact is that has all been \ndone on private land or on State land. None of it has been done on \nFederal land.\n  In fact, the Congressional Research Service came out earlier this \nyear:\n\n       All of the increase from FY2007 to FY2012 took place on \n     non-federal lands, and the federal share of total U.S. crude \n     oil production fell by about seven percentage points.\n\n  That means that while we increased 40 percent, that which was on \nFederal land decreased by 7 percent. It just goes to show the real \nconsequences of the administration's all-out war on fossil fuels. The \nPresident has made it so difficult for anyone to lease Federal land or \nobtain drilling permits that many producers have simply stopped working \non Federal lands altogether. For those who remain, the process is \ndysfunctional and unfriendly.\n  For instance, it takes an average of 207 days to get a drilling \npermit on Federal lands. By contrast, in my State of Oklahoma it only \ntakes 10 hours, and 83 percent of the Federal lands are off-limits.\n  I think we need to understand all the benefits that could be out \nthere are in spite of this administration and the policies of this \nadministration. We shouldn't be fooled. The President may claim he \nlikes natural gas, but he is actually taking every step he can to \nimpose more burdensome regulations on industries so he can shut them \ndown in favor of his beloved renewables. This war against hydraulic \nfracturing is part of that effort.\n  I can remember when we had something that took place a few months ago \ncalled date night. A lot of the Democrats, on national TV at a joint \nsession of the legislature, didn't like the idea when something came up \nthat was not popular with the people at home and happened to be popular \nwith Democrats, so they had date night, so individuals would be \nscattered out and they wouldn't have all the Republicans on one side \nand all the Democrats on one side.\n  I thought it was kind of interesting because, I won't mention her \nname, but one of my very good friends who happens to be a liberal \nDemocrat, when the President stood up and made the statement, he said:\n\n       Now there is an abundance of good, clean, natural gas that \n     we can have for the future.\n\n  I nudged her and I said:\n\n       Are you listening to this?\n\n  And she said back to me:\n\n       Wait a minute, you are going to hear something else.\n\n  He came out, and this is what he said right after that:\n\n       [we will be] requiring all companies that drill for gas on \n     public lands to disclose the chemicals they use. Because \n     America will develop this resource without putting the health \n     and safety of our citizens at risk.\n\n  Which are other words for: However, we are not going to be doing \nhydraulic fracturing. This is kind of interesting because we cannot \nhave natural gas production without having hydraulic fracturing.\n  In response to this charge by the President, the Department of the \nInterior recently proposed new regulations that would apply to any \nhydraulic fracturing that occurs on Federal lands. These new \nregulations cover everything from chemical disclosure to water use and \ncement bonding requirements. They add a massive new layer of regulatory \ncompliance to any operator looking to develop reserves on Federal lands \nat a cost of as much as $250,000 per well. It costs that much more with \nno environmental benefits.\n  You might ask: Why no environmental benefits? It is because Lisa \nJackson, who is Barack Obama's Director of EPA, stated on the record:\n\n       In no case have we made a definitive determination that the \n     fracking process has caused chemicals to enter ground water.\n\n  In other words, in the last 60 years--and I can attest to the last 60 \nyears because the first hydraulic fracturing took place in Duncan, OK, \nin my State, in 1949. Since then, over 1 million wells have been \nfracked without any ground water contamination.\n  So why would the President want to take the authority away from the \nStates if they have such an excellent track record? It is because of \nhis war on fossil fuels.\n  To combat this I am introducing the Fracturing Regulations Are \nEffective in State Hands Act.\n  The bill I am talking about simply makes it clear that States are the \nsole regulators of hydraulic fracturing, as they have been for the last \n60 years. It includes Federal lands located within the borders of a \nState, so my bill would render the President's new regulations moot and \nineffective and keep States in the driver's seat, effectively \nregulating the process.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this. This is something that would be \na major effort. If you stop and think about the people talking about \nthe bad economy and all that, you just go to the oil States and see \nwhat has happened. We could be enjoying this prosperity all throughout \nthe country. We\n\n[[Page S5014]]\n\nused to think of the oil and gas production as being primarily in the \nwestern part of the United States.\n  However, that is not the case anymore. The Marcellus shale--talking \nabout Pennsylvania, New York, and other States--could have great \nbenefits by opening that area. To do that we want to continue the State \nregulation of hydraulic fracturing as it has been in the past.\n  I have another bill I am going to be introducing, and I think it is \nimportant. It closely relates to this and the speech the President is \ngoing to make tomorrow.\n  First of all, the 10th Amendment to the Constitution says:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  That is something we all know. We learned this many years ago when we \nwere in school. Today the Framers would be shocked to know the \ngovernment's annual budget is near $4 trillion a year, with consistent \n$1 trillion deficits under the Obama administration.\n  They would also be astonished to know that the Federal Government is \ninvolving itself in nearly every facet of American life, ranging from \nthe absurd, such as protecting the small burrowing beetle in eastern \nOklahoma, to the offensive, such as mandating that private companies \nprovide contraceptives to employees despite objections of conscience.\n  I was reading a book written by a friend of mine, who is deceased \nnow, Bill Bright. His book has a daily message. The one for today, \nwhich happens to be day 175, the 24th of June, is kind of interesting. \nIt was written by Malcolm Muggeridge. He went back and talked about \nwhat we are--keep in mind this is 40 years ago. He talked about putting \nthe frogs in cold water and then slowly heating it up, and of course \nthey end up dying in the water. However, if you put them in, and it \nhappened all at once, they would not notice. I think that is what he is \ntalking about. Yet he said this is not happening today, but it could \nhappen. If he were around today, I wonder what he would say. This is \nnot the way it was supposed to be. The 10th Amendment was supposed to \nbe robust.\n  James Madison, in Federalist 39, wrote:\n\n       In this relation then the proposed Government cannot be \n     deemed a national one; since its jurisdiction extends to \n     certain enumerated objects only, and leaves to the several \n     States a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other \n     objects.\n\n  He continues to say:\n\n       The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the \n     federal government, are few and defined. Those which are to \n     remain in the State governments are numerous and infinite. \n     The former will be exercised principally on external objects, \n     as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce . . . The \n     powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the \n     objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the \n     lives, liberties, and properties of the people, and the \n     internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State.\n\n  We talk about the Constitution a lot. Yet people seem to forget the \nvery important parts of the Constitution. Given this, it should come as \nno surprise that for the first 100 years of our history, as States were \nadded to the Union, the Federal Government sold off vast quantities of \nits land. If the Federal Government were to be limited, then why would \nthey need to own a lot of land? In fact, we can see in this chart the \nFederal revenues from the land sales were a significant component in \nthe total revenues until just before the Civil War, and then it dropped \noff.\n  Today the Federal Government owns over 600 million acres of land, and \nthis chart shows how much of the country it actually is. It is \nastonishing. If we look at this chart, it shows most of it being in the \nwestern part of the United States, but it is all over the country.\n  This land is endowed with substantial natural resources. As we can \nsee in this chart, a substantial amount of oil and gas is located in \nthe tight shale formations on these Federal lands. These are Federal \nlands, and it shows the great potential out there which has recently \nproven to be highly productive because of the advances in technologies \nsuch as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling.\n  As a result of these discoveries, oil and natural gas production has \nboomed across the country. In the last 5 years, oil production has \nincreased by over 7 million barrels a day, which is 40 percent higher. \nAs I said when presenting the bill right before this one, all of that \nwas done in the private sector and in the State. While that increased \nby 40 percent, the Federal lands decreased by 7 percent. As the \nCongressional Research Service confirmed in the last report, it said \nall the increase in U.S. production from 2007 to 2012 took place on \nnon-Federal lands.\n  President Obama is the reason this land is locked up. He has made it \nimpossible for new oil and gas production to occur on Federal lands, \nand in addition to working to shut down development in areas such as \nwestern Oklahoma by proposing to list the lesser prairie chicken as an \nendangered species, he made the process of drilling on Federal land so \ndifficult that it takes 300 days to get a drilling permit from the \nFederal Government while it only takes 10 hours to get one from \nOklahoma. Further, 83 percent of the land is off limits to oil and gas \nproduction.\n  Today we are within striking distance of achieving energy \nindependence. Due to this, we must be able to get to the resources on \nFederal lands because they are enormous. For instance, ANWR in Alaska \nholds 16 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The Rocky Mountain West \nholds 1.8 trillion barrels of oil equivalent. If we expanded oil and \ngas production to its potential in all Federal areas, the impact would \nbe astounding.\n  The Institute for Energy Research recently issued a report based on \nthe most recent government data about these off-limits lands and showed \nthat if we enacted policies that allowed aggressive development of \nthese Federal lands, the process would generate $14.4 trillion in \neconomic activity, create 2.5 million jobs, and reduce the deficit by \n$2.7 trillion.\n  Had we stuck to the principles of our Founders as articulated in the \nFederalist Papers and ratified in the 10th Amendment, we would not be \nhaving this conversation because the States would already be in \ncontrol. So what we are trying to do is make sure the States can go \nback and control and do something that has been successful. What we \nneed to do is get back to the basics, which I am introducing in the \nFederal Land Freedom Act today. I want to thank Senator Vitter, and all \nthe other Senators who are cosponsors of the previous bills are also \ncosponsors of this bill.\n  This bill would reestablish the principles of Federalism when it \ncomes to the energy policy of our Federal lands. The bill gives States \nthe right to develop all forms of energy resources, including \nrenewables, located on Federal lands located within their borders. To \nget the authority, all a State would need to do is figure out how it \nwould release, permit, and regulate energy activities on its Federal \nlands.\n  Upon a State's declaration to the Federal Government that this \nprogram has been created, the energy development rights would \nautomatically transfer to the State. The Federal Government would \nretain ownership of the land and its resources. The royalty share would \nremain unchanged. It would be a split, 50-50, between the State and the \nFederal Government as enumerated in the Minerals Leasing Act.\n  The Energy Information Administration on Friday said the United \nStates could become a net oil exporter by 2040.\n  This bill could make it happen much faster than that. There is a guy \nnamed Harold Hamm, the CEO of Continental Resources, arguably one of \nthe most successful operators--maybe the most successful--in the \ncountry. I called him up because people in the administration keep \nsaying if we are able to drill on public lands, it would take 10 years \nbefore this would reach the economy. They are talking about the high \nprice of heating a home or cooling a home or the price of gasoline.\n  So I said I am going to go on a national show, and they are going to \nask me the question of about 10 years, because I know that is not true. \nSo I told Mr. Hamm that I would like to quote him as an authority, and \nso he should be honest with his answer because I am going to use his \nname on national TV. If we had everything set and we are going to go \nahead and start drilling now, how long would it take the first barrel \nof oil out of the ground to reach the market? Without hesitating he \nsaid\n\n[[Page S5015]]\n\n70 days. Then he went through and explained each step in the process \nfrom drilling to hydraulic fracturing to transportation and all of \nthis. He said it would take 70 days.\n  That was just a few months ago, and no one has challenged this since \nthen. Energy independence today--this is a reality we could be living \nin, and it would dramatically improve our economy.\n  Unemployment continues to hover around 8 percent nationwide, but in \nStates such as Oklahoma and North Dakota we are at full employment. \nWhy? Because of energy development. With greater development of Federal \nenergy resources, we would see a dramatic improvement in our economy, \nand there is simply no reason not to do it. The States have clearly \ndemonstrated they are capable of handling oil and gas development \nprocesses and regulations. They have been doing it for 100 years on \nState and private lands. Why shouldn't they be able to do it on Federal \nlands as well? I think the 10th Amendment trusts the States and the \nSenate should do the same.\n  I bring this up now because tomorrow there is going to be a speech. \nPresident Obama is going to give a speech on--I would say global \nwarming, but they don't call it that anymore since the globe isn't \nwarming. It is a climate speech on the unilateral first steps to \nregulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act--now we are talking \nabout powerplants--new and existing plants; energy efficiency of \nappliances. He will be talking about that. He will talk about renewable \nenergy production on Federal lands, but he will not be talking about \nthe cost of these regulations.\n  We all remember what he has already done. Utility MACT set new limits \non mercury, coal, and oil-fired powerplants at a $100 billion cost and \n1.65 million jobs lost. MACT means maximum achievable control \ntechnology. What this administration has been trying to do is mandate \nemissions that are below the technology to get there. Boiler MACT set \nstrict new limits on emissions of hazardous air pollutants from \nindustrial and commercial boilers costing $63.3 billion and 800,000 \njobs.\n  The same thing is going on now with what he is not talking about but \nwhat he is planning on doing. Ozone, for example. He is going to be \npromoting--from the information we have now, it would put 2,800 \ncounties out of attainment, including every county in my State of \nOklahoma. It could result in 7 million jobs and hundreds of billions in \ncosts, and it could shut down oil and gas production in western \nOklahoma.\n  Greenhouse gas for refineries, first ever greenhouse gas limits on \nrefineries; second largest emitter after powerplants. What we are \ntalking about is, he is going to be able to go through and continue in \nhis effort, in his war on fossil fuels, and he is going to attempt to \ndo it through the regulations. Let's keep in mind, he tried--they have \nbeen trying, I should say, since 12 years ago with the Kyoto treaty to \nregulate through legislation, all the way up to the most recent bill \nwhich was the bill that was defeated last year--the Waxman-Markey \nbill--and that would have regulated emitters of those who emit 25,000 \ntons or more.\n  Now, that was bad. That would have cost about $400 billion a year. \nHowever, if he is successful--he being the President--in doing this \nthrough regulations what he couldn't do through legislation, it would \nbe under the Clean Air Act, and it wouldn't be regulating those who \nemit 25,000 tons or more. It would be 250 tons or more. It would affect \nevery school, every hospital, every apartment building.\n  I would like to have people aware of that as the President makes his \nspeech tomorrow. I know he has an obligation. I know that prior to the \nlast election he would not come out with these regulations because he \nknew that would be damaging to his reelection efforts. However, now he \nhas that commitment to the far-left community who would like to shut \ndown the U.S. and the energy that keeps it running.\n  So let's be attentive to what he says tomorrow, and I will be anxious \nto respond to his speech at that time. In the meantime, we do know for \na fact that we have the ability to be totally independent from any \nother country or anyone else in providing our own energy to run this \nmachine called America.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/24/senate-section/article/S5015-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         REMEMBERING KATIE JOHN\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I am here today to honor Katie \nJohn, an Ahtna Athabascan elder, for her service to Alaska Native \npeoples and to all Alaskans. Katie made history in 1985 when she filed \nsuit against the State of Alaska to reopen her family's fish camp at \nBatzulentas and to protect her family's right to subsistence fish. \nKatie battled against the State and Federal Government legal systems \nfor almost two decades in order to protect her right and Alaska Native \npeople's right to hunt and fish in their traditional homelands.\n  Katie was born in Slana, AK, in 1915 to Sara and Charley Sanford, who \nraised her in the traditional Ahtna way. Her father was the last chief \nof the Batzulnetas. When she was 14, she took a job at Nabesna Mine, \nwhere she learned English. At age 16, Katie married Fred John, Sr., and \nmoved to Mentasta, where they had 14 children and adopted 6. They \nraised their children off the land, hunting, gathering, and fishing \nwith the changing seasons.\n  In 1964, the State of Alaska closed down Katie's fish camp at \nBatzulentas, denying her the right to provide for her family. The \ninjustice of this was the State allowed sport and commercial fisherman \nto continue fishing downriver while denying upriver subsistence users \nthe ability to fish. In 1984, Katie and another Ahtna elder, Doris \nCharles, submitted a proposal asking the State of Alaska open \nBatzuletas to subsistence fishing. When their request was denied, \nKatie, with the help of the Native American Rights Fund, filed suit \nagainst the State and argued that Federal law prioritizes and protects \nsubsistence uses of fish. For the next 10 years, the case worked its \nway through the court system. Katie never wavered in her determination \nto do what was right. She steadfastly maintained that Alaska Natives \nhad a right to support their families in a way that was culturally \nmeaningful. Finally, in 1994, Katie won her case, but it continued to \nbe appealed and litigated for years afterwards.\n  The Katie John Case, as her suit became known, finally had some \nresolve in 2001 when the ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reaffirmed \nKatie's--(and by extension all Alaska Native and rural peoples--right \nto subsistence fish in all Federal waters. For her hard work and \nservice to her family, Ahtna people, Alaska Natives, and all of Alaska, \nKatie was presented with an honorary doctorate of law degree from the \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks in 2011.\n  The Katie John Case, though it continues to be litigated, has become \na cornerstone of subsistence law in Alaska. Katie stood up for what was \nright and bravely fought to protect the Alaska Native subsistence way \nof life.\n  Katie is survived by over 250 grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and \ngreat-great-grandchildren, through which her legacy lives on. Her work \nchanged the way fisheries and natural resources are managed in Alaska \nfor the better. For that, Alaska Natives and all Alaskans are \ngrateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/24/senate-section/article/S5015-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5015-S5016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING KIRKWOOD AMTRAK VOLUNTEERS\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the \nnearly 70 volunteers who have faithfully dedicated their time to \noperating the Kirkwood Amtrak Train Station for the past 10 years. In \nrecognition of their outstanding service, a celebration has been \nplanned for them this weekend, on June 29, 2013, in Kirkwood, MO.\n  In 2002, the City of Kirkwood was on the verge of losing its historic \ntrain station due to budget constraints. However, the residents of this \ncommunity rejected that possibility. Instead, they banded together and \nthe City of Kirkwood arranged to purchase the station from Amtrak. In \ndoing so, the citizens saved the 120-year-old branch from destruction \nand preserved an iconic landmark in downtown Kirkwood.\n  Following the purchase, the City of Kirkwood called on volunteers to \nstaff and operate the facility. Nearly 200 people responded. Today, \nalmost 70 regular volunteers answer questions about\n\n[[Page S5016]]\n\nschedules, recommend Kirkwood sites and attractions, help passengers \nboard trains, issue parking passes, and keep the station open and \nrunning in accordance with the Amtrak train schedule.\n  Some may question whether an all-volunteer run train station can \ncompete with other staff-operated stations across the country. Let me \ntell you--Kirkwood Amtrak Train Station's honors and awards speak for \nthemselves. In 2004, the Kirkwood station volunteers were recognized \nwith Amtrak's prestigious ``Champion of the Rails'' award, marking this \nstation as the only non-employee station to ever receive the award.\n  Perhaps more impressively, the Kirkwood Amtrak Train Station's recent \ncustomer satisfaction scores placed it No. 1 in the country. With \nfriendly smiles and warm service, the Kirkwood station volunteers have \nset themselves apart from all other Amtrak stations, logging over \n50,000 hours of service to the City of Kirkwood, and welcoming more \nthan 500,000 visitors and passengers through the station doors.\n  I am proud these deserving citizens hail from my home State of \nMissouri. Their generous commitment to the City of Kirkwood and to \ntravelers from all over the country serves as an inspiration to the \npeople of Missouri.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the volunteers of the \nKirkwood Amtrak Train Station for their distinguished service to the \nresidents and visitors of Kirkwood.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/24/senate-section/article/S5016-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING JOHN BRANTLEY CRAWLEY\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nJudge John Brantley Crawley of Brundidge, AL, who passed away on June \n4, 2013. I met and talked with Judge Crawley when I ran for attorney \ngeneral in Alabama in 1994, and when he decided to run for an associate \njudgeship on the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals. He won and ably served \nbecoming the presiding judge on the court in 2005, a position he held \nuntil his retirement in 2007.\n  I liked him. He was a man of personal integrity and decency. He had \nno ego problems. He had good judgment and was comfortable in himself \nand with others. He was a real lawyer who had represented thousands of \nnormal people walking about. This experience taught him about people \nand legal issues. That experience made him the fine judge that he was.\n  He is survived by his wife of nearly 48 years, Sherrie Johnston \nCrawley; son, Brant; brother, Larry; and sister, Nancy. Judge Crawley \nwas a genuine and generous man, a modest man, with a keen sense of \nhumor. His career included 40 years of practicing law and 18 years \nserving the Alabama Courts and his contributions to justice in Alabama \nand the rule of law are most deserving of this recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/24/senate-section/article/S5016-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/24/senate-section/article/S5016-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/24/senate-section/article/S5016-4", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5016-S5017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-2038.

A bill to strengthen privacy protections, accountability, \nand oversight related to domestic surveillance conducted pursuant to \nthe USA PATRIOT Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n1978; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for more than a decade the government's \nability and authority to gather information and electronic \ncommunications data about those suspected of, or connected to, \npotential terrorists has greatly increased. You only need to read the \nnewspaper or listen to the news in order to realize how extraordinary \nthis expansion has been. As an American, I believe that if the \ngovernment is going to have such powerful authorities, it should only \nbe if there is proper oversight, accountability, and transparency. We \nhave to ensure that we maintain both our Nation's security and the \nfundamental civil liberties upon which our Nation was founded.\n  I have long been troubled by the expansive nature and scope of the \nUSA PATRIOT Act and the FISA Amendments Act. There is not enough \noversight and ability for Americans to know what their government is \ndoing and be able to get into the debate of whether they want their \ngovernment to do this. That is why I have consistently fought to \ninclude strong protections for the privacy rights and civil liberties \nof American citizens, as well as sunsets to help ensure proper \ncongressional oversight. Nothing focuses oversight like knowing a law \nis about to come to an end. So I will introduce at the end of my \nremarks, along with a bipartisan group of Senators, the FISA \nAccountability and Privacy Protection Act of 2013.\n  In fact, those of us who are introducing this legislation go across \nthe political spectrum. This is not a partisan issue--this is an \nAmerican issue. This is an issue about wanting to know what our \ngovernment is doing and why. As Americans, we have the right to know \nwhat our government does and why.\n  In each of the last two Congresses, I introduced legislation to \nimprove and reform the powerful law enforcement tools of the USA \nPATRIOT Act while at the same time increasing judicial oversight, \npublic accountability, and transparency. Both those bills were reported \nfavorably by the Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support, but \nCongress ultimately decided to extend all of these authorities, without \nany modifications or improvements, until 2015.\n  Likewise, when Congress considered reauthorizing the FISA Amendments \nAct last year, I pushed for a shorter sunset, greater transparency for \nthe American people, and better oversight. I regret the Senate rejected \nthese efforts to apply stricter oversight over these sweeping \nauthorities.\n  The recent public revelations about two classified data collection \nprograms have brought renewed attention to the government's broad \nsurveillance authorities, but they also underscore the need for close \nscrutiny by Congress. The Director of National Intelligence has \nacknowledged that they are being conducted pursuant to section 215 of \nthe USA PATRIOT Act and section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act.\n  We have also raised questions about lax oversight by the National \nSecurity Agency, when a 29-year-old contract employee can walk off with \nhuge amounts of data without being stopped. It is not enough for the \nNational Security Agency to come here and say that they are doing this \nto protect the country. I want them to protect the things they are \nalready holding. So the comprehensive legislation I am introducing \ntoday will not only improve the privacy protections and accountability \nprovisions associated with these authorities, but it is going to \nstrengthen oversight and transparency provisions in other parts of the \nUSA PATRIOT Act.\n  In recent days, much attention has been rightly focused on section \n215 of the PATRIOT Act and the bulk collection of phone call metadata \nby the National Security Agency and their inability to keep that from \nbeing stolen by a 29-year-old contract worker.\n  This measure will narrow the scope of section 215 orders by requiring \nthe government to show both relevance to an authorized investigation \nand a link to a foreign group or power.\n  The bill also adds more meaningful judicial review of section 215 \norders but strikes the one-year waiting period before a recipient can \nchallenge a nondisclosure order for section 215 orders. Now the order \ncomes in and you are told you can't talk about it. No matter whether it \ndamages your business, your relations, or people you are supposed to \nprotect, you can't talk about it for one year. That is a broad \ngeneralization of what the nondisclosure orders are. I think those \norders should be changed. I think when we have these kinds of ``gag \norders'' on Americans, you are going into a very dangerous area.\n  Moreover, this measure would require court review of minimization \nprocedures when information concerning a U.S. person is acquired, \nretained, or disseminated pursuant to a section 215 order. This is a \ncommonsense oversight requirement already required for other FISA \nauthorities such as wiretaps, physical searches, pen register and trap \nand trace devices.\n  As I likened it before, we all understand that if a law enforcement \nagency gets a search warrant to go into your home and search for \nthings, you usually know about it and are able to question that \nauthority. Now if they are collecting things electronically, you don't \nknow about it, you don't know what this is doing to your reputation, to \nyour work, or anything else. We have to have more accountability.\n\n  The FISA Accountability and Privacy Protection Act will also reform \nand improve other authorities contained in the PATRIOT Act that, while\n\n[[Page S5020]]\n\nperhaps not a topic of recent public debate--and I will not go into \nsome of those aspects here on the floor, also significantly impact the \nprivacy rights of Americans.\n  Some of the things we can talk about, things such as national \nsecurity letters, so-called NSLs, are used extensively by law \nenforcement and the intelligence community. They can be issued without \nthe approval of a court, a grand jury, or a prosecutor. Most Americans \nwould be amazed to know that authority exists. Frankly, in a State such \nas mine where people value their privacy, I think most Vermonters would \nbe really concerned about it.\n  I propose applying a new sunset to the NSL authority. That would \nrequire Congress to look at it again and come up with a better idea, or \nit would end right there. I have long been concerned about the broad \nscope of these secret requests and the potential for expansive \ncollection of sensitive information without appropriate limitations and \na sunset provision would help to ensure proper accountability.\n  Just because we can go out and gather all of this information on \nAmericans, often doing it secretly, doesn't mean we should. Some of us \nenjoy our privacy. Some of us like to think we are innocent unless \nproven guilty.\n  My bill would also address constitutional deficiencies regarding the \nnondisclosure or ``gag orders'' by finally allowing individuals to \nchallenge these orders in court. You grow up hearing from everybody, \nWell, you can have your day in court. Actually, you don't get your day \nin court with these ``gag orders.''\n  The bill would also expand public reporting on the use of NSLs and \nFISA authorities, including an unclassified report on the impact of the \nuse of these authorities on the privacy of U.S. persons. I have heard a \ngreat deal in the last few weeks from people not only in Vermont but \nelsewhere asking, Can't we have a report the American people can see--\nnot just those of us like myself who have access to classified \nmaterial, but have an unclassified report on the impact of the use of \nthese authorities on the privacy of Americans?\n  My bill will also address shortcomings in the FISA Amendments Act and \napply improvements that I sought during last year's reauthorization \ndebate in the Senate. The existing December 2017 sunset would be \nshortened to June 2015 to focus attention and ensure timely \nreexamination of how these authorities are being utilized.\n  The June 2015 sunset will also align with the PATRIOT Act sunset, \nallowing Congress--and in fact requiring Congress--to address all of \nthese provisions at once, rather than a little piece here and a little \npiece there. This legislation will also increase accountability by \nclarifying the scope of annual reviews currently required by law \nextends to all agencies that have a role in developing targeting and \nso-called minimization procedures.\n  Finally--and I think this is extremely important--the bill seeks to \nincrease oversight by requiring the Inspector General of the \nIntelligence Community to conduct a comprehensive review of the FISA \nAmendments Act and its impact on the privacy rights of all Americans.\n  These are commonsense, practical improvements to ensure that the \nbroad and powerful surveillance tools being used by the government are \nsubject to appropriate limitations, transparency, and oversight. The \nAmerican people deserve to know how laws such as the USA PATRIOT Act \nand the FISA Amendments Act are being used to conduct electronic \nsurveillance, particularly when the surveillance is not just on those \nthat we have reason to be suspicious of, but of all Americans--totally \ninnocent Americans. The American people also deserve to know whether \nthese programs have proven sufficiently effective to justify their \nextraordinary breadth. If you can collect billions of phone calls, and \nwe have proven technologically you can do that, do we get anything out \nof it?

Morgan (referred to in this preamble \n     as the ``Morgan'') was built and launched from New Bedford, \n     Massachusetts, in 1841;\n       Whereas the Morgan is a National Historic Landmark vessel, \n     the only remaining wooden whaleship in the world, and the \n     oldest commercial vessel in the United States;\n       Whereas the Morgan and similar vessels were the economic \n     backbone of New England for 200 years;\n       Whereas the Morgan has served as a living artifact and a \n     testament to the ingenuity, risk, and entrepreneurship of the \n     United States since the vessel retired from the whaling \n     industry in 1921;\n       Whereas the Morgan has completed a 5-year, multi-million \n     dollar restoration at the Preservation Shipyard of Mystic \n     Seaport: The Museum of America and the Sea and will be \n     relaunched on July 21, 2013;\n       Whereas the Morgan will embark on a ceremonial 38th voyage \n     in June 2014, serving as ``Ambassador'' to the world's whales \n     and to the world's whaling heritage;\n       Whereas the 38th voyage of the Morgan will rekindle the \n     spirit of exploration and discovery of people throughout the \n     world;\n       Whereas individuals and organizations from 22 States have \n     contributed materials and expertise to the restoration and \n     38th voyage of the Morgan; and\n       Whereas the new mission of the Morgan will be devoted to \n     history, education, science, and ocean awareness: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the relaunching of the whaleship Charles \n     W.

Res. 184\n\n       Whereas June 20 was established by the United Nations as \n     World Refugee Day, a global day to honor the courage, \n     strength, and determination of women, men, and children who \n     are forced to flee their homes under threat of conflict, \n     violence, and persecution;\n       Whereas, according to the Office of the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Refugees (in this preamble referred to as \n     the ``UNHCR''), there are more than 43,000,000 displaced \n     people worldwide, including more than 15,000,000 refugees;\n       Whereas, according to the UNHCR, women and girls make up at \n     least 50 percent of any refugee population;\n       Whereas refugee women and girls work every day, often under \n     the most difficult circumstances, to care for their families, \n     improve their prospects and build a better future;\n       Whereas refugee women and girls are often at greater risk \n     of sexual violence and exploitation, forced or early \n     marriage, human trafficking, and other forms of gender-based \n     violence;\n       Whereas refugee women and girls face barriers in accessing \n     education, healthcare, and economic opportunities in \n     countries of asylum;\n       Whereas, according to the UNHCR, more than 1,600,000 \n     refugees, \\3/4\\ of which are women and children, have fled \n     the ongoing violence in Syria;\n       Whereas, according to the UNHCR, an estimated 2,700,000 \n     people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been \n     displaced, and an additional nearly 500,000 Congolese \n     refugees have crossed the border into neighboring countries;\n       Whereas refugee women and girls are frequently victims of \n     gender-based violence as their displaced status puts them at \n     greater risk, coupled with intense social and cultural \n     stigmas that make actual statistics extremely difficult to \n     compile because underreporting is endemic;\n\n[[Page S5028]]\n\n       Whereas refugee women and girls have a right to safe and \n     equitable access to humanitarian assistance, including food \n     and cooking fuel, shelter, education, health care, and \n     economic opportunity;\n       Whereas the full and meaningful participation of refugee \n     women and girls in community decision-making is critical to \n     the stability, security, and prosperity of entire \n     communities;\n       Whereas the full participation of refugee women and girls \n     in the design and implementation of assistance programs is \n     vital to ensuring that those programs are equitable, \n     efficient and successful;\n       Whereas the United States is a leader on protection of and \n     humanitarian assistance for refugees, including refugee women \n     and girls;\n       Whereas the United States has recognized the threat that \n     gender-based violence can pose to refugee women and girls by \n     working to strengthen efforts to protect them through the \n     United States National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and \n     Security;\n       Whereas the United States is a leading advocate for the \n     meaningful participation of refugee women in humanitarian \n     programs, peace processes, governance, and recovery programs;\n       Whereas the United States provides critical resources and \n     support to the UNHCR and other international and \n     nongovernmental organizations working with refugees around \n     the world;

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the \nimmigration bill that is before the Senate this week. We just had a \nvote on the Corker-Hoeven amendment. I wish to talk about why it is so \nimportant to fix our broken immigration system, but also about a \ncritical issue that I believe has to be addressed in order for the \nproposed reforms to work.\n  I wish to begin by acknowledging the hard work of a number of my \ncolleagues, including four Republicans and four Democrats who came \ntogether and spent months negotiating the bill we are now considering. \nThey showed a lot of courage in addressing a tough issue. It is a tough \nissue politically, and it is a difficult issue in terms of the \npolicies.\n  I also wish to recognize Senators Hoeven and Corker who offered that \namendment today. The changes they made in that amendment are a step in \nthe right direction because they provide more enforcement for \nimmigration laws, and we have to guarantee there is meaningful \nenforcement that is coupled with any legal status for people who are \nnow living in the shadows. I think that enforcement must include strong \nborder protections. That was talked about a lot on the floor today.\n\n[[Page S5099]]\n\n  It also has to include enforcement of the visa system so an entry-\nexit system for visas is effective. Finally, it has to include \nworkplace enforcement.\n  In my view, the enforcement policies in the underlying bill and in \nthe amendment we just voted on are still insufficient to ensure that we \nultimately resolve our illegal immigration crisis. Much of the debate \nover the past week has been about border security, and the most \nsignificant provisions in today's amendment are focused on the border. \nSo much so it was described today as being a border surge--employing an \nadditional 20,000 Border Patrol agents and completing 700 miles of \nfencing that will no doubt make it harder for people to cross the \nsouthern border illegally.\n  Again, I think it is important we have a secure border. But, in \nreality, no matter how many miles of fence we build and no matter how \nmany agents we station along the border, I truly believe people will \ncontinue to come to this country illegally as long as they believe \nAmerica offers them a better life and a better job.\n  As we see on subsections of the border where fences have already been \nconstructed, determined people find ways to go under, over, and around \nit. Some go around those parts of the border altogether to enter our \ncountry through a coastline or other less secure parts of the border. \nWe also have to acknowledge that even if we were to prevent every \nsingle unauthorized entry at the border, such enforcement would not \nsolve the problem of illegal immigration. Why? Because we are told that \n40 percent of those here illegally are visa overstays. In other words, \nthey came legally. They didn't come illegally across the border; they \ncame legally and they have overstayed. They never tumbled a border \nfence or evaded a Border Patrol agent; instead, they came here legally \nand simply overstayed their visas.\n  Having a secure border is important for our immigration system, as I \nhave said. It is also important because of the illegal drug traffic, \nbecause of the concern about terrorists coming over our border. So I do \nsupport having a more secure border, but I do not think it is \nsufficient.\n  Today I want to talk about an issue I think should receive more \nattention. It has received a lot less than border security over the \npast few weeks, as we have talked about this legislation. But I think \nit is even more important to the ultimate success of comprehensive \nimmigration reform, and it is about turning off the jobs magnet--the \njobs magnet for those who come here illegally for a better way of life \nand a better job. It is about effective enforcement of the workplace \nthat I think is absolutely essential to bringing people out of the \nshadows and to preventing future flows of illegal immigration.\n  The only way to do that at the workplace is through effective \nemployment verification--a topic that has received little attention \nduring our debate thus far, an area where I believe the current bill \nand the amendment we voted on tonight fall short.\n  Policy efforts to eliminate this jobs magnet have been part of the \ndiscussion about immigration for decades. Yet our current employment \nenforcement system has failed to stem the tide of unauthorized workers. \nI am pleased the underlying bill would mandate the use of an electronic \nemployment verification system called E-Verify. But the bill does \nlittle to address the inadequacies of the E-Verify system itself, \nincluding the widespread use of false documents.\n  An effective employment verification system must first verify \nauthorization to work by connecting a worker's name and biographical \ninformation to a legal status, and then, second, it has to ensure the \nworker is who he or she says he or she is--in other words, connecting \nan individual to a specific name and identity record.\n  The goal of E-Verify should be to provide for a simple, reliable way \nfor employers to confirm a new employee's work eligibility and to \nidentify that person to prevent illegal immigrants from getting jobs in \nthis country. Until we do that, and deal with the magnet, I do not \nthink we are going to be able to get the kind of enforcement we need.\n  The current voluntary E-Verify pilot program--this is the pilot \nprogram that is out there now that is mandatory in the underlying \nlegislation, but in the pilot program, there is a way to reliably \nverify authorization to work. I think that actually is fairly \neffective. But where it has not been successful is in authenticating a \nworker's identity because it lacks a universal and secure system of \nverification. The best recent study of the E-Verify pilot, by the way, \nshows that 55 percent--54 percent--of unauthorized workers are getting \nthrough the system. In other words, more than half of those who are \nhere illegally, processed through the E-Verify system, are erroneously \nfound to be eligible for work. The reason is straightforward: Many \nunauthorized workers obtain employment by committing identity fraud \nthat cannot be detected by E-Verify. So my primary focus over the past \nfew weeks has been on working constructively to develop a bipartisan E-\nVerify amendment to strengthen the employment verification provisions \nin S. 744 to help curtail the widespread unauthorized employment that \nfuels most illegal immigration.\n  Along with my colleague from Montana Senator Tester, I have submitted \nan amendment today that strengthens E-Verify in five key respects--\nfirst, by enhancing protections against Social Security number fraud \nand identity theft.\n  A critical challenge in implementing mandatory E-Verify throughout \nthe country will be combating the fraudulent use of other people's \nidentities in seeking employment authorization. S. 744 seeks to address \nthis challenge by allowing individuals to lock their Social Security \nnumbers for purposes of E-Verify and requiring audits of suspicious E-\nVerify activities.\n  The amendment also requires the Social Security Administration to \ninclude in all of our annual statements we get from Social Security \ninformation about all E-Verify queries that have been placed during \nthat year and for us to have a toll-free telephone number to be able to \ncall folks if there has been a misuse of that number. This will allow \nus to be on guard against unauthorized workers fraudulently using our \npersonal information to seek and obtain work.\n  Our amendment also requires the Department of Homeland Security to \nnotify individuals when they identify suspected Social Security number \nfraud in the E-Verify system.\n  The amendment also allows the Department of Homeland Security to \nbuild on successful pilots programs in Florida and Mississippi to allow \nE-Verify to validate drivers' licenses and State-issued ID cards with \ninformation provided by the State motor vehicle administrations. This \nstep is critical to stopping the pervasive use of fake drivers' \nlicenses in the E-Verify process. But in doing so, we must also protect \npersonal privacy, so the Portman-Tester amendment prohibits DHS from \nmaintaining this information in a Federal database or transmitting that \ninformation except for the purposes of E-Verify.\n  Our amendment also requires regular referrals from the U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services, USCIS, to Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, ICE, identifying fraudulent Social Security number use and \nfake documents presented during the E-Verify process for investigation \nand appropriate enforcement action. And it provides for DHS outreach \nand training to assist employers in preventing identity fraud and \nstrengthening hiring practices. Only with all these tools and efforts \ncan we expect to curtail the widespread use of identity fraud and help \nprevent unauthorized employment.\n  The second focus of our amendment is to strengthen the identity \nauthentication aspects of E-Verify and ensure that the system includes \nrobust data privacy protections.\n  To improve the accuracy of E-Verify, the underlying bill expands the \nuse of a new photo-matching process called Photo Tool, which enables \nemployers to match a new employee's photo ID with a digital E-Verify \nimage. Currently, photo matching is limited to documents for which \nthere is a verified photo in the E-Verify system. Unfortunately, for \nmore than 60 percent of us--60 percent of Americans--there is no such \ndata in a file because we do not have a passport, we do not have an \nimmigration document. The bill, therefore, relies on States to give the \nDepartment of Homeland Security access to drivers' license photos. But \nbased on our experience with the REAL ID Act\n\n[[Page S5100]]\n\nof 2005, very few States are likely to comply.\n  There is no assurance that all or even most States will voluntarily \nparticipate in this kind of a program. So while the underlying bill \nprovides some funding and grants to ease State compliance, we believe \nthe amount they provide may understate the cost to most States.\n  To help make Photo Tool actually work, our amendment doubles the \navailable grant moneys for States that share department of motor \nvehicle information and photos, and it ensures the States are fully \nreimbursed for whatever their actual compliance and participation costs \nare, providing incentives for States to participate. It also clarifies \nthat Photo Tool will be fully integrated into the E-Verify system and \nthat it must be implemented in time for the rollout of the mandatory E-\nVerify throughout the country. So it brings Photo Match into the E-\nVerify system to provide for better enforcement at a time when some \nworkers are going to be provided a legal status.\n  Senator Tester and I want to be sure the bill's Photo Tool provisions \ndo not lead to the establishment of a Federal database containing \nadditional personal information and photographs of individual \nAmericans. In fact, this will be another thing that is important to \nStates because many States will only participate if assured the data \nthey share will not be misused. So our amendment provides robust data \nprivacy protections, one, clarifying that Photo Tool will be \nimplemented so that E-Verify ``pings'' State DMV databases with \nindividual queries rather than storing such State-provided \ninformation--so only when there is an individual request do they ping \nthe DMV, and the DMV provides the photo; two, providing that the State \nDMV images and information may not be collected, may not be stored, may \nnot be used for any other purpose other than for E-Verify, and may not \nbe disseminated in any way beyond a response to an individual Photo-\nTool query; and, three, providing for periodic DHS audits to ensure \nthat the Photo Tool data is not being collected, stored, or improperly \ndisseminated.\n  To make E-Verify work, we have to be certain employers are able to \nauthenticate the true identify of new hires accurately, quickly, and \neasily. But in doing so through methods such as Photo Tool match, we \nmust protect privacy and safeguard personal information. We have done \nthat in this amendment.\n  The third way our amendment strengthens E-Verify is by enhancing \nadditional security measures for identity verification. For new \nemployees whose identity cannot be verified using Photo Tool, which we \ntalked about, the underlying bill provides for the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to develop ``additional security measures'' designed \nto authenticate identity. But there is no specified timeframe for \nimplementation and little or no guidance in the way of standards for \nthese additional security measures.\n  Our amendment clarifies that the additional security measures must be \nintegrated into the E-Verify system for workers who present a document \nwithout a corresponding Photo Tool image, that the timing of their \nimplementation is tied to the rollout of mandatory E-Verify, and that \nfailure to verify an identity with the additional security measures \nresults in what is called a Further Action Notice in the E-Verify \nprocess, allowing employees to appeal through the established appeals \nprocess, where they have to prove they are authorized to work.\n  Our amendment also specifies standards for design and operation of \nthe additional security measures that are provided to include state-of-\nthe-art technology structured to provide prompt determinations and \nminimize employer and employee burdens. These specifications are \ndesigned to safeguard employee privacy and maximize the accuracy and \nefficiency of identity determinations. And the amendment permits \nemployers to choose, with advance notice to DHS, to use the additional \nauthentication measures on all new hires rather than only in cases \nwhere no digital image is available for a Photo Tool match. For a \nnumber of employers that is important.\n  A fourth section of our amendment clarifies protections for employers \nwho seek to comply with E-Verify procedures in good faith. The \nunderlying bill mandates nationwide rollout of E-Verify and also \nincreases employer sanctions--penalties for employers who do not comply \nwith the mandated employment verification process. The bill's \nprovisions seek to ensure that employers will not engage in unfair \nimmigration-related employment practices, expanding both the grounds \nand penalties for such practices.\n  Employers will therefore face the often challenging task of ensuring \ncompliance with these new employment verification obligations while \nsimultaneously avoiding an expanded set of unfair immigration-related \nemployment practices.\n  Our amendment simply provides that there is a safe harbor, a safe \nharbor protection to employers that comply in good faith with the \nrequirements of the mandatory employment verification system. The \namendment provides that the government must demonstrate by clear and \nconvincing evidence that the employer had knowingly hired an \nunauthorized worker and employers that take reasonable steps in good \nfaith to avoid unfair immigration-related employment practices are not \nsubject to liability. Again, it is very important for employers to have \nthis be a simple system and one where, if they follow the rules, they \nhave a safe harbor.\n  Finally, our amendment expedites the E-Verify mandatory rollout to \nAmerican employers, while preserving the full 5-year timeline for the \nsmallest businesses to make sure we begin rigorous enforcement efforts \nat the same time millions of current illegal immigrants begin to shift \nto a legal status.\n  Our amendment ensures that most American jobs are covered by E-Verify \nas soon as it is feasible, applying to large employers as early as 2 \nyears after enactment, which is speeding up and expediting the coverage \nof E-Verify. It includes a new strengthened trigger to ensure timely \nand full implementation of mandatory E-Verify to all employers, \nincluding integrated Photo Tool and additional security measures prior \nto any adjustment to green card status. So it also has a stronger, more \ncomprehensive trigger.\n  In each of these ways, this amendment presents an opportunity for \nthis Senate to put forth good policy that will make a real difference \nif implemented. The amendment's provisions were drafted with input from \nboth Republicans and Democrats. They are the product of a lot of \nnegotiations regarding business groups, labor interests. They were \ndeveloped and vetted in consultation with the administration and the \nofficials who will actually be tasked with developing and implementing \nthis new system of mandatory employment verification.\n  I am pleased Senator Tester has joined me in this effort. I know the \nprovisions in our amendment enjoy broad bipartisan support in this \nChamber and I think across the Nation. There is a recent poll, for \ninstance, that showed that 82 percent of likely voters think businesses \nshould be required to use E-Verify to determine if a new employee is \nlegal.\n  The question before this body is a simple one: Will our comprehensive \nimmigration reforms include serious, meaningful, and effective E-Verify \nprovisions that along with the border security measures will actually \nstem the tide of illegal immigration or will we fail to eliminate the \njobs magnet that makes it harder to bring people out of the shadows and \ncontinue to provide a strong incentive for people to come here \nillegally.\n  Today, I am simply asking for a debate and a vote on this critical \namendment. My request does not have a political motivation. It is not \nabout whether I support the legislation, although I will not be able to \nsupport it without it. It is about making this reform work. If this \namendment is not adopted, I do not believe the reforms are going to \nwork, and thus I would not be in a position to support final passage.\n  I was there during the immigration commission that came up with the \nproposals that led to the 1986 law, which was the last comprehensive \neffort that Congress made to overhaul our immigration system. I was a \nyoung staffer on what was called the Select Commission on Immigration \nand Refugee Policy. I spent 2 years there working on\n\n[[Page S5101]]\n\nthese issues and have followed them since and have been involved in \nimmigration policy both in the Congress and in the administration since \nthen.\n  But back in 1986, I saw the work that went into crafting that \nlegislation and the hope it gave everyone that we were actually going \nto solve the problem of illegal immigration. Then I saw those hopes \ndashed, as the reforms failed to work. They failed to address illegal \nimmigration, in part, because they did not effectively implement the \nworkplace enforcement provisions, despite, by the way, strong \nrecommendations from the Commission on which I served. Congress \nsimply--and the administration--subsequently did not implement the \nkinds of employer sanctions at the time and the kind of enforcement at \nthe workplace that was necessary.\n  Therefore, they left intact that jobs magnet that has driven so many \nto come here illegally in the past decades since. I do not want to see \na repeat of that failure. That is why I cannot support the legislation \nwithout these changes.\n  We have before us a historic opportunity. We have a real chance to \nfix this broken system and help curtail illegal immigration. It goes \nwithout saying that in the world of partisan politics, such \nopportunities are pretty rare. Time and again, we have seen reform \nefforts held hostage by politics. During the last few weeks, we \nhave been reminded once again how difficult it is to achieve consensus \non issues relating to immigration reform.\n\n  But this system is broken, the legal system and the illegal system. \nSo we ought to take this opportunity to fix it, but we have to really \nfix it. It is our responsibility to ensure that the reform legislation \npassed by the Senate includes policies that will actually work. We are \nnot operating in a vacuum. Not only are the people of this country \nwatching us, but the House of Representatives is watching too.\n  To ensure that effective workplace enforcement provisions actually \nbecome law, E-Verify must be prominent in our efforts and central to \nour debate. We must make certain the House understands that a more \neffective E-Verify is perhaps the most crucial element of successful \nreform and that real workplace enforcement remains a priority during \ntheir deliberations, as well as an eventual conference between the \nHouse and Senate to work out a final package.\n  A separate debate and a vote on this amendment is essential to \nsending that strong message to the House. They need to know one way or \nthe other whether there is strong bipartisan support for E-Verify. I \nbelieve there will be. I believe, therefore, that maximizes the chance \nof it being in the final product. Politically, if supporters want this \nlegislation to have a chance at passing the House and becoming law, we \nhave to make sure it is focused on preventing new illegal immigration \nas much as it is on adjusting the status of those currently living in \nthe shadows. I do not see how we can make that claim if E-Verify is not \nstrengthened, if it is included only in passing, if turning off the \njobs magnet is treated as an afterthought.\n  That is the sort of thinking that doomed the 1986 reform. It is this \nsort of approach that may doom this reform before it has even had a \nchance to be enacted. I am certain everyone engaged in this debate has \nthe best of intentions, but we have to ensure those intentions do not \nlead us down a path that we repeat the mistakes of 1986.\n  That is why we have to have a vote on this amendment. The Portman-\nTester E-Verify strengthening amendment is critical to the success of \nthis bill. I would like to be able to support reform of a broken \nimmigration system. An immigration system that invites the best and \nbrightest to come to our shores and seek a better life is what this \ncountry is all about. It is part of our promise. It is one of the \nreasons the United States has long been called a beacon of hope and \nopportunity for the rest of the world.\n  But I have given assurances to my constituents, the same assurances I \nknow many in this Chamber have made; that is, that I cannot vote for \nthis legislation unless I am convinced it will work. I cannot support \nreform that does not adequately address the problem of illegal \nimmigration and provides adequate enforcement; at the border, yes, but \nalso at the workplace. Without a stronger E-Verify system, I am \nconvinced this legislation will ultimately fail.\n  I know many of my colleagues feel the same way. That is why I believe \nif this amendment were brought up for a vote, it would not only pass, \nbut it would pass with a strong bipartisan vote. I am simply asking for \nthat vote. Let's make strong and effective E-Verify part of immigration \nreform. Let's accomplish something of which we can be proud, something \nthat fixes the problem this country has struggled with for decades, \nsomething we can hold up to the American people of how Washington is \nsupposed to work, as proof the Republicans and Democrats, working \ntogether with mutual respect and in a bipartisan fashion, can achieve \nmeaningful results.\n  That is what this amendment is all about. I certainly hope it can \nbecome part of this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/24/senate-section/article/S5101-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
