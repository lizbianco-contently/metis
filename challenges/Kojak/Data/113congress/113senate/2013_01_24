Mr. President, I do not know if you know anyone who \nhas climbed to the top of Mount Everest, but I am told it is quite an \nundertaking. It apparently took Sir Edmund Hillary several weeks to do \nit back in the 1950s. I am told my friends across the aisle could have \nscaled Everest almost 300 times in the nearly 4 years\n\n[[Page S234]]\n\nthat have gone by since they last passed a budget. They could have \ntaken 179 trips to the Moon or built three Pentagons.\n  Well, today it looks like that is all about to change. It is nice to \nsee that after years of playing budget peekaboo, Senate Democrats are \nfinally ready to take up their most basic of responsibilities--and only \na few weeks after the chairwoman of the Budget Committee indicated they \nmight skip it, for the fourth year in a row.\n  There is an indication now that the majority is committed to passing \na budget. What is unfortunate is that it has required so much pressure \nfor them to do so. It is in stark contrast to the House of \nRepresentatives, who have taken their duties very seriously.\n  Over there, committee hearings have been held, budget resolutions \nhave been marked up, amendments have been considered. More importantly, \nthe House has passed serious budgets annually, as the law requires. \nThey have laid out their priorities for the public to see: their plans \nto control spending, to save our most important social programs from \ncollapse, to reform an outdated anticompetitive Tax Code, and to \nstreamline government bureaucracies that are literally suffocating job \ncreation.\n  They have done their jobs while Senate Democrats have tried to keep \ntheir priorities a secret.\n  We know Senate Democrats do not like the House budgets. And we know \nthey do not even support the President's budgets--at least not with \ntheir votes. What we have not known for nearly 4 years is what they are \nfor because they have refused to put their plans for the country down \non paper and actually vote for them.\n  It is my hope the Democrats' sudden interest in passing a budget is \nnot just another attempt to actually raise taxes. As I have said \nrepeatedly, we are done with the revenue issue. The President has \nalready said the so-called rich are now paying their ``fair share,'' \nand, of course, middle-income families are already on the hook for new \ntaxes as a result of ObamaCare.\n  So the question is, Who would be in the firing line this time? And at \nwhat cost?\n  Look, struggling families should not have to pick up the tab again \nfor Washington's inability to live within its means. We need to start \nsolving the actual problem, which is spending, and we need to do it \ntogether.\n  So if--and I say if--Democrats are finally ready to confront the \nmassive fiscal and economic challenges facing our country, and to do so \nin a serious way, I assure them they will find partners on this side of \nthe aisle.\n  As for the debt limit, there is no need to wait for final resolution \nof the House's short-term legislation before we start putting a long-\nterm debt reduction solution together in the Senate. If the bill the \nHouse passed yesterday is signed into law, Congress will have another 3 \nmonths to take the debt challenge--to take it on seriously--but that \ndoes not mean we should wait a minute longer to start working on it. \nThere is no reason, for instance, that the Finance Committee should not \nbegin preparing the critical spending reforms that will be necessary, \nfor example, to get my vote and the vote of many of my colleagues for \nany kind of long-term increase in the debt ceiling.\n  So let's get the process moving. No more brinksmanship. No more last-\nminute deals. The American people have already had to wait 4 years--4 \nyears--for a budget from Senate Democrats. They should not have to wait \nnearly as long for us to confront a debt that threatens the economy, \nour jobs, and the future of our Nation.\n  Yesterday I laid out the realities of the fiscal challenges we face \nas a country. We have delayed facing them long enough. Let's put the \npolitics aside and finally do the work we were sent here to do.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of a \ncritical issue for my State; that is, much needed wildfire relief.\n  I wish to be more specific. Colorado has been in dire need of \nemergency watershed protection funds since fires raged in my State just \n6 months ago. Just 6 months ago we were in the news not only in our \ncountry but around the world because of fires in our State.\n  This is an important issue, one of the most important issues \nconfronting my State because the last fire season was the worst, \nliterally, on record. Although the fires no longer burn, the threats \nthey pose to entire communities persist long after the final embers are \nextinguished. Literally, hundreds of thousands of Coloradans remain \nvulnerable to flooding and tainted water supplies in the aftermath of \nthese fires.\n  To people not from the West, the reason why this is an emergency may \nnot be immediately clear, so let me explain. In my State, the Hyde Park \nand the Waldo Canyon fires--these are two fires that were all over the \nnews--tragically took lives, burned more than 100,000 acres, and led to \ncatastrophic property loss. President Obama declared them national \ndisasters, and he actually came to Colorado and joined me and the rest \nof the delegation to visit the scenes of destruction, where over 300 \nhomes were destroyed in Colorado's second largest city, Colorado \nSprings.\n  But that initial impact in those initial scenes could pale in \ncomparison to threats these communities will face in the coming days, \nmonths, and years. Why is that so? Because once a mountainside is \nstripped of all its trees and foliage and the soil is burned down to \nbedrock, there is nothing left to hold back the water and debris as it \nraces downhill toward our communities.\n  Without rehabilitation and restoration, the watersheds that provide \nmunicipal and agricultural water are at risk from landslides, flooding, \nand erosion. In turn, that could result in serious infrastructure \ndamage, water supply disruptions, and even loss of life.\n  Stabilizing and protecting these communities' watersheds is simply \nthe right thing to do and, moreover--and this is important--taking \naction now is also fiscally responsible. Quite simply, if we do not do \nthe repairs now, we will pay more later.\n  When Coloradans came to Senator Bennet and me to share these needs \nconfronting our State, we immediately went to work. We delivered on the \npromise of providing fire relief when the Senate passed the emergency \nsupplemental spending bill in December of last year, which also \nprovided much needed relief funds for Hurricane Sandy victims. That was \na bipartisan bill supported by Senate Republicans and Democrats alike. \nBut the Republicans in the House regrettably gutted the bill and sent \nback legislation that explicitly cut out wildfire relief.\n  In that context, let me make one point absolutely clear. This is an \nemergency. Some people question the need for funding and have asked why \nwe wouldn't limit dollars to just Hurricane Sandy areas, such as the \nbill does before us today. The short answer is it is a fiscally smart \nthing to do, the right thing to do, and the fair thing to do.\n  This bill is an emergency appropriations bill for all national \ndisasters, not just Hurricane Sandy. It is our best hope of seeing \nwildfire relief.\n  I emphatically note the Colorado emergencies occurred before \nHurricane Sandy, and the West should not have to continue to wait. Very \nfew emergency supplemental bills pass Congress. This bill is passing \nnow, and it should include aid for Colorado and other States across our \ncountry.\n  We, as Americans, are in this together. When deadly disasters strike, \nwe all support each other. I know the Presiding Officer's home State of \nHawaii has experienced natural disasters. We stand together when we get \ninto these situations. That is why I am so frustrated that the House of \nRepresentatives dismissed Colorado's needs and\n\n[[Page S235]]\n\nruined our chances, the West's chances, of immediate wildfire relief \nwhen lawmakers there failed to include emergency watershed protection \nfunding for Colorado in this disaster relief legislation.\n  This neglect is particularly disappointing, because if the House had \nquickly taken up the Senate-passed disaster assistance bill at the end \nof last year, we would not be in this desperate position today. I say \nthis somewhat reluctantly; I served in the House for 10 years. But I \nhave to say the House is setting a dangerous precedent of arbitrarily \nlegislating disaster relief funds. Communities across this country, and \nnot just those affected by Hurricane Sandy, are at risk of catastrophic \nflooding and contaminated drinking water.\n  But House Republicans are either sending a message that the West \ndoesn't matter or saying they don't care about certain communities once \nthe TV cameras are focused elsewhere.\n  What is the latest development in this ongoing fight to help wildfire \nvictims? Yesterday, I introduced an amendment to the House-passed \ndisaster relief legislation that would help national disaster areas \nrepair their drinking water supplies and the systems that back up those \nwater supplies. This amendment would not add a single cent to the bill \nand instead simply reverses the House's decision to exclude all States \nother than those affected by Hurricane Sandy.\n  No one questions that we need to help hurricane victims in the \nNortheast. But wildfire relief is not pork. I will say that again. \nWildfire relief is not pork. Colorado's record-setting wildfires in \n2012 displaced tens of thousands, destroyed more than 600 homes \nstatewide and tragically resulted in deaths. Wildfires destroy \ncommunities, and their devastation persists for decades.\n  These restoration projects of which I speak must get started now \nbefore our spring snow melt sends tons of ash and sediment into our \nwater supplies and buries homes and infrastructure under mudslides and \nfloodwaters.\n  As I said earlier, I know these fires may seem to be old news for \nsome, but Coloradans are living under the ongoing threats every day. I \nwish to remind all of my colleagues that in the past the Natural \nResources Conservation Services, the NRCS, had the flexibility to \nprovide EWP assistance for earlier disasters before moving on to the \nneeds created by subsequent events.\n  As of December, 2012, an estimated $47 million was needed to mitigate \ndamaged watersheds in the aftermath of other Presidentially declared \nStafford Act disaster areas in Arizona, Colorado, Louisiana, Florida, \nMinnesota, Mississippi, New York, Utah, and Wisconsin, North, South, \nEast, and West.\n  Of the $180 million the House approved for Sandy-related emergency \nwatershed protection relief, only $30 million has been requested. Yet \nthe House bill is saying other communities cannot have access to these \nfunds to protect their own people. It is senselessly wasteful to leave \nthese other communities behind to suffer the effects of less-recent \ndisasters, whether they faced wildfire, hurricane or flood.\n  Mr. President, I am not being an alarmist. Coloradans unfortunately \nhave already experienced some of these effects. For example, the \nusually crystal-clear Poudre River has been flowing black--literally \nflowing black due to ash and runoff from the fires. This forced the \ndownstream city of Fort Collins to shut off its water intake for over \n100 days. Senator Bennet was on site just a week ago, and the pictures \nwere tragic and they compel action.\n  Further downstream on that important water course, the Poudre, the \ncity of Greeley shut off its water intakes for 36 days and is still \nonly able to take a small fraction of its normal intake.\n  I have a photo here that shows a water main that supplies 75 percent \nof the backup drinking water supply for the city of Colorado Springs, \nour second largest city, south of Denver. This pipeline used to be \nburied 8 feet deep but is now exposed due to runoff. It has been \nexposed because of the runoff from the fire area, and, of course, it \nwill be exposed to more runoff.\n  You can see the effect of what is happening after these fires. How \nmuch more of an emergency do we need, when our most basic resource--\ndrinking water supplies for three of Colorado's largest cities and its \nfamilies and businesses--is threatened?\n  Let me share one more example. The flood potential in the burned \nareas is now 20 times higher than before the fire, which means that \nareas are experiencing 100-year floods from the same amount of rainfall \nthat would have caused a 5-year flood before the wildfires.\n  Look at this photo. This is Highway 14, which is the major east-west \nartery through northern Colorado. This mudslide is one of many that \noccurred during one very minor rainstorm after the High Park fire. \nThese mudslides on our major roads put people, property, and commerce \nat risk. Already families in the Colorado Springs vicinity, which I \nmentioned earlier, have received at least four flash flood warnings \nsince the Waldo Canyon fire. Stabilizing this ground and restoring the \nburned areas on both Federal and private land is critical to public \nsafety, public health, and the prevention of another disaster.\n  So as I begin to close, I would just say, don't get me wrong, I \nsupport the recovery of the communities devastated by Hurricane Sandy, \nbut I want to ensure that my colleagues understand the gravity of the \nsituation we are facing in Colorado and in other States that are \nconfronting disaster needs. The Senate delivered when it came to \nproviding fire relief, in part because of my colleague Senator Bennet's \ngreat work on the Agriculture Committee, but the House unwisely sent us \na package that turns a blind eye to Colorado and the West. If we do not \nact soon, communities across this Nation will see unnecessary flood \nrisks, contaminated water supplies, and the potential looms for tragic \ndeaths caused by our inaction. That is simply not acceptable.\n  So when someone asks whether the EWP--the emergency watershed \nprotection provisions and program--is necessary, critical, or even an \nemergency, the answer is an emphatic yes. For many of our communities \nin Colorado, this is their No. 1 priority in Congress, and I, for one, \nam not going to let their critical needs go unmet. Mark my words. This \nis not an issue I am going to let die. It is not an issue Senator \nBennet will let die. We are going to keep at it until we stabilize \nthese soils, protect our water supplies, and stand up for the people of \nColorado and the people of our country.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore for his attention, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 7 \nminutes on the same topic as my colleague.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Colorado, for his remarks and for his commitment to this \nimportant issue, and I rise today to speak briefly about the disaster \nbill that is in front of the Senate and to address an issue of enormous \nimportance to the people of Colorado.\n  We have in front of us a disaster bill to respond to the widespread \ndamage caused by Hurricane Sandy along the east coast, and we should \nobviously pass this bill to help our fellow citizens in their time of \nneed. It is in that exact same spirit that the Senate passed a disaster \nrelief bill at the end of last year that helped victims of natural \ndisasters all across this country--not just the victims of Hurricane \nSandy but also the victims of the devastating wildfires in my home \nState of Colorado and other States across the West.\n  We worked very hard to get that money into the bill the Senate passed \nin December. With the leadership of Mark Udall, we were able to \nsuccessfully make the case that Colorado has a significant need for \nresources to help protect communities affected by the wildfires. We \nworked closely with the Senate Appropriations Committee, and they \nanswered Colorado's call for help, and I thank those Members--Members \nfrom both sides of the aisle--who supported us. That was hard to do. It \nwas hard to do, but in the end the idea that we are all in this \ntogether prevailed.\n  The House, however, let that bipartisan bill die at the end of last \nsession, and now Congress has to start anew. Now here we are, asked to \nconsider a\n\n[[Page S236]]\n\nHouse-passed bill that leaves Colorado behind, a bill where the House \narbitrarily stripped out the money that would help our struggling \ncommunities in Colorado, and we are told this bill is unamendable. We \nare told the House has drawn a line in the sand and won't take any \nchanges. Like my senior Senator, I am stunned by this and profoundly \ndisappointed.\n  So let me tell my colleagues what this means for the people of \nColorado. The Waldo Canyon and High Park fires in the summer of 2012 \nwere the first and second most destructive fires in Colorado's history. \nThey tragically resulted in the loss of life for several Coloradans. \nThe fires destroyed hundreds of homes and caused millions of dollars of \ndamage to critical infrastructure and some of the worst and most \nlasting damage to our watersheds. As anyone from Colorado or the West \nknows, our watersheds and the clean water they provide are the \nlifeblood of our communities.\n  Here is a hilltop that was completely devastated by the fires of 2012 \nand a road near Fort Collins that was overrun with sediment and debris \nin a mudslide after the High Park fire.\n  Here is the Poudre River after the fire, running completely black as \nthe sediment, ash, and soot are washed off the singed hillsides into \nthe water. This river provides drinking water for the cities of Fort \nCollins and Greeley, CO, home to one-quarter of a million people--home \nto 250,000 people--and home to agriculture and businesses that rely on \nhaving clean water to get through the day.\n  I recently met with the water providers at the treatment plant for \nthis area, situated just yards from the charred mountains. They showed \nme a mason jar of black water, just like this. It could have been \npulled directly from the Poudre. That is, unfortunately, because of our \ninaction and our foolishness, our shortsightedness, and that is what \ncommunities can expect if we don't start recovery work in these \nwatersheds.\n  The resources provided under the USDA's emergency watershed \nprotections--the EWP Program--would directly help these communities in \nColorado. We fought for those resources, for the EWP Program, in the \nSenate bill last December, and reason prevailed. Republicans and \nDemocrats came together and said: We understand the people of Colorado \nneed this; they need our help. And I again thank our friends on the \nSenate Appropriations Committee for helping to make that happen. Yet we \nstand here today with a bill that doesn't include these funds, the \nfunding stripped out, while an unmet need of $20 million persists in \nColorado alone. And it is not just our State, there are 51 other \nprojects across 19 other States that need these resources to recover \nfrom their disasters. This is a major national issue, and it is crazy \nthat we are standing here in this position today. Lest anybody think \nthis is a decision that somehow is fiscally disciplined, let me stand \non this floor and guarantee you that as these hillsides wash into the \nriver in the spring snowmelt, the cost of restoring these water \ntreatment plants, the cost of making sure we have clean water will \ndwarf the $20 million we are talking about today.\n  To conclude, it is incredibly unfortunate, given the history we have \nin this country of coming together after a disaster, that the House \nwould not follow our lead in the Senate and provide us these resources. \nThere are reasons we are the United States of America, and one of those \nreasons is that we come to each other's aid at moments of natural \ndisasters and help our friends and neighbors in other States. We make \nsure they get through to the next year.\n  Perhaps adding insult to injury is that funding for Colorado was \nstripped under the rationale, as I said, that the House was somehow \nbeing fiscally responsible, even though the exact opposite is true. The \nreality of this situation is that it is fiscally irresponsible because \nwe can say with 100 percent certainty that the cost of fixing these \nproblems later will be significantly more than it is now. So an ounce \nof prevention in this case is clearly worth a pound of cure. Any \nhousehold or small business understands that making these investments \ntoday is the right move, instead of just waiting for the next disaster \nto happen, instead of waiting for matters to get worse, although that \nis the habit of this town, as the Acting President pro tempore will \ncome to learn. The House just couldn't put rigid ideology aside and do \nsomething for the country as a whole.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to oppose the Sandy bill. We need to \nhelp our fellow citizens on the east coast. But this is a real head-\nscratcher for me and I know for the senior Senator from Colorado, even \nfor this place. We are going to continue to work with our colleagues in \nthe Senate to get these resources signed into law, but the fact is we \nhad it done. We had it done in the Senate, in a bipartisan way, with \nthe help of our friends on the Appropriations Committee and both \nRepublicans and Democrats on this Senate floor. The House of \nRepresentatives let Colorado down, and now we are going to have to go \nback and find a way to make it right.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/24/senate-section/article/S236-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S236-S238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE NATIONAL DEBT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in 2008, a prominent Democratic politician \nsaid that adding $4 trillion to the national debt was ``irresponsible \nand unpatriotic.''\n  In 2009, this same politician said, ``I refuse to leave our children \nwith a debt they cannot repay. We cannot simply spend as we please.''\n  Again, in 2010, this same individual said, ``It keeps me awake at \nnight looking at all that red ink.''\n  Then in 2011, he echoed the statements of the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen, when he said, ``The greatest long-\nterm threat to America's national security is America's debt.''\n  And then finally, in 2012, this same politician said he was running \nfor reelection ``to pay down our debt in a way that is balanced and \nresponsible.''\n  Well, you might have guessed who this was. These are statements made \nby President Barack Obama.\n  Unfortunately, the President's actions have not come close to \nmatching his own rhetoric. Since he took office, the gross national \ndebt has increased by nearly $6 trillion. Indeed, the President has \nserved at a time when we have accumulated far more debt than any other \nPresident in American history.\n  After spending his first term maxing out America's credit card, the \nPresident is demanding yet another increase in the debt limit. The \nPresident argues he is merely asking lawmakers to pay the bills that \nhave already been racked up. And he continues to blame others--\ncertainly not himself--for trillion-dollar annual deficits and \nskyrocketing debt. But he fails to acknowledge that his stimulus bill \nborrowed more than $1 trillion, increasing the debt by that amount; \nand, secondly, that Obamacare will spend more than $2 trillion in its \nfirst decade.\n  Those on this side of the aisle, Republicans, have shown our \nwillingness to pass a budget that stabilizes our public finances. \nIndeed, I applaud the reaction of the White House and of Democrats in \nthe Senate saying that for the first time since 2009 they are willing \nto take up and pass a budget in the Senate--the first time since 2009. \nIt is long overdue but welcome news.\n  Likewise, we are willing to make compromises--not on principle, but \nwe are willing to find common ground, and we are willing to take tough \nvotes. Indeed, that is part of the budget process because we know--\nwhether it is a family budget; whether it is a small business; whether \nit is a county, city, State or the Federal Government--priorities have \nto be established in a budget because we know they always involve tough \ndecisions: What is the most important? What do you have to have? What \nare the things you want but you need to delay because you don't have \nthe money to pay for it now? What are the things you would like to have \nbut you simply cannot afford?\n  Those are decisions that are made by every family in America on a \ndaily\n\n[[Page S237]]\n\nbasis, and the Federal Government, particularly the Senate, has not \nbeen willing to make those sorts of hard choices since 2009.\n  In this cloud I guess there is a silver lining. Finally, we are going \nto see some movement in the Senate which is long overdue. The only way, \nthough, to get the real spending cuts we need to bring our budget into \nbalance and real deficit reduction over the next 4 years is if the \nPresident takes the lead. This is not something Congress can do without \nthe President. We need the President's leadership and, indeed, that is \nsomething that many of us on a bipartisan basis have been looking for \nsince the Simpson-Bowles Commission report came down in December 2010. \nI am still astonished that rather than embrace that bipartisan \ncommission report--not all of which I agree with, by the way, but at \nleast it was a start. The President could have done something important \nthat had bipartisan support, and it actually would have enhanced his \nchances of getting reelected because people would have seen it as \nstatesmanship and leadership.\n  We have had an unfortunate set of experiences here as recently as the \nend of last year, New Year's Eve, because we approached a manufactured \ncrisis, a deadline known as the fiscal cliff. But I don't think anybody \nin America, certainly not anybody in this body, wants another 2 a.m. \nSenate vote--not because it is inconvenient, but because it is not a \ngood thing in the people's House, the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives, to be voting in the dark of night when people are not \nable to watch. Nobody wants another cliff hanger that weakens public \ntrust in our government or in our willingness to meet our \nresponsibilities. Most of all, no one wants another credit downgrade. \nThis is important.\n  The President talks about the importance of lifting the debt ceiling \nbecause he said we do not want to suffer another downgrade in our \ncredit standing. But, indeed, one of the reasons we have already \nsuffered a negative response to our credit rating is because we have \nnot dealt with the real problems that confront our country, the $16.4 \ntrillion in debt, and we have not come together in a bipartisan way to \nsave and preserve Social Security and Medicare and to keep the promises \nthat we have made to our seniors. That has caused the credit downgrade.\n  Most of all, what Americans want, I believe, is a serious, good-\nfaith, open, transparent discussion over America's long-term budget \nstrategy. They want both parties to work together. Ironically, the best \ntime to actually do that is when we have divided government, like we \nhave. They want both parties to demonstrate that we are capable of \nhaving an adult conversation about balancing our budget.\n  Unfortunately, the President has given very little indication that he \nis prepared to negotiate on these important issues. Indeed, his \ninaugural speech, eloquent as it was, barely mentioned the preeminent \nchallenge facing America today; that is, our $16.4 trillion debt and \nmillions, tens of millions of Americans either unemployed or \nunderemployed. The President barely touched on those issues.\n  Instead, at a recent press conference the President suggested that \ncertain unnamed Republicans really do not care about poor children, the \nelderly, or medical research. Rather than taking the high road of \nPresidential leadership, unfortunately, the President chose the low \nroad. This is the same President who frequently bemoans the poisonous \natmosphere and toxic partisanship of Washington, DC.\n  When President Obama is ready to quit slandering his opponents and \nquit knocking down straw men, when he is ready to make serious \narguments and serious compromises, we might finally be able to work \ntogether to make some real progress on long-term fiscal consolidation. \nAmericans are yearning for that kind of leadership. They are yearning \nto see real solutions to the challenges that face our country. They are \nlooking forward to seeing concrete proposals from the White House that \ncut spending and reduce our national debt.\n  The President said he wanted a balanced approach. He wanted revenue \nto go along with the cuts and the reform of Social Security and \nMedicare. The President got his pound of flesh in the fiscal cliff \nnegotiations. Unfortunately, because of the expiration of a number of \ntemporary tax provisions, taxes were going to go up in the $3 trillion-\nplus range, if Congress did nothing. We were able, fortunately, to \nmitigate some of that and to eliminate tax increases on the vast \nmajority of Americans and to make many temporary provisions permanent. \nBut it is going to require genuine leadership from the President, which \nI hope he will provide soon, because Americans cannot afford to wait \nmuch longer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my colleague \nfrom Texas. I want to add my thoughts to much the same issue. I rise, \nonce again, to address what I believe and what many believe is the most \nimportant issue that faces this Congress and faces the Nation as a \nwhole; that issue is, the out-of-control Federal Government spending \nthat continues to pile up unsustainable debt and threaten our economic \nfuture.\n  Both Republicans and Democrats and conservatives and liberals have \nacknowledged that unless we get the debt under control, we will \neventually reach a tipping point where investors either stop buying our \ndebt or insist on higher interest rates to account for their greater \nrisk. This can trigger a crisis of confidence, a crisis that would \nlikely happen if we do not take action, and take action soon to address \nthis problem.\n  We have witnessed what happens in a number of European nations. \nGreece comes to mind, of course. That country is in chaos based on \npromises made that cannot be kept, based on spending that could not be \ncovered, based on a country that defied the math and the laws of \neconomics. But it is not just Greece. I just heard earlier this morning \nthe latest numbers on unemployment in Spain: over 25 percent and rising \namong all workers, and for those under the age of 25--those coming out \nof universities and colleges and the educational system looking to \nstart their lives and begin their roles as breadwinners, the providers \nfor their families and holding down a job so they can participate in \nlife as people capable of paying their bills, buying a house, getting \nmarried, raising their children, and providing for their education--\nthat number for those young people is over 55 percent. More than one of \nevery two young people in Spain is without employment--on the streets, \nnothing to do, no job to go to every day.\n  We see the austerity measures having to be imposed in the United \nKingdom. Italy is in and out of the news in terms of its' financial \nstatus. There are questions about France, questions about other \ncountries. Germany is struggling along with very little growth, even \nthough it is seen as an economic provider and dynamo, at a level of \ngrowth which is so anemic there are questions raised as to whether and \nhow much it can do to help the European situation. But even aside from \nthe potentially catastrophic debt bomb that continues to tick away, if \nwe fail to get spending under control in the short term, our economy \nwill remain in the doldrums because of this cloud of economic \nuncertainty it creates among businesses, investors, and consumers--\ncreated by our inability to grasp the fiscal plight of our excessive \nand reckless spending.\n  The fact is that we are not going to be able to get our economy out \nof the rut we have been in unless we tackle the Federal Government's \nspending addiction. Washington's reckless spending and failure to \nproduce even a budget plan over the last 4 years undermines confidence \nin our economic prospects and causes investors, businesses, and \nconsumers to sit on the sidelines rather than take risks with their \nmoney. As my colleagues know very well, our spending addiction in \nWashington has at long last led us to the point where we now face the \nprocess of record deficits as far as the eye can see into the future, a \nspiraling Federal debt that is now nearly $16.5 trillion, and a \npossible further downgrading of the credit rating of the United States.\n  Were interest rates not being held at historically, artificially low \nlevels by the Fed we might already be facing our day of reckoning. \nAccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, even a 1 \npercentage point increase in interest rates would add $1.3 trillion to \nour debt over a period of 10 years. If borrowing costs return to their \n20-year\n\n[[Page S238]]\n\naverage, which certainly they will at some point, deficits over the \nnext 10 years will increase by $4.9 trillion. If interest rates were to \nrise to the level of the 1980s, the total U.S. debt in 2021 would be \n$5.3 trillion greater. That is $5.3 trillion in new debt that would \noccur without any changes in spending or taxes. Interest rates would \nsimply drive our debt out of control.\n  Make no mistake that this is a spending problem and not a revenue \nproblem. The President campaigned on the false narrative that taking \nmore from the top earners would alleviate the economic burdens we face. \nAs a result of winning the election, he was able to get higher taxes on \nAmericans at the higher end of the income scale. But no one is fooled \nand math does not lie. Increasing taxes on higher income earners is not \ngoing to make much of a dent in our $1 trillion deficits.\n  The fact is, even if the President had received all of the revenue \nfrom the expiration of all of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts in tax rates, \nFederal revenue would have come in at this historical average of just \nover 18 percent of GDP, but spending continues to rise, on average, 23 \npercent of GDP over the same period of time--more than 2 points ahead \nof its historical average. Thus, the problem: the fact that we are \nspending more than we can afford. We are spending more than we receive.\n  Actions speak louder than words. President Obama may talk about the \nneed to rein in spending--although lately he has even rejected that--\nbut his administration refuses to act. Instead, the President started \noff his second term doubling down on--what? The need for more taxes. \nAre not the American people being taxed to death? It is not just the \nFederal income tax, it is the State tax added to that, it is the sales \ntax, it is the excise tax, it is the car tax, it is the alcohol tax--it \nis any number of things that add up to a burden of taxation on the \nAmerican people that is severely hampering our ability to grow and our \neconomy to provide the necessary employment and the necessary jobs for \npeople so desperately in need of and looking for that work.\n  While the President has not truly recognized that spending is the \nproblem, the business community has. A recent survey of chief \nexecutives said they are considerably less optimistic about the short-\nterm growth process for their companies than they were just a year \nago. The reason is uncertainty. The business community does not have \nconfidence in the growth prospects for our country because there is \nlittle confidence that Washington can get its act together and deal \nwith the spending crisis that is dragging down this economy.\n\n  In an atmosphere of uncertainty, investors, businesses, and consumers \nproceed with caution. They hold back in making significant investments \nor expenditures. Also, they don't hire people, and they will not until \nthey get more clarity about the future and our ability to address our \nproblems.\n  As I traveled across Indiana and talked to business owners' large, \nsmall, and in between, as well as farmers, to owners of restaurants, to \nCEOs of major companies, they all said the same thing. They all said \nthe lack of certainty and the prospects for the future--unless we get \ncontrol of our spending--are such that they have no choice but to just \nsit on their hands and hold back.\n  The big credit agencies are saying the same thing. They know that \nwithout significant spending reform and spending cuts the United States \nwill be unable to pay its bills at some point. Refusing to make the \ntough choices now just hastens the day of reckoning when markets decide \nthe United States has become a bad credit risk. Standard & Poor's, \nMoody's, and Fitch Ratings all have a negative outlook on the United \nStates' prospects and are threatening a further downgrade of our credit \nrating unless we get our fiscal house in order. Other downgrades would \nfollow in short order: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as many \nState governments. As a result, this would irreparably damage many \nState and local pension funds. They are all at risk.\n  It is a nightmare scenario that is not far away from happening if we \ndon't start getting a handle on our reckless, runaway spending. We need \nto get a handle on it now not later. There is no more reason for \nexcuses. We have done all we can on the revenue side. The President got \nwhat he wanted. He got his taxes, but now is the time when we need to \nfocus on the real problem, which is runaway spending. Big spending and \nsmall, everything from the need to reform our mandatory entitlement \nspending to the smaller, duplicative, wasteful, yet important, spending \nthat Washington specializes in and is not necessary particularly at a \ntime of austerity.\n  I intend to get into some more detail about spending reforms in \nfuture speeches, but the overall point is undeniable: Unless we get our \nspending under control, we are going to continue to stagger forward \nwith a weak economy, high unemployment, and draw ever closer to the day \nwhen our investors and creditors lose faith in our ability to pay our \ndebts.\n  The next time I come to the floor--and I am not sure when since it \ndepends on what our schedule might be--I want to talk not about what \nDan Coats is saying, not what the Senator from Indiana is saying; I \nwant to talk about what others are saying. I want to hear from those \nwho are not saying it from a political perspective or trying to reflect \ntheir party's position but from those who spend their time analyzing \nour current situation. I want to hear from those who understand the map \nof where we are and what the implications and consequences are for our \ncountry. I don't just want to hear statements by those of us here but \nstatements made by others and the importance and need for us to address \nthis most serious of problems and challenges.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask that following my remarks, the senior \nSenator from Rhode Island be granted permission to speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/24/senate-section/article/S238-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S238-S240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEDICARE AND MEDICAID REFORM\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a matter that is of the \ngreatest importance. Our Nation is on an unsustainable fiscal path. The \nnational debt stands at a current whopping $16.4 trillion with annual \ntrillion-dollar deficits having become the norm with the current \nadministration. Put simply, unless we change our course, our debt \nthreatens to cripple our economy and saddle future generations with \nbills they will not be able to pay.\n  Federal spending has been growing and will continue to grow at a rate \nthat outpaces government revenues by leaps and bounds. Despite some \nclaims to the contrary, the difference simply cannot be made up by \nincreasing taxes. We do not face a problem with not taxing enough in \nthis country; we have a spending problem.\n  Moreover, in the runup to the fiscal cliff, we had a national \ndiscussion on increasing taxes. Taxes were increased and the revenue \ndiscussion is done. It is time to turn our attention to our country's \nrunaway spending problem and our unsustainable entitlement programs. \nThe only way we can make meaningful progress toward reducing our \ndeficits and eliminating our massive debt is to focus on the main \ndrivers of these problems. The main drivers of our debts and deficits \nis not a lack of revenue; it is our entitlement programs.\n  Let's take a look at our two main health care entitlements, Medicare \nand Medicaid. In just the next 10 years, the Federal Government will \nspend more than $12 trillion on Medicare and Medicaid. Let's put that \nin perspective. That is $12 trillion on just two programs. That is more \nthan the entire economies of Germany, France, the UK, Italy, and Spain \ncombined. If we do not act to slow the rate of growth in these two \nprograms, they will consume roughly 10 percent of our entire economy by \nthe year 2035.\n\n  Medicare, by itself, spent nearly $480 billion last year. Over the \nnext 10 years, it will spend more than $7 trillion. In fact, by the end \nof that same 10 years, we will be spending more on Medicare than on our \nentire national defense. The prospects for Medicare solvency only get \nworse as time goes on. Over the long term, Medicare has nearly $39 \ntrillion in unfunded liability. That is $328,404 for every American\n\n[[Page S239]]\n\nhousehold in this country. Fixing Medicare will not just be a matter of \ntrimming off some fat and waste. The problems with the program are \nsystemic.\n  Let's talk about Medicaid for a moment. Things are not much better \nwith that program. The Federal Government spent $261 billion on \nMedicaid in 2012 and the States themselves spent about $196 billion, \nbringing the total cost of the program to $457 billion in a single \nyear. In the next 10 years, Federal Medicaid spending as a share of the \nU.S. economy is set to grow by 37 percent. The Federal Government will \nspend more than $4.4 trillion on the program over that time.\n  According to the National Governors Association, Medicaid represents \nthe single largest portion of total State spending, which accounted for \nan estimated 23.6 percent of State budgets last year. Between Medicare \nand Medicaid, we have two programs that threaten to swallow not only \nthe Federal Government but State governments as well. We simply cannot \nafford to keep these programs running on autopilot, nor can we afford \nto tinker around the edges when we talk about reform. If we are serious \nabout addressing our Nation's debt, Medicare and Medicaid need \nstructural reforms.\n  Today, I wish to lay out five specific reform proposals that could \nhelp to rein in entitlement spending and put our Nation on a better \nfiscal course. These are reasonable, rational ideas that have all \nenjoyed bipartisan support over the years. I believe they should be \nincluded in any deficit reduction package.\n  No. 1: We need to adjust the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67. \nRaising the retirement age is simply common sense. It would reflect \nincreases in life expectancy and align Medicare eligibility with that \nof Social Security. This idea was supported by the Simpson-Bowles \nCommission, and it was included in the bipartisan deficit negotiations \nin 2011.\n  In addition, prominent Democrats, including former Senate Budget \nCommittee chairman Kent Conrad and House Budget Committee ranking \nmember Chris Van Hollen, have expressed support for raising the \nretirement age as part of the discussion on retirement reform. Raising \nthe retirement age is not just a Republican idea. Members of both \nparties have supported it.\n  No. 2: We need to modernize the Medigap Program by limiting \nsupplemental Medicare insurance plans from covering initial out-of-\npocket expenses for Medicare beneficiaries. In 2010, on average, \nMedicare made $9,765 per beneficiary. The average out-of-pocket expense \ncoming from copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles for beneficiaries \nwas $1,679. Almost 90 percent of Medicare recipients use some kind of \nsupplemental insurance to offset some of their out-of-pocket costs. \nAlmost 30 percent of beneficiaries have so-called Medigap policies that \nprovide first-dollar coverage.\n  Multiple studies have found that this 30 percent--the ones with \nMedigap insurance policies--use about 25 percent more services than \nthose without similar coverage. This overutilization of services leads \ndirectly to higher costs for all seniors on Medicare. Limiting first-\ndollar coverage will encourage seniors to make better health care \nchoices and ensure the highest quality outcome while lowering costs for \nthe entire Medicare Program.\n  This policy was supported by the Simpson-Bowles Commission, and it \nwas part of the Biden-Cantor deficit reduction negotiations in 2011. In \naddition, the Democratic members of the House Ways and Means Committee \nincluded this idea as part of a set of cost-sharing reforms in their \n2011 deficit reduction proposal. The President's own 2011 deficit \nreduction package included a similar proposal to reduce costs \nassociated with Medigap insurance plans.\n  Once again, this is a policy that both Democrats and Republicans \nshould be willing to get behind.\n  No. 3: We need to simplify Medicare beneficiary cost sharing while \nprotecting seniors from catastrophic health costs. Currently, Medicare \ncost sharing--copays, deductibles, et cetera--varies significantly \ndepending on the type of service being provided. Beneficiaries now have \nseparate deductibles for inpatient care under Part A and physician and \noutpatient services under Part B. This overly complex benefit structure \nis difficult for beneficiaries to navigate, and it promotes \noverutilization. By streamlining the cost sharing and creating a single \ncombined deductible for both Part A and Part B, we can make it easier \nfor seniors to use Medicare more efficiently and reduce costs \nassociated with overutilization.\n  At the same time, we should institute an annual catastrophic cap to \nprotect seniors who face serious health events which will provide \nseniors with much needed financial security. This was another policy \nsupported by the Simpson-Bowles Commission. It was also a part of the \nCoburn-Lieberman Medicare proposal introduced in the last Congress. It \nis, in every sense, a bipartisan proposal.\n  No. 4: We need to increase quality and lower costs on Medicare by \nintroducing competitive bidding into the program. By allowing private \nhealth plans to compete with traditional fee-for-service Medicare, we \ncan provide seniors with their guaranteed Medicare benefit while at the \nsame time reducing costs and improving the quality of care.\n  Entitlement reforms should draw upon market-oriented solutions. \nIncreased competition will allow seniors to choose for themselves based \non transparent cost and quality information--if they want to use the \ntraditional Medicare program or a private health plan. This is the type \nof structure seniors enjoy under the Medicare Part D which has \ncontrolled costs and is very popular among beneficiaries.\n\n  This is not a Republican fantasy or a conservative plan to gut \nMedicare, as some may claim. Democrats have supported this approach \nover the years as well. President Clinton proposed a major set of \nMedicare reforms in 1999 that included a version of a premium support \nsystem. Alice Rivlin, OMB Director under President Clinton, recently \nworked with Senator Pete Domenici on a Medicare reform bill that \nincluded a defined premium support plan. In addition, Democratic \nSenator Ron Wyden worked with the House Budget Committee Chairman Paul \nRyan to develop a similar proposal in the 112th Congress. So while \nthere may be some resistance to this particular idea, it has enjoyed \nbipartisan support.\n  Finally, No. 5: We need to strengthen Medicaid for patients and \nStates through realistic reforms. Setting per capita limits on Federal \nMedicaid spending would put the Medicaid Program on a sustainable \nbudget and, when combined with increased flexibility for patient-\ncentered reforms at the State level, would reduce costs and improve \npatient care across the board. As with other ideas I have mentioned, \nthis is a bipartisan proposal.\n  In 1995, President Clinton introduced a Medicaid reform plan that \nincluded a per capita cap on Federal Medicaid spending. At that time, \nall 46 Democratic Senators, including several who are still serving \ntoday, signed a letter to President Clinton expressing support for this \nproposal. In addition, in October of last year, former Democratic \nSenate majority leader Tom Daschle publicly expressed support for per \ncapita caps on Medicaid spending as a way of ``guaranteeing the \nbenefits of the Medicaid program.''\n  So there we have it--a concrete, bipartisan approach to reforming our \nhealth care entitlement programs and restoring fiscal sanity here in \nWashington.\n  I know it is popular to talk in abstractions around here when it \ncomes to reforming our entitlement system, but these are specific ideas \nthat have enjoyed the support of both Republicans and Democrats over \nthe years. This is precisely what has been missing from the current \ndebate over deficit reduction.\n  Entitlement reform is not a matter of choice; it is a necessity. That \nbeing the case, it is not a Republican or Democratic issue; it is a \nchallenge facing our entire country. My proposals, which have all \nenjoyed bipartisan support, will help ensure future generations have a \nviable and sustainable safety net in place. Far from being offered out \nof any sense of ``suspicion'' about government safety net programs, as \na cynic might suggest, my proposals are designed to help sustain these \nimportant programs.\n\n[[Page S240]]\n\n  I believe these types of proposals are a good starting point for a \nserious discussion about entitlement reform. I hope my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle will want to be part of this conversation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to address the issue of gun \nviolence. I think my colleague from Rhode Island is going to be \naddressing this issue on which he has shown tremendous leadership. It \nwill be a continuing issue over the next several weeks as we get ready \nto consider legislation.\n  My approach is one of common sense and moderation. I come to this \nissue as a hunter, as a kid who grew up on a ranch having guns all my \nlife, being very familiar and comfortable with guns and to this day \nenjoying hunting, although my hunting has primarily been limited to \nquail, but I enjoy that so much with my son, although I might say that \nI was hunting Burmese pythons in the Everglades last week, but people \ndo not have to hunt them with guns. Since they are taking over the \nEverglades, they are caught and then euthanized and, hopefully, we can \nstop this proliferation of Burmese pythons that are eating up \neverything in the Everglades, including alligators. But that is a \nsubject for another day.\n  The subject before us is gun violence. Is there anybody who does not \nrealistically, with common sense, think we should do a criminal \nbackground check for anyone who is purchasing a gun? That is about as \ncommon sense, as moderate a position one can take given the \ncircumstances we find ourselves in with people who go in and start \nslaughtering innocent children. Maybe that is the one thing we can get \nover 60 votes for in this Chamber in order to pass and maybe they will \nconsider it in the other body, the House of Representatives.\n  Secondly, is there anybody who thinks we should have clips which I \nshowed with the sheriff of Orange County in Orlando last week--clips \nthat are this long and hold 60 rounds? The law I voted to extend back \nin 2004 said clips of more than 10 would not be allowed. Is that not \nreasonable? Is that not common sense? I know how people say, Oh, a \nperson can change a clip in a few seconds. But should we make it easier \nfor a killer so he does not have to change the clip?\n  The question is one of balance, one of common sense. When I go \nhunting, I don't have any need for anything more than 10; indeed, I \ndon't have any need for anything more than a few. In quail hunting, of \ncourse, if it is an over-and-under, a hunter has two shells because \nthat is basically the number of shots he is going to get off when the \nquail flush.\n  The third element is also one of common sense. The sheriff of Orange \nCounty and I held up two guns they confiscated from people using them \nfor criminal purposes. I held up an AK-47. The sheriff held up a \nBushmaster. The AK-47 is a derivative of the same weapon used by the \nNorth Vietnamese against us in the Vietnam war. I simply asked the \nquestion: Are these guns for hunting or are they for killing? The \nlegitimate answer is they are not for hunting, they are for killing. \nThat is what they were designed for, as an assault-type weapon in a \ncombat circumstance.\n\n  So how do we approach the legitimate recognition of the second \namendment, the right to bear arms, with assault weapons? It seems as \nthough among people of good will using common sense and moderation, we \ncan come to some definitions that would ban those types of assault \nweapons.\n  I wish to conclude my remarks by saying this is a lot of politics. \nSome of us are portrayed, as a result of taking this position of \nmoderation and common sense, as if we were not for the second \namendment. That is totally false. Of course I support the second \namendment. I just gave my history: growing up in the country, having \nguns all my life, and still having a number of guns in my house. I \nsupport the second amendment. I do so in light of the circumstances in \nour society today that have changed.\n  My final comment: In all of the politics going on about this issue, \nthe advocacy organization called the National Rifle Association is not \nthe same NRA that grew up representing the interests of hunters and \nsportsmen. It has become an advocacy group for gun manufacturers that \nwant to sell more of their manufactured products. So it becomes an \neconomic issue to people instead of one of common sense and moderation.\n  We need to draw that distinction. This organization--the NRA--has \ngone to the extreme not only, as we saw, in their response to the \nelementary school killings in Connecticut, but they have gone to the \nextreme in my State by advocating in the State legislature getting in \nbetween the doctor-patient relationship as to what a doctor can inquire \nabout with regard to a patient concerning a wound that might have come \nfrom a gunshot.\n  This is extremism in the extreme. We ought to call it what it is as \nwe are debating this issue.\n  Moderation and common sense is the answer to this issue facing us.\n  Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from Rhode Island for his \ncourtesies extended, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Florida is welcome. It was one of my \ngreat pleasures to sit next to him on the Intelligence Committee for \nthese many years. To tell a brief story, whenever Senator Nelson said, \nWell, I am just a country lawyer from Florida, everybody on the \ncommittee perked up, because they had learned from experience that one \nof the more withering and devastating cross-examinations of a witness \nwas about to ensue. It is always my pleasure to extend courtesy to the \nSenator from Florida.\n  I am here once again to talk about climate change. Alarms are \nringing, including the voices of the overwhelming majority of \nscientists, and indeed the voices of the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans. But here in Congress, it is still time for us to wake up.\n  Climate change is not a problem that will go away; human activity is \ndriving global change. Climate change is not a problem that can wait; \nwe see its effects all around us. But climate change is a problem that \ncan be solved.\n  We can and we must leave a healthy environment and clean energy \nsources to our children and grandchildren. The missing piece is \nCongress. Congress is sleepwalking through history. It is time to wake \nup.\n  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has confirmed \nthat 2012 was the hottest year in the contiguous United States on \nrecord, ever. This one wasn't a close call; it did not come down to the \nwire; 2012 was a full degree Fahrenheit higher than the previous record \nyear--a full degree Fahrenheit higher than the previous record year. To \nput that into context, 1 degree may not sound like a lot, but when you \naverage it across an entire year, it is a huge shift. The previous \nwarmest U.S. year on record, 1998, was 4.2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer \nthan the coldest year on record, 1917. If you take the warmest year on \nrecord--1998 until now--and you take the coldest year on record--1917--\nthe entire span between them is only 4.2 degrees Fahrenheit. This is a \njump of a full degree in Fahrenheit in just 1 year. By the way, 2.1 \ndegrees Fahrenheit over 2011 is a seriously big change.\n  We are just starting to heat up. The most optimistic estimate for the \nend of the century is a 2-degrees-Fahrenheit increase. That is the most \noptimistic estimate. More likely scenarios--ones that assume continued \ncurrent levels of greenhouse gas emissions--project for the continental \nUnited States an increase of between 4 and 10 degrees Fahrenheit. \nWorldwide, last year was the 36th year in a row with an annual global \ntemperature above the 20th-century average--36 straight years above \naverage. In fact, the 12 years of this century, of the 21st century, \n2000 to 2012, every single one of them is in the\n\n[[Page S241]]\n\ntop 14 warmest global averages on record. Mr. President, 12 for 12, \nthey are in the top 14 warmest global average years on record. Since \n1970, global average temperatures have increased more than one-quarter \nof a degree Fahrenheit every decade.\n  As the vast majority of climate scientists have confirmed, natural \nclimate forces alone simply do not explain this global temperature \ntrend, nor do they explain regional temperature trends. They do not \nexplain the land surface temperature trends. They do not explain the \nocean surface temperature trends. Only models that include the \ngreenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide emissions explain these \ntrends. When I use the word ``explain,'' I use it in its scientific \nsense--i.e., establish a significantly, statistically meaningful \ncorrelation between the two.\n  The United States does a regular national climate assessment. The \nassessment is based on scientific, peer-reviewed research and technical \nreports from top scientists at Federal agencies such as NOAA and NASA, \nthe Departments of Agriculture and Energy, and the U.S. Geological \nSurvey. Now, bear in mind that NASA scientists have just put a rover on \nto the surface of the planet Mars. These aren't people who get things \nvery badly wrong.\n  The recent draft assessment paints a clear picture of what is \nhappening in America right now. It says:\n\n       U.S. average temperature has increased by about 1.5 degrees \n     Fahrenheit since 1895; more than 80 percent of this increase \n     has occurred since 1980. The most recent decade was the \n     nation's hottest on record.\n\n  The National Climate Assessment is also required by law to project \nwhat is to come. The draft assessment says:\n\n       U.S. temperatures will continue to rise, with the next few \n     decades projected to see another 2 degrees Fahrenheit to 4 \n     degrees Fahrenheit of warming in most areas. The amount of \n     warming by the end of the century is projected to correspond \n     closely to the cumulative global emissions of greenhouse \n     gases up to that time: roughly . . . 5 degrees Fahrenheit to \n     10 degrees Fahrenheit . . . assuming continued increases in \n     emissions.\n\n  I represent the Ocean State, Rhode Island. I see that the new senior \nSenator from Hawaii is presiding, and certainly he represents an ocean \nState too, so let's talk about oceans.\n  Atmospheric warming brings sea level rise, and as global sea levels \nrise, storms, waves, and tides wash ever higher against the coast, \nputting our coastal infrastructure at greater and greater risk of storm \nsurges, flooding, and erosion. Five million Americans live within 4 \nfeet of the high-tide line--it is not just us in Rhode Island, it is \nnot just your folks in Hawaii--and it has real human consequences. \nHurricane Sandy, I hope, reminded us of that.\n  Already, sea level rise is up about 8 inches over the past century. \nThese changes are very evident to Rhode Islanders. We have been \nmonitoring the ocean for centuries. Just outside Narragansett Bay, the \ncrew of the Brenton Reef Lightship took nearly 22,000 ocean temperature \nmeasurements between 1878 and 1942. We have been at this a while. \nAlarmingly, the modern temperature record from points around \nNarragansett Bay shows that since the 1960s, the annual temperature in \nNarragansett Bay has increased about 4 degrees Fahrenheit. This has \nreal-life effect--crushing our winter flounder fishery, for instance. \nLong-term data from the tide gauges in Newport, RI, show an increase in \naverage sea level of nearly 10 inches since 1930. The rate of sea level \nrise at Newport is accelerating too. In southern Rhode Island, local \nerosion rates doubled from 1990 to 2006. Some of our freshwater \nwetlands near the coast are already transitioning to salt marsh.\n  Oceans warm and expand. Snow, glaciers, and icecaps melt into the \nsea. And the sea level is projected to rise between 1 and 4 feet by the \nend of this century.\n  Deniers should look to the assessments of our defense and \nintelligence agencies. Diego Garcia, a small island south of India, is \nthe home to a logistics hub for U.S. and British forces in the Middle \nEast and to Air Force Satellite Control Network equipment. The average \nelevation of Diego Garcia is approximately 4 feet. This installation is \nthreatened by inundation from slow, steady, sea level rise, set aside \nstorms. Norfolk naval air station and naval base on the southern end of \nthe Chesapeake Bay is the Navy's largest supply center and home to the \nU.S. Atlantic fleet. Eglin Air Force Base on Florida's gulf coast is \nthe largest Air Force base in the world. Both bases are threatened by \nrising seas.\n  The oceans are rising because they are getting warmer. Water expands \nas it warms. Warmer seas also threaten multibillion-dollar maritime \nindustries here in our country, industries such as fishing, tourism, \nand energy. When water is too warm, it stresses fish, coral, and other \nsea life. As I said, the winter flounder catch in Rhode Island has been \ncrushed by warming water. When water is too warm, it can't be used for \ncooling powerplants. That is what caused last summer's shutdown of Unit \n2 at the Millstone powerplant in Connecticut. The temperature of the \nwater in Long Island Sound climbed to over 75 degrees Fahrenheit--too \nwarm to cool a nuclear reactor.\n\n  Carbon dioxide, of course, doesn't just warm the atmosphere and warm \nthe oceans, carbon dioxide also gets absorbed into the oceans, and the \noceans become more acidic. Carbon pollution by humans has caused a \nnearly 30 percent increase in the acidity of the ocean, and this ocean \nacidification is certainly caused by human activity.\n  As the draft National Climate Assessment explains, ocean \nacidification harms species such as oysters, coral, and even the \nplankton--like the humble pteropod I have spoken about before on this \nfloor--that comprise the base of the ocean food chain, a food chain to \nwhich humankind is inextricably linked.\n  For my ocean State, carbon pollution presents a triple whammy from \nthe sea: higher seas, warming seas, and more acidic seas. But the draft \nNational Climate Assessment shows that you don't have to be an ocean \nState to be at risk. In the far North, Alaska is threatened by the loss \nof permafrost. Most of the permafrost in Alaska is tens of thousands of \nyears old. It is a natural wonder whose loss threatens structures, such \nas buildings and roads, as well as plants and wildlife that over many \ncenturies have adapted to that frozen tundra environment. In the \nMidwest, the draft assessment warns of ``the occurrence of extreme \nevents such as heat waves, droughts, and floods. In the long term, \ncombined stresses associated with climate change are expected to \ndecrease agricultural productivity, especially without significant \nadvances in genetic and agronomic technology.''\n  The dangers of carbon pollution are bearing down on us all. In the \nface of the clear warning of this national assessment, there are some \nwho counsel surrender. The oil industry-backed Institute for Energy \nResearch says this:\n\n       If the worst-case scenarios are correct, then even very \n     strong action by the Federal, State, and local governments in \n     the United States will do very little to alter the global \n     climate.\n\n  The polluters deny the ability of the United States to lead. Well, \nthey are wrong. They are wrong. They are very wrong. With our vast \neconomy, with our ingenuity, and with the trust the rest of the world \nhas put on our experiment in democracy, we can lead. We can lead the \nworld toward a cleaner future. To do any less would be, as President \nObama said in his inaugural address, to betray our children and future \ngenerations. I will not countenance that betrayal, and neither will \nmost Americans. A recent poll conducted by Yale University and George \nMason University found that a large majority of Americans--77 percent--\nsay climate change should be a priority for President Obama and for all \nof us here in Congress. Yet, for the last 2 years, opponents and \nskeptics, polluters and lobbyists, special interests and their paid-for \nfront organizations have blocked Congress from acting to reduce carbon \npollution and reduce the threat of climate change.\n  Today, a very distinguished Member of the House of Representatives \nwho has worked on environmental issues for 38 years in this building, \nRepresentative Henry Waxman, and I announced the formation of a \nbicameral House and Senate climate change task force to fight back. We \nwelcome all Members of Congress, regardless of political party, who \nrecognize the urgency of what is happening to our world all around us \nand who feel a duty to our descendents. We intend to focus sufficient \nattention on what is happening in the world\n\n[[Page S242]]\n\naround us to at last--at long last--reduce the carbon pollution that is \ncausing it.\n  It is time to wake up. Carbon pollution from fossil fuels is \nthreatening our future. Unless we take serious action to scale back the \npollution, the consequences may well be dire. Congress is sleepwalking \nthrough history. It is time to hear the alarms, roll up our sleeves, \nand do what needs to be done. It is time to wake up.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to talk a little about the bill that \nis coming over from the House that would require the Senate to--\nsurprise--have a budget. I know the law already requires the Senate to \nhave a budget, but apparently that law wasn't good enough for us to \nhave a budget for the last 3 years. So I am supportive of the House \ndecision to do that. In fact, I am supportive of almost any discussion \nthat requires us to talk about what we are going to do about spending.\n  You know, if you have been living outside your means, if you can't \npay your bills and you go to a credit counselor, the credit counselor \nis highly unlikely to say: Your problem is you need another credit \ncard. The credit counselor is going to say: You need to figure out how \nyou are going to pay your bills, and that includes things such as \nhaving a budget, it includes things such as figuring out what you are \nspending money on that you can stop spending money on. That is what we \nneed to do, and it is what we need to do with a budget.\n  Somehow in the face of unprecedented spending and record Federal \ndebt, the President and even Senate Democrats for a few years now have \nbeen saying that in Washington all we need to do is get another credit \ncard. Our problem, I hear, is not a spending problem, it is a health \ncare problem or it is a whatever kind of problem it is. It is clearly a \nspending problem.\n  There is no doubt that Washington is living outside its means. The \nFederal debt has skyrocketed to a record $16.5 trillion. President \nObama's first term added almost $6 trillion to that total. There is no \nreason to believe we have done anything to slow down the spending and \ndebt path we have been on. Meanwhile, it has been 1,360 days since the \nmajority in the Senate and the Senate itself has managed to pass a \nbudget. In fact, I think during that 1,316 days we haven't even had the \nBudget Committee report a budget out for the Senate to vote on.\n  Last summer Vice President Biden said: Show me your budget and I will \ntell you what you value. Well, let's find out what we value. Let's find \nout what the majority in the Senate values. When the Vice President \ntalked about showing the budget, he was talking about the Republican \nbudget, because there actually was one. The Republican House had passed \na budget. In fact, the Senate and the House both passed a budget every \nsingle year from the passage of the Budget Control Act in the mid-1970s \nuntil 2010. In 2010, both the House and the Senate--the House with \nSpeaker Pelosi and the Senate with the current majority--said: We don't \ncare what the law says, we are not going to pass a budget. That lasted \n1 year in the House, but it has lasted now 3 years in the Senate. In \n2011 and 2012 the House came back and passed a budget.\n  The Republicans have voted for serious budgets that make tough \nchoices, and even those choices were choices that made us go out and \nexplain what we were for. And, of course, that is exactly what the Vice \nPresident was talking about when he said: Show me your budget, I will \nshow you your values. There was only one side that had a budget. So \nthat was a pretty harmless position, from the point of view of the Vice \nPresident, because he was saying: Let's look at the budget the other \nguys have put on the table because we don't have one on the table; we \nhave not said what we are for.\n  The Senate Democrats have ignored the law, ignored their legal \nobligation to pass a budget, while House Republicans have now said the \nSenate should either pass a budget or not be paid, and I agree with \nthat. It is a fundamental step toward planning.\n  The second step is to vote on appropriations bills. We haven't voted \non a single appropriations bill in the Senate in over a year. We don't \nhave a budget, so there is no plan to try to get spending under \ncontrol; and then we don't vote on how we are going to spend the money \nin any way other than some big continuing resolution, which basically \nis a bill that says we are going to continue spending money as we have \nbeen spending money, and here are the two or three exceptions. But we \nare not going to have the debate I think the Senate needs to have. \nFrankly, I believe our new Appropriations chairman, Barbara Mikulski, \nis going to be insisting we bring appropriations bills to the floor, \nand I think that is a good thing.\n  The failure to have a Senate budget has too often been described as a \nminor procedural matter. Senator Schumer said recently: Well, the \nDemocrats didn't have a budget because there was a budget that came out \nof the sequester agreement in mid-2011. Never mind the Senate hadn't \nhad a budget that spring or the spring before that or that the \nParliamentarian said the sequester deal wasn't a budget, somehow coming \nup with one number was supposedly good enough to come up with a budget.\n  That is like sitting around the kitchen table to decide how you are \ngoing to spend your money, and here is how the discussion would go: OK, \nI think we ought to spend X amount of money. That is the meeting. We \nhave just decided that is what we are going to do. And somehow that is \nthe budget? Particularly when X amount of money didn't relate at all to \nthe amount of money coming into your family. Nobody believes that would \nmake sense.\n  We will see whether Senator Schumer's words this weekend will produce \na budget. The House has acted. The President says he wants the debt \nceiling increased. Hopefully, the majority has decided to pass a \nbudget. The new budget chairman, Senator Murray, said yesterday that \nher committee will draft a budget. Now let's let the Senate produce a \nbudget. Let's have a budget drawn up, let's have a budget debated, and \nlet's figure out what our plans are.\n  Budgets lay out plans. We will see if a budget that a majority in the \nSenate would vote for will pass the straight-face test with the \nAmerican people. We will see if this is just another budget that says: \nOK, here is the amount of money we want to spend; it has no \nrelationship to the amount of money we have, but let's let that be our \nbudget.\n  The people will no longer tolerate, I am convinced, the amount of \ndebt and taxes that that type of spending plan would require. For them \nto think about that, they have to have a spending plan, and so I am \ngrateful the House passed legislation that says we have to have that \nplan. When the majority in the Senate--Democrats in the Senate--have a \nbudget, we will see how they feel about continuing to attack the budget \nthe House has been willing to come up with for the last two Congresses. \nRight now they can talk about the cuts that Republicans in the House \nwant because there are no Senate cuts. There is no Senate budget.\n\n  So let's have an apples-to-apples comparison. Let's compare what \nRepublicans in the House would do compared to what Democrats in the \nSenate would do and figure out what our plan needs to be. It is often \nsaid that when you fail to plan, you plan to fail. Not having a budget \nis sort of the entry level of failing to plan. We have failed to do the \nfirst thing you would do if you were going to have a plan, if you were \ngoing to get your spending under control.\n  My Republican colleagues and I in the Senate have--even though there \nwasn't a Budget Committee product--actually found ways to vote for and \nsupport the Republican-passed budget from the House and, of course, we \npaid the price for that. People were out there saying: Here is what you \nwant to do about this program and here is what you want to do about \nthat program. But we are going to move quickly from where, rather than \njust attacking one\n\n[[Page S243]]\n\nside that has a plan, we are talking about what the two plans are, and \nwe will see what the American people want to do.\n  President Obama and our friends in the Senate should work with \nRepublicans in the Senate to cut spending and to pass a budget in a \ntransparent way. Republicans have been willing to do that. Democrats \nmay be willing to join in that. And if they are, the American people \ncan begin to see more than a last-minute, back-room deal. I am tired of \nseeing this planned crisis, one right after another, and I have a \nfeeling the people I work for are even more tired of it than I am.\n  A divided government is a good opportunity to make tough choices. The \nPresident will never have more political capital than he has right now. \nLet's take those two things together and let's see what that formula \nwould produce. A divided government--Republicans and Democrats both \nhave to take responsibility--and a President with maximum political \ncapital could equal a good and long-term result. I hope the President \nand the majority in the Senate get serious about working together and \nsolving the problems we face as a country.\n  I look forward to being part of that, and I am appreciative that the \nHouse of Representatives has passed legislation that appears to have \nforced the Senate to do its job on a budget for the first time in 4 \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/24/senate-section/article/S243-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BLUNT.

Madam President, I come to the floor to talk about the \ndebt crisis facing this country and the opportunity we have to address \nthis issue in a way that balances the budget and ensures the long-term \nfiscal solvency for future generations.\n  The recent fiscal cliff agreement which enacted tax relief for 99 \npercent of Americans addressed the revenue side of the equation. But as \neveryone knows, revenue increases alone are not going to solve the debt \ncrisis. In fact, the tax increases that went into effect as a part of \nthe fiscal cliff deal generate enough revenue over the next 10 years--\nand I should say if we annualize that over the next year--to fund the \ngovernment for less than 1 week next year. So all the talk about the \nhigher revenues and what that will do to address our long-term fiscal \nsolvency and what it will do to address the deficit, if we think about \nit in those terms, it puts into perspective what the real problem is.\n  We have a debate in this city and in the Congress all the time about \nwhether we can address the huge debt we have in front of us--the \ntrillion-dollar annual deficits--by raising taxes on the so-called rich \nand people in the higher income categories. That was done. That was \ndone as part of the fiscal cliff negotiations that occurred. Remember, \nthose taxes were all scheduled to go up. They were scheduled to go up \non everybody--anybody who had income tax liability on January 1. \nBecause of the agreement that was reached, we were able to protect 99--\nin my case in South Dakota more than 99--percent of taxpayers from \nthose tax increases. That being said, there are those in the higher \nincome categories and some businesses that will see higher taxes as a \nresult of that. But those higher taxes represent enough revenue next \nyear to fund the Federal Government for less than 1 week.\n  The question before us is, What do we do for the other 358 days of \nthe year? That is what we have to start talking about, the real \nproblem: What truly affects and afflicts Washington and our fiscal \nsituation for the foreseeable future and for the long-term future; that \nis, government spending.\n  The reality is the Federal Government doesn't tax too little; it \nspends too much. Over the past 4 years, the deficit has exceeded $1 \ntrillion each\n\n[[Page S244]]\n\nyear. The long-term outlook is even worse. This country faces \nunsustainable fiscal imbalances largely because of entitlement programs \nsuch as Social Security and Medicare that have not been reformed in a \nway that aligns our current demographics with the needs of these \nprograms, which must be done if we are going to save and protect these \nprograms for future generations.\n  Entitlement spending is the largest driver of our national debt over \nthe long term. While it is true Federal revenues as a percentage of GDP \nhave declined over the past few years, this was true because of the \ngreat recession, not because tax rates were too low. The average ratio \nof Federal revenue to GDP over the past 40 years has been roughly in \nthe 18-percent range. Based on Congressional Budget Office data, it is \nexpected that Federal revenues will exceed their historical averages \nwithin the next 10 years and remain there for the foreseeable future, \neven without additional tax increases.\n  I wish to illustrate with this chart which I think tells the story. \nWe always talk about a picture telling a story in exchange for a \nthousand words. I can talk a lot about this, but I think this visually \nillustrates it perhaps as well as anything.\n  If we look at the green part, that represents Federal revenue \nhistorically, and this goes back to 1980. If we took this chart back to \nliterally the 1970s, late 1960s, we would find, I think over that time \nperiod, the revenues stayed pretty static. They go up and down a little \nbit based on what is happening in the economy, and of course we have a \ndownturn in the 2007 and 2008 timeframe, but revenues are starting to \nclimb back up to that historical average. So it is about, give or take, \n18 percent of GDP. That is what historical revenues are.\n  The black strip, which may be perhaps hard to see, is what was \nenacted in the fiscal cliff negotiation. Those are enacted tax \nincreases that will add a little bit to the total as we project out. \nThis chart takes us out literally to 2040.\n  The purple represents the additional taxes the President would like \nto get. If the President got everything he wanted in the form of taxes, \nthe revenue picture would be about right here. Again, this takes us \nfrom where we are today out to about 2040. As we can see, even if the \nPresident got all the tax increases he wanted, represented by this line \nright here, it still doesn't come anywhere close to dealing with the \nspending that is going to explode in the outyears if we don't do \nsomething to rein that in by reforming many of these programs I just \nmentioned.\n  If we are going to save and protect Social Security and Medicare for \nfuture generations, we have to reform those programs in a way that \ndoesn't create this huge red line that spikes into the future and \nliterally bankrupts the country. In fact, Social Security ran a cash \ndeficit in 2010. Medicare, we are told by the actuaries, will be \ninsolvent by the year 2024. In fact, in the hospital portion of the \nMedicare trust fund, we are told it may be insolvent by the year 2016. \nThese are important dates to remember because those are the dates at \nwhich the revenue coming in from the payroll taxes that support Social \nSecurity and Medicare no longer pay for the benefits paid out to \nbeneficiaries.\n\n  We have this sort of train wreck coming. We know what drives Federal \nspending are these entitlement programs. What we call mandatory \nspending in the Federal budget is about 60 percent now of all Federal \nspending, largely imposed by Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. \nWe have this crisis looming. We see the way this thing just starts \nexploding in the outyears because of the demographics of the country. \nWe have more baby boomers who are reaching retirement age, people \nliving longer--all good things--but we have to align those programs \nwith the demographics of this country and today they are not. Today we \nare headed on a path that will take us toward a fiscal train wreck \nunless we do something about that.\n  I think it is important to point out the reason we are where we are, \nthe reason we are running nearly $1 trillion deficits or north of $1 \ntrillion deficits every single year for the past 4 years is because \nspending has increased dramatically over that timeframe. Again, just to \nput that into perspective, before the great recession in 2007, the \nFederal Government was generating about $2.5 trillion annually in tax \nrevenue. At that time, the government was spending about $2.7 trillion \neach year. So we had somewhere on the order of a couple hundred billion \ndollars in annual deficits.\n  As I said, revenues dropped off a little bit from that period in 2008 \nin the financial meltdown, but those have started to pop back up to a \nmore historic and traditional level. So now revenues are back up to \nroughly that $2.5 trillion annual range. What has changed over that \nsame period of time, between 2007 and 2012, is the amount the Federal \nGovernment spends annually.\n  I just mentioned that in 2007 the Federal Government spent $2.7 \ntrillion. We are now at the end of fiscal year 2012, which ended on \nSeptember 30 of this year, and the Federal Government spent $3.5 \ntrillion. We saw almost a $1 trillion increase in spending over that 5-\nyear period at a time when revenues have stayed somewhat static, \nalthough they dipped into recession, but now they have come back, as I \nsaid, to that more historic level.\n  Essentially, what is driving these deficits is the massive runup in \nspending. What caused them? We had a stimulus program that was going to \nbe one-time spending, much of which I think has gotten factored into \nthe baseline. Eventually, we are going to have with the new health care \nmandates enormous amounts of new spending associated with that, which I \nthink is going to make this picture much worse than it looks already. \nBut my point is we have a fiscal crisis in this country which needs to \nbe addressed. We have been kicking that can down the road for way too \nlong and we have run out of road.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has made it abundantly clear that in \neach of their assessments of our fiscal situation as a country, most \nrecently in November of 2012, a couple months ago, they said the \nfollowing:\n\n       With the population aging and health care costs per person \n     likely to keep growing faster than the economy, the United \n     States cannot sustain the Federal spending programs that are \n     now in place.\n\n  That is from the CBO. They track this stuff on a daily basis for us.\n  We have a real challenge ahead of us. We have a major problem. I \nwould argue, again, this is predominantly a spending problem, and I \nthink it is illustrated, again, by this chart. When we look at \ngovernment revenues, it is a fairly flat line. Even with the ups and \ndowns in the economy, it averages about 18 percent of revenue. \nActually, without any changes in the baseline, I think it ends up at \nabout 18.6 percent of revenue a decade from now. But what we see is \nspending, which historically has been in the 20- to 25-percent range if \nwe go back over the past 40 years, is going to explode. The spike we \nsee right here is why we have a fiscal crisis on our hands and why it \nis so important we act to rein in out-of-control Federal spending.\n  I suggest to my colleagues in the Senate, as I have for a long time, \nthat where this starts is with passing a budget. We have to go back a \nlong time now. I mentioned this the other day, but the last time the \nSenate passed a budget the iPad didn't even exist. Most of us now take \niPads for granted. Many Americans--not all but some Americans--have \niPads. They came on the scene around April of 2010. There hasn't been a \nbudget passed in the Senate since April of 2009.\n  We are going on 4 years and now 1,360-some days since the last time \nthe Senate acted on a budget. That is irresponsible. It is especially \nirresponsible in light of this problem. We have a responsibility to the \ntaxpayers of this country, as stewards of their tax dollars, to do what \nwe can to ensure that we are putting the fiscal house of this country \nin order in a way that will ensure that future generations of Americans \nhave at least as good, if not better, standard of living and quality of \nlife than what the generation that came before us had.\n  That is not going to happen because we are piling on the backs of \nfuture generations enormous amounts of debt. In fact, the $16.4 \ntrillion in debt the Nation has today, if you break that down an on an \nindividual basis, that is about $53,000 for every man, woman,\n\n[[Page S245]]\n\nand child in America. That is what every individual owes, every \nindividual in this country owes of that $16.4 trillion in debt. That is \nnot fair to future generations.\n  It is up to us as leaders to look at these things and make decisions \ntoday that are in the best interests of future generations. I think it \nhas been sort of a tradition in this country, a heritage, if you will, \nfor one generation of Americans to sacrifice so that the future \ngeneration, the next generation of Americans may have a better life, a \nbetter standard of living, a better quality of life.\n  That is certainly something that is true where I come from in South \nDakota and where the Chair comes from in North Dakota. We represent \npeople who understand that you sacrifice so that the next generation \nand those who come after you have a better life than you had.\n  If we don't change the way we are doing things, this next generation \nwill be the first generation of Americans where that is not true. \nLiterally, they will have a lower standard of living and a lower \nquality of life than what we experienced because we weren't willing to \nlive within our means. This is because we continued to spend money we \ndidn't have, we continued to borrow money from China, and we will hand \nthe bill to future generations.\n  It is unconscionable, given this picture--and, again, a picture \nspeaks a thousand words--that we haven't done a budget in the Senate in \nthe last 4 years. There is always a blame game played in Washington, \nDC, and I understand that both sides have contributed over the years. \nWhen my party was in charge of the Congress we spent too much. \nObviously, since that time, since we have been out of the majority in \nCongress the numbers have increased dramatically.\n  If you look at the amount of debt we piled up just in the last 4 \nyears under the current administration, it is about $6 trillion that we \nhave added to the debt in that amount of time. The spending is \nexploding. The tax revenues are staying fairly steady over time, as I \nhave pointed out with this particular graphic.\n  One thing we know for certain is that raising taxes doesn't solve the \nproblem. If the President got everything he wanted in terms of \nadditional tax increases, and that would be this purple line right \nhere, it doesn't come anywhere close to addressing the amount of \nspending we have already put on the books. We are going to have to \nborrow to pay and hand that bill to future generations. You can only do \nthat for so long. It is high time that the Senate got on board and \nstarted doing the budget.\n  I served on the Budget Committee for the last 2 years. I had hoped \nthat being on the Budget Committee would be a place where a lot of big \ndebates would occur about how to deal with these big fiscal issues that \nare facing our country. I turned out to be wrong. We didn't do a \nbudget, we didn't mark up one, we didn't put one on the floor of the \nSenate. We didn't vote, we didn't have amendments, and we didn't do \nanything to address this fiscal crisis. To be fair, the House of \nRepresentatives, every single year, on time, has passed a budget.\n  The President of the United States, who needs to be a party to this, \nis the only 1 of 307 million Americans who can sign a bill into law, \ncan engage the American public and the Congress in a way that would \naddress this. The budgets he submitted to the Congress, when they have \nbeen voted on in the Senate and the House, haven't received a single \nvote, not a single vote. Neither Republicans or Democrats in the House \nor the Senate have voted for the budgets the President has submitted.\n  Why? Because they are not serious. The President hasn't taken this \nissue seriously. Neither has the majority in the Senate, where we \nhaven't had a budget now for 4 consecutive years.\n  It is high time that changed. I hope it will. I am encouraged, \nactually, by what I have been hearing from my colleagues. This year, \nperhaps now, finally, after 4 years, we will actually do a budget. We \nmay put a plan in place for how we are going to address this fiscal \ncrisis, this amount of spending that is going to bankrupt the country \nunless we take steps to avert it.\n  There are lots of ideas out there. It is not like we don't know what \nthe issues are, like we don't know what the problems are. We do. There \nhave been many bipartisan commissions that have studied this and have \nexamined it thoroughly, that have all come to the same conclusion with \nregard to what the various problems are--and, frankly, for that matter, \nwhat the solutions are.\n  My colleague, Senator Hatch, was down here earlier this morning \ntalking about some of those suggestions. Many of those suggestions, as \nI have said, have come from bipartisan commissions. We know if we do \nnothing, we are going to bankrupt the country and ensure that the \nprograms that many Americans rely on today are not going to be \navailable to future generations of Americans.\n  I would hope this is the year in which we do a budget, and this is \nthe year in which the President engages in this discussion in a \nmeaningful way that allows us to put in place a path that will avert \nwhat is going to be a major crisis. The problem is not that we tax too \nlittle, it is that we spend too much.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I would note that, of course, we have \npassed a budget, and that is why we are facing sequestration now. That \nwasn't just a resolution; that was an actual law, signed by the \nPresident. A lot of people who voted for it don't like it, but we voted \nfor it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/24/senate-section/article/S245-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S245-S246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            KERRY NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I want to commend President Obama for \nnominating Senator Kerry to be our next Secretary of State. There are \nfew, if any, people in America today who have had the breadth of \nexperience that Senator Kerry has had: as a military officer, as a \nhighly decorated veteran, as a Lieutenant Governor, as a U.S. Senator, \nand as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He is exceptionally \nwell qualified to be the next Secretary of State.\n  John Kerry is a leader of extraordinary intellect, wisdom, and \ninsight. To those of us who have watched him, worked with him, and \ntraveled with him over the years, it is crystal clear that he is a \nnatural diplomat. He lives and breathes the art of diplomacy. He is \ninstinctively drawn to understanding and addressing the global security \nchallenges of our time.\n  He is also multilingual. I have heard Senator Kerry in meetings in \nother capitals of the world, and I have watched those who were there \npay special attention to what he had to say as he conversed in their \nlanguage. This is someone who does not need on-the-job training. He has \nbeen learning the job over the course of four decades of public \nservice.\n  I chair the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Department of State \nand Foreign Operations. In that role, I will look forward to working \nclosely with Senator Kerry in his new position as Secretary of State, \nto provide the resources necessary to promote and protect U.S. \ninterests around the world.\n  It is a formidable assignment. We face daunting threats from \nreligious extremism, nuclear proliferation, climate change, growing \ncompetition for energy, water, and other natural resources--all amid \nthe obligations of deficit and debt reduction. But these threats and \nchallenges present opportunities if we approach them intelligently.\n  Some in Congress have an almost xenophobic attitude. They would have \nus retreat. They would slash our contribution to the United Nations and \nweaken our ability to build alliances, which would only embolden our \nadversaries.\n  They would cut the State Department's budget at a time when our \ndiplomats and consular officers, many of whom work long hours in \ndangerous places, already are stretched to the limit. Then they \ncriticize and politicize when tragedies happen.\n  We saw that yesterday, when members of the other body criticized \nSecretary of State Clinton for lapses in diplomatic security, only a \nweek after they prevented passage of my amendment that would have \nallowed for the transfer of unused State Department funds to improve \nsecurity at U.S. embassies around the world. Let's stop the hypocrisy.\n\n[[Page S246]]\n\n  Some here would roll back funding for international development \nprograms, which help to create political stability in conflict-prone \nregions and build markets for U.S. exports, on the grounds that these \nfunds would be better spent at home.\n  They miss the point. Ninety-nine percent of the Federal budget is \nspent on domestic programs. The notion that somehow the wealthiest, \nmost powerful nation on Earth is an island, and that we can ignore what \nis happening in the world around us is foolhardy, and is dangerous.\n  John Kerry understands this, and he knows that appropriations begin \nwith Congress. In times of close scrutiny of all aspects of the Federal \nbudget and fierce competition for funds among Federal agencies, he will \nneed to make his case up here repeatedly, and I will work with him to \ndo that. We have to convince Congress and the American people why the \nState Department's budget is important. As Secretary of State one can \nhave the best policies and the best plans to implement them. But if you \ndon't have the resources, if you don't have the people to do it, the \nbest plans in the world don't go very far.\n  Secretary Clinton has done an outstanding job. I have told her that I \nstand in awe of what she has accomplished throughout the world and \nwithin the State Department. We all owe her a debt of gratitude for her \nsteady hand and tireless energy as Secretary of State. I have traveled \nwith her to other countries. I have seen how she approaches problems, \nalways prepared and with such energy. Every American should be proud to \nbe represented by her. She has done an extraordinary job in \nreintroducing America to the world after the missteps following 9/11 \nthat caused so much damage to our image and authority abroad.\n  Her successor also has not only a hard act to follow, but he also \nunderstands, as we all do, that America must continuously demonstrate \nto the rest of the world what we stand for as a people.\n  I believe the Congress and the American people, and I think, in a \nway, the world, is fortunate to have a nominee for the position as \nqualified as Senator Kerry. I will enthusiastically vote for him when \nhis name comes before the Senate.\n  Madam President, seeing no other person seeking recognition, as \nPresident pro tempore of this body, I am glad to see you in the role of \nPresiding Officer. I realize you can't respond to this, but in your \nfirst month in the Senate you are actually filling the pivotal role in \nthis body, and I appreciate it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to, No. 1, welcome you \nand welcome all of the other new Senators who have just joined this \nhistoric body.\n  Along with the rest of us, you have all watched the difficult \nnegotiations over the fiscal cliff that dominated the last few weeks of \nthe 112th Congress. That debate was an important opportunity to talk to \nthe American people about Washington's addiction to spending. We made \nclear in that debate that no amount of tax increases--no amount--would \ncome close to wiping out Washington's debt. So as we begin the 113th \nCongress, we are faced with fresh opportunities to continue that \nconversation with the American people.\n  This time the debate is over whether to raise the Nation's debt \nlimit. Last week, the President opened negotiations on this important \nissue by saying that he wouldn't negotiate. He did not announce this by \ncalling the Republicans in Congress; he did it, instead, by calling a \npress conference.\n  In the last days of 2012, President Obama, in my opinion, failed to \nlead in the talks over avoiding the fiscal cliff. Now the President \nplans not to lead on the Nation's debt limit either. Whether the \nPresident leads, follows, or just gets out of the way, Washington needs \nreal budget reform. We can't continue President Obama's pattern of \nuntold trillions of dollars in wasteful government spending.\n  Over the past 4 years, President Obama has added so much to our \nnational debt that he has already had to increase our Nation's debt \nlimit four separate times. This includes the two largest increases in \nour history. No other President of the United States has needed an \nincrease of over $1 trillion. President Obama has asked for that much \ntwice. While he once promised to cut the deficit in half by now, he has \ndone just the opposite. He has added as much debt in 4 years as all the \nprevious Presidents racked up in our country's first 225 years.\n  President Obama has maxed out the national credit card and now he \nwants a new one. In return, the President isn't willing to offer any \ncommitments that he will try to be more responsible with that next \ncredit card. In fact, under his latest budget, the President wants to \nadd another $6.4 trillion to our debt over the next 5 years. That is \nthe wrong direction for our Federal budget and for the Nation's future.\n  The President could take this opportunity to reassure hardworking \nAmerican taxpayers, as well as world financial markets, that he is \nfinally serious about reining in Washington's out-of-control spending. \nInstead, he has chosen to try to score political points.\n  This isn't the first time the President has voiced an opinion on the \ndebt limit debate. Last December, he spoke on this subject as he, in my \nopinion, misrepresented decades of precedence regarding congressional \nconsideration of the debt limit. He said that connecting debt ceiling \nvotes and budget negotiations--connecting debt ceiling votes and budget \nnegotiations--was something that ``we had never done in our history \nuntil we did it last year.''\n  That statement is false. Frankly, we should be talking about \nresponsible spending reform every time we debate any measure in \nCongress that involves spending money. We should certainly do it when \nwe are debating borrowing more money.\n  The debt limit has been used at least 20 times in the past 60 years \nspecifically tied to debating fiscal reform. For example, in 1954, \nCongress passed a temporary increase specifically as a way to control \nfuture finances. In 1967, the House actually defeated a debt limit \nincrease so that it could force President Johnson to quit using some of \nthe budget tricks he had been using. In 1970, the debate over the debt \nlimit included amendments to cut defense spending, imposing a spending \ncap, and freezing congressional pay until Congress passed a balanced \nbudget.\n  In 1983, Congress actually defeated a debt limit increase bill. \nSenator Russell Long, a Democrat, told his colleagues if they voted for \nthe increase, ``you are voting to continue the biggest deficits in the \nhistory of this country as far as the eye can see.''\n  Incidentally, the debt at that time was $1.3 trillion. That is about \nhow much we have added to our debt every year since President Obama was \nsworn in for the first time. Democrats balked at Washington having a \ndebt over $1.3 trillion back then. Today, the President says \nRepublicans are doing something irresponsible for even wanting to talk \nabout a debt of more than $16.4 trillion.\n  I could go on and on with more examples, but I think you have the \nidea. The President says it is unprecedented for us to even ask to have \nthis debate. Well, the President is not correct. It is not \nunprecedented. It is actually very common and absolutely appropriate.\n  There is nobody on the Republican side of the aisle here in the \nSenate who is saying we should not pay our bills. There is also nobody \non this side of the aisle who thinks we should keep wasting taxpayer \ndollars without even trying to act responsibly and slow down \nWashington's spending. Yes, the debt limit is about paying for past \nobligations, but our history shows the debate\n\n[[Page S247]]\n\nover the debt limit is an absolutely appropriate time to talk about \nreforming Washington's future spending.\n  President Obama agreed to spending cuts the last time he asked for an \nincrease in the debt limit. Now the President says he wants his credit \nlimit increased without any effort to reduce future spending. And, of \ncourse, we all remember when he was a Senator he spoke out against \nraising the debt limit. He once called the need to increase the debt \nlimit ``a failure of leadership.'' But that was then. This is now.\n  The White House has floated gimmicks such as issuing a $1 trillion \ncoin or using the 14th amendment to raise the debt limit without \ncongressional approval. And now the President won't negotiate \nresponsible spending at all. His policies--his policies of the past 4 \nyears--have buried our children and our grandchildren under a mountain \nof debt. America needs real budget reform, but President Obama insists \non playing politics with our country's credit rating. Hard-working \nAmerican taxpayers have to balance their budgets. They understand what \nthe President does not.\n  The President bragged in his press conference last week that ``it's \nbeen a busy and productive 4 years, and I expect the same for the next \n4 years.'' Well, it looks like he means we can count on 4 more years of \nwasteful Washington spending.\n  This has to stop. It is time for President Obama to finally keep his \npromise to get America's finances in order.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren).

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to give some \nremarks that I give about every 2 years, I guess, when the Senate \nreconvenes for a new Congress. Now this is a new Congress, so once \nagain I come here to point out that we need to make some changes in the \nway we operate.\n  I have been in this body for 28 years. I am currently eighth in \nseniority. As soon as Senator Kerry becomes Secretary of State, I will \nbe seventh in seniority. I am proud to represent the great State of \nIowa; I am proud to be a Senator, to serve in this illustrious body. I \nhave been in the majority and minority I think up to five times in the \nSenate. Before that, I served 10 years in the House. I love the Senate. \nIt is a wonderful institution--it is, as envisioned by our Founders.\n  The Senate at times has been frustratingly slow to encompass the \nchanges necessary to the smooth functioning of our country. I mention \nin particular the long, long struggle for civil rights and how that was \nheld up by a small minority--which happened to be in my party, by the \nway, at that time.\n  Nonetheless, the Senate through the years has really been the Chamber \nthat takes a long and hard look at legislation, where we have the right \nto amend, where we have the right to discuss and to embark upon \ndiscourse on legislation in a manner that allows even the smallest \nState to be represented as much as a large State. That is not true in \nthe body that both the occupant of the chair and I used to serve in, \nthe House. There, as you know, large States tend to dominate because we \nhave most of the Members. But here, a Senator from Connecticut is just \nas important as a Senator from California or a Senator from Iowa or--\nlet's see, what is the least populous State? I think Wyoming or \nAlaska--is equal to a Senator from New York or Florida or Texas or \nCalifornia. This has been a great equalizing body.\n  Having served here for this time, I think I have some perspective on \nthis Senate. As I said, at its best, this Senate is where our great \nAmerican experience in democratic self-government most fully manifests \nitself. It is in this body that the American people, through their \nelected officials, can come together collectively to debate, \ndeliberate, and address the great issues of our time. Through our \nNation's history, it has done so. In the nearly quarter of a century I \nhave been here--well, wait, it is 28 years that I have been here, so it \nis over a quarter of a century--the rights of Americans have been \nexpanded: Americans with disabilities; we have ensured health insurance \nfor millions of Americans.\n  In the early 1990s we voted here on the course to eliminate the \nnational deficit in a generation, and we are on our way to doing that.\n  It is because of my great reverence for this institution and my love \nfor our country that I come to the floor today. One does not need to \nread the abysmal approval ratings of Congress to know that Americans \nare fed up and angry with this broken government. In too many critical \nareas, people see a Congress that is riven with dysfunction. Citizens \nsee their legislature going from manufactured crisis to manufactured \ncrisis. They see a legislature that is simply unable to respond \neffectively to the most urgent challenges of our time.\n  Of course, there are a myriad of reasons for this gridlock--increased \npartisanship; a decline in civility and comity; too much power, I \nbelieve, in the hands of special interest groups; a polarizing instant-\nnews media; and, I might add, the increasing time demands on all of us \nhere involved in raising large amounts of money to run for reelection. \nBut make no mistake, a principal cause of dysfunction here in the \nSenate is the rampant abuse of the filibuster.\n  It is long past time to make the Senate a more functional body, one \nthat is better able, as I said, to respond to our Nation's challenges. \nThe fact is that I am not a Johnny-come-lately to filibuster reform. In \nJanuary of 1995--when I was in the minority, I might add--I first \nintroduced legislation to reform the filibuster. We got a vote on it. \nObviously, we did not win, but I made my points then, and I engaged in \na very good debate with Senator Byrd at that time, in 1995. You can \nread it in the Record. I think it was probably January 8, if I am not \nmistaken, of 1995.\n  At that time, I submitted a resolution because, as I said, I saw an \narms race in which each side would simply escalate the use of the \nfilibuster and abuse procedural rules to a point where we would just \ncease to function here in the Senate. I said that at the time. I said \nthat what happens is when the Democrats are in the minority, they abuse \nthe filibuster against the Republicans. Then when the Republicans \nbecome the minority, they say: You Democrats did it to us 20 times, we \nwill do it to you 30 times. Then when it switches again and the \nDemocrats are in the minority, they say: Republicans did it to us 30 \ntimes, we will do it 50 times. We will teach them a lesson.\n  On and on, the arms race is escalated. I said at the time that we \nmight get to a point where this body simply cannot function, and sadly \nthat is what happened.\n  That is why 18 years after I first submitted my proposal, I believe \nreform is never more urgent and necessary. The minority leader stated \nthat reformers advocate ``a fundamental change to the way the Senate \noperates.'' To the contrary, it is the abuse of the filibuster, not the \nreforms being advocated, that has fundamentally changed the character \nof this body and our entire system of government. Again, I will point \nout now and I will point out repeatedly in my remarks that Democrats \nare not guiltless in this regard by any means, but the real power grab \nand the real abuse has come about when the Republicans have abused this \ntool--one that was used sparingly for nearly 200 years.\n  What has happened is that effective control of the Senate and of \npublic policy has been turned over to the minority, not to the majority \nthat has been elected by the American people. In many cases, those who \nare warning of a fundamental change to the nature and culture of the \nSenate are the very ones\n\n[[Page S248]]\n\nwho have already carried out a revolutionary change. Those of us who \nare seeking to reform the filibuster rules are not the ones who are \ndoing a nuclear option or blowing up the Senate. Those who have abused \nthe filibuster are the ones who have already changed the character of \nthe Senate. What we are trying to do is restore some functionality to \nthe Senate so that the Senate can operate with due regard for the \nrights of the minority. I will talk about that more in a moment.\n  The minority leader has recently called the filibuster ``near \nsacred.'' I am sorry, he could not be more incorrect. The notion that \n60 votes are required to pass any measure or confirm any nominee is not \nin the Constitution and until recently would have been considered a \nludicrous idea, flying in the face of any definition of government by \ndemocracy.\n  Far from considering the filibuster ``near sacred,'' it is safe to \nsay that the Founders would have considered a supermajority requirement \nsacrilegious. After all, they experimented with a supermajority \nrequirement under the Articles of Confederation, and it was expressly \nrejected in the Constitution because the Framers believed it had proven \nunworkable. That is right, the Articles of Confederation basically had \na supermajority requirement, and they found that did not work. That is \nwhy, as I will mention in a moment also, the Framers of the \nConstitution set out explicitly five different times that this Senate \nrequires a supermajority. You would have thought that if they wanted a \nsupermajority for everything, they would have said so. No, they \nspecified treaties, impeachments, expelling a Member--those require a \nsupermajority as expressly spelled out in the Constitution.\n  The filibuster was once a tool used only in rare instances--most \nshamefully, as I said earlier, to block civil rights legislation. But \nacross the entire 19th century, there were only 23 filibusters, in 100 \nyears. From 1917, when the Senate first adopted rules to end \nfilibusters, until 1969 there were fewer than 50--during all those \nyears. That is less than one filibuster a year. In his 6 years as \nmajority leader, Lyndon Johnson only faced one filibuster.\n  According to one study, in the 1960s just 8 percent of major bills \nwere filibustered. Think about all the legislation that was passed--\ncivil rights, Voting Rights Act, Medicare, Medicaid, Older Americans \nAct, Pell grants, Higher Education Act, Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. Think of all the legislation passed in the 1960s. Just 8 \npercent was filibustered. In contrast, since 2007 when Democrats \nregained control of the Senate, there have been over 380 motions to end \nfilibusters--380. This does not even include the countless bills and \nnominations on which the majority has not even tried to obtain cloture \neither because of a lack of time or because we knew it would be \nfruitless.\n  The fact is that for the first time in history, on almost a daily \nbasis, the minority--and in many cases, just one Senator--routinely is \nable to and does use the threat of a filibuster to stop bills from even \ncoming to the floor for debate and amendment. Unfortunately, moreover, \nbecause of outdated rules, an actual filibuster rarely occurs. Too \noften it is merely the threat of a filibuster, and that is the end of \nit; it is not debated or anything.\n  Let's get beyond the outrageous idea that Democrats, in proposing \nrules reform, would be initiating a revolution. In actuality, the \nchanges that are seriously under discussion right now are simply a \nmodest reaction to decades of escalating warfare which has culminated \nin 6 years of unrelenting minority obstructionism.\n  Because I feel so passionately that reform is so badly needed, I \nfully support the commonsense proposals from Senator Merkley and \nSenator Udall. Their proposals would simply require the minority to \nactually filibuster, actually debate. A Senator would have to come to \nthe floor and explain his or her opposition or offer his or her views \non how a bill could be improved. Under the proposed reforms, the \nSenators would actually have to make arguments, debate, and deliberate. \nSenators would have to obstruct in public and be held accountable for \nthat obstructionism.\n  Perhaps because this is such a commonsense reform, Republicans who \nhave come to the floor have not addressed why they oppose rules that \nwould require more transparency. Republicans have failed to explain to \nthis body or to the public why a minority--again, the group the public \nchose not to govern here--why should they be able to kill a nominee by \nstealth? Republicans have failed to explain why they oppose more debate \nand more deliberation. Why do they oppose more debate, more \ndeliberation, which is puzzling given that they profess that their \nsincere concerns are animated by the desire to foster debate and \ndeliberation. But that is not what is happening. In stealth, they \noppose a bill. They do not come to the floor, and they fail to defend \nwhy they do not even do that, why they will not even come to the floor \nand speak.\n  Instead, Republican after Republican has come to the floor and \ndenounced what they claim are Democratic efforts to eliminate the \nfilibuster and to, in their words, ``fundamentally change'' this body. \nThe fact is that they are attacking the wrong plan. The truth is, under \nthe reforms proposed either by Senator Udall or Senator Merkley or one \nthey have together or even under my proposal, the filibuster would \nstill be a tool. Sixty votes would be needed to enact a measure, to \nconfirm a nominee. Under their proposal, it would still require 60 \nvotes.\n  Under my proposal as I first laid out in this body in 1995, I said: \nYou know, sure, OK, on the first vote after you have the cloture motion \nfiled, the first vote would require 60 votes.\n  If they didn't have 60 votes, they would have to wait 3 days, file \nanother cloture motion, and then they would need 57 votes. If they \ndidn't get 57 votes, they would have to file another cloture motion, \nwait 3 days, and they would need 54 votes. If they didn't get that, \nthey would file another cloture motion, wait 3 days, and they would \nneed 51 votes.\n  Under this proposal I have worked out with other groups and other \npeople over the last almost 20 years, the fact is the filibuster could \nbe used for what it was intended--slow things down. I believe the \nSenate ought to be a place where we slow things down. It should not be \na place where just a few Senators can kill a bill. This should be a \nplace where the filibuster is used not to slow things down but is \nactually used to kill a bill.\n  What I have proposed would be a period of time--actually up to about \n16 days--where someone could slow a bill down, but eventually the \nmajority would be able to act. I mean, what a revolutionary idea. The \nmajority should be able to prevail. Think about our own elections. I \nguess maybe it could be extended further to say it is not enough to get \n51 percent, or the majority of votes, we have to get 60; if they don't \nget that, they don't take office. What a revolutionary idea that \nsomehow the majority should be able to move legislation.\n  I also agree there should be the rights of the minority to debate, \ndiscuss, and amend legislation. Again, the majority, after ample debate \nand deliberation, should have the power to govern, to enact the agenda \nthe voters voted for, and to be held accountable at the ballot box. I \nguess I fundamentally believe in democracy. Maybe that is a failing on \nmy part. I fundamentally believe the majority should rule, with respect \nfor rights of the minority.\n  As I have noted, a revolution has already occurred in the Senate in \nrecent years. Never before in the history of this Senate was it \naccepted that a 60-vote threshold was required for everything. This did \nnot occur as a constitutional amendment or through any great public \ndebate. Rather, this occurred because of the abuse of the filibuster. \nThe minority party has assumed for itself absolute and virtually \nunchecked veto power over all legislation; over any executive branch \nnominee, no matter how insignificant the position; over all judges, no \nmatter how uncontroversial.\n  In other words, because of the filibuster, even when a party has been \nresoundingly repudiated at the polls, that party retains the power to \nprevent the majority from governing and carrying out the agenda the \npublic elected it to implement. In this regard, over 380 filibusters is \nnot some cold statistic. Each filibuster represents a minority of \nSenators--sometimes a mere\n\n[[Page S249]]\n\nhandful--who are preventing the majority of the people's \nrepresentatives from governing.\n  As one example, Republicans repeatedly filibustered a motion to \nproceed to legislation that would require more disclosure of campaign \ndonations. The DISCLOSE Act is what it was called. A substantial \nmajority of Senators supported the bill. Polling showed that 80 percent \nof the public believed the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United \nwas wrong, that we needed to know more disclosure of campaign \ncontributions. Yet a small minority of Senators was able to prevent the \nbill from even being debated on the floor of the Senate, let alone \nreceiving an up-or-down vote. That is just one example.\n  In the last two Congresses, consider some of the measures blocked by \nthe minority, measures that received majority support on a cloture \nvote: the DREAM Act, Bring Jobs Home Act, Small Business Jobs and Tax \nRelief Act, Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012, Repeal Big Oil Tax \nSubsidies Act, Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act, American \nJobs Act of 2011, Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act, \nPaycheck Fairness Act, Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring \nAct.\n  Again, it is not that the bills were filibustered. The right to even \ndebate these bills and vote on them was filibustered. It is one thing \nif we are on the bill and have a filibuster. No, we could not even \ndebate them even though a majority of Senators voted for cloture. Not \n60 votes but a majority. So the majority was thwarted from the ability \nto even bring these up and debate them or even letting people offer \namendments.\n  It used to be that if a Senator opposed a bill, he or she would \nengage in a spirited debate, try to change people's minds, attempt to \npersuade the public, offer amendments, vote no, and then try to hold \nMembers who voted yes accountable at the ballot box. Isn't that what it \nis about? In contrast, today--and to quote former Republican Senator \nCharles McC. Mathias in 1994:\n\n       The filibuster has become an epidemic, used whenever a \n     coalition can find 41 votes to oppose legislation. The \n     distinction between voting against legislation and blocking a \n     vote, between opposing and obstructing, has nearly \n     disappeared.\n\n  When Senator McC. Mathias spoke and described it as an epidemic, in \nthat Congress there were 80 motions to end filibusters. That is a \nnumber which pales in comparison to today, when we have had 380 motions \nto end the filibuster. To grind this body to a halt, all the minority \nparty has to do is resort to the filibuster of a motion to proceed.\n  Under the critical jobs legislation, all the minority party had to do \nwas block the motion to proceed and then they turn around and blame the \nmajority for failing to address the jobs crisis. We had jobs bills; we \ncould not get them up. We had jobs bills, but then they blamed us for \nfailing to address the jobs crisis. It is no surprise that Americans \nare fed up with the broken government. As that list of blocked bills \ndemonstrates, the anger is fully justified. In too many critical areas \nwhat people see is a dysfunctional Congress that is unable to respond \ncollectively to the urgent challenges we face.\n  As the Des Moines Register recently noted:\n\n       One message candidates heard from voters this election was \n     contempt for partisan gridlock in Congress. One of the \n     biggest obstacles to congressional action is the profusion of \n     filibusters in the Senate.\n\n  It is no surprise that editorials throughout the country have \nrecognized that the use of the filibuster must be changed.\n  USA Today has noted that the ``filibuster has become destructively \nroutine.''\n  The Roanoke Times noted that ``filibuster reform alone will not fix \neverything that is wrong with Washington, but it would remove one of \nthe chief impediments to governing.''\n  The Minnesota Star Tribune stated:\n\n       Most Americans live under the impression that \n     representative democracy's basic precept is majority rule. \n     Sadly, that's no longer the case in the U.S. Senate, where \n     the minority party has so abused the filibuster that it (the \n     minority) now controls the action--or more accurately, the \n     inaction. This perverts the will of the voters and should not \n     be allowed to stand.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the copies of these \neditorials, and others from around the country, in support of \nfilibuster reform be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the StarTribune, Dec. 25, 2012]\n\n                  Filibuster in Need of Major Overhaul\n\n                          (By Editorial Board)\n\n       Most Americans live under the impression that \n     representative democracy's basic precept is majority rule. \n     Sadly, that's no longer the case In the U.S. Senate, where \n     the minority party has so abused the filibuster that it (the \n     minority) now controls the action--or more accurately, the \n     Inaction.\n       This perverts the will of the voters and should not be \n     allowed to stand. As its first order of business next month, \n     the new Senate should reform the filibuster rules in a way \n     that restores fairness to the majority, preserves reasonable \n     rights for the minority and keeps faith with the intent of \n     the Constitution and the voting public. Democrats Jeff \n     Merkley of Oregon and Tom Harkin of Iowa have solid proposals \n     for their fellow senators to consider. What they should not \n     consider is keeping the filibuster rules the way they are.\n       Let's be clear. This is not a partisan matter. The abusers \n     in this case happen to be Republicans. They have masterfully \n     mounted hundreds of filibusters in recent years to frustrate \n     the majority Democrats and, in the process, have remade their \n     leader, Mitch McConnell, into the Senate's de facto majority \n     leader. But Democrats could--and probably would--stoop to the \n     same depths the next time they're relegated to minority \n     status.\n       As an idea, the filibuster has merit, and when used more \n     sparingly in the past, it has won support from this page. Not \n     rushing to judgment is a main function of the Senate, which \n     was intended as a deliberative body. Extending debate also \n     protects important rights for minority views. But the \n     minority's clear abuse of those rights has gone beyond \n     reason.\n       Here's the problem. On nearly every major bill, rather than \n     accept a loss by a simple majority, the minority party \n     launches a filibuster--a procedure that pushes the bill into \n     a limbo of theoretically endless ``debate'' unless a \n     supermajority of 60 votes can be rounded up to stop it. \n     Getting 60 senators to agree on anything is nearly \n     impossible. So the wheels of government grind to a halt. It's \n     a perfect tactic for the minority, because the public tends \n     to blame the majority for ineffectual leadership.\n       But it's worse than that. To mount and maintain a \n     filibuster takes no real effort or conviction. The minority \n     party never has to stand up on the Senate floor to defend its \n     position. There is no real debate, no real deliberation on \n     the nation's important business, or on the scores of judges \n     and other federal officials whose nominations the Senate must \n     confirm.\n       Not since 1970, when ``silent filibusters'' were adopted, \n     have senators had to hold the floor in the manner made famous \n     by the film ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' (1939) or the \n     endless tag-team ordeals that Strom Thurmond and other \n     southern senators employed against civil-rights legislation \n     in the 1960s.\n       Even In those bygone days, senators reserved filibusters \n     for extraordinary moments. But now they are routine. In his \n     six years as majority leader, Harry Reid has faced 380 \n     filibusters. Lyndon Johnson, in his six years as majority \n     leader (1955-1961), dealt with one.\n       ``If you had a child acting like this, you'd worry about \n     him,'' former Vice President Walter Mondale told a University \n     of Minnesota audience last week. As a senator, Mondale led \n     efforts to reform the filibuster in 1975, but clearly his \n     changes weren't enough to halt the abuse.\n       Merkley's proposal would bring back the traditional \n     ``talking filibuster.'' If more than half of senators voted \n     to end debate, but not the 60 votes required, then senators \n     would have to hold the floor with talking marathons.\n       Harkin offers a ``sliding filibuster.'' If the 60-vote \n     threshold to halt a filibuster isn't met, a 57-vote threshold \n     kicks in three days later, then a 54-vote threshold three \n     days after that. Finally, after nine days, the bill could \n     pass by a simple majority.\n       A third option is to get rid of the filibuster altogether. \n     A pending lawsuit from Common Cause proposes just that, \n     arguing that requiring a supermajority is unlawful except on \n     treaties and other Matters enumerated in the Constitution.\n       As currently practiced, the filibuster is a cynical affront \n     to voters and to the precepts of representative democracy. It \n     does not extend debate in a meaningful way. It does not make \n     the Senates deliberative body. It does more harm than good. \n     It should be reformed at the earliest possible moment\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Des Moines Register, Dec. 6, 2012]\n\n                   Time Has Come To End Senate Logjam\n\n                  (By The Register's Editorial Staff)\n\n       One message candidates heard from voters this election was \n     contempt for partisan gridlock in Congress. One of the \n     biggest obstacles to congressional action is the profusion of \n     filibusters in the Senate.\n       Now is the time to reform Senate rules to break that \n     legislative logjam.\n       It's a longstanding tradition for senators to block \n     legislation by merely talking it to\n\n[[Page S250]]\n\n     death, known as a filibuster. Though by definition a \n     filibuster means literally obstructing Senate procedures by \n     continuous speech by members on the floor, a senator can have \n     the same effect these days by simply threatening to \n     filibuster. That is increasingly common.\n       The only way to stop a filibuster, according to the \n     Senate's rules, is by a ``cloture'' vote, which requires the \n     support of three-fifths of the body, or 60 senators. The \n     upshot is a minority of senators can block the will of the \n     majority.\n       In the past six years alone, 385 cloture motions have been \n     filed in the Senate calling for votes to end filibusters. \n     That is more than all of such motions filed in the 70-year \n     period after the cloture-vote rule was created, according to \n     a report by the Brennan Center for Justice. This has become \n     so common that it is assumed a 60 percent supermajority is \n     required for all votes.\n       That was not the intent of the framers, however. The \n     Constitution requires a supermajority vote for a limited \n     number of issues, which means only a majority is necessary on \n     all others.\n       Still, the filibuster is deeply rooted in Senate tradition. \n     The Senate cherishes the right of any senator to be fully \n     heard. Thus, the rules say no senator ``shall interrupt \n     another senator in debate without his consent.'' In other \n     words, one senator can hold the floor as long as he or she \n     has the capacity to speak.\n       Originally one had to actually talk continuously to prevent \n     a bill coming to a vote, which Southerners did to great \n     effect to block civil rights laws in the 1950s. Indeed, the \n     late Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina still holds the \n     record for talking 24 hours and 18 minutes in August 1957. \n     The previous record holder was Louisiana Sen. Huey Long who \n     would read aloud recipes, instructions on how to fry oysters \n     and the occasional ``rambling discourse on the subject of \n     `potlilkker','' according to one account.\n       The Senate has sought to curb the filibuster before. In \n     1917, the rules were changed to provide for a way to end a \n     filibuster if two-thirds of the body is in favor, or 67 \n     votes. The threshold was lowered to three-fifths, 60 votes, \n     in 1975.\n       Some argue that changing the rules would destroy the \n     Senate, but the party making that case is usually in the \n     minority and is using the filibuster to frustrate the \n     majority. Both parties are guilty of abusing the rules to \n     make it next to impossible for the Senate to perform its \n     duty, which is to act on legislation. Both parties should \n     agree on a compromise to reform the filibuster.\n       The Senate should agree on a rule change that recognizes \n     the Senate's respect for hearing the views of the minority \n     and to preserve the Senate's role in slowing reckless \n     proposals from the House for more thoughtful consideration.\n       But it should not preserve the status quo, which means that \n     nothing gets done in the Senate, and by extension nothing \n     gets done in Congress. That is neither the intent of the \n     Constitution or of the American people.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Dec. 12, 2012]\n\n                      Go Nuclear on the Filibuster\n\n                              (Editorial)\n\n       Harry Reid offers a plan to curb a tactic that has created \n     gridlock in Congress. It's a good start.\n       Nothing exposes partisan hypocrisy quite like the \n     filibuster, that irksome parliamentary rule that allows a \n     minority of U.S. senators to block legislation, judicial \n     appointments and other business by requiring a 60-vote \n     majority to proceed to a vote. Almost invariably, the party \n     in power considers the filibuster to be an enemy of progress \n     that must be squashed, while the minority fights to preserve \n     it at all cost. That the same players often find themselves \n     arguing from opposite sides depending on whether they control \n     the Senate or are in the minority hardly seems to trouble \n     most lawmakers.\n       So comes now Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) \n     with a campaign to alter the filibuster rule using the so-\n     called nuclear option, which if invoked on the opening day of \n     the new legislative session would allow senators to change \n     the rules by majority vote. Republicans are appalled that he \n     would consider such a ploy, even though they floated the same \n     proposal when they held the majority in 2005. Back then, \n     reform was blocked when a Gang of 14 senators led \n     negotiations that kept the filibuster largely intact, and top \n     Senate Republicans are reportedly reaching out to their \n     Democratic counterparts in an effort to repeat that \n     ``success.'' We hope they fail.\n       For the record, we were rooting for the Republicans to go \n     nuclear in 2005, and we feel the same way with Democrats in \n     control. This is not a venerable rule created by the Founding \n     Fathers to protect against the tyranny of the majority, but a \n     procedural nicety that has been altered many times throughout \n     history. In its current incarnation, it goes much too far and \n     has produced gridlock in Congress.\n       Reid reportedly aims to return to the era of the ``talking \n     filibuster,'' when senators who wanted to hold up a bill had \n     to stand up and debate it ceaselessly, day and night. This \n     doesn't go quite far enough; Reid should also place limits on \n     the number of opportunities for senators to mount \n     filibusters, and put the burden on minority opponents by \n     forcing them to come up with 40 votes to sustain a \n     filibuster, rather than requiring the majority to drum up 60 \n     votes to end it. Nonetheless, Reid's plan is a nice start, \n     requiring those who want to hold up legislation to do so \n     publicly and to use their oratorical skills to explain why \n     such a move is justified.\n       Even many Democrats realize that someday they'll be in the \n     minority, and fret that a future Republican-dominated chamber \n     will use Reid's precedent to put even stricter limits on \n     filibusters. But that's no reason not to approve Reid's \n     proposal. If some future Senate majority wants to go \n     thermonuclear, that's a debate for another day.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Dec. 11, 2012]\n\n                        Ending Filibuster Abuse\n\n       Our view: In a matter of weeks, incoming Senators can \n     strike a blow for democracy and approve badly needed reforms \n     to the chamber's dysfunctional filibuster rule.\n       The announcement last week that South Carolina's Jim DeMint \n     is leaving his Senate seat to run the Heritage Foundation \n     caused some in Washington to wishfully think that perhaps the \n     move might usher in a more congenial, if not cooperative, \n     outlook in the U.S. Senate.

There is no evidence the \n     Constitution's architects envisioned it as a place where \n     legislation goes to die.\n       And yet that's what it has become.\n       According to the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York \n     University School of Law, the Senate has passed a record-low \n     2.8 percent of bills introduced during the current 112th \n     Congress. Judicial nominations have languished on average for \n     more than six months.\n       That inaction can be tied to the increased use of \n     filibusters--or even the threat of them--a tactic that, \n     operationally, means it takes a supermajority of 60 votes to \n     pass anything.\n       That's not only anti-democratic--a point made in the \n     Federalist Papers by Alexander Hamilton and James Madison--it \n     also is embarrassing. The Senate has simply stopped making \n     decisions on critical issues. Each parties uses procedural \n     tactics to frustrate the other, and as a result, the work of \n     the American people isn't getting done.\n       Now some junior Democrats want to vote on changing the \n     Senate's rules when the 113th Congress opens in January, and \n     Majority Leader Harry Reid says they'll get that vote. The \n     suggested changes make sense: No more blocking motions to \n     bring a bill to the floor or convene conference committees. \n     And a requirement that senators who wish to filibuster a bill \n     once again stand and talk for hours on end to block its \n     consideration. We'd add an idea from the nonpartisan No \n     Labels group: a 90-day deadline for confirmation votes.\n       Republicans who favored similar reforms when Democrats used \n     the rules to frustrate their majority during the Bush years \n     now complain that Reid would destroy the Senate's culture if \n     he rams through changes by a majority vote--and some veteran \n     Democrats, who recall being in the minority, agree.

But \n     even the longest journey begins with a single step, which is \n     why the Senate should enact two quick and easy reforms when \n     the 113th Congress convenes in January.\n       No, this has nothing to do with the so-called ``fiscal \n     cliff,'' which is a crisis that for now is wholly owned by \n     the House of Representatives. But it is a reminder that there \n     are pressing issues in addition to the nation's financial \n     crisis. Among them is the fact that there is gridlock in the \n     Senate. Yes, the austere, august Senate, originally designed \n     as a refuge of nobility and decorum, is no more noble than \n     the sandbox fight that is the House.\n       During the past six years, Republicans used the \n     parliamentary procedure known as a filibuster almost 400 \n     times to waylay legislation. That is about twice as often as \n     the\n\n[[Page S251]]\n\n     procedure was used during the previous six years, and it \n     included the filibustering of simple procedural motions. All \n     of this suggests the Republicans have been more interested in \n     obstructionism than productivity, and we would hope for a \n     little less paralysis and a lot more action from the next \n     Senate.\n       To be sure, the filibuster is a necessary and often-\n     productive method for preventing tyranny of the majority. The \n     party that is not in power must have some means to prevent \n     being bulldozed by an overzealous ruling party that wishes to \n     limit debate. But the modern filibuster isn't the filibuster \n     they taught about in your grandfather's high school Civics \n     class.\n       The traditional filibuster evokes images of a courageous \n     legislator righteously standing up for his or her beliefs, \n     speaking for hours on the Senate floor and resorting to \n     reading the phone book if necessary to prevent a bill from \n     coming to a vote. Yet the modern filibuster consists of \n     little more than a notification that a filibuster is in \n     effect--and that notification can be delivered anonymously. \n     The filibuster then prevents a vote and effectively kills \n     legislation unless a cloture vote can be passed to end the \n     ``debate.'' This essentially means that 60 votes are required \n     to pass any legislation out of the Senate, providing the \n     minority party with more power than voters have willed to \n     them.\n       That brings us to our proposals:\n       Restore the rule requiring actual floor debate to sustain a \n     filibuster. Not only would this force senators to act on \n     their convictions rather than their partisan predilections, \n     but in a world of 24/7 media coverage it would allow voters \n     to see exactly who is holding up legislation and to consider \n     why they are doing so. If a senator wishes to read recipes in \n     order to prevent a vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act, so be \n     it. But let the country watch.\n       Prohibit anonymous filibusters. If a senator wishes to \n     prevent a vote on the Dream Act, fine. But he or she should \n     own it, for the whole world to see. The trick is that any \n     procedural changes governing Senate business can be passed by \n     a simple majority--if the change is made on the first day of \n     a new session. The 113th Congress will convene on Jan. 3, \n     2013, and we urge the new Senate to show that it is \n     interested in a new way of doing business--one that actually \n     welcomes debate and accountability rather than allowing \n     legislators to silently and anonymously block the people's \n     business.\n       We should expect nothing less from those we send to \n     Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the San Bernardino County Sun, \n                             Dec. 7, 2012]\n\n                Back to the Future on Filibuster Reform\n\n                     (By the San Jose Mercury News)\n\n       The Senate needs to go back to the future on filibuster \n     reform.

Strom Thurmond spoke for a record 24 hours and 18 \n     minutes against the Civil Rights Act, which he labeled \n     unconstitutional and ``cruel and unusual punishment.''\n       The Senate is supposed to debate the great issues of the \n     day, not stop them from being debated. Senators should change \n     the rules and get back to work.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. At issue in this debate is a principle at the heart of \nour representative democracy. This is from Alexander Hamilton in \nFederalist Paper No. 22:\n\n       The fundamental maxim of republican government . . . \n     requires that the sense of the majority should prevail.\n\n  The Framers, to be sure, put in place important checks to temper pure \nmajority rule. For example, the Bill of Rights protects fundamental \nrights and liberties. Moreover, the Framers imposed structural \nrequirements. For example, to become a law, a bill must pass both \nHouses of Congress and then it is subject to the President's veto \npower, and then, of course, there are always the courts and the Supreme \nCourt to rule on the constitutionality of legislation.\n  The Senate itself was a check on pure majority rule. As James Madison \nsaid:\n\n       The use of the Senate is to consist in its proceeding with \n     more coolness, with more system, and with more wisdom, than \n     the popular branch.\n\n  Meaning the House of Representatives.\n  To achieve this purpose, citizens from the smallest States have the \nsame number of Senators as citizens from the largest States, which I \ncommented on earlier. Further, Senators are elected every 6 years, not \nevery 2 years. These provisions in the Constitution are ample to \nprotect minority rights and to restrain pure majority rule.\n  What is not necessary and what was never intended is an \nextraconstitutional empowerment of the minority through a de facto \nrequirement that a supermajority of Senators be needed to even consider \na bill or nominee, let alone to enact a measure or confirm an \nindividual for office.\n  As I said earlier, the Constitution was expressly framed and ratified \nto correct the glaring defects of the Articles of Confederation. The \nArticles of\n\n[[Page S252]]\n\nConfederation required a two-thirds supermajority to pass any law and a \nunanimous consent of all States to ratify any amendment. Well, we know \nthat the experience under the Articles of Confederation was a dismal \nfailure, one that crippled the national government. The Framers were \ndetermined to remedy those defects under our new Constitution.\n  It is not surprising that the Founders specifically rejected the idea \nthat more than a majority would be needed for most decisions. In fact, \nthe Framers were crystal clear about when a supermajority is needed--\nfive times. It is spelled out clearly in the Constitution: ratification \nof a treaty, the override of a veto, votes of impeachment, passage of a \nconstitutional amendment, and the expulsion of a Member. It is \nexpressly pointed out in the Constitution.\n  It should be clear, especially to those who worship at the shrine of \n``original intent,'' that if the Framers wanted a supermajority for \nmoving legislation or confirming a nominee, they would have done so. \nThey would have written it in there. Not only did they not do so, until \n1806 the Senate had a rule that allowed for a motion for the previous \nquestion. That goes back to the British Parliament. It permitted a \nmajority to stop debate and bring up an immediate vote.\n  It was Vice President Aaron Burr, as he was leaving the Senate and \nthey were reforming the rules, who said: You know, this is never used. \nWe might as well do away with it because it is never used, anyway. So \nthey did away with the motion for the previous question, but the point \nbeing that the first Congress in the first Senate enacted that. They \nhad that motion for the previous question. The Founders were very clear \nwhy a supermajority requirement was not included. As Hamilton \nexplained, a supermajority requirement would mean that a small minority \ncould ``destroy the energy of government.''\n  That is what Madison said. A supermajority would mean that a small \nminority could ``destroy the energy of government.'' Government would, \nin Hamilton's words, be subject to the ``pleasure, caprice or artifices \nof an insignificant, turbulent or corrupt junta.''\n  James Madison, as I said, said this:\n\n       It would no longer be the majority that would rule, the \n     power would be transferred to the minority.\n\n  Federalist Paper No. 58. When James Madison--sort of the author of \nour Constitution--said, no, you cannot have a supermajority; if you do \nthat, then the minority would rule, the power would be transferred to \nthe minority--unfortunately, Madison's warning has come true. In the \nSenate today--the United States Senate--the minority, not the majority, \ncontrols. In today's Senate, American democracy is turned on its head. \nThe minority rules, the majority is blocked. The majority has \nresponsibility and accountability, but the majority lacks the power to \ngovern. The minority has the power but lacks accountability and \nresponsibility. This means the minority can block bills and prevent \nconfirmation of officials and then turn around and blame the majority \nfor not solving the Nation's problems. The minority can block popular \nlegislation and then accuse the majority of being ineffective.\n\n  I firmly believe we need to restore the tradition of majority rule to \nthe Senate. Elections, I believe, should have consequences. That is why \nI developed my plan, as I said, almost 20 years ago to amend the \nstanding rules to permit a decreasing majority of Senators over a \nperiod of days to invoke cloture on a given matter. I believe it is \nclear in the history of the Senate and of the Framers of the \nConstitution.\n  There is the story, of course, that has been told many times. It may \nbe a popular story, I don't know. Thomas Jefferson, of course, was not \nhere for the drafting of the Constitution. He was in France. He came \nback home and looked at the Constitution. He was having breakfast with \nGeorge Washington. As the story goes, Jefferson was upset about the \nSenate. He looked upon it as another House of Lords. So he asked \nWashington why he allowed such a thing to happen, that the Senate would \nbe created. Washington supposedly said to him: Why did you pour your \ntea into the saucer? Jefferson said: To cool it down. Washington \npurportedly said: Just so. That is why we created the Senate, to cool \nthings down, to slow down legislation, apart from that popular body \nover there, so there could be a more sober second look at things. What \nWashington did not say, as far as I know, was that the Senate was \ncreated to be a trash can where legislation could be killed and \nstopped. The idea was to slow things down, to deliberate.\n  Senator George Hoar noted in 1897 the Framers designed the Senate to \nbe a deliberative forum in which a ``sober second thought of the people \nmight find expression.'' That is what the Senate is supposed to be \nabout. But at the end of ample debate and with the right of the \nminority to be able to offer amendments and have them voted on, the \nmajority should be allowed to act with an up-or-down vote on \nlegislation or on a nominee. In this way, we could restore this body to \none where government can actually function and where we can actually \nlegislate.\n  I think this plan also has another advantage. Recently, the minority \nleader defended the abuse of the filibuster on the grounds that it \nforces the majority to compromise and to ``resolve the great issues of \nthe moment in the middle.'' I strongly disagree with the minority \nleader. Right now, the fact is, because of the abuse of the filibuster, \nthe minority has no incentive to compromise. Why should they? They can \nstop it. They have the power to block legislation without even coming \nto the floor to explain themselves. In such a world, as we have seen \nover the past few years, why would the minority come to the table to \ncut a deal? I showed my colleagues the list of all the legislation they \nhave blocked the last couple years. There wasn't any overture from the \nminority to compromise. They just said: We are going to kill it; the \nmajority is not going to be able to bring it up.\n  The DREAM Act, for example. What are those other bills on the chart? \nThe DREAM Act, and the other ones listed we wanted to bring up. Here is \nthe list again. The DREAM Act. Did the Republicans say we want to \ncompromise? No, they just killed it. The Bring Jobs Home Act, just kill \nit. The Paycheck Fairness Act, just kill it. Creating American Jobs and \nEnding Offshoring Act, just kill it. There was no real attempt to \ncompromise because they didn't have to compromise.\n  In contrast, under my proposal, where we would have 60 votes at the \nbeginning and if we didn't have 60 votes, we would file another cloture \nmotion and wait 3 days, then we would have another vote. Then we would \nneed 57 votes. Then, if we didn't get 57, we could file another cloture \nmotion and then we would wait 3 days and need 54 votes. If we didn't \nget that, we would wait 3 more days, file another cloture motion and \nonly need 51 votes.\n  This would be a period of about 16 days, plus 30 hours of debate, \nthat would be allowed under my proposal. Here is why that would be a \ntrue compromise. The minority wants the right to offer amendments to be \nheard on a bill. I understand that. They should have that right. The \nmost important thing to the majority leader--whether Republican or \nDemocrat, whoever the majority leader may be--the most important thing \nfor the majority leader is time on the floor. So someone files a bill, \nit is filibustered by the minority, they have a cloture vote, and let's \nsay there are only 53 votes for it. The minority knows that at some \npoint, this bill is going to come to the floor. We will get a vote on \nit. The majority leader knows that will happen, but it is going to chew \nup a couple weeks' time. The most important thing to the majority \nleader is time, so the majority leader would like to collapse that \ntime. The minority leader would like to have the right to offer \namendments, and therein is the compromise. The minority leader comes \nand says: If we can offer these amendments, we will collapse the time; \nif not, we will chew up a couple weeks' time. That provokes compromise. \nBut when one side knows that with 41 votes they can absolutely trash \ncan something, why should they compromise if they have the 41 votes?\n  Again, I wish to emphasize another fact about my proposal. The \nRepublicans have said the filibuster is necessary because Democrats \nincreasingly employ procedural maneuvers to deprive them of their right \nto offer amendments. I want my colleagues to\n\n[[Page S253]]\n\nknow I am sympathetic to that argument. That is why in the last \nCongress I included in my resolution the guaranteed right to offer \ngermane amendments; the inherent right of the minority to offer those \namendments.\n  Unfortunately, of course, every Republican voted against my proposal, \nand that is because Republicans currently want the best of both worlds: \nthe right to offer nongermane amendments and the right to obstruct, and \nthat doesn't make sense.\n  Again, no one should be fooled. The fact is the radicals who now hold \nsway in the Republican Party are not concerned with making the \ngovernment or the Senate function better. That is because the current \nuse of the filibuster has nothing to do with ensuring minority rights \nto debate and deliberate or the right to amend; otherwise, they could \nsupport either one of these proposals, either mine or Senator Merkley's \nor Senator Udall's. Nor have I ever heard one Republican come to the \nfloor and unequivocally state that if the majority leader stopped \nfilling the amendment tree, they would routinely vote for cloture, even \nif they opposed the underlying bill. I have not heard one of them say \nthat because the current use of the filibuster has nothing to do with \nminority rights. It has everything to do with obstruction, hijacking \ndemocracy, and a pure power grab designed to nullify elections in which \nthe public has rejected the minority's ideas and placed them in the \nminority so the majority could act.\n  The minority leader, I must say, has been frank about this approach \nto governing. In a speech about the balanced budget amendment, he said \nthe following. Listen to this. This is our minority leader:\n\n       The time has come for a balanced budget amendment that \n     forces Washington to balance its books. The Constitution must \n     be amended to keep the government in check. We have tried \n     persuasion. We have tried negotiations. We have tried \n     elections. Nothing has worked.\n\n  Think about that. In other words, when elections--when democracy \ndoesn't work, what does the minority leader want? The ability to \nundermine the majority from acting in the Senate. Imagine that. We have \ntried elections and the elections didn't go their way. They have tried \nelections. So if they can't do that, then they have to do something \nelse. It seems to me the ballot box ought to be determinative of what \nkind of government we have.\n  Republicans have repeatedly filibustered motions to proceed. How can \nthey offer amendments if we can't even bring it up? They filibuster \njudicial nominees. Of course, nominations can't be amended; again, \nbelying the argument that many Republicans use because of filling the \ntree. There is no tree when it comes to nominations.\n  I want to now emphasize something. I have been saying all along the \nRepublicans and how they have been using the filibuster. I want to say \nunequivocally the Democrats don't come to this with clean hands, I can \ntell my colleagues. It has been both sides. It depends on who is in the \nmajority and who is in the minority. That is all it depends on. As I \nsaid earlier when I first brought this up in the 1990s, I warned then \nof an escalating arms race. I have been in the Senate long enough to \nhave five different changes in the Senate between majority and \nminority, and every single time the number of filibusters goes up--\nevery time. Democrats say to Republicans: You filibustered 30 times \nlast Congress. We are now in power; we will filibuster you 60 times. \nThe Democrats get kicked out and the Republicans come back and they \nsay: They did it 60 times and we will do it 100 times, on and on and \non.\n  It is akin to an arms race. So any time I use the word ``Republican'' \ngenerically, we can just substitute minority. I don't care what \nminority, Democrats or Republicans. It doesn't make any difference. The \nminority in the Senate should not have the absolute power to trash can \nsomething. It should have the power to slow things down, to debate, to \namend, to deliberate, but eventually the majority--the people whom the \npeople at the ballot box in this country have put in charge to govern--\nshould at some point be allowed to govern. If I am in the minority, all \nI want is the right to be able to debate, have my views heard, offer \namendments.\n  I might also say this: The right of the minority is not to win. The \nminority doesn't have the right to win, but it sure has the right to \noffer amendments and to be heard and to be able to try to sway people. \nI have been in the Senate when we have had amendments and, amazingly \nenough, we get some Republicans and some Democrats and it passes, even \nthough some Democrats and some Republicans oppose it. That very rarely \nhappens any longer.\n  Again, I have been talking mostly about Republicans generically, and \nthat is because they are in the minority now. I said the same thing \nabout Democrats when the Democrats were in the minority. This is not a \nminority right. It is nothing less than a form of tyranny by the \nminority. Who said that? That was Senator Frist, the Republican leader, \nagain, in November of 2004, when he was in the majority and we were in \nthe minority: ``This filibuster is nothing less than a formula for \ntyranny by the minority.'' He was right. It just depends on who is in \nthe minority and who is in the majority.\n  That is why we have to make a change. It could be Democrats, it could \nbe Republicans, it could be--even a bipartisan coalition, if it is a \nminority, a small minority.\n  As I said, I don't think there is anything radical about what I have \nintroduced. As I noted, the filibuster was not in the Constitution. It \nwas rejected by the Founders. There is nothing sacred about requiring \n60 votes to end debate. The Senate has adopted rules and laws that \nprevent the filibuster in numerous circumstances. Get that. This Senate \nhas adopted rules that forbid the filibuster in certain cases. The \nbudget cannot be filibustered, war powers cannot be filibustered, \ninternational trade acts--imagine that. International trade acts cannot \nbe filibustered. Congressional Review Act, disapproval of regulations, \ncannot be filibustered. So if the filibuster is so sacred, why have we \ncarved out exceptions for international trade acts?\n  Moreover, article I, section 5, clause 2 of the Constitution, the \nrules of proceedings clause, specifies: ``Each House may determine the \nrules of its proceedings.'' Again, my resolution, far from being \nunprecedented, stands squarely within the tradition of updating Senate \nrules as appropriate to fostering more effective and functioning \nlegislation. For example, beginning in 1917, the Senate passed four \nsignificant amendments to its standing rules, the latest in 1975, to \nnarrow, to shape the filibuster. In 1979, Senator Robert Byrd made \nclear that the Constitution allows a majority of the Senate to change \nits rules. He said:\n\n     [t]he Constitution, in Article I, section 5, specifies that \n     each House may determine the rules of its proceedings. Now we \n     are at the beginning of a Congress.\n\n  Senator Byrd said:\n\n       This Congress is not obliged to be bound by the dead hand \n     of the past . . . It is my belief--which has been supported \n     by rulings of Vice Presidents of both parties and by votes of \n     the Senate in essence upholding the power and right of a \n     majority of the Senate to change the rules of the Senate at \n     the beginning of a new Congress.\n\n  Senator Byrd: ``This Congress is not obliged to be bound by the dead \nhand of the past.'' He said that. `` . . . power and right of a \nmajority of the Senate to change the rules of the Senate at the \nbeginning of a new Congress.''\n  Again, this was also the opinion of the Republican Party. As I \nmentioned, in 2005 the Republican policy committee, chaired by our \nformer colleague Senator Kyl, stated:\n\n       The Senate has always had, and repeatedly has exercised, \n     the constitutional power to change the Senate's procedures \n     through a majority vote.\n\n  That is a statement from the Republican policy committee in 2005.\n  Those who say this is some kind of nuclear option, blow up the \nSenate, all these terms about nuclear options--no, it is not a nuclear \noption. As Senator Byrd said and as Senator Kyl said, ``The Senate has \nalways had, and repeatedly has exercised, the constitutional power to \nchange the Senate's procedures through a majority vote.''\n  There are those now--I must admit, some in my own party on this side \nof the aisle in the Senate--who say that in order to change the rules, \nwe have to have a two-thirds vote. Now, why is that? Well, because some \nSenate in the past set down the rules. They said that in order to \nchange these rules, you need a two-thirds vote. Are we bound\n\n[[Page S254]]\n\nby that dead hand of the past? Not at all. Not at all. Each new \nCongress--each time the Senate convenes after a new Congress forms--can \nby majority vote change its own rules. It is not a nuclear option at \nall.\n  To be very clear, I opposed the Frist motion at that time in 2005, \nand I made it clear why--because they were attempting to change the \nrules in the middle of a Congress.\n  While I believe the Congress has the power--I'm sorry, it was the \nRepublican policy committee. It is at the beginning of a Congress.\n  Senator Byrd said:\n\n       It is my belief--which has been supported by rulings of \n     Vice Presidents of both parties and by votes of the Senate in \n     essence upholding the power and right of the majority of the \n     Senate to change the rules of the Senate at the beginning of \n     a new Congress.\n\n  I mean, you can't go changing rules every other week. How do you know \nwhat is going to happen? But at the beginning of a Congress every 2 \nyears, the Senate has the right by a majority vote to set down the \nrules, and you operate by those rules for 2 years. What Senator Frist \nwas trying to do was change it in the middle of the game. Well, if you \ngo down that pathway, my goodness, the majority could change the rules \nnext week and the week after, do it one time one week and one time the \nnext. How would you ever know what the rules of the road were? The only \nreason I opposed the Frist motion at that time was because it was \nchanging it in the middle of a Congress.\n  Here is a letter from numerous constitutional scholars, including \nCharles Fried, Solicitor General under President Reagan, and Michael \nMcConnell, a former Federal judge nominated by President George W. \nBush. These scholars make clear that at the beginning of a new \nCongress, a majority of the Senate can change its rules. Here is the \nletter, and it reads in part:\n\n       Some, however, have sought to elevate the debate to \n     constitutional dimensions by suggesting that it is \n     institutionally improper for a new Senate to alter the \n     Senate's rules by majority vote because the internal \n     procedures adopted by prior Senates have required a two-third \n     majority to allow a vote on a motion to alter the rules.\n       With respect, such a concern confuses the power to change \n     the Senate rules during a session with the unquestioned \n     constitutional power of each incoming Senate to fix its own \n     rules unencumbered by the decisions of past Senates. The \n     standing two-thirds requirement for altering the Senate's \n     rules is a sensible effort at preventing changes to the rules \n     in the midst of a game. It cannot, however, prevent the \n     Senate, at the beginning of a new game, from adopting rules \n     deemed necessary to permit the just, efficient and orderly \n     operations of the 113th Senate. . . .\n\n  This letter from Charles Fried, Solicitor General under President \nReagan, and Michael McConnell, a former Federal judge nominated by \nPresident George W. Bush, states:\n\n       We agree with the overwhelming consensus of the academic \n     community that no preexisting internal procedural rule can \n     limit the constitutional authority of each new Senate to \n     determine by majority vote its own rules of procedure.\n       We agree with the overwhelming consensus of the academic \n     community that no preexisting internal procedural rule can \n     limit the constitutional authority of each new Senate to \n     determine by majority vote its own rules of procedure.\n\n  That is very profound. So it is not just me as a Democrat. Here are \ntwo Republicans, very prominent Republicans, saying the same thing.\n  The last significant rules change, I might point out, was in 1975, \nwhen the number of votes necessary for cloture was set at 60. There is \nonly one Senator today--Senator Leahy--who was in the Senate in 1975 to \nvote on that current version of rule XXII. No one else was here then. \nWe have had how many different Senates since that time, and yet that \ndead hand of the past continues to rule.\n  Mr. President, I would like to emphasize that I firmly agree that \namending the standing rules is necessary. Informal agreements are \ninsufficient to return the Senate to functionality. We had this last \ntime--sort of a handshake agreement to make the Senate a better \ninstitution through fewer filibusters, procedural delays, et cetera. \nLooking back over the last 2 years, I don't think anyone would agree \nthat this gentleman's agreement was very effective.\n  The minority leader recently stated that the reforms being advocated \nby me and others are being done with the ``purpose of consolidating \npower and further marginalizing the minority voice.'' Nothing--\nnothing--could be further from the truth. I want to be clear that the \nreforms I advocate are not about one party or one agenda gaining an \nunfair advantage. It is about the Senate as an institution operating \nmore fairly, effectively, and democratically. Those of us who went to \nlaw school all remember that if you come into the court of equity, you \nhave to come in with clean hands. I hope that I have clean hands since \nI first offered this when I was in the minority. I was in the minority.\n\n  Again, I would point out that it belies belief that sometime in the \nfuture, Democrats won't be in the minority again. It is going to \nhappen, and it should. No one party should rule here for long periods \nof time. We need to have that kind of change. But what we need is the \nability of whoever is in the majority to be able to govern. That is \nwhat the people elected them to do.\n  Well, the truth is that we do not function here. We do not function \nin the way we are supposed to under the Constitution--something both \nDemocrats and Republicans should care about. What was never envisioned \nand what should not be allowed to continue is a system where bills are \nprevented from being debated or the idea that a small minority can \nblock legislation or nominees without even coming to the floor to \nexplain themselves.\n  Finally, there is one other red herring that keeps coming up, and \nthat is that somehow the reform I am proposing or any reform will \nsomehow make the Senate like the House. I have heard that from Members \nfrom the other side of the aisle--oh, we will just become like the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I have to ask the question, since when did the Senate become defined \nby rule XXII, the cloture rule? Why does that define the Senate? It \nseems to me the Senate was designed in the Constitution where we have \ntwo Senators from every State, small and large; where we are reelected \nevery 6 years, not every 2; where the Senate has certain functions on \ntreaties and on nominations that the House of Representatives doesn't \nhave; and where the Constitution is very clear; there are five times \nwhere the Senate must have a supermajority to act.\n  Again, I would point out that the Senate will, by its very nature--\neven under my proposed reform or even that of Mr. Udall or Mr. \nMerkley--still operate based on unanimous consent, and each Senator \nwill continue to understand that maintaining good relationships with \nall Senators, working hard to become experts in issues, and drafting \nlegislation and amendments will remain the essence of what it means to \nbe a Senator, not the ability to filibuster.\n  To those who say we have become more like the House, I say that is \nnot going to happen. Well, it could. Sure it could. Some future Senate \ncould wipe out all the rules--wipe out all the rules. Now, they \ncouldn't do away with the constitutional aspect. They couldn't make us \nelected every 2 years, for example, but take away the function of the \nSenate in terms of treaties, impeachments, and things like that, sure. \nAny future Congress can change the rules.\n  I think that because of the nature of the Senate, the way it is \nestablished, because of the way it is set in the Constitution--two from \nevery State, not popularly elected every 2 years--that means Senators \nwill have to work with one another. They will have to exhibit that kind \nof comity--c-o-m-i-t-y, not comedy--of recognizing that each Senator \nshould have the right to amend, to debate, to discuss the question, to \noffer amendments.\n  Again, we were told that somehow the filibuster--this idea that the \nfilibuster somehow defines the Senate, again, until 1970 there was \napproximately one filibuster per Congress. Did anyone ever suggest then \nthat because there was not the rapid use of a filibuster, the Senate \nwas no different from the House? Was the Senate of Clay, Wagner, \nVandenberg, Johnson, and Taft just another House of Representatives? \nWere the giants in the Senate who came before us--the Daniel Websters, \nthe Henry Clays, the Robert Tafts, the Hubert Humphreys--were they any \nless a Senator because they were not defined by a de facto 60-vote \nsupermajority requirement?\n\n[[Page S255]]\n\n  I believe the Senate should embrace George Washington's vision of \nthis body, if that story is true about him and Jefferson and the saucer \nand the tea. The Senate was set up to slow things down to ensure proper \ndebate and deliberation. That is what the Founders intended. That is \nwhat we have advocated and I advocate. We will not become the House. As \none author has noted, however, the increasing use of the filibuster has \nconverted the Senate from the saucer George Washington intended into a \ndeep freeze and a dead weight.\n  At the heart of this debate is a central question: Do we believe in \ndemocracy?\n  Republicans and, sadly, many of my colleagues in my own caucus \nrepeatedly warn about advancing these reforms because Democrats will \nfind themselves in the minority one day and we may want to stop \nsomething. Well, I am sorry, I don't fear democracy. If the people of \nthis country at the ballot box put the Republicans in charge of the \nSenate, the Republicans ought to have the right to govern. We should \nhave the right to be able to offer amendments and debate and \ndeliberate, but we should not have the right to absolutely obstruct \nwhat the majority is doing. Issues of public policy should be decided \nat the ballot box, not by the manipulation of archaic procedural rules.\n  The truth is that neither party should be afraid of majority rule, \nafraid of allowing a majority of the people's representatives to work \nits will. After ample protections for minority rights, the majority in \nthe Senate, whether Democratic, Republican, or a bipartisan coalition, \nduly elected by the American people, should be allowed to carry out its \nagenda, to govern, and to be held accountable at the ballot box.\n  I wish to conclude by noting that it is often said--and it is true--\nthat the power of a Senator comes not by what we can do but by what we \ncan stop. That is true. The Senate is a body in which one individual \nSenator has an enormous amount of power to stop things. No one wants to \ngive up that power. But I believe it is time for us Senators to take a \nlook at ourselves. For the good of the Senate and, more importantly, \nfor the good of the country, we need to give up that power--not all of \nit but a little bit of it. I am willing to give it up.\n\n  All Senators should have fundamental confidence in democracy and the \ngood sense of the American people. We must have confidence in our \nability to make our case to the people and to prevail at the ballot \nbox. We must not be afraid of democracy. I am not afraid of it. I, \nquite frankly, believe my ideas, my support of certain measures, is \nmore widely supported by the American people than my friends on the \nother side of the aisle. They believe just the opposite. That is good. \nThat is the way we should operate here in grinding out legislation and \nthen at the ballot box every 2 years.\n  Healthy debate is about the direction of the country and which way we \nshould go. We should have the confidence--the Republicans should have \ntheir own confidence and we should have our own confidence--in our \nability to make our case to the people and to prevail at the ballot \nbox. I say: Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid of the American people and \ntheir inherent ability to make wise and just decisions. Things may go \nawry one time or another time, but in the great history of our country, \nthe American people--as Winston Churchill once said: After we try \neverything else, we always do the right thing--the American people make \nthe right decisions. Sometimes I may not agree with it, but then it is \nmy business to go out and try to convince my constituents and others \nthey made the wrong choice; that we should be going in a different \ndirection.\n  That is the essence of democracy, not the power of me, a Senator from \nIowa, being able to stop what the majority wants to do; not me, just \nwith a handful of other people saying: I don't care what they want to \ndo; we can stop it, put it in the trash can.\n  All I want is the right to debate, to discuss, to be able to offer \namendments that are germane to the legislation. So, again, I am not \nafraid of living with these reforms, both as a member of the majority \nparty and as a member of the minority party, which I am sure we will \nonce again become at some point in the future.\n  So, Mr. President, as I have over the last, I guess it makes 17 years \nnow, I come to the floor knowing that my proposal will not win. Well, \nit hasn't thus far. And that is all right. A lot of times people say: \nWhy do you offer it? You know you are going to lose.\n  I offer it because I believe so deeply in this, and I believe \nsometimes you just have to stand for what you believe in, and you have \nto make your case as forcefully, as intelligently as possible. I hope I \nhave done that both in my words and in my statement and in the past \ndebates I have had on this Senate floor that occur about every 2 years \nwhen the Senate convenes.\n  I don't carry this beyond the first day of legislative business. I \ndon't think we should. If we set the rules down on the first day, after \nthat I don't think we should be changing the rules in the middle of the \ngame. But we are still in the first legislative day, and I think now is \nthe time to do this.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I know our distinguished \nminority and majority leaders have been working hard on some reforms on \nthe filibuster. I am not privy to all of that. I don't know exactly all \nthe details of it, although it was discussed in our policy caucus \ntoday. But I will say this about it--at least what I understand to be \nthe essence of the reforms that our majority leader has worked so hard \non--it is better than what we have right now. From what I understand--\nand I don't know all the details--it is a step in the right direction.\n  I want to make it clear that I might vote for it--as soon as I find \nout exactly what it all is. I might vote for it because it is probably \nbetter than what we have right now. But I just want to be clear that my \nvote for that does not signify that I prefer that over doing away with \nthis absolute 60-vote threshold because under the reformed rules that I \nunderstand are being promulgated by the majority and minority leaders, \nwe still have a 60-vote threshold on anything except for the motion to \nproceed.\n  So on any amendment, any bill, we still have 60 votes. So a small \ngroup, a handful, can still put bills and amendments and everything \nelse in the trash can. I just fundamentally disagree with that. So if I \ndo vote for that--like I say, I probably will--it is because it looks \nlike it might be better than what we have now.\n  I know it is tough. I do not denigrate for one minute the effort and \nthe work of the majority leader and the minority leader in trying to \nreach these agreements. These are tough things. I just think we have to \nbe more forthright in constantly--every 2 years--going after this idea \nthat somehow this dead hand of the past that says we need a two-thirds \nvote to change the rules and that somehow that controls us--it \nshouldn't; it doesn't control us--that somehow we have to adhere to \nthis 60-vote threshold forever. That shouldn't control us.\n  Every 2 years, according to the Constitution, according to Senator \nByrd, according to constitutional scholars of both parties, we have the \nconstitutional right at the beginning of a Congress to change our rules \nwith a majority vote. That is what we ought to be about doing.\n  So, Mr. President, I look forward to seeing the proposed rules reform \nthe majority leader and minority leader have been working on. Again, I \nknow it is tough to work these things out, but I think this body has to \nmove ahead and do away with that dead hand of the past and provide for \nrules changes that allow us to function, that allow the majority to \nact, with the right of the minority to debate, to slow things down and \nto amend--but not the right to win. I have never said the minority has \nto have the right to win. But the minority ought to have the right to \nmake their voices and their votes heard in this body.\n  That is what my proposal would do. Again, as I said, I don't expect \nit to win, but I want people to be able to express themselves if they \nbelieve we should move in that direction, and I offer it in that vein. \nI know there are those who believe somehow that we have to abide by \nthat two-thirds vote, by this dead hand of the past. I just don't \nbelieve so.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S256]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/24/senate-section/article/S256-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S256-S259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the period of \nmorning business be extended until 6:30 p.m. today, and that all \nprovisions of the previous order remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, let me compliment Senator Harkin \nfor his incredible leadership in bringing to the attention of this body \nsomething I think everyone understands; that is, with the procedures of \nthe Senate and the way it is operating today, there is a problem. There \nis a very serious problem.\n  All one needs to do is to turn on C-SPAN to see the Senate in a \nquorum call for hours to know there is a better way for us to operate. \nAll one has to do is to look at a week that goes by where there are \nvery few recorded votes to know there is opportunity for debate and \naction that is being lost in the Senate. We can do better. The \nprocedures we are following today, the way that is being honored by the \nMembers of the Senate, we need to change the rules and procedures of \nthe Senate.\n  I want to thank the majority leader and the Republican leader for \nnegotiating and getting together to understand the frustrations that \nare out there in both of our caucuses and to try to come up with \nreasonable changes in our rules. I see Senator McCain is on the floor, \nand I acknowledge his leadership, along with that of Senator Levin. I \nwas honored to work with that group, along with Senators Pryor, \nSchumer, Barrasso, Alexander, and our former colleague, Senator Kyl. We \nsat for hours debating, and it was very educational for me, Mr. \nPresident, because I listened to the concerns of my Republican \ncolleagues--and it was a lot different than what I heard in the \nDemocratic caucus--and I think we both learned a lot from each other.\n  But there was general agreement that there is a real problem in the \noperation of the Senate, and we have an obligation to take a look at \nour rules and see whether we can't modify the rules so we can have the \ntype of deliberation, debate, and voting that is expected of the \nSenate.\n  One of the problems that became very apparent to all of us is that \nindividual Senators are able to block the consideration of amendments \nand bills on the floor of the Senate indefinitely. That is wrong. My \ncolleague from Arizona pointed out that someone could be in their home \nState and offer an objection, and a bill could be brought to a \nstandstill. That is not how the Senate should operate. We should be \nable to consider legislation, and individual Senators should not be \nable to block the consideration of that legislation.\n  I could give examples of hundreds of bills that have been reported \nout of our committees in the Senate that have never reached the floor \nof the Senate. Quite frankly, the reason is an individual Senator \nblocked consideration, and it would take the majority leader too much \ntime to go through cloture motions in order to bring those issues to \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  We also have seen an abuse of the 60-vote threshold. The 60-vote \nthreshold shouldn't be the standard working procedure of the Senate. A \nsimple majority should control our actions. Yet in too many cases we \nhave used the 60-vote threshold in order to move legislation forward.\n  We have also seen that it is very difficult to bring amendments up \nfor consideration. It has been very difficult to get action on \nindividual amendments on the floor of the Senate. So we need to change \nour procedures. We need to be the great deliberative body which \nhistorically the Senate has been.\n  I want to compliment many of my colleagues--I already mentioned the \ngroup that worked on some suggested rules changes and made those \nrecommendations to the majority leader and the Republican leader--but I \nalso want to thank my colleague, Senator Harkin, who just spoke, for \nhis leadership on this issue, as well as Senators Merkley and Tom \nUdall, who have been leaders on this matter. We have brought this to \nthe attention not only of our colleagues but to the attention of the \nAmerican people, and they expect us to take action to improve the \noperation of the Senate.\n  Let me talk a moment about the negotiated agreement between the \nDemocratic leader and the Republican leader--between the majority and \nminority leaders--and what I understand will be recommended to us very \nshortly, and I hope we can act on it as early as this evening.\n  First, one of the frustrations is that we find it difficult to bring \na bill to the floor of the Senate in a motion to proceed. The threat of \na filibuster on the motion to proceed has denied us the opportunity to \neven start debating an issue. Under the agreement I expect will be \nbrought forward, the majority leader will have two additional \nopportunities to start debate on an issue.\n  First, if the Republican leader is in agreement, they can bring that \nbill to the floor immediately, without any preconditions. That could \nparticularly work well on institutional issues that need to be dealt \nwith, such as appropriations bills, so that we can get onto \nappropriations bills a lot sooner than we can today.\n  There is then another opportunity where the majority leader could \nbring a bill to the floor without the fear of a filibuster, without \nhaving to file cloture, by offering amendments. There would be a \nguaranteed right to offer up to four amendments: two by the minority, \ntwo by the majority. That gets us started on legislation.\n  Now, it is very interesting, if one looks at the process that has \nbeen used where bills come to the floor and where we are most pleased \nby how the process has worked--such as in the case of the national \ndefense authorization bill, postal reform, and the Agriculture bill in \nthe 112th Congress--in each of those cases the committees voted on the \nbills, they came to the floor with the managers, we started on the \nbills, and we completed the bills. I think we were all pretty proud \nwith the manner in which those issues were handled on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Under this process, the majority leader could get us started. The \nmanagers can get us started on legislation. Once we start on \nlegislation, once we start debating the issues, we can see what \namendments are out there, and we can try to manage the time \nappropriately and actually get action and debate and votes on the floor \nof the Senate on the amendments and on final passage.\n  I do think this empowers our committees. We all spend a lot of time \nin our committees. We are there for the hearings, we want to see \ncommittee markups, but we also like to see the products we bring up in \nthe committee be the major work on the floor of the Senate. Well, now, \nwith this reform and the ability of the leader to bring forward a bill \nthat has come out of our committees, our committee products will be \nmore respected, and we will have a better legislative process because \nwe are using the products that come out of our committee. We are \nrespecting the work of our committees. We are rewarding our chairmen \nand ranking members working together and bringing legislation to the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I think that is a real major improvement and something that will \nallow the Senate to operate in the way it should.\n  We also allow for conference committees to be formed in a more \nexpedited way. Right now it could take three cloture votes to get into \nconference. We contract that into one. I think that is going to be the \nrecommendation.\n  I had the honor in the 112th Congress to serve on a conference \ncommittee that dealt with the payroll tax extension. We got our work \ndone, brought a bill to the floor of the Senate and the House, and got \nit enacted into law because we were able, in a very open and \ntransparent way, to work with our colleagues in the other body, resolve \nour differences, and bring legislation forward. I might be wrong, but I \nthink that was the only conference committee that operated in the 112th \nCongress. There haven't been many. I think most Members of this body \nwould be hard-pressed to remember when they last served on a conference \ncommittee. Yet we know there are significant differences between the \nproducts that come out of this body and the products that come out of \nthe other body. We need to reconcile those differences. Being able to \ngo into conference allows us the opportunity to let\n\n[[Page S257]]\n\nthe legislative process work the way it should.\n  One of the procedures the majority leader is going to talk about is \nthat once cloture is invoked, if you have to use cloture, you have 30 \nhours. But you don't guarantee 30 hours. That 30 hours is the maximum. \nEach Member is entitled to only 1 hour to speak, and a quorum call \nduring postcloture can be considered dilatory if we have already \nestablished a quorum.\n  The majority leader and the minority leader are going to talk about \nthe fact that postcloture, if you want to speak, come to the floor and \nspeak. If you don't, the Presiding Officer should put the issue to the \nmembership for vote so we can expedite issues and not waste a full day \nletting the 30 hours expire.\n  There will also be recommendations to deal with nominations. We were \nextremely frustrated. I served on the Judiciary Committee. I had the \nopportunity to recommend to the President several appointments to the \nFederal bench. It took months for these noncontroversial nominees to be \napproved on the floor of the Senate. It truly affects our ability to \nrecruit the very best to serve on our courts.\n  The same thing is true with the President on his team to have in \nplace, and there will be recommendations to shorten the postcloture \ntime if a cloture vote is needed on judicial nominations to, I think, 2 \nhours, and sub-Cabinet appointments to around 8 hours. That allows the \nleader to be able to bring these issues to the floor without the threat \nthat it would tie us up for weeks to take up just a couple \nappointments.\n  These are all major improvements. Let me make it clear. If I were \nwriting the rules of the Senate, I would go a lot further. I know I \nmight be in the minority in this body, but I happen to believe in \nmajority rule. I happen to believe the majority should make the \ndecisions. I think there should be adequate time for debate, et cetera. \nThe Senate is different than the House. I accept that. But at the end \nof the day, I am in favor of majority rule. But I am also in favor of \ntrying to get our rules done in a bipartisan manner because, quite \nfrankly, the Democrats may not be in the majority forever.\n  If we look since 1981 through the end of this Congress, but for \nSenator Jeffords' decision in May of 2001 to become an Independent and \ncaucus with the Democrats, the Senate would have been divided as \nfollows: Sixteen years under Democratic control, 16 years under \nRepublican control, and 2 years split 50-50.\n  I think it is very important we all understand these rules need to \nwork regardless of which party is in the majority. That is why it is \nthe right thing to do to negotiate between the Democrats and \nRepublicans rules that can withstand the test of time and be fair to \nboth the majority and the minority.\n  Once again, I would have majority rule. That is what I believe and I \nknow there will be a chance to vote on that and that is how I will \nexpress my vote. But I do believe it is best for us to work together, \nDemocrats and Republicans, and come together with a true compromise on \nthe rules changes. I think that is exactly what Leader Reid and Leader \nMcConnell have done. They have taken the recommendations of many of us, \nthey have listened to a lot of us, they have listened to both caucuses, \nand they will come forward with recommendations that will allow this \nbody to carry out its responsibilities in a more effective way--in a \nway that is better understandable to the American people, where we can \nget on legislation a lot sooner, debate issues a lot quicker, take up \namendments and actually vote on amendments and be able to move \nlegislation that comes out of our committee and approve nominations in \na much more efficient way.\n  To me, that gives us an opportunity for a new start in the Senate as \nwe begin the 113th Congress. Let's hope the cooperation we see \ndeveloping on the changes of the rules will allow us to work together \nto deal with the problems of the Nation in a more collegial way, \nrecognizing that compromise is how this country was formed, listen to \neach other, and move legislation in the best traditions of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Maryland leaves \nthe floor, I would like to tell him how much I appreciate the remarks \nhe just made. I think he gave a very accurate depiction of the \nagreement we reached after many hours of always pleasant conversation. \nThe fact is we showed our colleagues and many others it is still \npossible for a group of us to join together on a very difficult issue \nand a very complex one.\n  The Senator from Maryland stated his preference just a minute ago \nthat he is for majority rule. But he also understood that in order for \nus to come together, that we had to move--each of us--in a more \ncentrist direction. Without his input, his efforts, and his \nwillingness, in my view, it is very likely we would not have agreed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Maryland and I engage \nin a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think the Senator from Maryland and I would agree that \neven though this is not a headline-grabbing issue and a lot of people \nin America have no real idea what was at stake, that if we hadn't \nreached this agreement amongst us, it could have had repercussions for \na very long period of time in the Senate; would the Senator agree to \nthat?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I certainly agree with my friend from Arizona. They may \nnot have understood what caused the problems, but when they see the \ntype of gridlock where the Senate can't take up amendments for 1 week \nor can't take up a bill for 2 weeks or debating how to proceed on a \nmotion to proceed, not only on substance, they wonder what is going on \nhere. So the Senator is absolutely right.\n  Also, we are going to be in a much better start to this Senate with \nDemocrats and Republicans agreeing on the rules collectively. That is \ncertainly a better place for us to start to work with this Congress, \nand it gives us the opportunity to work together with more confidence, \nbeyond just rules but also dealing with the difficult issues this \ncountry faces.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Wouldn't the Senator from Maryland agree that the whole \npurpose of this is not to block? In fact, with our numerous meetings \nwith the Parliamentarians, I think we reached a greater and fuller \nunderstanding that if someone really, really wants to block progress in \nthe Senate, given the incredible--if the word isn't ``arcane,'' it is \ncertainly ``detailed''--rules of the Senate, they can.\n  But the real purpose of this and the outcome that the Senator from \nMaryland and I and Senator Kyl, Senator Barrasso, Senator Levin, \nSenator Schumer, Senator Pryor--and I note the presence of the Senator \nfrom Michigan on the floor; I think he would agree that this fix, this \ncompromise we have all now agreed to--and hopefully we will agree to \nand pass shortly--is also intended to change an attitude in the Senate.\n  Instead of blocking everything moving forward and blocking \namendments, perhaps we could create a new environment in the Senate \nwhere we will let the minority have their amendments, but also the \nminority party will let the process move forward. I think that is the \ntradeoff that was the fundamental aspect of the negotiations we \ncontinued in the office of the Senator from Michigan for many days and \nmany hours.\n  I think the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Maryland would \nagree; if someone wants to block the Senate from moving forward, they \ncan at least do it for some short period of time. What has happened, \nlooking back 10, 15 years ago, the tree wasn't filled. But at the same \ntime, on the other side, amendments were not produced by the hundreds. \nI believe the object and I believe the outcome of this hard-earned \ncompromise will be that there will be a greater degree of comity in the \nSenate which would allow us to achieve the legislative goals that all \nof us seek.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Michigan join the \nSenator from Maryland and me in this colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank my dear friend from \nArizona for helping to lead this bipartisan effort, where eight of us \nspent weeks to\n\n[[Page S258]]\n\ntry to come up with a bipartisan proposal to our leaders. Senator \nCardin was one of the eight, and I am grateful to him and to all the \neight Members, including one who has now left, Senator Kyl.\n  Its purpose was twofold. The first purpose was to address the \nspecific hurdles that have created gridlock, the specific mechanisms \nwhich have been overused in this Senate that have led to gridlock. \nThere are a number of things that have led to gridlock, but the most \nsignificant problem we have faced is the excessive use of the threat of \nthe filibuster on the motion to proceed to a bill.\n  The reason it was used--according to many Members of the minority--\nwas because of a fear that the tree would be filled by the majority \nleader and then there would be no opportunity to offer amendments. So \nwhat the eight of us strived to do was to find a balance where we could \nprotect the minority's rights to offer some amendments at the same time \nthat we finally got rid of a roadblock which was being abused, which \nwas a threat to filibuster a motion to proceed. So we devised this \napproach which is now part of the leadership proposal to do exactly \nthat.\n  The other purpose is the one which my friend from Arizona has just \nidentified; that if we could come together, the eight of us, four \nDemocrats and four Republicans--Senator Schumer is now on the floor and \nhe was one of the eight. If we could come together and come up with a \nbipartisan proposal on this issue, we could hopefully begin to change \nthe dynamic that has so divided this Senate. That is, hopefully, a very \nimportant and, I hope, successful outcome of those discussions and of \nthe leadership then coming together, because those two leaders have to \ncome together if this Senate is to come together and be able to move \nlegislation in the ordinary course.\n  I agree with Senator McCain's assessment as to the second goal we \nhad, which was to show that on the thorniest procedural issue we face, \nthat four Democrats and four Republicans, meeting in a very thorough \nand personal way, without a lot of staff around, could find a way \nthrough this procedural thicket and then make recommendations to the \nmajority and to the Republican leader. I do agree with the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think my friend from Maryland would also agree that we \nhave found, for example, on the Defense authorization bill, that once \nwe get onto a bill and once we have some amendments--in the case of our \nagreement it was four--that now the Members are sort of invested in \nmoving the process forward. The logjam has always appeared before the \nbill is ever taken up for debate and amendments. By expediting that \nprocess, without depriving Members of their rights but expediting that \nprocess, hopefully, we will get onto the bill and some amendments that \nare already--four in one option--are already agreed to, and then we can \nmove forward.\n  I would like to point out one other thing, and I think my two \ncolleagues would agree; that is, we are fairly well paid around here, \nand maybe sometimes we should work a 5-day workweek; and maybe, if \nabsolutely necessary, God forbid, a 6-day workweek. We should be taking \nup legislation and completing that legislation before the end of the \nweek or, depending on how massive the legislation is, at least 2 weeks. \nBut there should be dates certain. It is funny how this body operates \nwhen there are deadlines as opposed to just extended periods of debate \nand amending.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Could I inquire because I want to use the two Senators as \nthe example. They did that on the Defense Authorization Act. They were \nable to get the bill to the floor. They started on the bill, had a \nlittle rough start, but started on the bill and then set up a series of \nvotes. We were able to vote on I don't know how many amendments. But it \nis interesting, if my memory is correct, there was no requirement for a \n60-vote threshold on any of those amendments. You voted them all on \nmajority so there was no need for a cloture vote because we started on \nit and people believed the process was fair. They had the opportunity, \nthey had a chance to debate. So we had full and open debate on many \nissues.\n  National defense authorization opens a whole host of issues which are \nvery controversial: What do we do with detainees? What do we do with \nour civil liberty rights? What do we do with our troop levels? There \nwere a lot of issues that could have divided us, and we had the type of \ndebate that I think was in the best interests of the Senate and we \ncompleted that bill in a timely way.\n  I think the way the two Senators were able to come forward--there are \na lot of other committees. I serve on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. We talked today, yesterday, during--Senator McCain is also \non that committee. We talked--Secretary Clinton--wouldn't it be nice to \nget a State Department authorization bill on the floor of the Senate?\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is a disgrace that we have not--in how many years?\n  Mr. CARDIN. A long time. Certainly, I have not been in the Senate \nsince that happened. But I do think now we have a better opportunity. \nIf our committee could mark up a Defense authorization bill--and maybe \nit would take a week or two. Maybe we would have to work Friday or \nSaturday to get it done, but we should do that. But we now have the \nopportunity for the leader to bring that to the Senate floor \nimmediately and allow the amendment process to start. Once it starts, \nnormally we can get the type of consideration by all of us as to a \nreasonable number of amendments, and we can get the bill, hopefully, \nthrough the Senate. That is what I think is the real plus of the type \nof reforms we are talking about that allow the right legislative \nprocess to work.\n  As I said, it doesn't cover everything I wanted to cover. I would \nhave gone further. But I do think it does give us a chance, allows us \nto do our work in the way that we should.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I, again, would like to express my appreciation to \nSenator Schumer and Senator Cardin, Senator Pryor and my Republican \ncolleagues, Senator Kyl and Senator Barrasso. But I would especially \nlike to thank Senator Levin. We have known each other and worked \ntogether now for many years. We had very spirited and open and honest \ndisagreements, but there is a level of trust and friendship that allows \nus, when committed to the same goal, to be able to--I believe, \nhopefully, in a very short period of time--achieve it.\n  Maybe I am being a little bit too optimistic. Hopefully, because of \nthis, we can start moving legislation through the Senate. The record \nthat we have achieved over the last 2 years is less than admirable. We \nknow that filling the tree has dramatically increased, but we also know \nthe objections to moving forward also have. I am not placing any \nresponsibility on either side. I am placing the responsibility on both \nsides. Maybe we can start a new day, take up some legislation, pass it, \nand do the people's will. Maybe we would improve our favorability \nratings to exceed that of--I saw a poll the other day; I don't know if \nmy colleagues did. A colonoscopy is more favorable than Members of the \nCongress. I don't know if they saw that.\n  I hope we can at least raise it to some level above that. By getting \nthings done around here I think that will probably enhance our chances \nof regaining some more favorability amongst the American people.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Maryland and my friend from Michigan \nand, hopefully, in a couple of hours we will have achieved something \nthat, in my view, could avert a fundamental change in the Senate which \nmaybe could never have been repaired. I view it with the utmost \nseriousness. I have never been involved in an issue that impacted this \nbody to the degree that the nuclear option would have caused. We would \nhave regretted it for a long time. Hopefully, in a few hours we will \nhave avoided it.\n  I just want to remind my friend from Maryland and the Senator from \nMichigan, this is going to be for 2 years. So we are in kind of an \nexperimental phase. If we are unable to do the things that we aspire \nto, then I think you could see further Draconian measures considered by \nthe majority. It is up to both sides to make this work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first of all, let me comment on what \nSenator Cardin said about one of the purposes of this effort, which is \nto get a bill to the floor so the managers can work on it.\n\n[[Page S259]]\n\n  As we have proven in the last couple of months on a number of bills, \nand the Senator has pointed this out, if we can get the bill to the \nfloor for the managers to be able to work with our colleagues on \namendments, we can legislate. The problem has been that we have not \nbeen able to get bills to the floor because of this blockage, the \nblockage caused by the overuse of the filibuster and, more accurately, \nthe threat of a filibuster on the motion to proceed, which, in turn--\nand my Republican friends believe this very keenly--was caused by the \nuse of filling the tree, which meant that they would not have the \nopportunity to offer amendments. So they would then use that threat of \na filibuster in order to try to gain assurance that they would be able \nto offer some amendments.\n  That is the heart of the compromise we proposed. There are a lot of \nother aspects to it, including trying to get rid of these filibusters \non going to conference; including these filibusters that tied up \nnominations with postcloture 30-hours, nominations that were going to \npass with votes of 90 to 0.\n  There are a lot of other parts to the recommendations and what the \nleaders are recommending to us, but the key thing--and Senator Reid \nsaid it to us repeatedly--the key thing that this compromise addresses, \nand it is a bipartisan approach, is trying to overcome that barrier to \ngetting legislation to the floor. We know--the Senator from Maryland \nhas pointed out and Senator McCain knows it because we have lived it--\nif you can get a bill to the floor with managers, they can work out \namendments, sometimes by the hundreds.\n  I think Senator McCain and I probably had over 100 amendments filed \nto our bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think it was about 383.\n  Mr. LEVIN. OK. I am glad I exaggerated in the downward direction. In \nany event, we were able not to work through all of them but to deal \nwith that challenge, to probably deal with about 100 of them, as I \nremember. We did it in about 3 days.\n  That doesn't mean we are magicians. It means we are capable, all of \nus are capable, if we can get the bill to the floor. Particularly when \nthe bill has come out of committee with broad bipartisan support, we \ncan get bills passed here. So the heart of what we have proposed to the \nleadership, this group of 8, and what they have adopted and \nincorporated in their bipartisan approach to the Senate and to the \ncountry, is exactly what Senator Cardin has talked about: getting bills \nto the floor. We can then watch the momentum work.\n  I want to add one other thing. Senator McCain just made reference to \nit. That has to do with the so-called nuclear option, or the \nconstitutional option, depending on what your view of it is. I have \nalways believed the threat of that option was troublesome. I was \ntroubled by it because it is inconsistent with the rules of the Senate \nwhich require a two-thirds vote for amendments to the rules and because \nwe are a continuing body, not just by our rules but by even a Supreme \nCourt opinion which so ruled.\n  I believe if the constitutional or the nuclear option were utilized \nhere, if we ended up with the utilization of that option, that what we \nnow have, which is gridlock, would have resulted instead in a meltdown. \nI want to remind my Democratic friends and folks around the country \nthat not too many years ago when the Republicans threatened to use a \nconstitutional option, the reaction on this side of the aisle was \nintense. The words of Senator Kennedy, Senator Biden, Senator Byrd \nresonated through this Chamber in strong opposition to the use of a \nnuclear option.\n  I have just a few examples of what our reaction was on this side of \nthe aisle when there was a threat to use the nuclear option when it was \nthreatened relative to judges. What I am not going to do tonight is go \nthrough the history of the constitutional or the nuclear option, what \nhappened over the century when it has been threatened, how it has not \nbeen adopted by the Senate. It is a long, detailed history.\n  I know some of my colleagues have argued that the constitutional \noption is based on the Constitution. It is very much the opposite in \nterms of the history of this Chamber and the rejection of any idea that \nthe Constitution somehow requires that at the beginning of a session of \na Senate that rules can be amended by majority vote. It is a long \nhistory.\n  I want to just quote, if I can find these quotes, what the reaction \nwas on this side of the aisle when there was a threat on the Republican \nside of the aisle to use this approach of getting a ruling from the \nChair, somehow, that the rules, although they say they can only be \namended by two-thirds, can in fact be amended by a majority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/24/senate-section/article/S259-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S259-S266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while I am looking for these quotes, let me \nask unanimous consent the period for morning business be extended until \n7 p.m. today and that all provisions of the previous order remain in \neffect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  I wish to quote Senator Byrd as to what he said when the actual issue \nwas before the Senate. He said:\n\n       Now, if we go down this road--\n\n  That is the road which says rules can be adopted by a majority vote, \neven though the rules say it takes 67 votes.\n  He said:\n\n       Now, if we go down this road, I can guarantee that every \n     Senator in this body will rue this day . . . Senators, do we \n     want to do it this way? If this is done today, it can be done \n     any day. If it can be done on the constitutional question, it \n     can be done on any other constitutional question. It can be \n     done on any other point of order which the Chair wishes for \n     the Senate for decision . . . I believe that there is a \n     danger here that, if Senators will reflect upon it for but a \n     little while, they could foresee a time when they say that we \n     went the wrong way to achieve an otherwise notable purpose . \n     . . Put this power in the hands of a tyrannical leadership, \n     and a tyrannical majority of 51 Senators, and we are going to \n     be sorry on both sides of the aisle.\n\n  This is what Senator Inouye said in his maiden speech in this \nChamber. They were discussing civil rights legislation. The question \nwas whether there would be a ruling of the Chair which would allow the \nrules to be changed by the majority vote. This is a Senator who had \nbeen discriminated against in probably one of the most dramatic and \nmassive ways that anyone could be discriminated against, being denied \nfreedom because of his Japanese-American ancestry while he was fighting \nto defend this country.\n  What he said in his maiden speech was the Senate needs to preserve \nits protections for minority views, even though those protections \nallowed a misguided minority to obstruct our Nation's progress.\n  He supported the civil rights legislation, but he would not allow it \nto be addressed in violation of the rights of the minority of this \nbody. This is what Danny Inouye said in his maiden speech:\n\n       The philosophy of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights \n     is not simply to grant the majority the power to rule, but it \n     is also to set out limitation after limitation upon that \n     power. Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of \n     religion: What are these but the recognition that at times \n     when the majority of men would willingly destroy him, a \n     dissenting man may have no friend but the law? This power \n     given to the minority is the most sophisticated and the most \n     vital power bestowed by our Constitution.\n\n  He was not willing to end a grave injustice, which is what civil \nrights legislation would have achieved, by a method that he felt ran \nroughshod over the rights of the minority. He warned us against the \nattempts, in his words, ``to destroy the power of the minority . . . in \nthe name of another minority.''\n  Mike Mansfield, leader of the Senate, supported a modification in the \nrule to reduce the number of Senators needed to end debate from 67 to \n60. Although he supported the change in the rules, he opposed the use \nof the nuclear option, or the constitutional option, to achieve it.\n  This is what Mike Mansfield said in arguing for the reform:\n\n       [The] urgency or even wisdom of adopting the three-fifths \n     resolution does not justify a path of destruction to the \n     Senate as an institution and its vital importance to our \n     scheme of government. And this, in my opinion, is what the \n     present motion to invoke cloture by simple majority would do.\n\n  He added:\n\n       I simply feel the protection of the minority transcends any \n     rule change however desirable. . . . The issue of limiting \n     debate in this body is one of such monumental importance\n\n[[Page S260]]\n\n     that it reaches, in my opinion, to the very essence of the \n     Senate as an institution. I believe it compels a decision by \n     more than a majority.\n\n  Senator Kennedy's words were extremely powerful in this regard. I \nquoted some of Senator Byrd's words and Senator Biden's words \nvehemently opposing the effort to change the rules of this body by \nmajority vote when the rules themselves provide it takes two-thirds of \nthe vote to amend the rules.\n  We have to be consistent. The rules cannot just be simply what the \nmajority wants them to be, whatever the current majority is. This is a \nbody that has continuity. It is one of the few bodies in this country \nthat has continuity. The only other one is the Supreme Court.\n  Two-thirds of us were not elected last November. Two-thirds of us \ncontinued from the last Senate. Over the centuries, this body has been \nlooked to as a source of continuity, where the rules cannot be changed \nat the will or whim of a majority but where the rules stay in place \nuntil amended. The rules don't end when a Congress ends, in terms of \nSenate rules. House rules do because all the House Members are elected \nevery 2 years. Senate rules are permanent until amended or changed. It \nis critically important that we not say those rules can be modified \nwhenever the majority wishes to modify those rules or else we will lose \nnot just the protection of the minority, which is so critically \nimportant to the history and purpose of the Senate, but it is \ncritically important to the very continuity and stability of the \nSenate.\n  This is a unique position, where most of us--two-thirds of us--stay \nfrom Congress to Congress to Congress. It is not always the same two-\nthirds, but it is always two-thirds. That has created an institution \nwhich is unique in protecting minority rights as well as holding out to \nthe American public that continuity. In the last few years, we have \nfallen terribly short of what we should be. There are many reasons for \nthat, and I will not go into all of them or even any of them right at \nthe moment. We have fallen terribly short. We have not carried out our \nduties for lots of reasons; again, most of which, frankly, are not \nacceptable to me.\n  We talk about how the filibuster has been abused--and it has been. In \npart, it has been abused because we, in the majority, have allowed it \nto be abused. We have not made the filibusterers filibuster. As Senator \nByrd put it, it is just the whiff of a threat of a filibuster which has \ntied up the Senate. It doesn't have to be that way, and it should not \nbe that way.\n  I see Senator Alexander is here. He is such an important part of this \ngroup of eight.\n  What has happened is that eight of us came together with a very \nspecific purpose. There were four Democrats and four Republicans. I \nhave mentioned everybody who was in that group already. We came \ntogether to try and see if we could get through this thicket, where we \nhave this threat of a filibuster on the motion to proceed which takes \nweeks to dispose of. What that means is it has been a huge problem in \nterms of getting things done.\n\n  Eight of us got together and said: Let's just reason together and see \nif we cannot get rid of the roadblock and the abuse of the threat of a \nfilibuster but protect the rights of the minority at the same time to \noffer amendments. As I said before, it was that which drove many \nRepublicans to use that threat because of the fear the tree would be \nfilled and there would be no opportunity to offer amendments. Unless \nthere was some assurance that there could be amendments offered, they \nthen stood their ground and said: We are not going to proceed to that \nbill unless there is some assurance in terms of amendments. It is that \nbalance that we struck, and that is where the two amendments on each \nside came from and where some of the suggestions we made to the \nmajority came from.\n  I wish to thank Senator Alexander and all the other Members. I am \ngoing to repeat the names of this group who spent so many hours \ntogether to try and come together not just to solve the problem of \ngetting through this thicket, but also to help restore a climate in the \nSenate which might help us be more fruitful in our work.\n  Again, I wish to thank Senators McCain, Schumer, Kyl, Kirk, \nAlexander, Pryor, and Barrasso for all the work they put in on this \nbipartisan proposal to reform Senate procedures.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bipartisan proposal we made to the \nleadership--and which they have embraced in large measure in their own \nextraordinarily important effort to offer the Senate and the Nation a \nbipartisan approach of getting through this rules morass--be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Bipartisan Proposal To Reform Senate Procedures\n\n       We propose the Senate adopt a Standing Order at the \n     beginning of the next Congress, which would provide two \n     additional alternatives to the existing rules for the \n     Majority Leader to proceed to the consideration of a measure \n     on the Senate Calendar. It also streamlines procedures \n     relative to going to conference and consideration of \n     nominations. The two additional methods for the Majority \n     Leader to proceed, at his option, would sunset at the end of \n     the 113th Congress. The current rule relative to proceeding \n     to a bill would remain an option. We also propose a number of \n     recommendations relative to current practices and comity \n     including that the Leaders inform their conferences that \n     existing rules which require Senators to come to the floor to \n     debate or object to a matter will be enforced.\n\n\n                               Highlights\n\n     Two Additional Methods for the Majority Leader to Proceed, at \n         his option\n       (1) No filibuster of the motion to proceed (debate on the \n     motion would be limited to 4 hours, equally divided.) The \n     amendment tree could not be filled at the time the Senate \n     proceeds to the consideration of such bills where this option \n     is used. The process by which this option would be \n     implemented is in attachment A. It includes a guaranteed \n     amendment at the beginning of the bill's consideration for \n     each of the following in the order indicated: the Minority \n     Manager, the Majority Manager, the Minority Leader and the \n     Majority Leader. (Those amendments would not be subject to \n     amendment or division.)\n       (2) When a cloture motion is filed that is signed by both \n     the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader on a motion to \n     proceed, and where the cloture motion is signed by at least \n     five additional Senators from each caucus, the motion ripens \n     after two hours of debate, equally divided and, if cloture is \n     invoked by three-fifths affirmative vote, there will be no \n     post-cloture debate.\n     Going to Conference\n       (3) All three initial motions relative to going to \n     conference (insist, request, appoint) would be collapsed into \n     one nondivisible motion. Cloture on such a motion would ripen \n     after up to two hours of debate, equally divided, with no \n     post-cloture debate if cloture is invoked.\n     Nominations\n       (4) The list of nominees subject to the current expedited \n     process of putting nominations directly on the Calendar (S. \n     Res. 116, 1126 Congress) unless a nomination is objected to \n     by any Senator would be expanded by 531 nominations leaving \n     448 nominations to go through the traditional committee \n     review process. Committee Chairs and Ranking Members would be \n     able to strike nominations from the list of 531 before the \n     Standing Order is put to a vote.\n       (5) A cloture motion on nominations would ripen after up to \n     two hours of debate, equally divided, with no post-cloture \n     debate if cloture is invoked. This change would not apply to \n     Cabinet Officers, Cabinet-level Officers, or Article III \n     judges. However, relative to district court nominations, \n     post-cloture consideration would be limited to 2 hours.\n\n\n                      Current Practices and Comity\n\n       In addition to the adoption of the Standing Order, the \n     leaders, at their respective conference meetings, should \n     address changing some practices to make the Senate operate \n     more efficiently. They should notify their members about the \n     following:\n       Leaders and bill managers should not honor requests to \n     object or threats to filibuster on behalf of another Senator \n     unless, after reasonable notice, that Senator comes to the \n     floor and exercises his or her rights himself or herself. \n     This also applies to all objections to unanimous consent \n     requests. Members should be required to come to the floor and \n     participate in the legislative process--to voice objections, \n     engage in debate, or offer amendments.\n       When the two cloakrooms send out hotlines agreed to by the \n     two leaders, any Senator may object, but the Senator should \n     lose his or her objection if, after appropriate notice, the \n     Senator fails to object to the request on the floor the next \n     session day.\n       Rule XXII makes provision for 30 hours of debate after \n     cloture is invoked. Within the 30 hours, Senators have strict \n     limitations on the amount of time each Senator is allowed to \n     speak. These limits should be enforced by the leaders and \n     bill managers. Rule XXII further says, ``After no more than \n     thirty hours of debate . . .'', so 30 hours will be \n     considered the outside limit of post-cloture debate time.\n       When the Majority Leader or bill manager has reasonably \n     alerted the body of the intention to do so and the Senate is \n     not in a quorum call and there is no order of the Senate to \n     the contrary, the Presiding Officer\n\n[[Page S261]]\n\n     may ask if there is further debate, and if no Senator seeks \n     recognition, the Presiding Officer may put the question to a \n     vote. This is consistent with precedent of the Senate and \n     with Riddick's Senate Procedure, 1992. (See p. 716; see also \n     footnotes 385 and 386 on p. 764) This can be done pre-cloture \n     or post-cloture on any amendment, bill, resolution or \n     nomination.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                              Attachment A\n\n       (1) The first amendments in order to any measure shall be \n     one amendment for each of the two Leaders and two Managers. \n     Such amendments shall be offered in the following order: \n     Minority Manager, Majority Manager, Minority Leader, Majority \n     Leader. If an amendment is not offered in its designated \n     order, the right to offer the amendment is forfeited.\n       (2) Each paragraph 1 amendment must be disposed of before \n     the next amendment may be offered.\n       (3) Paragraph 1 amendments are not subject to amendment or \n     division.\n       (4) Each paragraph 1 amendment, if adopted, would be \n     considered original text for purpose of further amendment.\n       (5) No points of order would be waived by virtue of this \n     procedure.\n       (6) No motion to recommit shall be in order during the \n     pendency of any amendment offered pursuant to paragraph 1.\n       (7) Notwithstanding Rule XXII, if cloture is invoked before \n     all paragraph 1 amendments are disposed of, any amendment in \n     order under paragraph 1 but not considered upon the \n     expiration of post-cloture time may be offered and is \n     guaranteed up to 1 hour of debate, equally divided.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Our proposal was born out of the sincere belief that, even \nin today's hyper-partisan environment, it is still possible for \nSenators from both parties to work together to restore the deliberative \ntraditions for which the Senate was once known. It took many days of \ndiscussions over two months among our group to reach an agreement we \ncould present to our Leaders. We looked past our frustrations with the \nrecent practices of the Senate and acted together for the sake of this \nvital institution. I would also like to thank our former and current \nParliamentarians, Alan Frumin and Elizabeth MacDonough, who answered \nour questions and provided their expert advice throughout our \ndiscussions.\n  Perhaps the most significant reform in the bipartisan leadership \nproposal, as in our bipartisan proposal to the leadership, is a reform \ndesigned to end the abuse of the threat of a filibuster on the motion \nto proceed to a bill--that is, the abuse of the Senate's minority \nprotections to obstruct the Senate from even taking up and debating \nlegislation. Reform in this area is vital, because abuse of the rules \non the motion to proceed has prevented the Senate from engaging in what \nour rules are supposed to promote: Debate of the important issues our \nnation must face. Over the previous two Congresses, we have had to hold \n59 cloture votes on motions to proceed, and the very threat of the \nfilibuster on the motion to proceed has on countless occasions derailed \nthe Senate's legislative process. Reforming the procedures regarding \nthe motion to proceed will allow this body to deliberate as it is \nintended to do.\n  The proposal before us will give the majority leader two alternatives \nto the method in the existing rules for proceeding to a bill. The first \nalternative, in the form of a standing order effective for the 113th \nCongress, would limit debate on the motion to proceed to 4 hours. When \nused by the majority leader, this alternative would guarantee \nconsideration of some minority amendments. Specifically, two amendments \neach for both the majority and the minority would be the first \namendments in order at the beginning of consideration of a measure. The \norder of those amendments would be the first minority amendment, the \nfirst majority amendment, the second minority amendment, and the second \nmajority amendment. Each amendment would need to be disposed of prior \nto the offering of the next amendment in order. These amendments would \nnot be subject to amendment or division, and if adopted, the amendments \nwould be considered original text for purpose of further amendment. \nThey could be tabled or filibustered. If an amendment is not offered in \nits designated order, the right to offer that amendment would be \nforfeited. Filing deadlines would occur on these amendments if a \ncloture motion is filed. If cloture is invoked, any of these amendments \nnot offered prior to the expiration of post-cloture time could be \noffered and would be guaranteed up to 1 hour of debate.\n  The second alternative would allow the Senate to move quickly when \nboth the majority and minority leaders agree we should proceed to a \nmatter. Specifically, where eight Senators from each side, including \nthe two Leaders, sign a cloture petition on the motion to proceed to a \nmeasure, then the cloture vote would occur the day following the filing \nof the motion with no post-cloture debate if cloture is invoked.\n  The bipartisan proposal before us would also reform the process of \ngoing to conference by collapsing the three motions currently required \nby the rules to be adopted in order to go to conference into a single \nmotion and shrinking the cloture process on that conference motion from \n30 to 2 hours. This change would be in the form of an amendment to the \nStanding Rules, and was part of our bipartisan group's recommendations \nto the leaders.\n  In addition, the proposal before us would reform the consideration of \nnominations. First, for district court nominations, it would reduce \npost-cloture time from 30 to 2 hours, as recommended by our bipartisan \ngroup of eight. Second, it would shrink the cloture process on \nsubcabinet nominations by reducing post-cloture time from 30 to 8 \nhours. This change would be in the form of a standing order and would \nbe effective for the 113th Congress.\n  When a few Senators threaten to filibuster or object to proposed \nunanimous consent agreements, those Senators should have to come to the \nfloor to speak or object. Our bipartisan group's reform proposal urged \nthe leaders to give notice that the existing rules of the Senate will \nbe used more vigorously to force filibusterers to show up on the Senate \nfloor to speak, and their colloquy on this matter reflects the leaders' \nintention to do so.\n  This proposal includes reasonable protections for the minority, and \nit reforms our procedures in ways that can end the gridlock that \nbedevils us. And as it accomplishes those important reforms, this \nproposal allows the Senate to avoid a process that would break the \nrules of the Senate and do untold damage to this institution. Amending \nour procedures in this way, without use of the nuclear option, avoids \nhaving the Senate go from gridlock to meltdown. I want to spend some \ntime discussing this process because the issue is extremely important \nand not fully understood.\n  The greatest difference between the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives is the approach to minority rights. Senate rules \nprotect the rights of the minority and the House rules do not. With \nthose rights, a minority or even a single Senator can influence the \nlegislative process. Without those rights, a simple majority can render \na minority irrelevant and powerless to influence the legislative \nprocess.\n  The current Standing Rules of the Senate spell out clearly the \nprocess by which the rules of the Senate may be amended. Rule 5 states \nthat the rules of the Senate shall continue from one Congress to the \nnext Congress unless they are changed as provided in these rules. Rule \n22 states that an affirmative vote by two-thirds of the Senators \npresent and voting is required to end debate on a proposal to amend the \nrules.\n  Some Senators have argued that the Constitution empowers a simple \nmajority of Senators to force a change in the rules at the beginning of \na Congress, although the change would occur in violation of rule 5 and \nrule 22. Supporters of this position refer to this procedure as the \n``constitutional option.'' Others, including many of us who have served \nhere for longer periods of time in both the majority and in the \nminority, refer to it as the ``nuclear option'' because we can see the \ndamage this procedure would do to the Senate. Indeed, many of us who \nare deeply concerned about its use vehemently opposed Republican \nthreats to use this procedure in 2005.\n\n  How worried were we in 2005? Senator Kennedy was worried enough to \ntell his colleagues: ``By the time all pretense of comity, all sense of \nmutual respect and fairness, all of the normal courtesies that allow \nthe Senate to proceed expeditiously on any business at all will have \nbeen destroyed by the preemptive Republican nuclear strike on the \nSenate floor . . . They will have broken the Senate compact of comity, \nand will\n\n[[Page S262]]\n\nhave launched a preemptive nuclear war.''\n  And here's what Senator Biden said on this floor: ``I say to my \nfriends on the Republican side: You may own the field right now, but \nyou won't own it forever. I pray God when the Democrats take back \ncontrol, we don't make the kind of naked power grab you are doing.''\n  Why were our esteemed former colleagues so concerned about walking \nthis path? Here are some of the dangers inherent in the \n``constitutional'' or ``nuclear'' option, and some explanation of why \nand how the Senate has consistently rejected this approach in the past.\n  Supporters of the nuclear option claim a simple majority of Senators \ncan force a rules change at the beginning of a Congress, but do not \nargue that they can do so at other times. There is no basis for the \nargument that the beginning of a Congress enjoys a special status for \nrules adoption or amendment that the remainder of a term of Congress \ndoes not. If the Constitution grants a simple majority of Senators the \nright to amend the rules of the Senate at the beginning of a Congress, \nwhen and how does that majority lose that right? This temporal \ndistinction cannot be found anywhere in the Constitution. Article I, \nsection 5 of the Constitution says that each House may determine the \nrules of its proceedings. It makes no distinction as to when.\n  That provision of the Constitution, which governs the Senate, also \ngoverns the House. The House adopts its rules at the opening of every \nCongress, but it can and does amend its rules in the middle of a \nCongress. If the Constitution grants a simple majority of Senators the \npower to adopt rules, what would stop that simple majority from \namending those rules in the middle of a Congress, just as our House \ncolleagues do? And if that is the case, the Senate would no longer be \nable to fulfill its historic distinction of protecting the rights of \nthe minority.\n  Some supporters of the constitutional or nuclear option claim that \nrule 22's supermajority threshold to end debate on a proposed rules \nchange is unconstitutional because it inhibits the Senate from \nexercising its constitutional power to determine its rules under \narticle I, section 5.\n  But the power to set its own rules is just one of the many powers \ngranted the Senate by the Constitution. For instance, the Senate is \nempowered to provide advice and consent on nominations and to consider \nlegislation to collect taxes, to pay the nation's debts, to provide for \nthe common defense and general welfare of the United States. Yet, \nfilibusters have delayed or prevented the Senate from acting on those \nimportant measures and nominations that fall within the Senate's \nconstitutional duties.\n  In testimony before the Senate Rules Committee, CRS expert Stanley \nBach argued:\n\n       Adopting and amending its own rules is not the only thing, \n     and arguably not the most important thing, that the \n     Constitution empowers and expects the Senate to do. If \n     filibusters are unconstitutional because they impede the \n     Senate in its efforts to exercise its authority under section \n     5 of Article I to adopt or amend its rules, then why are \n     filibusters constitutional when they impede the Senate's \n     efforts to exercise its equally or more important authority \n     under Article I, especially section 8, to legislate on \n     matters committed to it and the House of Representatives?\n\n  In other words, if the filibuster of a rules change is \nunconstitutional, as nuclear option advocates contend, then a \nfilibuster on any matter would also be unconstitutional because it \nwould delay or prevent the Senate from discharging its constitutional \nduties. So by declaring the filibuster unconstitutional on a rules \nchange, advocates of the nuclear option are thereby swinging the door \nwide open to eliminate the filibuster altogether from the Senate.\n  Some supporters of the nuclear option say that the Founders never \nintended for the Senate to have filibusters. They claim that the \noriginal Senate's rules included a motion for the previous question, \nwhich they further claim was used to end debate and bring a matter to \nan immediate vote. So, they argue, the early Senate supported the \nability to close debate and bring a matter to immediate vote by simple \nmajority vote.\n  The problem is that they have their history wrong. The early form of \nthe motion for the previous question is unlike its modern day version. \nIn the first Congress, both Chambers had a motion for the previous \nquestion in their rules--the Senate dropped the motion from its rules \nin 1806. But the early version of the motion was not used to bring a \nquestion to an immediate vote. The motion, which was phrased ``shall \nthe question be now put,'' was used to suppress or postpone a question. \nIt was moved by Senators who would then vote against the motion in \norder to suppress or postpone the pending question.\n  The modern day version of the motion for the previous question in the \nHouse serves as a simple majority cloture device. However, in the early \nHouse, just as in the Senate, if the motion for the previous question \nwas decided in the negative, then the question was suppressed and the \nHouse moved on to other business; if the motion was decided in the \naffirmative, then the House would continue debate on the pending \nquestion, not immediately proceed to a vote. That practice continued \nuntil 1811, when a new precedent was set that the motion, when agreed \nto, would immediately end debate and bring a vote on the question. That \nwas the origin of simple majority cloture in the House.\n  The early history of the motion for the previous question is set \nforth in the House of Representatives official guide to procedure, \nHouse Practice: A Guide to the Rules, Precedents and Procedures of the \nHouse:\n\n       In early Congresses, the previous question was used in the \n     House for an entirely different purpose than it is today, \n     having been modeled on the English parliamentary practice. As \n     early as 1604, the previous question had been used in the \n     Parliament to suppress a question that the majority deemed \n     undesirable for further discussion or action. The Continental \n     Congress adopted this device in 1778, but there was no \n     intention of using it as a means of closing debate in order \n     to bring the pending question to a vote. Early \n     interpretations of the rule in the House were consistent with \n     its usage in the Continental Congress. (House Practice, page \n     690)\n\n  Just as in the House, the early Senate rules had a motion for the \nprevious question, which, just as in the House, was used only to end \ndebate and move to another matter, not put a question to an immediate \nvote. This motion was eventually dropped from the Senate rules. In his \nspeech to the Senate on March 2, 1805, Vice President Aaron Burr \nrecommended changes to the rules of the Senate. Among those, he \nsuggested that the Senate drop the motion for the previous question on \nthe basis that it was duplicative to the motion for indefinite \npostponement. The diary of John Quincy Adams contains the following \naccount of Burr's speech:\n\n       He [Burr] mentioned one or two of the rules which appeared \n     to him to need a revisal, and recommended the abolition of \n     that respecting the previous question, which he said had in \n     the four years been only once taken, and that upon an \n     amendment. That was proof that it could not be necessary, and \n     all its purposes were certainly much better answered by the \n     question of indefinite postponement. (Memoirs of John Quincy \n     Adams, edited by Charles Francis Adams, vol. I, p. 365)\n\n  Supporters of the nuclear option often reference advisory opinions \nand rulings by Vice Presidents Nixon, Humphrey, and Rockefeller that \nthe Senate may adopt its rules by simple majority vote at the opening \nof Congress. These advisory rulings and opinions were rendered during \nactual attempts to change the rules, but the proposed changes were \nrejected, for good reason.\n  For example, Vice President Nixon believed the constitution granted a \nsimple majority of Senators the power to force a rules change in \nviolation of Senate rules. In 1957, when an attempt to change the rules \nwas made at the beginning of a new Congress, Nixon made reference to \nhis belief, but his advisory opinion recognized no special status for \nthe beginning of a Congress. Nixon believed a simple majority of \nSenators could amend the rules at any point during a Congress. In his \nadvisory opinion, Nixon said, ``The Constitution also provides that \n`each House may determine the rules of its proceedings.' This \nconstitutional right is lodged in the membership of the Senate and it \nmay be exercised by a majority of the Senate at any time.'' Vice \nPresident Nixon also acknowledged that his opinion was merely advisory, \nand not binding upon the Senate.\n  Vice President Humphrey advised the Senate in 1969 that if a simple \nmajority of Senators, but fewer than the two-\n\n[[Page S263]]\n\nthirds required by the rules, voted to invoke cloture on a proposed \nrules change, then he would rule that cloture had been invoked. On \nJanuary 16, 1969, the Senate voted 51-47 in favor of a motion to invoke \ncloture. Vice President Humphrey ruled that cloture had been invoked by \nthe majority. Humphrey's decision was appealed and the Senate reversed \nHumphrey's decision by a vote of 53-45. In doing so, the Senate \nestablished a clear precedent rejecting Vice President Humphrey's \nruling that a simple majority could end debate.\n  Supporters of the constitutional argument point to statements by Vice \nPresidents Humphrey and Rockefeller in 1967 and 1975, respectively. In \nboth these instances, the Vice Presidents advised the Senate that \ntabling a point of order against a motion to end debate by simple \nmajority would validate the motion to end debate and cause it to self-\nexecute. It is my understanding that both former and current Senate \nParliamentarians disagree with the advisory opinions of Humphrey and \nRockefeller. Tabling a point of order lodged against a motion to end \ndebate by simple majority does not validate that motion or cause it to \nself-execute. In tabling the point of order, the question simply recurs \non the underlying motion, and that question is debatable. At the end of \nmy remarks I intend to propound several parliamentary inquiries that, I \nbelieve, will address the errors of the Humphrey and Rockefeller \nrulings.\n  Let's examine more closely these two advisory rulings.\n  In 1967, it was Senator McGovern who offered a motion to end debate \nby a simple majority on the question of proceeding to a rules change. \nSenator Dirksen raised a point of order that the motion was out of \norder because it violated the rules of the Senate. Vice President \nHumphrey advised the Senate that if the Senate tabled the Dirksen point \nof order, that act would serve to validate the constitutionality of the \nMcGovern motion. But in any event, the Senate rejected the motion to \ntable the Dirksen point of order by a vote of 37-61. Then the Senate \nsustained Dirksen's point of order by a vote of 59-37. This is yet \nanother example of the Senate establishing a clear precedent rejecting \nsimple majority cloture of debate on a rules change.\n  Then, again, in 1975, the Senate faced a very similar question. \nSenator Mondale offered a motion that would end debate with a simple \nmajority. Majority Leader Mansfield raised a point of order against the \nmotion. Vice President Rockefeller advised that if the Senate tabled \nthe Mansfield point of order, he would interpret that act as an \nexpression of the Senate that the motion was proper--again, as I will \nshow in a moment, a dubious position. After considerable intervening \naction and debate, the Senate ultimately sustained the Mansfield point \nof order by a vote of 53-43. Once again, the Senate established a clear \nprecedent of its rejection of simple majority cloture of debate on a \nrules change.\n  The danger of the advisory rulings by Humphrey and Rockefeller in \n1967 and 1975 is made clear in a grave warning issued by our former \ncolleague, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the longest serving \nSenator in the history of the Senate and the author of its definitive \nhistory. During the debate in 1975 on the question of whether a simple \nmajority could end debate on a proposed rules change, Senator Byrd gave \nthe following remarks that I believe we should heed carefully today.\n\n       May I say to those of us on our side that the day may \n     come--although I hope it will not be in my time--when we will \n     be in the minority, and it will take only 51 Senators from \n     the other side of the aisle to stop debate immediately, \n     without one word, on some matter which we may consider vital \n     to our States or to the Nation. Let me show the Senate how \n     this would work. ...\n       Suppose it were the Bay of Tonkin resolution, which \n     involved a declaration of war by the Congress of the United \n     States. Any Senator could contrive his own--and I do not use \n     that word disrespectfully--any Senator could write a \n     similarly phrased divisible motion, a multiple motion, sent \n     it to the Chair and all someone would have to do is raise a \n     point of order, another Senator would move to table the point \n     of order; if the point of order were tabled, the matter, \n     without debate, would immediately be put to a vote. If a \n     majority were to sustain that vote, debate would be closed on \n     the basic motion to move to consideration of the matter, or \n     if the matter were already before the Senate, to proceed to \n     vote immediately on the matter without further debate.\n\n  Senator Byrd that same day said:\n\n       I must say that I have to disagree respectfully with the \n     Chair. We are today operating by the rules of the Senate, \n     which rules and precedents provide that a motion before the \n     Senate, against which a point of order has been made and \n     tabled, remains before the Senate and is debatable. I cannot \n     for the life of me understand how, in this instance, the \n     motion, if the point of order is tabled, will not still be \n     before the Senate and will not be debatable. I cannot \n     understand that. I cannot understand how the Chair can \n     logically state that the Senate, by this motion, and by \n     virtue of its tabling a point of order, which is a separate \n     matter, ipso facto shuts off debate on the motion.\n       Now, if we go down this road, I can guarantee that every \n     Senator in this body will rue this day ... Senators, do we \n     want to do it this way? If this is done today, it can be done \n     any day. If it can be done on this constitutional question, \n     it can be done on any other constitutional question. It can \n     be done on any other point of order the Chair wishes to refer \n     to the Senate for decision. ... I believe that there is a \n     danger here that, if Senators will reflect upon it for but a \n     little while, they can foresee a time when we would say that \n     we went the wrong way to achieve an otherwise very notable \n     purpose ... Put this power in the hands of a tyrannical \n     leadership, and a tyrannical majority of 51 Senators, and we \n     are going to be sorry on both sides of the aisle. (121 \n     Congressional Record 3842-3844)\n\n  So in 1975, the Senate did what it has always done when confronted \nwith the question of simple majority cloture on debate of a motion to \namend the rules. It rejected it.\n  The reason that the constitutional approach to rules changes has \nnever been implemented is that every time it has been attempted, the \nSenate has not gone along.\n  When Vice President Humphrey explicitly ruled that the Senate could \nend debate by a simple majority, the Senate voted to overturn that \nruling. In those instances when a Vice President has advised that \ntabling a point of order against a motion to limit debate on a rules \nchange by a simple majority amounted to Senate approval of that motion, \nthe Senate has either voted to reject that interpretation outright or \nvoted against tabling the point of order.\n  The very basis for minority rights in the Senate is the absence of \nsimple majority cloture, which would allow a majority of Senators to \nend debate. The absence of simple majority cloture is the only ground \non which a minority, and sometimes a single Senator, can stand to \ndemand they be heard on any given issue.\n  I believe by the letter and spirit of our rules, and the history and \npractice of this body, the bipartisan leadership proposal before us \nmerits support. But I also recognize that these arguments alone may not \nsuffice for the millions of Americans who understandably do not know or \ncare much about the procedures and rules of the Senate, and who have \nwatched for the last 4 years with mounting frustration as abuse of \nthose rules has obstructed progress and mired the Senate in seemingly \nendless delay.\n\n  The foundation of Democratic governance is rule by majority consent. \nIndeed, democracy arose as a response to centuries of rule by a \nprivileged and self-interested minority imposing its will on the \nmajority. And the need for a system that protects minority rights is \ncounter-intuitive to many Americans, who find it hard to understand why \nthe majority's will does not always carry the day in the Senate.\n  But while the foundation of our Democratic system is rule by the will \nof the people, our Founding Fathers were careful to enshrine \nprotections against what they warned was a dangerous threat to true \npolitical liberty. They called it ``majority faction,'' the possibility \nthat a majority of the public would, in pursuit of its own interests, \ninfringe upon the rights of their fellow citizens.\n  They crafted our system with a series of checks and balances to \nprotect against the dangers of majority faction. And since the \nfounding, many of the most important steps forward for our country have \ninvolved protecting minorities from the harms of majority faction.\n  The giants of the Senate have recognized the vital importance of \nprotecting minority rights. Senator Daniel Inouye was rightly eulogized \nrecently in this chamber as a wise and experienced presence in the \nSenate. He demonstrated that wisdom from the very beginning of his \ncareer here. In\n\n[[Page S264]]\n\nhis maiden speech on this floor, he implored the Senate to preserve its \nprotections for minority views, even when those protections allowed a \nmisguided minority to obstruct our Nation's progress. This is what he \nsaid:\n\n       The philosophy of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights \n     is not simply to grant the majority the power to rule, but is \n     also to set out limitation after limitation upon that power. \n     Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion: \n     What are these but the recognition that at times when the \n     majority of men would willingly destroy him, a dissenting man \n     may have no friend but the law? This power given to the \n     minority is the most sophisticated and the most vital power \n     bestowed by our Constitution.\n\n  Understand what was taking place here. Senator Inouye spoke as the \nSenate was debating whether to weaken the rights of the Senate \nminority, so that the Senate majority could end grave injustice by \nenacting civil rights legislation. Senator Inouye, a man who had \nhimself felt the pain of racial discrimination, even during and after \nhis remarkable service to this nation during World War II, used his \nfirst speech on this floor to warn against the attempts ``to destroy \nthe power of the minority . . . in the name of another minority.''\n  I want to make clear to my colleagues my belief that defense of the \nminority's rights in the Senate is not defense of the current use, and \nabuse, of those rights. It is not a defense of a few who threaten \nroutinely to prevent consideration of judicial nominees unanimously \napproved in committee, or to prevent debate on legislation. We need to \nact so that the Senate can function again.\n  But we can't save the Senate by destroying its very nature and role. \nIn the past, Senators strongly committed to reforming the Senate rules \nhave been equally committed to preserving its institutional strengths. \nListen to the words of Senator Mansfield, who, in 1967, worked to \nreform the cloture rule so the Senate would function more normally--\nbut, importantly, urged his colleagues not to pursue those reforms by \nthe destructive means of establishing simple majority cloture to end \ndebate on a rules change. While arguing strongly for reform, Senator \nMansfield said, ``[The] urgency or even wisdom of adopting the three-\nfifths resolution does not justify a path of destruction to the Senate \nas an institution and its vital importance to our scheme of government. \nAnd this, in my opinion, is what the present motion to invoke cloture \nby simple majority would do.'' Senator Mansfield added: ``I simply feel \nthe protection of the minority transcends any rule change, however \ndesirable. . . . The issue of limiting debate in this body is one of \nsuch monumental importance that it reaches, in my opinion, to the very \nessence of the Senate as an institution. I believe it compels a \ndecision by more than a majority.''\n  In 1975, Senator Byrd argued in favor of the rule change reducing the \nnumber of votes needed to end debate from 67 to 60. But he strongly \nopposed using simple-majority cloture of the debate on that rules \nchange. ``I feel that a three-fifths cloture vote would protect the \nminority, protect the uniqueness of this institution, and preserve a \nfair and equitable way to close debate. But I am not for destroying the \nSenate as a unique institution in an effort to reach that end.''\n\n  In 2010, in testimony before the Rules Committee on this subject, \nSenator Byrd said:\n\n       During this 111th Congress, in particular, the minority has \n     threatened to filibuster almost every matter proposed for \n     Senate consideration. I find this tactic contrary to every \n     Senator's duty to act in good faith. I share the profound \n     frustration of my constituents and colleagues as we confront \n     this situation. The challenges before our nation are too \n     grave, too numerous, for the Senate to be rendered impotent \n     to address them, and yet be derided for inaction by those \n     causing the delays. . . . Does the difficulty reside in the \n     construction of our rules, or does it reside in the ease of \n     circumventing them? A true filibuster is a fight, not a \n     threat, not a bluff. . . . Now, unbelievably, just the \n     whisper of opposition brings the `world's greatest \n     deliberative body' to a grinding halt. . . . Forceful \n     confrontation to a threat to filibuster is undoubtedly the \n     antidote to the malady.\n\n  There have without question been times when a self-interested or \nhide-bound minority in the Senate has frustrated American progress. But \nthere have also been times when a Senate majority has attempted to \nimpose its will in ways that would have been harmful. Those instances \nresonate far less loudly when one is a supporter of a frustrated \nmajority. But those of us who have served in the minority in this body, \nas I have for nearly half my time in the Senate, remember them well.\n  In the recent past, Senate Democrats in the minority used the \nprotections afforded the minority to block a series of bills that would \nhave unwisely restricted the reproductive rights of American women. We \nbeat back special-interest efforts to limit Americans' ability to seek \njustice in our courts when harmed by corporate wrongdoing. We used \nthose protections to seek an extension of unemployment benefits for \nmillions of Americans. We used them to oppose the nomination of \nnominees to the Federal courts who we thought would do great harm to \nthe law. Progressives distressed that the recent fiscal cliff agreement \nraised the estate tax exemption to more than $5 million should recall \nthat without the protections afforded the Senate minority, a total \nrepeal of the estate tax would have passed the Senate in 2006. Forty-\none Senators prevented that from happening.\n  Over the history of this body, giants of the Senate have repeatedly \nwarned us against the danger of damaging, even with the best of \nintentions, the Senate's protections for minority rights and extended \ndebate. Time and again, the Senate has heeded those warnings. While it \nis necessary to reasonably preserve those minority rights, it also is \nurgent that we restore the Senate's ability to function. Unless we do \nthat, the Senate's character and function within our system of \ngovernment will remain threatened by constant gridlock. The bipartisan \nproposal before us holds the promise of restoring the Senate's \ndeliberative and legislative process, without going down a ``nuclear'' \npath that might severely damage the Senate in an attempt to save it. \nThis proposal holds the promise of demonstrating to a nation hungering \nfor bipartisan cooperation that we are capable of providing it. I urge \nmy colleagues to embrace a bipartisan approach that will allow us to \nend the gridlock of which we have seen too much, and to do so with the \nbipartisan spirit of which our people have seen too little.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Levin for his \nleadership, as well as Senator McCain, Senators Schumer, Cardin, Pryor, \nand Senator Kyl--who has now retired from the Senate--and Senator \nBarrasso. We are hopeful the leaders will be able to recommend to us a \nset of changes in our rules and procedures and practices that will help \nthe Senate operate in a fairer and more efficient way. That is what all \nof us want. It is surprising how many of us want that.\n  We all worked pretty hard to get here. We all understand we are \npolitical accidents. The Senator from Maine, the Senator from \nArkansas--we all know that. We are very fortunate to be here. While we \nare here, we would like to contribute something. That gets down to a \ncouple things. Let's make it easy for a committee bill to come to the \nfloor, and let's make it easier for Senators from the various States \nand from various points of view to have their say. Allow them to offer \ntheir amendment and have it voted up or down and to have a final vote. \nThat is all.\n  I often use the analogy of the Grand Ole Opry. A person is lucky to \nbe on the Grand Ole Opry. If you are there, you want to sing. Sometimes \nbeing in the Senate has been like being in the Grand Ole Opry and not \nbeing able to sing. We have all done the finger-pointing. The \nDemocrats--the majority--say: You Republicans are filibustering. You \nare blocking things and keeping things from happening.\n  What we are saying is the majority leader has used the gag rule 69 \ntimes. Senator Daschle only used it once. What the eight of us found \nvery quickly when we sat down in the first meeting a few weeks ago was \nthat we were of the same mind. We honored this institution and we \nbelieve our country has serious problems. We want to get to those \nproblems, and we want to serve our country well in the position we \nhave.\n  If we are from Michigan, we want to be able to offer the voices of \nMichigan\n\n[[Page S265]]\n\non the floor of the Senate. If we are from Nashville or the mountains \nof Tennessee or Maine, we want to be able to do the same. We want our \nvoices heard--not our voices but the voices of the people whom we \nrepresent. That is the importance of the discussion we are having \ntoday.\n  My hope is the majority leader and the Republican leader--and I \ncongratulate them for sort of sticking their necks out in their \nrespective conferences--recommend a way that we can do two things: make \nit easier for bills to come to the floor and make it easier for \nSenators to get their amendments in. I believe if that happens, this \nSenate will see a new day.\n  On this side of the aisle, we believe we don't need rules changes; \nthat we just need a change in behavior. On the other side of the aisle, \nthere are those who say: Let's get rid of the filibuster. I think once \nwe get back into what we call regular order, all that talk will go \naway. I think Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby are going to have 10 \nor 11 or 12 appropriations bills ready to come to the floor within a \nfew weeks, and I think they are going to want them to be considered by \nthis body. If they do, we will be busy for 8 or 10 weeks and we will \nhave dozens of amendments. I heard the chairman of the Budget Committee \nsay she intended to have a budget and, if she does, we will have dozens \nof amendments. Then the voices of the people of this country will be \nheard here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We will have votes, we will \nhave amendments, and we will be doing our job, and all of this talk we \nare having right now will be pushed into the background.\n\n  There is a reason for a Senate that is different than the House of \nRepresentatives. It goes all the way back to the founding of our \ncountry. It was noticed by the first observers of our country. Alexis \nde Tocqueville, in his fascinating view of America in ``Democracy in \nAmerica'' which he wrote in the early part of the 19th century, said \nAmerica faced two great challenges. One was Russia. The other one was \nthe tyranny of the majority. This is a democracy. This is a majority \nrules country. But he saw in a great, big, complex country the danger \nof the tyranny of the majority. And this institution, the U.S. Senate, \nhas from the beginning of the country protected the minority and \nprotected the unpopular view. If a Senator didn't like the Vietnam war, \nhe or she could stand up and say something here and maybe do something \nabout it. Or if a Senator was on the other side, maybe he or she could \ndo something about it. They could make people slow down and stop and \nthink before the country rushes ahead.\n  Senators of both parties eloquently, as Senator Levin has pointed \nout, have defended that right. We Republicans in the Bush \nadministration were so upset about the Democrats' blocking of judges \nthat we said we might use the nuclear option, that we might turn this \ninto a majority body. Now there are a number of Democrats who feel the \nsame way here. I hope we put that away and realize that this is the \nbody that stands up for minority views in this country and says, don't \nrun over minorities. Stop and think. Stop and think before you do that. \nThen we forge a consensus.\n  To conclude my remarks--because I see the Senator from Arkansas, who \nhas been an outstanding contributor to this effort, as he has been \nthrough his time in the Senate--I came to the Senate as a young staff \naide in 1967. That was a long time ago. I saw a little bit of how \nimportant it is to have a body that gains a consensus when we are \ntalking about a big, difficult issue for the whole country. In 1967, \nthe issue was civil rights. The Senator from Maine knows about those \nearly days in the Senate. The Senator from Michigan does as well. There \nwere a minority of Republicans at that time. Everett Dirksen was the \nRepublican leader. But the civil rights bill of 1968 was written in the \nRepublican leader's office. Why? Because at that time they had to get \n67 votes to pass it.\n  One might say, Well, that shows what is wrong with the Senate, \nbecause it slowed things down. But looking back over history, those \nlast 8 or 10 years of civil rights laws, the Voting Rights Act, \neventually all of the laws that changed our country and continue to \nchange it, were big steps. And what happened in 1968 once the Senate \ngained a consensus on civil rights? Senator Russell, who led the \nopposition to the civil rights bill through his whole career, got on \nthe airplane, went home to Georgia and said, It is the law of the land. \nNow we obey it.\n  So the value of having a body in our government that respects the \nminority and forces a consensus is that once we reach that consensus--\nonce we reach it--we then have a better chance of having the country \nbehind what we do on the very controversial and difficult issues we \nface.\n  So if this works out as I hope it does today, I pledge my part to \nwork with the majority, as one Senator, to help make sure bills come to \nthe floor, and to work with Republican Senators in the minority to help \nmake sure they get their amendments. If we do, I think we will do our \njob better, we will gain more respect, the country will have a stronger \ngovernment, and the rights of the minority will be protected.\n  I thank Senator Levin for his leadership, as well as Senator Pryor \nand the others with whom I have worked.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Levin and Senator \nAlexander for their kind comments about me. The Senator from Tennessee \nand I came to the U.S. Senate at the same time. That was 10 years ago.\n  One of the things I think everyone would agree with is we have seen \nover the last 10 years a waning of effectiveness in the Senate. A large \npart of that is the fact that this floor is not used as it should be. \nThis floor has been used to block and obstruct. Both parties are guilty \nof that. This floor should be the marketplace of ideas. It should be \nwhere we come together and we work to resolve our differences. Our \ndifferences may be partisan, they may be regional, they may be \nphilosophical, they may be generational, whatever, but our Founding \nFathers set up our system of government where there would be one place \nwhere difficult, complex, thorny, even sometimes politically \ntreacherous issues can be resolved, and that is on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  When we, again Democrats and Republicans, abuse the rules around here \nand we stymie the Senate from acting, we get gridlock, and gridlock is \nnot good for the country. I firmly believe one of the reasons the \nAmerican public is so disgusted with Congress right now is because of \nthe things that are happening and not happening on this floor.\n  When we think about our system of government and when our Founding \nFathers set it up, of course we have the three branches, but as a \npractical matter, the floor, right here, is the only place in our \ngovernment where the American people--the people we represent--can \nactually see their law being made. Americans don't see law being made \nat the White House. They go out there and they huddle up in their \nconference rooms and they come out to the Rose Garden and they make the \nannouncement. We never see the process. We don't see the process in the \nU.S. Supreme Court or in the courts of appeals. What happens there is \nthe lawyers and the parties come in and make their cases and then the \nJustices and judges go back and conference and they talk about it back \nin their chambers, and they come out with their decision, and that is \nwhat we have. We don't always know what the deliberations are. We don't \nknow all the considerations. The same thing in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, with all due respect to our other Chamber down the \nhall. Because of the way their rules operate, because of the Rules \nCommittee and the way it is structured and their history and, quite \nfrankly, their DNA, it is a majoritarian body. But not the U.S. Senate. \nIn the Senate we allow Senators to amend and debate and to vote. That \nhas been one of the problems here in the last 10 years. The Senator \nfrom Tennessee--and I see the Senator from Texas on the floor--we all \ncame in together. This Senate has lost a lot of ability to do that.\n\n  I am firmly convinced we have sufficient verbiage in rule XXII of the \nSenate Rules to require a talking filibuster. I think that is \ncritically important. It is not a new interpretation, but it is \nutilizing the existing interpretations, the longstanding history of the \nSenate, based on parliamentary decisions, based on decades of things \nthat\n\n[[Page S266]]\n\nhave happened here on the floor, where we have the authority already in \nrule XXII. But we have asked our two leaders to clarify and state and \nnotify all of us how we are going to handle issues during this \nCongress. The way we are going to handle it when it comes to the \ntalking filibuster is we are going to require Senators to be here to \nobject. No more phone-in filibusters. We are going to require Senators \nto come down and state their objections, to come down and actually \nspeak. If they have a problem with moving forward, they need to come \nand speak about it. If they want to start a filibuster, they should be \nhere to speak on the floor. What is going to happen is the majority of \nSenators who want to see legislation get done may have to do a little \nwork and be here late nights, but that is part of it. That is what we \nsigned up for. It is like the Senator from Tennessee said a few moments \nago. We all worked very hard to get here, and we came here to work for \nthe country. If we are ever going to have a chance of resolving the big \nand difficult issues that face our Nation--issues such as our debt and \ndeficit; issues such as the fiscal cliff; a whole set of issues \nincluding tax reform, entitlement reform--we can bet our last dollar \nthose things are going to happen in the Senate. That is where things \nget done.\n  The fiscal cliff, with all due respect to the House, didn't happen in \nthe House, it happened in the Senate. The minority leader and the Vice \nPresident worked it out. That is the way things have always gotten \ndone, for the most part, in American history, and that is the way we \nneed to allow things to get done in this Congress, because we have too \nmany big issues to block everything that is coming through on the \nSenate floor.\n  Again, I wish to thank Senator Levin and Senator McCain for leading \nthis effort. They are great leaders. I thank Senator Kyl, Senator \nBarrasso, Senator Alexander. Participating in those meetings with my \nRepublican colleagues was a great experience, to listen to them, listen \nto their concerns. I think it was an education for all the Democrats to \nhave that quality time where we did listen and then they listened to \nus. I think that was very important. We need to do more of that around \nhere. We will get a lot more done if we do.\n  Also, our Democratic colleagues, of course led by Senator Levin, \nSenator Schumer, and Senator Cardin, everybody contributed, and I think \nit is something we should be proud of and it is also a great victory \nfor bipartisanship. It is a great victory for bipartisanship. I think \nthat is what the American people are screaming out for: for us to work \ntogether to get things done, and this is a good example of that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/24/senate-section/article/S266-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Mr. President, as I walked to the Capitol, I had not \nintended to speak. But when I came in and started listening to Senator \nPryor and Senator Levin, and I listened earlier today to Senator McCain \nand now Senator Alexander, it made me want to come to the floor and \nthank them for the effort they have made to hopefully make us a better \nworking body in the next 2 years than we would have been otherwise \npreceding this agreement.\n  When Senator Alexander made the remarks about our predecessor, \nRichard Russell, and when he came home to Georgia after a rigorous \ndebate, an arduous debate, that took place on civil rights, it made me \nrecognize the appreciation and respect our predecessors had for the \nresult of the debating process.\n  As I listened to Senator Pryor, I had a flashback to 2 weeks ago when \na number of us attended the movie ``Lincoln.'' It was a screening of \nthe movie downstairs, and Steven Spielberg was there. I thought about \nthose great scenes in the movie ``Lincoln'' where the U.S. Congress \ndebated slavery and whether we were going to abolish it. We came to a \ndecision, we had a vote, we debated it, and the abolition of slavery \ntook place, all because the Congress functioned, all because \npoliticians took the issues to the floor. They challenged one another. \nThey worked hard for what they thought was best for the country. I \nthink tonight when we vote on the changes that will be adopted, we \npreserve the interests of the minority. We preserve the best heritage \nof this body. We put ourselves in a state where we will debate on the \nfloor of the Senate and make decisions for the American people, and the \nresult will be a better country and a better product by the U.S. \nSenate.\n  So I thank, Senator Alexander, Senator Pryor, Senator McCain, \nwherever you might be, and Senator Carl Levin, for a job well done.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to share a few comments on the \nvotes that we are about to take. In particular, I am struck by the \nenormous amount of conversation over the last few days over how we make \nthis body, our beloved Senate, work more effectively in addressing the \nbig issues facing America.\n  I think all of us have had the experience of our constituents back \nhome recognizing that the last 2 years, and many years before, were \nones that we had a particular growing element of paralysis that we had \na responsibility to address. Tonight the Senate is going to be speaking \nin a bipartisan fashion and saying this cannot continue in the same \nway; that we need to take steps toward having a more functional Senate.\n  I don't think it will come as a surprise to anyone in this Chamber \nthat I had hoped we would go a little further in addressing the silent \nfilibuster that has been haunting us in these Halls. But here is the \nimportant thing. The important thing is that this Chamber is speaking \ntonight in a bipartisan voice, in a strong voice, saying we must take \nsteps for this deliberation to work better. I think that message \nreverberates with the American people who are looking at the many \nchallenges we face as a nation and who have been watching through the \ncourtesy of C-SPAN and seeing that often, when they want us to be \naddressing these challenges, we are here in quorum calls.\n  A substantial amount of that can change, both with the modest steps \nwe are taking tonight and, hopefully, in the collaboration between the \ntwo parties in the spirit of having a functioning legislature.\n  I want to thank a number of groups who have worked very hard to bring \nto us the importance of making change: the Communications Workers of \nAmerica, the Sierra Club, the Alliance for Justice, the entire Fix the \nSenate Coalition, Daily Coast, Credo, the Progressive Campaign \nCommittee, and the nearly half million Americans who have signed \npetitions to say: Please, Dear Senators, work hard on this. It matters. \nI think their voices were heard.\n  So I extend my appreciation to the leadership on both sides who have \nbeen working so hard to figure out these steps forward, to try to have \na series of tools on the motion to proceed, to figure out how we can \nget more effectively to conference committee with the House, how we can \ncut down on the number of hours that are often wasted after a cloture \nvote on a nomination. So there is significant progress in a number of \nareas.\n  I certainly pledge to my majority leader and to my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to remain engaged in this conversation about the \nfunctioning of the Senate. I appreciate the work they have done. I \nappreciate the steps we are taking tonight. I also appreciate the \nspirit in which many folks are saying: Let's make these things work. We \nhope they work. And if they don't get us there, let's return to this \nconversation because we do have that\n\n[[Page S267]]\n\nunderlying responsibility to the citizens of the Nation to have a \nSenate that can act. In the words of the President just outside a few \ndays ago, it is time to act. He called upon the Nation and he calls \nupon us, and we make significant steps in that direction tonight.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about \nour efforts to change the Senate rules.\n  For the second time since I have been in the Senate, the \nconstitutional option has been crucial. It has pushed this body to \nseriously look at changing the way we do business.\n  This week the majority leader and majority whip declared majority \nsupport for the constitutional option. As a result, the Republican \nleader has finally agreed to some Senate rule changes.\n  As I said more than 3 years ago when I first proposed the \nconstitutional option, it is time for reform. There are many great \ntraditions in this Chamber that should be protected and respected. But \nthe paralyzing abuse of filibusters is not one of them.\n  Senators Merkley, Harkin, and I introduced a package of reforms that \nis fair, that reins in the abuse, and that protects the voice of the \nminority.\n  While I believe our reform package is a much better way to restore \ndebate and deliberation to the Senate, I appreciate the leadership's \nefforts to get a bipartisan agreement. To move forward to reform the \nfilibuster and reduce Senate gridlock.\n  I have carefully considered the compromise proposal that Leaders Reid \nand McConnell have crafted. I don't believe their proposal does enough \nto reform the Senate, but it does show that there is consensus, that \nboth sides of the aisle recognize that the Senate is broken, that we \nmust have change.\n  The leaders' proposal is a step in the right direction. I am most \nconcerned that it does not eliminate the fundamental cause of Senate \ndysfunction--the fact that any Member can halt Senate business without \neven showing up on the Senate floor. We shouldn't do away with the \nfilibuster, but we should demand greater responsibility from senators \nwho use it.\n  The majority leader and the Republican leader are telling us that \nthey will make Senators who object or threaten filibusters come to the \nfloor and actually debate, using the existing rules. The proof of this \nwill be over the next 2 years. We will be watching.\n  I believe we could have achieved more substantive reform by using the \nconstitutional option to amend the rules with a majority vote. I know \nseveral of my colleagues think this would set a dangerous precedent. I \ndisagree.\n  I know that we may serve in the minority at some point in our Senate \ncareers. Senators Merkley, Harkin, and I have not proposed any rules \nchanges that we are not willing to live with in the minority.\n  Senator Harkin made his proposal when he was in the minority. I \nserved in the minority in the House--which is a lot worse than the \nminority around here. So I don't think looking at our rules and \namending them by a majority vote at the beginning of a Congress is \ndangerous. On the contrary. It is a healthy exercise to make sure we \ncan still function as a legislative body.\n  We started this effort over 3 years ago. We have made progress. But \nrules reform is not over. Our work is not complete. We should always \nseek to find ways to be a better institution. That is why I believe we \nshould review and adopt our rules at the beginning of every Congress.\n  One of the resolutions today is a standing order--it applies for only \nthis Congress. We will have an opportunity to revisit this in two \nyears.\n  I want to close by saying this. Since the beginning of this process, \nmy actions have been guided by the great respect I have for the \ninstitution of the United States Senate, my reverence for the many \ngreat men and women who have served here, and my sincere affection for \nmy colleagues.\n  That remains true today. I want to thank my colleagues for their \nconsideration of our proposals, for their willingness to listen, and \nfor their friendship.\n  And I want to make clear to all those who have supported this \neffort--our work will continue. Our cause endures. History has made \nclear that substantial reform is more often than not the work of many \nCongresses, not just one.\n  I commit to doing all I can to ensure that the Senate is not a \ngraveyard for good ideas, that it is once again the world's greatest \ndeliberative body, and that we have a government that truly responds to \nthe real needs of the American people.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are facing major changes in how the \nSenate operates and even minor changes can have big consequences.\n  Since the Senator even from the smallest State represents hundreds of \nthousands of Americans, any change to how senators are able to \nrepresent their constituents' views is of great importance.\n  We have heard plenty of talk from the other side of the aisle about \nhow the Senate's current dysfunction simply boils down to Republican \nabuse of the filibuster.\n  If you are a partisan Democrat and inclined to think the worst of \nRepublicans, then that explanation may hold water for you.\n  On the other hand, those who are more fair minded will find \nthemselves wondering if there isn't more to the story.\n  A fair analysis of what is wrong with the Senate must look at the \nsituation from both sides.\n  From the Republican point of view, the main gripe with how the Senate \nhas been operating recently is the inability of the minority party to \noffer amendments and receive a fair hearing for our ideas.\n  The Senate rules provide that any Senator may offer an amendment \nregardless of party affiliation.\n  The longstanding tradition of the Senate is that members of the \nminority party have an opportunity to offer amendments for a vote by \nthe Senate, even if those votes don't fit the agenda of the leadership \nof the majority party.\n  Of course, if those amendments don't receive a majority of votes in \nthe Senate, they cannot be passed.\n  No one is arguing for some sort of right of a minority of senators to \nadvance a minority agenda.\n  However, it is not uncommon for an idea that comes from the minority \nparty to attract votes from the majority party, even enough to pass.\n  This can be inconvenient or even embarrassing to the leadership of \nthe majority party.\n  Perhaps there is a Republican amendment that would reveal a split \nwithin the Democratic caucus.\n  Perhaps a Republican might offer an amendment that has broad public \nsupport and it would be hard for certain Democrats to explain to the \npeople they represent why they voted against it.\n  What's wrong with taking tough votes and showing the American people \nwhere you stand?\n  Those who lecture us about majority rule can't have it both ways.\n  If an amendment gets the votes of 45 Republicans and 6 Democrats, \nthat is a majority, but that is exactly the scenario the majority \nleader has been trying to avoid.\n  Minority amendments have routinely, systematically been blocked in \nrecent years in the Senate.\n  The Majority Leader has consistently used a tactic called ``filling \nthe tree'' where he offers blocker amendments that block any other \nsenator from offering their own amendment unless he agrees to set his \nblocker amendments aside.\n  He is able to get in line first to put his blocker amendments in \nplace because of a tradition that the Majority Leader has priority to \nbe recognized by the presiding officer.\n  This doesn't appear anywhere in the Senate rules and it arguably \ncontrary to the rules.\n  This so called filling the tree tactic used to be relatively rare, \nbut it has become routine under this Democratic leadership.\n  So what are Republicans to do if they have amendments they want to \noffer?\n  We can ask the majority leader to allow us to set aside his blocker \namendments so we can offer an amendment.\n  His response has been to ask us what amendments we want to offer, and \nhe will only agree to set aside his blocker amendments if he approves \nof the particular Republican amendment.\n  If there are amendments that he doesn't like, he says ``No.''\n  Then, with amendments blocked, he makes a motion to bring debate to a \nclose, or ``cloture''.\n  When cloture is invoked, it sets up a limited time before a final \nvote must take place.\n\n[[Page S268]]\n\n  By keeping amendments blocked while running out that clock, the \nmajority leader can force a final vote on a bill without having to \nconsider any amendments.\n  Naturally, under these circumstances, members of the minority party \nwho wish to offer amendments will vote against the motion to end debate \nand force a final vote until they have had an opportunity to have their \namendments considered.\n  However, when Republicans vote against the majority leader's motion \nto end debate, we are accused of ``launching a filibuster''.\n  Many Americans may be surprised to learn that the Senate rules do not \ndefine what constitutes a filibuster.\n  The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines a filibuster as ``the use of \nextreme dilatory tactics in an attempt to delay or prevent action \nespecially in a legislative assembly.''\n  The fact is, a filibuster can refer to any procedure perceived as \ndilatory, which is in the eye of the beholder.\n  In the case I have described, if Republicans refuse to go along with \nthe majority leader's attempt to deny Senators the right to offer \namendments, is that an extreme dilatory tactic?\n  I would say it is a logical response to an assault on our rights.\n  Republicans can't be expected to vote for the majority leader's \nmotion to end consideration of a bill before we have had a chance to \noffer any amendments.\n  That brings us to the so called ``talking filibuster'' proposal that \nhas been mentioned so much on the Senate floor.\n  Some have proposed that Senators be required to talk non-stop on the \nSenate floor or a final vote can be forced, even if there have been no \namendments allowed.\n  In other words, when the majority leader has amendments blocked, if \nRepublicans want to defend their basic right to offer amendments, they \nwould have to go to the floor and debate non-stop.\n  That doesn't make any sense.\n  What does non-stop debate have to do with giving up your right to \noffer amendments?\n  Here is where advocates of the so called ``talking filibuster'' \nconfuse the issue.\n  As I mentioned, a filibuster can refer to any tactic perceived as \ndilatory, but when most Americans think of the filibuster, they think \nof Jimmy Stewart in the classic film Mr. Smith goes to Washington \nstanding and talking without stopping for an extended period of time to \ndelay proceedings and make a point. It just makes sense that if you \nwant to engage in this type of filibuster, you should have to actually \nspeak.\n  Some Senators would have us believe that somewhere along the line the \nfilibuster was mysteriously transformed so Senators no longer had to \ntalk on the floor of the Senate, but that is not the case.\n  The filibuster itself hasn't changed, just what we call a filibuster.\n  When Democrats complain about Republican filibusters, they aren't \ntalking about Mr. Smith Goes to Washington filibusters.\n  They are talking about Republicans refusing to vote for the majority \nleader's motion to end consideration of bills without the opportunity \nfor amendments.\n  Again, the rules and traditions of the Senate dictate that Senators \nhave a right to offer amendment.\n  What justification can there be for forcing Senators to speak for \nhours on the floor or lose the right to offer amendments?\n  That would just encourage the majority leader to block amendments \neven more and use this new tool to jam legislation through the Senate \nwithout considering alternative views. Such a situation would only make \nthe underlying problem worse.\n  This isn't just Republicans saying this.\n  Listen to what the New York Times said: ``The use of filibusters has \nrisen since the 1970s, especially when Republicans have been in the \nSenate minority. But the most recent spike of Republican filibusters \nhas coincided with the Democrats' unprecedented moves to limit \namendments on the Senate floor.''\n  The current majority has moved to cut off debate and amendments on a \nmeasure other than the motion to proceed over 100 times.\n  This doesn't even tell the whole story because much of the time, the \nSenate Majority Leader doesn't have to actually use his amendment \nblocking tactic.\n  He simply informs Republicans that he will block amendments, or \nrefuses to commit to allow Republican amendments before making the \nmotion to consider a bill.\n  Republicans can hardly be expected to vote in favor of taking up a \nbill under these conditions.\n  I should point out that it isn't just members of the minority party \nwho have been affected by the blocking of amendments.\n  There have been far fewer opportunities for Democrat Senators to \noffer amendments in recent years than used to be the case.\n  Not all Democrats will agree with every aspect of a bill brought \nbefore the Senate by their own leadership.\n  Rank and file Democrats might also have ideas to improve a bill that \nhad not yet been considered before being taken up by the Senate.\n  Those who claim to want to fix the dysfunction of the Senate but who \nfocus only on the alleged dilatory tactics by the minority party and \nignore the heavy handed tactics by the current majority party are at \nbest only addressing half the problem.\n  Moreover, to the extent any change to the Senate rules strengthens \nthe ability of the majority to steamroll the minority, partisanship \nwill only get worse.\n  The rules of the Senate, which protect the rights of the minority, \nforce the majority to work with the minority if they want to get things \ndone.\n  As a result, the Senate has historically been a more bipartisan place \nthan the House.\n  That is a positive feature of the Senate that we should not discard \nlightly.\n  The role the Senate was intended to play by our Founding Fathers is \nclear.\n  I have described before how the Senate, with its longer staggered \nterms and other features, was specifically structured to act as a check \non the passions of temporary majorities as represented in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I won't go into detail on that subject again because it is already in \nthe Congressional Record, but I quoted James Madison, the Father of the \nConstitution, at length.\n  I have heard some select quotes from the Federalist Papers also used \nby some on the other side to argue that the Framers of the Constitution \nactually favored a more strictly majoritarian system.\n  One common quote is from Federalist 58, which discusses how only a \nsimple majority is required for a quorum in the House of \nRepresentatives. Madison explains that this is to prevent a situation \nwhere a minority of Members can halt action by walking out, as happened \nwith Democrat State legislators during the redistricting fight in 2003 \nand more recently in Wisconsin during the debate about collective \nbargaining for public employees.\n  In context, I see nothing that would contradict the expressed \nconcerns elsewhere in the Federalist Papers about tyranny of the \nmajority.\n  I have also heard a reference to Federalist 75, which ironically \ndiscusses the supermajority requirement in the Constitution for \nratifying treaties.\n  The discussion is about whether the supermajority ought to be two-\nthirds of Senators present or two-thirds voting, not whether there \nought to be a supermajority requirement.\n  We can never know what the Framers would have thought of the cloture \nrule as it currently exists.\n  However, we know that the Senate was specifically intended to prevent \nthe majority from steamrolling the minority.\n  The fact is, our Constitution is a compromise between a purely \nmajoritarian system where the rights of the minority are threatened by \nwhat Madison called the ``superior force of an interested and \noverbearing majority'' and the system under the Articles of \nConfederation where nothing could be done unless it was practically \nunanimous.\n  Our goal should be to return to the tradition of the Senate as a \ndeliberative body where all Senators have an opportunity to put forward \nproposals, and the Senate can work its collective will.\n\n[[Page S269]]\n\n  Any reform of the Senate rules must balance the interests of the \nmajority with the rights of the minority, not tip the balance toward \none or the other.\n  If we fail to strike that balance, partisanship will only get worse.\n  That is easier said than done.\n  I know several Senators put forward proposals that they think are \nfair and will fix the Senate.\n  However, it takes more than assurances that you are willing to live \nunder the rules you are prepared to impose should you find yourself in \nthe minority.\n  You can't say that for sure until you are in that position.\n  Any serious attempt at a fair approach to the Senate's problems must \ninvolve engaging members of the other party and addressing their \nlegitimate concerns.\n  That means that any reform of the Senate rules must restore a full \nand open amendment process where individual senators of any party can \noffer amendments.\n  Does the deal before us meet that test?\n  I am not sure.\n  The deal the two leaders have struck does include a guarantee of two \namendments for the minority party, presumably picked by the minority \nleader.\n  That at least acknowledges the legitimate concerns on my side of the \naisle about the blocking of amendments.\n  Two amendments is better than none, which is what we have had in \npractice.\n  It is also better than a unilateral rules changes imposed by the \nmajority on an unwilling minority.\n  However, I have described how the right to offer amendments is a \nfundamental right of individual Senators representing their respective \nStates.\n  There are 45 Republicans in the Senate, not 2.\n  It is also true that rank and file Democrats have plenty of proposals \nthey have a right to put forward.\n  They shouldn't have to ask their leader's permission to do so any \nmore than Republicans should.\n  Perhaps knowing that he will have to deal with two Republican \namendments, the majority leader will decide to allow more bills to be \nconsidered under an open amendment process the way they should be. I \nhope so.\n  However, it is also possible that the majority leader will decide \nthat there is no reason to ever go back to the traditional open \namendment process now that we have this new process that only \nguarantees two amendments.\n  Two amendments could become the new ceiling rather than the floor.\n  If that is the case, we will have made the Senate more partisan and \nmore dysfunctional.\n  It remains to be seen these changes will work in practice and I will \nbe watching closely.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, during my 38 years in the Senate, I have \nserved with Democratic majorities and Republican majorities, during \nRepublican administrations and Democratic ones. Whether in the majority \nor the minority, whether the chairman or ranking member of a committee, \nI have always stood for the protection of the rights of the minority. \nEven when the minority has voted differently than I have or opposed \nwhat I have supported, I have defended their rights and held to my \nbelief that the best traditions of the Senate would win out and that \nthe 100 of us who stand in the shoes of over 300 million Americans \nwould do the right thing.\n  Yet over the last 4 years, Senate Republicans have come dangerously \nclose to changing something central to the character of the Senate and \nthreatening its ability to do its work for the American people.\n  As a caucus, instead of trying to work with us on efforts to help the \nAmerican people at a time of economic challenges, Senate Republicans \nhave engaged in an across-the-board procedural barricade. On issue \nafter issue, from the DISCLOSE Act to efforts to curb massive subsidies \nfor big oil companies, from the American Jobs Act to the Paycheck \nFairness Act, from legislation to help small businesses to providing \nsupport for our veterans, Senate Republicans have relied on the \nunprecedented use of the filibuster to thwart the majority from making \nprogress. They have long since crossed the line from use of the Senate \nrules to abuse of the rules, exploiting them to undermine our ability \nto solve national problems.\n  Filibusters that were once used rarely have now become a common \noccurrence, with Senate Republicans raising procedural barriers to even \nconsidering legislation or voting on the kinds of noncontroversial \nnominations the Senate once confirmed regularly and quickly by \nunanimous consent. The leader has been required to file cloture just to \nensure that the Senate makes any progress at all to address our \nnational and economic security, and a supermajority of the Senate is \nnow needed even to force a vote on mundane issues.\n  That is not how the Senate should work or has worked. The Senate is \nbuilt on a tradition of comity, with rules that only function based on \nthe kind of consent commonly and traditionally given. The rules are not \nbuilt to aid and abet Senators using across-the-board filibusters and \nobstruction at every turn. The Senate does not function if an entire \ncaucus takes every opportunity to use obscure procedural loopholes to \nstand in the way of a vote because they might disagree with the result. \nWithout serious steps to curtail these abuses, the approach taken the \nlast four years by Senate Republicans risks turning the rules of the \nSenate into a farce and calls into question the ability of the Senate \nto perform its constitutional functions.\n  In an earlier period of Senate history, when the filibuster was \nwidely regarded as having become too great an obstacle for long-overdue \nreforms--for which there was a wide and general national consensus--I \nhad the honor of playing a small part as a freshman senator during \nSenator Walter Mondale's heroic and successful efforts to lower the \ncloture bar from 67 votes to 60 votes. Then, as now, reform came \nthrough arduous, bipartisan negotiation.\n  I am hopeful that the agreement reached today by the majority leader \nand the Republican leader represents that kind of serious step toward \nrestoring the tradition of the Senate and its ability to work for the \nAmerican people. I am hopeful that the Republican Senators who join \ntoday with Senate Democrats follow through on the commitment they are \nmaking to curtail the abuse of Senate rules and practices that have \nmarked the last four years.\n  The progress we are making today is a credit to Senator Merkley, \nSenator Udall, Senator Harkin, and others whose efforts to reform the \nSenate rules are justified by the abuses we have seen. The diligence \nand energy of these reformers provided the impetus for the agreement \nreached today by the majority leader and the Republican leader. In my \nview the agreement does not go far enough to address abuses, and I wish \nit included more of the commonsense proposals put forward by the \nreformers to make the Senate run more efficiently. As I did at the \nbeginning of the last Congress, I support their proposals to put the \nburden of maintaining a filibuster on those seeking to obstruct the \nSenate, rather than on those seeking to overcome the obstruction. \nHowever, I am willing to accept today's agreement as a meaningful \ncompromise with concessions by both sides that will have the support of \nsenators from both parties, rather than the support of only one party. \nI will support it because it can be adopted by a supermajority vote \ninstead of the kind of extended and damaging floor fight over the rules \nthat would undermine any progress we hope to make. With so many urgent \nissues to tackle for the American people, we cannot risk giving \nopponents of progress another excuse for inaction.\n  I am encouraged by the verbal agreement between the majority leader \nand the Republican leader to change the practices of how the Senate \nhandles filibusters. Under this agreement, the bill managers and \nleadership would call on Senators who are threatening a filibuster to \ncome to the floor, which will properly put the burden of a filibuster \non those seeking to obstruct, rather than those seeking to make \nprogress. The leaders will also press that postcloture debate time be \nused for debate and will bring votes to produce a quorum to avoid \ndelay. These commonsense steps will help build on today's rules changes \nto help curtail the abuses we have seen and restore the Senate's \nability to work for the American people.\n\n[[Page S270]]\n\n  I also believe the Standing Order that is part of today's agreement \nwill give the majority leader new tools for overcoming the wholesale \nRepublican obstruction of President Obama's judicial nominations. As \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have been especially concerned \nabout the damage being done by Republican obstruction to the Senate's \nunique responsibility for ensuring that the judicial branch has the \njudges it needs to do its job. Over the last 4 years, Senate \nRepublicans have abandoned this constitutional responsibility, using \nunprecedented filibusters to delay and obstruct President Obama from \nappointing to the Federal bench even judicial nominations that have \nbipartisan support. As a result of this brand of Republican \nobstruction, we begin President Obama's second term with the Judiciary \nnearly 20 percent below where it needs to be in terms of judges, and a \nprescription for overburdened courts and a Federal justice system that \ndoes not serve the interests of the American people.\n  Senate Republicans have already forced the majority leader to file \ncloture on 30 of President Obama's judicial nominations, almost all of \nwhich were noncontroversial and were ultimately confirmed \noverwhelmingly. Yet the Senate rules give the minority the ability to \ndemand 30 hours of floor time even after a supermajority of the Senate \nhas voted to end the filibuster of a judicial nomination. This extended \ndebate time is meant to give the Senate a chance to consider amendments \nthat are germane to a bill so it serves no purpose for judicial \nnominations. Rather, it has been used by Senate Republicans as a threat \nto obstruct the Senate for days just to get to a vote on each of these \nnoncontroversial nominations. Such an approach has made it easier for a \nsilent minority of Senate Republicans to make the costs too high for \nthe majority leader to push for votes on nominees and has led directly \nto the unnecessary and damaging backlog of judicial nominations we have \nseen for years on the Senate calendar.\n  The agreement reached today has a good chance of curtailing this type \nof abuse of the rules in this Congress by reducing this extended debate \ntime after the end of a filibuster on district court nominations from \n30 hours to two hours. I believe this change will increase the ability \nof the majority leader to push for votes on district court nominations, \nwhere the threat by Senate Republicans of extended debate time has been \nparticularly damaging.\n  Federal district court judges hear cases from litigants across the \ncountry and handle the vast majority of the caseload of the Federal \ncourts. Nominations to fill these critical positions, whether made by a \nDemocratic or Republican President, have always been considered with \ndeference to the home State Senators who know the nominees and their \nStates best and have been confirmed promptly with that support. Never \nbefore in the 38 years I have been in the Senate have I seen anything \nlike what has happened in the last 4 years, when we have seen district \ncourt nominees blocked for months and opposed for no good reason. \nSenate Republicans have politicized even these traditionally non-\npartisan positions, needlessly stalling them for months with no \nexplanation.\n  Until 2009, Senators deferred to the President and to home State \nSenators on district court nominees. During the 8 years that George W. \nBush served as President, only five of his district court nominees \nreceived any opposition on the floor. In just 4 years, Senate \nRepublicans have voted against 39 of President Obama's district court \nnominees, and the majority leader has been forced to file cloture on 20 \nof them, with many more left to linger month after month without a vote \non the Senate calendar due to the threat by Republicans to require half \na legislative week or more just to confirm one of them. As a result, it \nhas taken the Senate more than three times as long to vote on President \nObama's district court nominees as it did to vote on President Bush's.\n  The agreement reached today will blunt the ability of Senate \nRepublicans to block important legislation and district court \nnominations without accountability merely by the threat of burning so \nmuch Senate time. I wish that the proposal also applied to Federal \ncircuit court or Supreme Court nominations, where the extended \npostcloture debate time also serves no purpose. But the progress I \nbelieve we will make as a result of this bipartisan compromise is a \ngood first step towards helping us reduce the extended backlog of \njudicial nominations created by Republican obstruction and should \nresult in more judges serving the American people.\n  There is no question that the reforms sought by many Democratic \nSenators are justified by the extended and unprecedented abuse of the \nSenate rules and practices by Senate Republicans that began when \nPresident Obama took office. However, I hope that by reaching this \nbipartisan agreement we build a foundation for restoring the Senate's \nability to fulfill its constitutional duties and do its work for the \nAmerican people. Now the burden is on Senate Republicans to work with \nus rather than hide behind an abuse of the rules to block progress.\n  The American people want Congress to be able to solve national \nproblems like disaster relief, comprehensive immigration reform, and \nthe reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. They want us to \nwork together on commonsense solutions to reduce gun violence and to \nensure that all Americans have access to a working Federal court \nsystem. I hope that today's bipartisan compromise holds the promise of \ngetting more done to help the American people. I look forward to \nworking with those on both sides of the aisle in the coming months.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Further, Mr. President, that the time until 7:55 p.m. be \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees for the \npurpose of debating these resolutions concurrently; that the only \namendment in order to any of the resolutions is a Lee amendment to S. \nRes. 15, that upon use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to \nvote in relation to S.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolutions by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 5) amending the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate to provide for cloture to be invoked with less than a \n     three-fifths majority after additional debate.\n       A resolution (S.

The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the time on this side to the Senator from \nUtah.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, in just a moment I will be offering an \namendment to S. Res. 15. The purpose of this amendment is to protect \nthis institution as the world's greatest deliberative legislative body. \nThe hallmark characteristics of this body that make it distinct, that \nmake it both great and\n\n[[Page S271]]\n\ndeliberative, include the fact that as individual Senators we are \nsupposed to have the right to participate in an open and robust debate \nthat includes an open amendment process. This is historically one of \nthe things that has defined this institution. It is naturally the \noutgrowth of the fact that pursuant to article V of the Constitution, \neach State of the Union is entitled to equal representation in the \nSenate.\n  So as we are talking tonight, we have to remember that we are not \ntalking about the rights of the minority or the majority. We are \ntalking about the rights of each individual Senator having been duly \nelected by the voters in his or her State. I have a concern that some \nof the implications of S. Res. 15 could undermine this characteristic \nof the Senate. In other words, S. Res. 15, while crafted with the very \nbest of intentions, could be applied at some point so as to undermine \nthis right of each and every Senator to offer an amendment.\n  What my amendment does is to guarantee that once this procedure, the \nprocedure under the standing order created by S. Res. 15--once it has \nbeen invoked, every Senator in this body would have the right to file, \npostcloture, a germane amendment to the pending legislation.\n  I think the history, the custom, and the tradition of this body and \nall the things that have made this body great require nothing less than \nthat.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment once we bring it up.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have long believed that rule XXII does \nnot define the Senate. The Senate is defined in the Constitution, and \nit does not mention rule XXII or filibusters.\n  Second, I do not believe the dead hand of the past should control any \nSenate now or in the future.\n  Third, I believe the filibuster should be used to slow things down, \nto make sure the minority has the right to offer amendments and to have \nthem debated and voted on. It does not mean the minority has a right to \nwin, but they have the right to debate and slow things down. The \nfilibuster should not be used as a method to put things in the trash \ncan.\n  As George Washington supposedly said to Jefferson, it was to cool \nthings down. I can understand that. But the filibuster has been used, \nand it will still be used even in the future, so that the minority can \nstop the majority. I have long believed the majority should have the \nright to enact legislation with due regard for the rights of the \nminority to be able to offer amendments and slow things down. But that \nis not what is happening and that is what my proposal I first offered \nin 1995, and continue to offer today, would do.\n  Yes, it would protect the filibuster as a means of slowing things \ndown, but eventually the majority would be able to act, and that is as \nI think the Founders and the drafters of our Constitution really meant \nit to be.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I believe I have no further requests for \ntime on this side. If that, in fact, is the case, and the Republican \nleader has no request for time, I yield whatever time I have.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield whatever time we have.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the Republican \nleader and me to have a brief colloquy about the application of the \nstanding order related to motions to proceed and nominations that the \nSenate will consider. The template for this order was a bipartisan \nproposal developed by Senators Levin and McCain and other Members on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The proposal, as initially developed, provided that \nthe bill managers and the floor leaders of the respective parties would \nbe able to offer one amendment each if the motion to proceed to a \nmatter were employed as it is available in the standing order. The \nmajority leader and I thought it important not to codify who would \noffer those amendments on each side of the aisle.\n  Mr. REID. In addition, the amendment process set out in this order is \nnot to be understood as establishing a ceiling for offering amendments, \nbut instead setting a floor for offering them. The order sets out a \nstructure for beginning the amendment process, not ending it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I agree. The Senate works best when all Members have a \nreasonable opportunity to offer amendments and put forth the views of \ntheir constituents.\n  Mr. REID. And although the order provides that in the amendment \nsequence, the majority party has the ability to offer the last \namendment, the majority will not use that last amendment to eliminate \nor remove language, if any, that the minority was able to add to the \nunderlying matter through the Senate adopting any of the minority's \npreceding amendments.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. On the subject of nominations, Senate Republicans will \ncontinue to work with the majority to process nominations, consistent \nwith the norms and traditions of the Senate. One of those customs is \nfor home-State senators to be consulted on, and approve of, nominations \nfrom their States before the committee on the Judiciary moves forward \nwith considering those nominations, be it a nomination to serve as a \nU.S. Attorney, U.S. Marshall, or judicial officer. It is my \nunderstanding that the order does not change, in any way, the Senate's \n``blue slip'' process.\n  Mr. REID. I agree. Furthermore, it is our expectation that this new \nprocess for considering nominations as set out in this order will not \nbe the norm, but that the two leaders will continue to work together to \nschedule votes on nominees in a timely manner by unanimous consent, \nexcept in extraordinary circumstances.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Finally, I would confirm with the majority leader that \nthe Senate would not consider other resolutions relating to any \nstanding order or rules this Congress unless they went through the \nregular order process?\n  Mr. REID. That is correct. Any other resolutions related to Senate \nprocedure would be subject to a regular order process including \nconsideration by the Rules Committee.\n\n[[Page S273]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the majority leader for confirming my \nunderstanding of the application of the standing order.\n  Mr. REID. In addition to the standing order, I will enforce existing \nrules to make the Senate operate more efficiently. After reasonable \nnotice, I will insist that any Senator who objects to consent requests \nor threatens to filibuster come to the floor and exercises his or her \nrights himself or herself. This will apply to all objections to \nunanimous consent requests. Senators should be required to come to the \nfloor and participate in the legislative process--to voice objections, \nengage in debate, or offer amendments.\n  In addition, Rule XXII makes provision for 30 hours of debate after \ncloture is invoked. Within the 30 hours, Senators have strict \nlimitations on the amount of time each Senator is allowed to speak. \nThese limits should be enforced and Rule XXII further says, ``After no \nmore than thirty hours of debate,'' so 30 hours will be considered the \noutside limit of post-cloture debate time.\n  Finally, we will also announce that when the majority leader or bill \nmanager has reasonably alerted the body of the intention to do so and \nthe Senate is not in a quorum call and there is no order of the Senate \nto the contrary, the Presiding Officer may ask if there is further \ndebate, and if no Senator seeks recognition, the Presiding Officer may \nput the question to a vote. This is consistent with precedent of the \nSenate and with Riddick's Senate Procedure, 1992. See page 716 in \nRiddick's and footnotes 385 and 386 on page 764. This can be done pre-\ncloture or post-cloture on any amendment, bill, resolution or \nnomination.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. This is consistent with the precedent of the Senate \nwith the understanding that Senators are given the timely notification \nof the Presiding Officer's intention so that they will be able to come \nto the floor to exercise their rights under the rules.\n\n\n                           Motion to Proceed\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask that Senators Alexander and Barrasso \nengage in a colloquy with me about our understanding of the operation \nof the standing order that the Senate just adopted related to motions \nto proceed and nominations, and our intent in drafting it.\n  The prospect of the majority, for the first time, changing the \nStanding Rules of the Senate by violating the provisions of those very \nrules was jarring to me and several of my colleagues, on both sides of \nthe aisle, who care about this institution and the uniquely important \nrole it serves in our Republic. Use of this unprecedented tactic for \nchanging the standing rules would be a nuclear option, for it would \nirreparably damage the institution just to accommodate the desires of \nthe current majority. Over the years Senators of both parties have \neloquently stated where doing this would, in the words of the current \nmajority leader in 2005, be: ``The end of the U.S. Senate.''\n  Mr. McCAIN. Some of the most vociferous proponents of this approach \nhave never served in the minority. They do not appreciate that the \ncourse of action they were urging, if undertaken, ultimately would be \nto their disadvantage when they served in the minority, which \ninevitably some of them will. So Senators Alexander, Barrasso and I, \nalong with our former colleague, Jon Kyl, began working with like-\nminded Members of the majority to diffuse this situation to meet the \ngoals of making it easier for the majority to bring legislation to the \nfloor and making it easier for a member of the minority to offer \namendments to that legislation. We worked together to develop \nrecommendations for the majority and minority leaders which we all \nbelieved would allow the Senate to function in a fairer and more \neffective way.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senate works best when committee-approved bills \nmove to the floor in an orderly way and Senators are freely able to \ndebate and amend and vote upon the legislation. Unfortunately, under \nthe current Democratic majority, committee work has been marginalized, \nas the majority has too often bypassed committees in the legislative \nprocess.\n  And on the Senate floor, the twin hallmarks of the Senate, the right \nto debate and the right to amend legislation, are barely recognizable: \nto an unprecedented extent the majority has moved to shut off debate on \na matter as soon as the Senate has begun to take up the matter, and it \nhas blocked Members--of both parties--from offering their legislative \nideas for the body to consider.\n  The proposal we developed addressed a concern of the majority--\nnamely, the ability of a majority to take up a matter--but it \nconditioned its ability to bring that matter to conclusion by giving \nthe minority the right to have the Senate consider at least two \namendments of the minority's choosing--without any requirement of \ngermaneness--as well as two amendments of the majority's choosing.\n  The minority, in fact, would get to offer the first amendment under \nthis procedure. And while the majority would get to offer the last \namendment, all eight of the Members who developed this idea--four \nRepublicans and four Democrats--agreed that the majority could not use \nits final amendment to strike or eliminate legislative language, if \nany, that the Senate adopted from one of the minority's amendments.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is correct. And I want to underscore that the \namendment construct we developed is not to be used as a ceiling to \nlimit the ability of Members of the majority or the minority to offer \njust two amendments per side. Rather, we intend it to be used as an \namendment floor--a minimum guarantee of amendments--that would serve to \nstart the amendment process so as many Members as possible could \nparticipate in that process. Having a robust amendment process, \nespecially on legislation of major consequence, is how the Senate has \ntraditionally operated. It is something that has been sorely lacking \nfor the last several years. And it is something that, when it has \noccurred, has invariably led to legislative achievement. It is for the \npurpose of strengthening the right to amend legislation that we helped \ndraft the new procedure of a majority motion to proceed. If the \nmajority instead begins to use this procedure to limit the minority to \njust two amendments before seeking to bring consideration of a bill to \na close, then we would view that as an abuse of this procedure. It \nwould break faith with us who worked in good faith. Under those \ncircumstances, we would oppose cloture on the bill and would urge that \nour colleagues do the same.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I strongly agree with the understanding of my friend, \nthe senior Senator from Arizona. I, too, would oppose cloture on a \nmatter if the majority abused the motion to proceed set out in the \norder by using that procedure as the high-water mark for the \nconsideration of amendments, rather than as a starting point for a \nrobust amendment process.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I agree with the views expressed by my good friends \nfrom Arizona and Tennessee. They and I, and our Democratic colleagues, \nworked in good faith on the concepts embodied in the order the Senate \nhas just adopted. I am hopeful that the majority will use the \nprocedures in this order in harmony with our good intentions. If not, I \nwill oppose cloture on legislation or nominations.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  We are going to have one more vote tonight. The next vote will be on \nSandy and matters relating to Sandy on Monday night at 5:30.\n  I have spoken with the soon-to-be chair of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and Ranking Member Corker. We are going to have a vote after \nthe business meeting sometime on Tuesday on the new Secretary of State.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to S. Res. 16.\n  Mr. CORKER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nappears to be a sufficient second.

Mr. President, 2 years ago my friend the Republican leader \nand I expressed our intention that the funding allocation adopted for \nthe 112th Congress would serve for that and future Congresses. Over the \nprior 20 years, the apportionment of committee funding had gone from a \nstraight two-thirds for majority and one-third for minority during the \n1990s, regardless of the size of the majority and minority, to biannual \nnegotiations during the following decade. The new funding allocation \nfor Senate committees was based on the party division of the Senate, \nwith 10 percent of the total majority and minority salary baseline \ngoing to the majority for administrative expenses. However, regardless \nof the party division of the Senate, the minority share of the majority \nand minority salary baseline will never be less than 40 percent, and \nthe majority share will never exceed 60 percent. This approach met our \nneeds for the last Congress, and I would like to see it continue.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I, too, would like to continue this \napproach for the 113th and future Congresses. It serves the interest of \nthe Senate and the public by helping to retain core committee staff \nwith institutional knowledge, regardless of which party is in the \nmajority. We made a transition in the last Congress to restore special \nreserves to its historic purpose, but appropriations cuts prevented \nspecial reserves from being funded. To the extent possible, we should \ntry to fund special reserves in order to be able to assist committees \nthat face urgent, unanticipated, nonrecurring needs. We know that we \nwill continue to face tight budgets for the foreseeable future, and we \nhave to bring funding authorizations more in line with our actual \nresources while ensuring that committees e able to fulfill their \nresponsibilities. I look forward to continuing to work with my friend \nthe majority leader to accomplish this.\n  Mr. REID. I thank my friend the Republican leader and ask unanimous \nconsent that a joint leadership letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Joint Leadership Letter\n\n       We mutually commit to the following for the 113th Congress:\n       The budgets of the Committees of the Senate, including \n     Joint and Special Committees, and all other subgroups, shall \n     be apportioned to reflect the ratio of the Senate as of this \n     date, including an additional ten percent (10%) from the \n     majority and minority salary baseline to be allocated to the \n     Chairman for administrative expenses, to be determined by the \n     Rules Committee.\n       Special Reserves has been restored to its historic purpose. \n     Requests for funding will only be considered when submitted \n     by a Committee Chairman and Ranking Member for unanticipated, \n     non-recurring needs. Such requests shall be granted only upon \n     the approval of the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Rules \n     Committee.\n       Funds for Committee expenses shall be available to each \n     Chairman consistent with Senate rules and practices of the \n     112th Congress.\n       The Chairman and Ranking Member of any Committee may, by \n     mutual consent, modifying the apportionment of Committee \n     funding and office space.\n       The division of Committee office space shall be \n     commensurate with this funding agreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/24/senate-section/article/S274-3", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S274-S275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO REV. JOHNNY SCOTT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Reverend Johnny Scott has announced his \nretirement after 31 years as president of the NAACP East St. Louis \nChapter. As a faith leader, businessman, civil rights activist, husband \nand father, Rev. Scott has dedicated his life to justice and equality. \nHe is a man who cares about making sure things are done right. East St. \nLouis--my hometown--is a better place for Reverend Scott's years of \nservice.\n  A native of Indianola, MS, Johnny Scott went to Mildred Louise \nBusiness\n\n[[Page S275]]\n\nCollege in East St. Louis and later LaSalle University in Chicago. He \ncompleted his theological studies at the Midwest Theological Seminary.\n  Rev. Scott was working as bookkeeper by trade, when he was approached \nabout serving as president of the East St. Louis Chapter of the NAACP \nin 1982. He accepted, but didn't expect to be in the role for more than \na year. At the time, he believed that it ``was not his type of work.''\n  It turned out to be exactly his type of work. He kept his office \ndoors open 8 hours a day, 6 days a week for the following 32 years.\n  While he was with the NAACP, Reverend Scott led the effort to create \nopportunity for and prevent indignities against people of color. He \nmade sure there was scholarship support for thousands of students over \nthe years he served. He played a key role in the U.S. Department of \nJustice's settlement with the City of Belleville over racial bias in \nhiring. He helped with sensitivity training for local police. He played \na part in mediating disputes around racial epithets used in public. And \nhe represented communities of color on issues from cross burnings to \nState control of local schools. It is no surprise that membership in \nthe NAACP Chapter in East St. Louis grew under his leadership.\n  On behalf of a grateful community, I thank the Reverend Scott, his \nwife Gretta Scott and his three children. He stood and gave voice to a \ncommunity through 30 years of progress and setbacks, celebration and \ninjury. His leadership has touched East St. Louis deeply. It has been \nan honor to work alongside Reverend Scott, and Loretta and I wish him \nand his family the best as he opens the next chapter in his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/24/senate-section/article/S275-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S275-S276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOE HUBBARD\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

But the Irish priest who baptized him said he \nshould have a good Irish name and so declared him Joseph Patrick, after \nSt. Joseph the Worker. It turned out to be a fitting choice because Joe \nHubbard has spent nearly his entire life doing the Lord's work.\n  He started 50 years ago as a volunteer with the St. Vincent DePaul \nSociety in East St. Louis. Joe was 20 years old back then. He was \nworking as a bookkeeper for the East Side Levee and Sanitary District \nto help support his widowed mother, but his real joy was helping the \npoor. Every minute that Joe wasn't working, he was volunteering with \nSt. Vincent DePaul.\n  After a while Joe quit his job to volunteer full-time to help the \npeople he calls ``God's broken people,'' the poor, the homeless and the \nfriendless of East St. Louis. He did this for a decade.\n  In 1972, about a dozen priests, nuns and lay leaders in the Roman \nCatholic Diocese of Belleville drafted a petition that was later signed \nby every priest then serving East St. Louis. The petition asked the \nbishop of the diocese to create a small salary for Joe so that he could \ncontinue his good works under the auspices of the Catholic Church. Thus \nwas born in 1973 a new social service agency, Catholic Urban Programs \nor CUP, as it is sometimes called--with Joe Hubbard as coordinator and \nsole employee.\n  CUP's purpose is to perform the works of mercy that Jesus asked of \nhis followers when he told them, ``For I was hungry and you gave me \nfood, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, a stranger and you welcomed \nme, naked and you clothed me, ill and you cared for me, in prison and \nyou visited me.''\n  CUP helps ``the in-between people.'' It fills needs that other \norganizations, public and private, don't address. In the beginning \nCUP's services included emergency help, prison ministries and advocacy \nand guardianships for people who could not manage their own affairs.\n  Over the decades its programs have grown to include shelters for \nhomeless women, children and families in East St. Louis, a food pantry \nand a neighborhood law office to provide poor people with legal \nassistance. Another program, the Griffin Center, offers tutoring and \nafterschool programs for more than 450 children living in four housing \nprojects in East St. Louis.\n  On any given day, Joe might give someone money for bus tickets, visit \na lonely person in a nursing home, tell stories to children at a day \ncare center, find housing for a family that has been evicted, serve \nmeals at a soup kitchen, attend a funeral and sit up all night at the \nbedside of someone who is dying and alone.\n  Above all, what CUP and Joe Hubbard offer is unconditional love. Joe \ndoes not hesitate to do work that others might consider too menial or \ndirty. He will mop up after a sick alcoholic. Twenty years ago, Joe and \nhis right-hand man at CUP, Gerry Hasenstab, found a man living in his \ncar. He was in his 50s and dying. He had open sores and maggots in his \narms. His only wish was not to die dirty, in a car. Joe and Gerry got \nhim admitted to a hospital to spend his last hours in a clean bed.\n  Support for the programs comes from churches and individuals, \nincluding many who have been helped by CUP agencies in the past. One \nwoman gave part of her first paycheck to CUP after she got a job. A \nwidow paid CUP back for the money it gave her to help with her \nhusband's funeral.\n  After the Mississippi River overflowed its banks in 1993, CUP gave a \nfarmer $400 to buy seed and school supplies. That farmer has sent CUP \n$100 every quarter--$400 a year every year for the last 20 years.\n  Joe's compassion for others is partly rooted in his own family's \nmisfortune.\n  Joe is the youngest of four children of Edward and Olga Hubbard. His \ndad was a steamfitter. When Joe was in grade school his father was \nbadly injured on the job. He lived with constant wrenching pain for 8 \nyears before dying of cancer.\n  The loss of his father's income hit Joe's family hard. Men and women \nfrom the St. Vincent de Paul Society brought food and coal to help the \nHubbards survive. Joe said those volunteers inspired him.\n  He said, ``I remember the dedication they showed, the way they \nreached out and helped others in need through their love of Christ. And \nI appreciated that they did it in a quiet manner that enabled people to \nkeep their dignity. Their love of God and love of people inspired me to \nwant to do God's work, too.'' And that is what Joe Hubbard has done his \nentire life.\n  In early November, after 40 years of selfless service, Joe Hubbard \nannounced that he was stepping down as coordinator of CUP. At 70, Joe \nis starting to get a little tired. He's got diabetes, high blood \npressure and bad feet, and the arthritis that has pained him his whole \nlife is getting worse.\n  On Jan. 1, Gerry Hasenstab, Joe's right hand man at CUP for the last \n36 years ago, took over as the agency's new coordinator. But don't \nthink for a minute that Joe Hubbard is finished helping people. Joe \nalso still maintains the Belleville Diocese's two cemeteries. And he \nstill volunteers regularly for the St. Vincent DePaul Society and has a \nsmall office in their building, which is right next door to CUP.\n  When CUP started, they got about two dozen calls a day for help. Now \nthey get about 60 calls a day. Last year, CUP programs helped more than \n24,000 people in East St. Louis and St. Clair County.\n  In a letter announcing his decision to step down, Joe wrote: ``As I \nsit here and realize how the times have changed over the past 40 years \nof Catholic Urban Programs' existence, I am both amazed and \ndiscouraged. Technology has made our lives so much easier and efficient \nin so many ways. High-efficiency furnaces lower our utility bills. But \nif a family can't pay for the gas or electric, they are useless.''\n  Technological advances are great for some, Joe added. But they've \nmade life even harder for the needy because nonskilled jobs they used \nto count on to make a living have nearly disappeared.\n  A couple years ago, Joe noticed violets blooming on a hill near a \nburned-out house. He thought it was a sign of hope.\n  He said: ``You have to be a believer to be a survivor.''\n  Joe's belief is that God is in every person and that it is not just a \nresponsibility but a privilege to help those he calls ``God's broken \npeople.'' That belief has defined his life and it has made\n\n[[Page S276]]\n\nlife kinder and better for countless others in East St. Louis and St. \nClair County.\n  Besides helping people, Joe's other great joy in life is eating good \nmeals with good friends in small, locally owned restaurants. On \nSaturday, about 400 of Joe's friends will gather at one of Joe's \nfavorites, Fischer's Restaurant in Belleville, to celebrate his \nretirement as head of CUP. More than that, they will celebrate Joe's \nunconditional love and unbreakable faith. I want to add my thanks to \ntheirs.\n  In closing, I would like to read a short editorial about Joe that ran \nin this past Sunday's Belleville News-Democrat.\n\n       Martin Luther King Jr. would have considered Joe Hubbard a \n     kindred spirit. King and Hubbard both spent their careers \n     championing the cause of social justice. King focused on the \n     spirit while Hubbard helped provide for people's physical \n     needs in East St. Louis and throughout the metro-east. \n     Hubbard is retiring after leading Catholic Urban Programs for \n     40 years.\n       King considered service to others to be a measure of \n     greatness: ``You don't have to have a college degree to \n     serve. . . . You only need a heart full of grace. A soul \n     generated by love.''\n       Hubbard has the sort of heart and soul that King \n     envisioned. Even in retirement, we have no doubt that he will \n     continue his life of service to the poor of our area.\n       Thank you to Hubbard. May the rest of us learn from his \n     example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/24/senate-section/article/S276-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RUSS SULLIVAN\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Benjamin Franklin once said:\n\n       The noblest question in the world is, ``What good may I do \n     in it?''\n\n  I rise today to honor the service of Russ Sullivan, who was a \ndistinguished member of my staff for more than a decade until his \ndeparture earlier this month.\n  Most of us come to the Senate because it is a place where, despite \nthe many challenges, there remains a capacity to do great good. And too \noften people forget that. But Russ Sullivan never did. Every day he \ncame to work in the Senate and for the Finance Committee, Russ led by \nasking our staff how can we do good here? And how can we make this \ncountry and the world a better place?\n  Russ's leadership proves that by working to do good and working \ntogether to find solutions we can get things done.\n  Russ is well known here on Capitol Hill. He has earned the respect \nand admiration of Senators and staff on both sides of the aisle.\n  Russ's political career started early. He was twice elected Student \nBody President--once at McClellan High School and again at Baylor \nUniversity. He had his sights set on a life of public service in \nWashington. In 1995, he became tax counsel and Legislative Director to \nSenator Bob Graham. In 1999, he moved to the Finance Committee staff to \nserve as Chief Tax Counsel to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n  Russ stayed on at the committee when I became chairman in 2001. \nThrough his proven abilities, he was promoted to the staff director of \nmy team in 2004.\n  During the past 8 years, Russ led the Finance Committee staff to pass \nmajor bills that give real help to families across the country. We cut \ntaxes for middle-class families and small businesses. We defended \nSocial Security from privatization. We opened new markets to U.S. \nexports to create more jobs here at home. We passed health reform to \nbring top-notch, affordable care to millions of Americans. And we are \ncurrently at work on a plan to modernize the U.S. tax code to \nreinvigorate the economy and create jobs.\n  True to his style, Russ did all this without a hint of partisanship. \nHe maintained a laser-like focus on solutions. That focus made the \nFinance Committee more productive, and it strengthened the bills we \npassed.\n  I know there are many people here--including my colleagues in the \nSenate--who share my deep respect for Russ. Senator Reid once called \nRuss ``instrumental'' and a ``problem-solver.''\n  Former Senator Blanche Lincoln once said, ``We could not do our job \nwithout him,'' and boy, is she right. Russ has earned the trust of his \ncolleagues and the admiration of his staff.\n  People who meet with Russ are often surprised to see his desk tucked \nbetween filing cabinets and boxes right alongside interns, assistants \nand law clerks. Russ is a true team player.\n  It would be impossible to honor Russ without recognizing his public \nservice off of Capitol Hill. In his life outside the Senate, Russ truly \nembodies the question of ``What good may I do?'' For many years, he has \nbeen a mentor to young people, making a difference in hundreds of \nlives.\n  Several years ago, Russ became a foster parent and legal guardian to \nhelp teenage boys secure a better future. Since then, he has been a \nlegal or designated guardian for 18 teenage boys. Thirteen are \ncurrently in college, and several more have already earned degrees. One \nof Russ's sons, Abu Kamara, spoke to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette when \nit profiled Russ in 2010. Abu said, ``[Russ] kept telling me, keep your \nhead up.' He got people to tutor me because my grades weren't good. He \nkept me focused and made sure I was doing the right thing. He's the \nreason I graduated from high school.''\n  Abu is the first person from his family to go to college. And there \nare several other young men who could tell you similar stories.\n  Last summer, Russ lost one of his sons in a tragic incident. AJ \nHassan, who was a student at the University of West Virginia, was \nassaulted one night and suffered a brain injury. Russ rushed to be at \nAJ's side, but AJ soon slipped into a coma.\n  Washington was in the midst of a contentious deficit reduction \ndebate. Somehow, Russ spent months juggling work, AJ's medical \ncondition, and the needs of his other boys. I will never know where he \nfound the time and energy to have all these bases covered so well. But \nAJ's condition wavered, and there were complications. AJ passed away in \nJuly.\n  There was an outpouring of support for Russ and his family. Russ's \nfriends and colleagues wanted to show him the same kind of caring and \nsupport he always shows others.\n  Russ continues to mentor and help young people, and he is still \nchanging lives. He helped found the Capital Area REACH program, an \norganization dedicated to helping young people find success.\n  REACH connects students with job training, internships, tutors and \nscholarships. Some of these kids come from tough backgrounds. But REACH \nhelps them find a pathway toward a stable and successful life.\n  In the spirit of extending the same opportunities he had early in his \ncareer, Russ started a program for interns, law clerks and fellows to \nserve on the Finance Committee. It now has hundreds of alumni who got \ntheir first shot at work in Congress thanks to Russ.\n  That includes a large number of people who have moved up the ladder \non my staff. Russ fostered a culture where hard work gets the \nrecognition it deserves.\n  Like any great staffer, Russ would not leave me without an ace \nreplacement to take on his role. We have a deep bench on the Finance \nCommittee, and I am thrilled to have Amber Cottle as my new Staff \nDirector. She has been on my staff for 6 years, most recently as my \nChief Trade Counsel. Amber is a pro. She is whip-smart. And she is a \nmaster negotiator.\n  Russ leaves some big shoes to fill. But Amber is more than capable \nand, as she likes to say, her shoes are much more stylish. I know \nwithout a doubt that she will do a great job.\n  There is one more thing I would like to say about Russ. Rule number \none in my office is to remember the people we serve. They are hard-\nworking people back in Montana and around the country, and it is our \njob to help them out. Russ never forgot that. A southern boy, Russ \nadopted Montana as his home State. He thinks of the people of Montana \nas his neighbors. And Russ always rolled up his sleeves and got \nresults. I truly appreciate all he has done.\n  I know I am not alone in saying: thank you, Russ, for all your \nservice all your hard work over the years. You did good, Russ.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/24/senate-section/article/S276-2", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S276-S277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING THEODORE GARDNER\n\n Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of \nTheodore ``Ted'' Harbison Gardner. He was a devoted husband, father, a \nproud veteran of the U.S. Navy and a consummate\n\n[[Page S277]]\n\ncommunity volunteer whose contributions will have long lasting impacts \nin the Greater Cincinnati community, and beyond.\n  Born and raised in Hillsboro, OR, Mr. Gardner was the only child of \nVesey Gardner, a prominent community leader and a lumber company owner, \nand Ruth Gardner, a popular singer. He is a graduate of Oregon State \nUniversity.\n  A proud and decorated veteran of World War II, Mr. Gardner withdrew \nfrom college to serve in the U.S. Navy the day after the attack on \nPearl Harbor. He survived one of the largest and most brutal battles in \nhistory--The Battle off Samar--earning his unit aboard the USS Kalinin \nBay the Presidential Unit Citation, one of the Navy's highest honors.\n  Ted was an active member of the U.S. Navy League, The Hornet \nFoundation, and was a member of the advisory board of the Warbird \nMuseum. He was passionate about the importance of oral history and \npersonally interviewed over 150 World War II veterans and recorded and \nvideotaped their stories for the Cincinnati Public Library and for the \nU.S. Library of Congress.\n  Following his graduation from Oregon State University, Mr. Gardner \ngot a job with a lumber distributor in Columbus, OH and then later \nmoved to Cincinnati, where he and his wife, Naomi, raised their three \nchildren. Mr. Gardner changed careers in the 1970s and worked as a \nlocal art dealer until he retired.\n  Ted was a 30-year member of the Cincinnati Rotary Club, where he was \ninvolved in programs to welcome international students studying at area \nuniversities and where he participated in events benefiting children \nwith disabilities and youth in government.\n  A talented musician, Mr. Gardner shared his vocal talents as a member \nof the Rotary chorus, the choir of the Church of the Redeemer and the \nCincinnati May Festival Chorus, where he served as a board member. For \n25 years, he sang all four verses of ``Taps'' in his rich bass voice on \nVeterans Day at the public library.\n  Ted was an historian, a lover of art and literature, a musician and \nan avid sports enthusiast. He is greatly missed, and his extraordinary \nlegacy and giving spirit will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/24/senate-section/article/S277-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PUTTING OUR VETERANS BACK TO WORK\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as incoming chairman of the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, one of my top priorities will be to \nevaluate and improve the training and employment programs afforded to \nour Nation's servicemembers and veterans.\n  Every day, far too many young veterans face the harsh realities of \nunemployment. These are brave men and women who have put their lives on \nthe line defending our country who now struggle to find employment and \nprovide for their families. The Putting Our Veterans Back to Work Act \nof 2013 will ensure we provide them with much needed support.\n  This legislation would reauthorize several of the transition, \nretraining, and employment services created by the VOW to Hire Heroes \nAct of 2011. That legislation is making a real impact in the lives of \ncountless veterans by providing them with the training opportunities \nthey need in order to secure meaningful employment.\n  Too often I hear from veterans that the government provides great \nresources for them to find training and employment opportunities, but \nthey are not sure where to start in order to tap into those resources. \nThose Departments charged with helping to provide veterans with \nemployment assistance must make certain that they are conducting \nappropriate outreach so that veterans know where to turn when they need \nhelp.\n  Assisting in this effort, the Putting Our Veterans Back to Work Act \nwould also provide veterans with a new, unified, online employment \nportal for veterans seeking information regarding employment and job \ntraining resources. This online portal would make it easier for \nveterans to take advantage of the services and opportunities available \nto them.\n  At a time when 85 percent of law enforcement agencies were forced to \nreduce their budget, according to a 2011 survey by the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, answering the Nation's public safety \nneeds is also a priority. That is why this legislation would provide \npotential employers with additional grants for first responder hiring \nand re-hiring needs.\n  This legislation would also direct agency heads to favorably consider \ncontractors that employ a significant number of veterans for all \ncontracts over $25 million. This provision would ensure that \ncontractors, who are doing their part to help veterans find good paying \njobs, have a competitive advantage when doing business with the Federal \ngovernment.\n  Finally, the Putting Our Veterans Back to Work Act would strengthen \nour commitment to protecting the employment rights of servicemembers \nand veterans. These commonsense provisions would build upon existing \nlaw by providing the government with additional tools to carry out its \nobligation to safeguard veterans' employment rights. This legislation \nwould enable the Attorney General to investigate and file suit against \na pattern or practice in violation of the Uniformed Services Employment \nand Reemployment Rights Act and to issue limited civil investigative \ndemands for relevant documentary material. It would also allow Federal \nagencies to suspend and debar contractors who repeatedly violate the \nemployment and reemployment rights of members of the uniformed \nservices. Finally, it would provide the Special Counsel with authority \nto subpoena attendance, testimony, and documents from Federal employees \nand agencies in order to carry out investigations related to USERRA.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of great training and employment \nprograms available to veterans. This legislation would strengthen such \nprograms and make certain that veterans have and maintain access to \nthose programs. That is what our veterans are entitled to and that is \nwhat we must deliver.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/24/senate-section/article/S277-2", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S277-S278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  RECOGNIZING MARILYN AND ALAN BERGMAN\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

I \nlook forward to paying tribute to them at the New West Symphony's event \nin Los Angeles.\n  Alan and Marilyn Bergman are two of the world's best-known and best-\nloved lyricists.

CARL EVERETT DRAKE, SR.\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Dr. Carl Everett Drake, Sr. \ndied peacefully of natural causes at his home in Sacramento Thursday \nevening. He was 99. Carl Drake was born on August 21, 1913 in Neptune, \nNJ, the second son of James and Lucy Bingham Drake. Carl was educated \nin the public schools where he was an outstanding student and even \nbetter multisport athlete. His State high school long jump mark of 21' \n10'' stood for over 25 years. His talents brought him to the attention \nof coaches from Morgan State College in Baltimore, MD, the top ranked \ncollege football program available to African American players in the \n1930s. His combination of size, speed, and ferocity won him a starting \nspot on the championship football team. At 6' 1'' and 205 pounds--huge \nat the time--he was a bruising, standout guard, playing both offense \nand defense. The team went undefeated for his entire career. He was \nteam captain, had the honor of wearing jersey No. 1, and held the team \nball in the national championship photos.\n  At Morgan he was active in several student organizations, including \nthe Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, which he joined in 1933. He began \ndating an attractive and studious coed who worked as the dean's \nsecretary, even joining the glee club to demonstrate to her his \n``softer'' side. Carl and Beatrice Hayes were married in September \n1937. They settled in Baltimore, she began work as a social worker, and \nhe, having left school after football a few credits short of \ngraduation, took a job in the post office. Professional football was \nnot available, but his training made him valuable at handling mail \nsacks. Two children, Carl Jr., 1939, and Beatrice, 1940, followed, \nalong with a chronic back injury that led to a job shift that relied \nmore on his college schooling than his strength.\n  Ruled out of active military service due to his back injury, he re-\nenrolled in school to complete his college degree, and in 1944, at the \nurging of Bea, applied to medical school. He could not attend the \nsegregated University of Maryland, but under the ``separate but equal'' \nconcept of Jim Crow laws, the State of Maryland instead paid his \ntuition to attend Meharry Medical College, in Nashville, TN, one of the \ntwo medical schools in the county to educate more than the occasional \nperson of color.\n  He moved to Nashville to begin study, working an 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. \ngraveyard shift as a hospital orderly to save enough money to send for \nhis wife and family, which he was able to do by 1946. He finished \nMeharry in 1949 and moved to New York City to begin internship at \nHarlem Hospital. He had wanted to return to Baltimore, but the city \nhospital there paid interns $15 per month with free room. Harlem paid \n$50 per month, enough to rent a one bedroom apartment for the family. \nAfter internship and a new baby--Michael, 1950--the family moved across \nthe George Washington Bridge to Englewood, NJ. Carl began his life as a \nworking physician with a grueling schedule that consisted of steady \nemployment in the ER at Harlem Hospital, a graveyard shift, 11 p.m. to \n7 a.m., followed by a junior partnership in a local New York \nphysician's office from 9 to noon, then home to Jersey to sleep, dinner \nat 6, and then a few private patients seen in a room converted to a \nmakeshift medical office in the house until 9, before returning to work \nfor the 11 p.m. shift in Harlem. When asked later about this level of \ncommitment he replied that he was mainly ``grateful for a chance to \nactually work.''\n  This schedule was of course unsustainable, and a fascination with the \nnewly emerging field of psychiatry led him to, at 40, begin training in \npsychiatry at Graystone State Hospital. During residency he continued \nhis home office practice after dinner to help support a family that had \ngrown to four children with the addition of Barry in 1952. In 1957, \nafter completing residency he looked nationally, and made the bold \ndecision to move to Sacramento to join a newly burgeoning State mental \nhealth system. Prior to this, no one in the family had ever been west \nof Tennessee. Arriving in Sacramento in July 1958, he worked for the \nState during the day, and as had always been the case set up a small \nprivate practice in rented space in the evenings. Financial obligations \nincluded supporting a son in college and stiff mortgage payments on a \nmodern house in an upscale, and for the first time integrated, \nneighborhood.\n  In Sacramento Carl and Bea joined a small circle of middle class \nAfrican Americans who had also moved west to make a new life. A handful \nof doctors, lawyers, a defense contractor, and a funeral home owner \nformed a social group anchored by the ``Couples Club,'' which met on \nSaturdays once a month for a rotating house party. There were also \ncivic activities like the Lions Club, competitive chess, and the NAACP, \nas well as the local chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha, Inc. The names of \nthese pioneers: Colley, Jones, Morris, Morrissey, Nance, Rutland, \nStewart, Trent, West, and a few others, are now a part of Sacramento \nhistory. In 1967 a reduction in State supported mental health services \naffected clinics, including the Sacramento branch where Carl was chief \nof psychiatry. The new Medicare and Medicaid programs made private \npractice more viable for physicians caring for low income patients. He \nconverted to full time private practice, and the late 1960s and 1970s \nbecame a time of relative prosperity. A pool was added to the backyard, \nand Carl learned, for the first time, to swim. He remained health \nconscious, and he and Bea were in the pool everyday from May to October \nuntil they were both in their 90s.\n  With the children finally grown and on their own Carl and Bea \ntravelled--Alaska, Mexico, Hawaii, and Scandinavia were highlights--\nentertained friends, and watched their ever expanding cadre of \ngrandchildren and great grandchildren grow. Bea retired in 1975, but \nCarl kept his active practice going, seeing patients five days a week \nuntil he was 90. Bea suffered from mild macular degeneration and \nprogressive Alzheimer's disease, ultimately requiring full time \nsupervision. Carl closed his practice--regretfully--to come home to \ncare for her. He moved from many patients to just one. They continued \nto play backgammon as long as she could, exercised in the pool, and \nwhen that was no longer safe took walks around the courtyard, until Bea \npassed away in March 2008. They had been married for just over 70 \nyears.\n  In the months following Bea's death, Carl, now 94, began a series of \nhome refurbishing projects including a new roof and painting inside and \nout. His oldest grandson John, a professional house painter, came north \nto help, and ultimately moved in to help manage the house and yard. In \nAugust 2008 Carl renewed his medical license and his driver's license \nas he put it ``just in case.'' He became active in his fraternity once \nagain. He did a few legal consultations in 2009, and then with John to \ntype reports on the new computer, began seeing patients again, on a \nregular basis, working for the State of California as he had when he \nmoved to Sacramento in 1958, this time doing disability evaluations. He \npulled the office shingle bearing the name ``Carl E. Drake, Sr. MD'' \nfrom the garage--the same shingle used at the house in New Jersey 60 \nyears ago--and mounted it near the back door. The kitchen table became \nhis consultation office. He scheduled a light but steady stream of \npatients, three or four a week. He saw his last patient on December 12, \n2012, before taking a break for the holidays. New visits were on the \nbooks for January 2013.\n  On December 26, all four of his children, along with five \ngrandchildren and two daughters-in-law, visited without fanfare for a \ntraditional post-Christmas gathering. He was in great spirits, holding \ncourt, albeit with less energy than usual. On December 27, after a \nlight dinner, he walked into the living room to sit in his favorite \neasy chair and watch a few bowl games. He dozed off, never to wake \nagain.\n  Dr. Carl Drake left this life as he lived it, with great dignity and \ngrace. He came through the Depression, was an All-American athlete, \neducated himself, raised a family, and was an active working \npsychiatrist until the very last days of a life that spanned the 20th \ncentury and more. He was calm, open, and cheerful, always. His physical \nstature was imposing, but his gentle steadfastness and serenity were \nthe traits that made him a joy to be with. He never raised his voice; \nhe never needed to. He was universally admired, respected, and loved. \nHe is survived by 4 children, 11 grandchildren, 17\n\n[[Page S279]]\n\ngreat grandchildren, 16 great-great grandchildren, and thousands of \npatients. He lived to see his 100th Christmas; he leaves the world a \nbetter place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/24/senate-section/article/S279-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HONORING SILVERIO \n                             CUARESMA, SR.\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life 2LT \nSilverio Cuaresma, Sr., whose passing on January 20, 2013, has brought \ngreat sadness to the Silver State. As a member of the World War II \nMighty Five Nevadans and the State's oldest unrecognized Filipino-\nAmerican World War II veteran, Mr. Cuaresma dedicated his life to \nhonoring Filipino veterans for their sacrifices. I am grateful for his \nservice to our country and advocacy on behalf of our heroes. While in \nthe Senate, I will continue fighting to guarantee that all veterans and \ntheir families are properly thanked for their sacrifices.\n  As one of the Mighty Five, Mr. Cuaresma fought tirelessly to secure \nproper military recognition and compensation for our Nation's nearly \n24,000 Filipino World War II veterans. We must continue the fight to \nensure that Filipino veterans like Mr. Cuaresma are honored for their \nsacrifices. That is why I introduced the Filipino Veterans Fairness \nAct. This bill would establish a process for Filipinos who have fought \nalongside the U.S. military during World War II to work with military \nhistorians to determine eligibility for military benefits. I believe we \nhave a responsibility to ensure that individuals who served honorably \nalongside U.S. troops are recognized for their contributions to our \nNation.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Cuaresma's family and friends \nduring this difficult time. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncelebrating the life of an honorable man who was devoted to providing \njustice for our Nation's heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/24/senate-section/article/S279-2", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SUE EVERHART\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President. I would like to honor in the \nRecord Ms. Sue Everhart of Marietta, GA. Sue is a dear friend of mine \nwho is one of the hardest working individuals in Georgia politics. In \nfact, Sue was elected chairman of the Georgia Republican Party in 2008 \nand re-elected in 2009 and again in 2011, making her the first chairman \nto serve three consecutive terms. In 2009, Sue was also chosen as one \nof ten women in the United States to be honored as a Woman of \nAchievement by the Republican National Committee.\n  Sue is an effective leader who has worked tirelessly to elect \nRepublicans in the State of Georgia. In 2010, her efforts over the \nyears came to a crescendo when Republicans swept the State, winning \nevery statewide contest. In fact, Sue has been instrumental in my \npolitical campaigns, and I am forever grateful for her support \nthroughout the years.\n  Although Sue will be ending her successful run as chairman of the \nGeorgia Republican Party in May of this year, I am sure that this will \nnot be the end of her involvement in Georgia politics.

Mr. Tindell served 30 years in uniform and for over \n10 years in Federal civil service as the director of the Commander's \nAction Group and the Chief of Legislative Affairs for Air Force Space \nCommand. He has been an enduring presence and a subject-matter expert \nfor all congressional matters related to Air Force space and cyberspace \nissues and has facilitated countless congressional interactions with \nHeadquarters Air Force Space Command and its numerous subordinate \ncenters, wings and units.\n  Air Force Major Command Legislative Liaisons facilitate communication \nbetween their commands and Congress, effectively bridging our \norganizational cultures and promoting clear and open communication. \nThese professionals require in depth knowledge of congressional \nprocedures, committee structures and the legislative process. They also \nmust have detailed understanding of the missions, challenges and \norganizational structures of the commands they represent. My office \ndepends heavily on the rapport we have with our military liaisons for \ntimely information and candid dialogue.\n  During his tenure as a legislative liaison, Mr. Tindell enhanced the \nAir Force Space Command mission by delivering space, missile and \ncyberspace capabilities to the U.S. armed forces and its warfighting \ncommands. He was the architect of Space Command's legislative game \nplan, which coordinated vital communications concerning the command's \nspace and cyberspace programs. He prepared countless pages of testimony \nand orchestrated hundreds of congressional notifications and visits, \nincluding many for me and my staff to our bases throughout the Colorado \nFront Range.\n  Mr. Tindell leaves an indelible mark on Air Force Space Command. His \ninstitutional knowledge and savvy analysis of legislative activity will \nbe difficult to replace; however, he can take great pride, satisfaction \nand confidence in knowing that his legacy will endure through those he \nhas mentored over the years. Mr. Tindell has exemplified the best of \nthe U.S. Air Force.\n  On behalf of all Coloradans, I thank Mr. Steven Tindell for his many \nyears of faithful, selfless service, and I offer warm congratulations \non the occasion of his retirement. May he and his wife, Nancy, enjoy a \nvery bright future as they begin this new chapter in their \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/24/senate-section/article/S279-4", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ROSALIND GRAY\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI.

His time in education has seen him serve as assistant \nprincipal, principal, and Assistant Superintendent of the Catholic \nDiocese of Baton Rouge, a position he has held since 1999. In 1997, he \nwas presented with the Distinguished Secondary Educator award and also \nreceived the 1999 Saint Michael the Archangel High School Warrior \naward.\n  The National Conference of Catholic Bishops stated, ``Education is \none of the most important ways by which the Church fulfills its \ncommitment to the dignity of the person and building of community.''\n  In Louisiana, our Catholic schools maintain high academic standards, \nfoster a healthy learning environment for\n\n[[Page S280]]\n\nstudents, and encourage family involvement in the ongoing education of \nchildren. Mr. Scimeca has promoted these ideals with extraordinary \nleadership, professionalism and a vision to provide our children with \nthe tools they will need to go out in to the world and become valuable \nmembers of society and their community.\n  His efforts to bring together adults and children, educators and \nvolunteers, business leaders, and elected officials in a learning \nenvironment highlights his ability to impart comprehensive curriculums \nthat stress the importance of education as part of the mission of the \nCatholic Church and the importance of community in shaping our young \npeople.\n  While I know he will be missed after his departure later this year, I \nthank Mr. Scimeca for his selfless commitment to the education of our \nchildren, his outstanding contributions to the Catholic Diocese of \nBaton Rouge and the State of Louisiana, and extend to him our best \nwishes for continued success and happiness in all of his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/24/senate-section/article/S280-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO CSM JOHN McDONOUGH\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

He \nwas then assigned as an artilleryman in Battery A, 1st Battalion, 103rd \nField Artillery. He quickly became an invaluable member of the Guard's \nfield artillery team and went on to serve in a variety of positions, \nincluding cannon crewman, assistant gunner, gunner, howitzer section \nchief, gunnery sergeant, intelligence sergeant, first sergeant, and \noperations sergeant major.\n  Over the years, Command Sergeant Major McDonough received numerous \nawards commending his superior service, and he was eventually selected \nto be the State command sergeant major, the highest noncommissioned \nrank in the Rhode Island National Guard. In this role, Command Sergeant \nMajor McDonough represented all enlisted soldiers in command, and \nserved as the principal enlisted adviser to the adjutant general.

The command sergeant major has taken on a new \nendeavor to improve the lives of veterans as the director of Supportive \nServices for Operation Stand Down, an organization that works to combat \nhomelessness among veterans and provide services to help struggling \nveterans get back on their feet.\n  Throughout his career in the Rhode Island National Guard, and with \nhis continued service today, Command Sergeant Major McDonough has been \nan inspiration, advocate and role model for his fellow Guardsmen.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the \nreproductive assistance provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs \nto severely wounded, ill, or injured veterans and their spouses, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I introduce the Women Veterans and \nOther Health Care Improvement Act of 2013. I am incredibly proud of the \nwomen and men who have served or are serving our Nation in uniform, and \nI am grateful for the sacrifices they make on our behalf. That is why \nwe must do everything in our power to meet the needs of our veterans \nand servicemembers. As those needs change, we must ensure the care \navailable keeps pace.\n  That is why I introduced legislation, which was signed into law as \npart of the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of \n2010, which helped to transform the way that the Department of Veterans \nAffairs addresses the needs of women veterans. Among other things, that \nlaw required the VA to provide neonatal care, train mental health \nprofessionals to provide mental health services for sexual trauma, and \ndevelop a child care pilot program. VA has an obligation to provide \nveterans with quality care and it is our responsibility to make sure \nthat VA does so. The legislation I am introducing today builds upon \nthat effort to make additional improvements to VA's services for women \nveterans and veterans with families.\n  The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been characterized by \nincreasing use of improvised explosive devices that leave \nservicemembers, both male and female, at increased risk for blast \ninjuries including spinal cord injury and trauma to the reproductive \nand urinary systems. Defense Department data show that between 2003 and \n2012 nearly 2,000 women and men suffered these types of injuries while \nserving in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n  These devastating and life-changing wounds can destroy the vision \nthese men and women, and their spouses, had for the future. Having a \nfamily is one of the cornerstones of life that so many people look \nforward to and see as a fundamental part of their lives. To have dreams \nshattered because you were brave enough to put yourself in harm's way \nfor your country is something we can never fully repay. But we must do \neverything we can.\n  As our warriors return from the battlefield, the VA system must be \nequipped to help injured veterans step back into their lives as \nparents, spouses, and citizens. These veterans have served honorably \nand have made the ultimate sacrifice for our great Nation. They deserve \nthe opportunity to pursue their goals and dreams, whether that includes \npursuing higher education, finding gainful employment, purchasing their \nfirst house, or starting their own family. VA has many programs that \nhelp veterans pursue the educational, career, or homeownership dreams \nand goals that they deferred in service to this country, but it falls \nshort when it comes to helping severely wounded veterans who want to \nstart a family. These veterans often need far more advanced services in \norder to conceive a child.\n  The Department of Defense and the Tricare program are already able to \nprovide advanced fertility treatments, including assisted reproductive \ntechnology, to servicemembers with complex injuries. However, not all \ninjured servicemembers are prepared to have a child at the time they \nare eligible for that coverage, and some are no longer eligible for \nTricare by the time they are ready.\n  VA's fertility counseling and treatment options are limited and do \nnot meet the complex needs of severely injured veterans. I have heard \nfrom seriously wounded veterans whose injuries have made it impossible \nfor them to conceive children naturally. While the details of these \nstories vary, the common thread that runs through them all is that \nthese veterans were unable to obtain the type of assistance they need. \nSome have spent tens of thousands of dollars on advanced reproductive \ntreatments in the private sector to get what they need to start a \nfamily. Others have watched their marriage collapse because the stress \nof infertility, in combination with the stresses of readjusting to life \nafter severe injury, drove their relationship to a breaking point. Any \nservicemember who sustains this type of serious injury deserves much \nbetter. It is our responsibility to give VA the tools it needs to serve \nthem, and the Women Veterans and Other Health Care Improvement Act is a \nstart at doing that.\n  This legislation also requires VA to build upon existing research \nframework to gain a better understanding of the long-term reproductive \nhealth care needs of veterans, from those who experience severe \nreproductive and urinary tract trauma to those who experience gender-\nspecific infections in the battlefield. An Army task force charged with \nlooking at the needs of female servicemembers reported that women in \nthe battlefield experience higher rates of urinary tract infections and \nother women's health difficulties.\n  After a decade at war, many women servicemembers are still at \nincreased risk for women's health problems due to deployment conditions \nand a lack of predeployment women's health information, compounded by \nprivacy and safety concerns. Little is known about the impact that \nthese issues and injuries have on the long-term health care needs of \nveterans. Additional research will provide critical information to help \nVA improve services for veterans.\n  Caring for children is another frequent problem veterans encounter \nwhen trying to get health care. To address this, my legislation \nprovides permanent authority for VA to provide child care to veterans \ngoing to medical centers or Vet Centers for health care. A pilot \nprogram examining these services is nearing completion and the results \nhave been overwhelmingly positive. Those pilots have been very popular \nwith veterans and VA employees, and have been far less expensive than \noriginally estimated.\n  This legislation is also fully paid for. VA would be empowered to ask \ncontractors and large corporations to pay a relatively small fee in \norder to provide the care needed by some of our most seriously wounded \nveterans. This would not hurt small businesses or veteran owned small \nbusinesses, because the Secretary would be given the authority to \nexempt those small businesses to ensure their ability to compete is not \njeopardized.\n  Finally, I would point out that last Congress, in fact just a little \nmore than a month ago, these provisions were unanimously approved by \nthe Senate. I think the other Members of this body realized then that \nwe must meet the changing needs of all our servicemembers and veterans, \nand that regardless of gender we must fulfill our obligation to do \neverything we can to make whole those who have been injured in service \nto this country.\n\n[[Page S287]]\n\n  I hope all of my colleagues will again support this legislation so we \ncan provide care to meet these most serious needs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARPER (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Murray, and Mrs. \n        Boxer):\n  S. 132. A bill to provide for the admission of the State of New \nColumbia into the Union; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the New Columbia \nAdmissions Act, a bill that seeks to end a longstanding injustice and \ngive full voting representation to the residents of the District of \nColumbia. More than 600,000 Americans live in Washington, D.C. and bear \nall the responsibilities of citizenship, yet currently have no vote in \neither chamber of Congress. This legislation paves the way for the \ncreation of a 51st state from the populated portions of Washington, \nD.C., giving the citizens who live here in our nation's capital the \nvoice they deserve in our national government.\n  Washington is not just a collection of government offices, monuments \nand museums; it is home to more than half a million people who work, \nstudy, raise families, and start businesses. These citizens serve in \nthe military and die for our country just like the residents of the 50 \nStates. They pay Federal taxes just like other Americans in fact they \npay more per capita than residents of most states. But when it comes to \nhaving a voice in our Congress, suddenly these citizens do not count.\n  We must ask ourselves how we would feel in their place; I think most \nof us would quickly decide that this is not how we would want to be \ntreated. In fact, the United States is the only democracy in the world \nthat treats the citizens of its capital city this way. We are the only \ndemocracy, it is sad to say, that denies voting representation to the \npeople who live in its capital city.\n  People have been trying to fix this injustice for almost as long as \nit has existed. In 1801, just one year after residents of the new \nFederal capital city were denied the vote, a prominent city resident \nbegan arguing for a constitutional amendment to give voting rights to \nresidents of the District. Two years later, a House member introduced a \nbill to ``retrocede,'' or give back to Maryland and Virginia, the land \nthat was ceded to create the District. Support for the proposal was \nbased in large part on the political injustice of denying \nrepresentation to the residents of the capital city. Even some \nopponents reportedly argued that the District might be granted \nCongressional representation once its population became more \nsubstantial, a threshold that clearly seems to have been met by a city \nof more than half a million people, a number comparable to several \nstates. In 1978, the House and Senate approved a constitutional \namendment to give the District full voting representation in Congress \nthat was ratified by 16 states, but the measure died when it failed to \nwin support from the required \\3/4\\ of the States within 7 years. More \nrecently, in 2009, the Senate approved a bill to give the District a \nvoting representative in the House.\n  The bill I am introducing today creates a path for the District of \nColumbia to become the State of ``New Columbia'' with full voting \nrights in Congress. Under this bill, a federal district called \nWashington, D.C. would still remain under the control of Congress, as \nthe Constitution mandates. But it would be a smaller area encompassing \nthe White House, the Capitol, the Supreme Court and the National Mall, \nan area where few people actually live. The rest of the current \nDistrict of Columbia, diverse neighborhoods that are home to more than \nhalf a million U.S. citizens no different from the ones you and I and \nour colleagues come here to represent would become a new State provided \nthat its residents vote to set that in motion.\n  The bill is similar to proposals offered by Senator Edward Kennedy in \nthe early 1990s, and by my former colleague Senator Joseph Lieberman in \nDecember 2012. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's sole, \nnon-voting representative in the House who has worked tirelessly for \nvoting rights for the residents of the city, has introduced a companion \nHouse bill.\n  I believe we keep proposing and debating different solutions to the \ninjustice imposed on District residents because we know in our hearts \nthat the situation we have now and have tolerated for so long is not \nright. It is familiar, but it is not fair and not consistent with the \nvalues we all share as Americans. It is incumbent upon those of us who \nenjoy the right and the privilege of full voting rights to take up the \ncause of our fellow citizens here in the District of Columbia and find \na solution.\n  Earlier this week, we celebrated the birth of Martin Luther King, Jr. \nand his legacy of working to bring equality and justice to all \nAmericans. It is in that spirit that I introduce this bill, with my \ncolleagues Senators Barbara Boxer, Richard Durbin and Patty Murray. I \nhope we can work together to find a way to bring the same rights to the \nresidents of the District of Columbia that all of us living in the 50 \nstates cherish so much.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Coburn, Mr. \n        Johanns, and Mr. Heller):\n  S. 134. A bill to arrange for the National Academy of Sciences to \nstudy the impact of violent video games and violent video programming \non children; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I still well up with deep emotion \nwhen I see Newtown parents remembering their lost children, recalling \nwhat they wore to school that day or their last sweet words before \nboarding the school bus. The memory of that horrifying day, and of \nthose children and their teachers, has not waned, nor should it ever. \nIt should be an enduring call to action to do everything we can to save \ninnocent lives.\n  That is why I have championed a comprehensive approach to combating \ngun violence, and support the President's plan to protect the Nation's \ncitizens. West Virginians have a proud tradition of hunting and \nunderstand the importance of the Second Amendment. I know we can \nprotect those traditions and rights as we look at ways to prevent \nsenseless acts of violence.\n  One piece of this comprehensive examination concerns violent content, \nincluding video games and video programming. I have long had concerns \nabout how the violent content that kids see and interact with every day \naffects their wellbeing. This is a very important issue, and one that \ndeserves further research, as even the President recognized. That is \nwhy, as Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, I am introducing \ntoday the Violent Content Research Act of 2013. Under this legislation, \nthe National Academy of Sciences would conduct a comprehensive study on \nthe connection between exposure to violent video games and video \nprogramming and harmful effects on children.\n  Recent court decisions demonstrate that some people still do not get \nit. They believe that violent video games are no more dangerous to \nyoung minds than classic literature or Saturday morning cartoons. \nParents, pediatricians, and psychologists know better.\n  These court decisions show we need to conduct additional groundwork \non this issue. This report would be a critical resource in this \nprocess. It could inform research by other organizations, including the \nCenters for Disease Control, and provide guidance to lawmakers. I call \non my colleagues to join me in passing this important legislation \nquickly.\n  Separately, I will be calling on the Federal Trade Commission and the \nFederal Communications Commission to expand their work in this area. \nThe FTC has reviewed the effectiveness of the video game ratings \nsystem. The FCC has looked at the impact of violent programming on \nchildren. Changes in technology now allow kids to access violent \ncontent on-line and increasingly from mobile platforms with less \nparental involvement. It is time for these two agencies to take a fresh \nlook at these issues.\n  Major corporations, including the video game industry, make billions \non marketing and selling violent content to children. They have a \nresponsibility to protect our children.

A bill to make supplemental agricultural disaster assistance \navailable for fiscal years 2012 and 2013, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, last year the U.S. experienced the most \nsevere and extensive drought in at least 25 years.\n  While the impacts of the drought affected both crop and livestock \nsectors, our commodity farmers have had some protection under crop \ninsurance. With the House not passing a 5 year reauthorization of the \nFarm Bill last year, we have left one sector of agriculture to fend for \nthemselves.\n  Our ranchers across the country and in my home State of Montana have \nexperienced the most extensive drought since the 1950. About 80 percent \nof agricultural land experienced drought in 2012.\n  As last year came and went, a drought stretched across the United \nStates.\n  Wheat and corn fields dried up. Without enough forage, ranchers faced \nthe decision to either to sell their herds or purchase extra feed, \ncutting into their thin margins.\n  As of this week, over 2,000 counties have been designated as drought \ndisaster areas by the USDA.\n  In my state of Montana, 36 counties, or well over half of our State, \nare in disaster. Compound that with one of the worst droughts in recent \nhistory and our cattle and sheep producers are hanging on by a thread.\n  Where our corn, wheat, and soybean farmers have crop insurance as a \nbackstop, we have left our ranchers without any assistance.\n  Pastureland last year was scarce and the cost of feed, when it was \neven available, was often unaffordable. Many ranchers are responding by \nculling their herds.\n  That is why I have introduced the supplemental agricultural disaster \nassistance. This bill takes the three livestock disaster program I \ncreated in the 2008 Farm Bill and extends them for 2012 and 2013 \nlosses.\n  Covering losses from 2012 and 2013 will give our livestock producers \nsome assistance through one of the worst droughts anyone in this \nchamber can remember. It will also cover our ranchers until the House \nand Senate can complete the 2013 Farm Bill.\n  These livestock disaster programs expired in September 2011, leaving \nour livestock producers with no safety net. For over a year and a half, \nthrough one of the worst droughts in recent memory, our producers have \nbeen left to fend for themselves.\n  Congress must make the responsible decision and pass this standalone \nbill I introduce today with Senator Debbie Stabenow, Chairwomen of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, and Senator Roy Blunt.\n  We must do our jobs and pass this basic safety net for ranchers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Whitehouse, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Levin, Mr. Rockefeller, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Reed, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Menendez, \n        Mr. Cardin, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Schatz, Mr. Murphy, Ms. \n        Warren, and Mr. Carper):\n  S. 150. A bill to regulate assault weapons, to ensure that the right \nto keep and bear arms is not unlimited, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Assault \nWeapons Ban of 2013. This legislation is urgently needed to help end \nthe mass shootings that have devastated countless families and that \nlead too many Americans to live their lives in fear.\n  Imagine that you receive a call from your child's school that there \nhas been a shooting. How would you feel? Panicked? Terror-stricken? \nHelpless? Those were the feelings experienced by hundreds of parents \nwhose children attend Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT.\n  Now imagine that, after rushing to the school, you receive the \nterrible news that your child is not coming back. On December 14, 20 \nsets of parents heard those devastating words. Their lives will never \nbe the same.\n  I remain horrified by the mass murders that were committed that day \nin Newtown. But I am even more incensed that our weak gun laws allow \nmass killings to be carried out again and again in our country. Since \n1982, there have been at least 62 mass shootings across the United \nStates. Even worse, the rate of these shootings has been accelerating: \nTwenty-five of these shootings have occurred since 2006, and 7 took \nplace in 2012.\n  These massacres don't stop--they just continue on and on. They have \nbecome tragically common in our society.\n  For each shooting that occurs, there are parents and grandparents, \nbrothers and sisters, and aunts and uncles who have forever lost \nsomeone special in their lives: In Newtown, 26 families will never hear \nthe laughter of their son or daughter again. In Aurora, Colorado, 12 \npeople who attended a movie on a July night will never be able to enjoy \nanother night out. At Virginia Tech, 32 families will never see their \nson or daughter again. In Tucson, AZ, 6 people\n\n[[Page S289]]\n\nnever returned home from meeting their Congresswoman one Saturday \nmorning 2 years ago. My friend, Gabby Giffords, will never be the same.\n  The one common thread running through all of these shootings is that \nthe gunman used a semiautomatic assault weapon or large capacity \nammunition magazine or drum.\n  These military-style weapons have but one purpose: to kill as many \npeople as possible as quickly as possible. Since the last assault \nweapons ban expired in 2004, over 350 people have been killed with \nassault weapons. Over 450 have been injured.\n  I do not intend to sit by while these killings continue. That is why \ntoday I am joining with my colleagues Senators Schumer, Durbin, \nWhitehouse, Blumenthal, Levin, Rockefeller, Mikulski, Boxer, Reed, \nLautenberg, Menendez, Cardin, Gillibrand, Schatz, Murphy, and Warren to \nintroduce legislation to prohibit the sale, transfer, manufacture, and \nimportation of assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding \ndevices that can accept more than 10 rounds.\n  As the members of this body know, we had an assault weapons ban in \nplace from 1994-2004. I was the author of that ban in the Senate, and \nSenator Schumer carried that ban as the then-Chairman of the House \nCrime Subcommittee.\n  The 1994 law was not perfect, but it was working when it expired in \n2004. The supply of assault weapons was drying up, and crime committed \nwith those weapons was decreasing. Don't take my word for it; \nscientific studies bear this about.\n  The 1994 law required the Justice Department to study and report on \nits effectiveness. That study, completed in 1997, found that the ban \nwas responsible for a 6.7 percent decrease in total gun murders, \nholding all other factors equal.\n  The Justice Department sponsored a subsequent follow-on study in \n2004, as the law was getting ready to expire. That study, carried out \nby the University of Pennsylvania, found that by about 9 years after \nthe law took effect, the use of assault weapons in crime had declined \nby more than 2/3--70 percent.\n  The Washington Post found that the percentage of firearms seized by \npolice in Virginia that had high-capacity magazines dropped \nsignificantly during the ban. That figure has doubled since the ban \nexpired.\n  The Police Executive Research Forum found that 37 percent of police \ndepartments reported seeing a noticeable increase in criminals' use of \nassault weapons since the ban expired.\n  Studies of state-level assault weapons bans also show that these bans \nDO work. A study of Maryland's State ban on assault pistols found that \nin the first six months after the ban was enacted, ``the Baltimore City \nPolice Department recovered 55 percent fewer assault pistols than would \nhave been expected had there been no ban.''\n  Let me just address for a moment the arguments of some of the \nopponent of this legislation. They point to overall crime rates, and \nsay the 1994 ban did not affect them. But that overstates the purpose \nof the ban. It was never intended to reduce all crime. It was intended \nto reduce gun murders, and specifically mass shootings. And the \nresearch found that it did just that.\n  A 6.7 percent decrease is not a complete solution. But if one of the \nlives saved was your child, your husband, your sister, your parent, it \nmakes all the difference in the world. As President Obama has said, if \nwe can save even one life, then we must try. And a 6.7 percent decrease \nin total gun murders--that is a lot more than one life.\n  Our police officers, the men and women who pledge their lives to \nprotect us, are particularly at risk from assault weapons. A study by \nthe Violence Policy Center found that, between 1998 and 2001, one in \nfive law enforcement officers slain in the line of duty was killed with \nan assault weapon.\n  Recognizing this, I am proud to have the support of the Major Cities \nChiefs of Police Association and several other organizations \nrepresenting law enforcement. Every day, they must stare down ever-\nmore-powerful military-style assault weapons.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will strengthen the 1994 \nlaw, allowing it to be even more effective:\n  The 1994 law prohibited semiautomatic weapons that could accept a \ndetachable magazine, and had at least two military characteristics. The \nbill we are introducing today tightens this test to prohibit \nsemiautomatic rifles, handguns, and shotguns that can accept a \ndetachable magazine and have one military characteristic. One criticism \nof the 1994 law was that its ``two-characteristic'' test was too easy \nto ``work around'': a manufacture could simply remove one of the \ncharacteristics, and the firearm was legal. The bill we are introducing \ntoday will be much more difficult to work around.\n  The bill also accounts for specific ``work-arounds'' that the gun \nindustry developed to avoid the 1994 law and similar State bans.\n  The bill prohibits ``thumbhole stocks'', which manufacturers \ndeveloped to allow a stock to function like a pistol grip, which is a \nstandard military feature in State bans and the expired Federal ban.\n  It also prohibits ``bullet buttons'', a feature that certain \nmanufacturers developed to evade state restrictions on detachable \nammunition magazines. Some state laws describe a ``detachable \nmagazine'' as one that can be removed without the use of a tool. So \nthese gun manufacturers developed so-called ``bullet buttons'' that \nallow magazines to be removed with the use of the simplest of tools, \nsuch as a key, another bullet, or even a magnet. With these ``bullet \nbuttons'', what is supposed to be a fixed magazine becomes in practical \napplication a detachable magazine. Our bill contains tight language to \nclose this loophole.\n  Other changes to the bill include updating the list of specifically-\nnamed military-style firearms that are prohibited, to account for new \nmodels that have been developed since 1994. We now prohibit 158 weapons \nby name.\n  The bill prohibits semiautomatic rifles and handguns with a fixed \nmagazine that can accept more than 10 rounds.\n  The bill adds a ban on the importation of assault weapons and large-\ncapacity magazines; and eliminates the 10-year sunset that allowed the \noriginal law to expire.\n  Like the 1994 law, our legislation will prohibit large-capacity \nammunition feeding devices capable of accepting more than 10 rounds. \nThese large magazines and drums are so dangerous because they allow a \nshooter to fire 15, 30, even 100 rounds without having to reload.\n  Now, let me tell you what the bill will not do.\n  It will not affect hunting or sporting firearms. Instead, the bill \nprotects legitimate hunters by protecting 2,258 specifically-named \nfirearms used for hunting or sporting purposes, and exempting antique, \nmanually-operated, and permanently disabled weapons.\n  Let me be clear: the bill will not take away weapons you currently \nown. Anybody who says otherwise is simply trying to deceive you. \nInstead, the bill protects the rights of existing gun owners by \ngrandfathering weapons legally possessed on the date of enactment.\n  An important change from the 1994 law is that we address the millions \nof assault weapons that currently exist. While, as in 1994, they would \nremain legal after our bill takes effect, any future sale or transfer \nof such a weapon would require a background check to be conducted of \nthe purchaser or recipient. We do have an exception for intra-family \ntransfers. Keeping these powerful weapons out of the hands of known \ncriminals and people with adjudicated mental problems is a no-brainer.\n  The bill also imposes a safe storage requirement for grandfathered \nfirearms to ensure they don't get into the hands of people who would be \nprohibited from possessing them.\n  While the bill permits the continued possession of high-capacity \nammunition magazines that are legally possessed on the date of \nenactment, it would ban the future transfer of these magazines.\n  Finally, the bill allows local jurisdictions to use existing Federal \nByrne JAG grant money to support voluntary buy-back programs for \ngrandfathered assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition feeding \ndevices.\n  Opponents charge that this legislation impinges upon rights protected \nby the Second Amendment. I recognize that the Supreme Court has clearly \nheld that there is an individual right to possess firearms that is \nprotected by\n\n[[Page S290]]\n\nthe Second Amendment to the Constitution, and I respect that right.\n  However, the Supreme Court was also very clear that, like other \nrights protected by other amendments in the Bill of Rights, this is not \nan unlimited right. For instance, the First Amendment's protection of \nfree speech does not allow someone to falsely yell ``Fire!'' in a \ncrowded theater. Justice Scalia, the author of the majority opinion in \nthe seminal case of District of Columbia v. Heller, said this plainly: \n``Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not \nunlimited.''\n  Justice Scalia, no flaming liberal he, went on to say: ``We also \nrecognize another important limitation on the right to keep and carry \narms. [United States v.] Miller said, as we have explained, that the \nsorts of weapons protected were those `in common use at the time.' We \nthink that limitation is fairly supported by the historical tradition \nof prohibiting the carrying of `dangerous and unusual weapons.' ''\n  The muskets of the 18th Century bear little resemblance to the rapid-\nfire military-style assault weapons today, and their single-shot \nweapons are a far cry from the 100-round ammunition drum that was used \nto inflict such carnage at a movie theater in Aurora, CO. These are \nparticularly dangerous weapons, which the Government is well within its \nrights to regulate under the Second Amendment and the Heller decision. \nThe Second Amendment protects an individual's ability to own a weapon; \nit does not protect their ability to own any weapon. Any reasonable \nperson would recognize limitations on this right: an individual should \nnot own a nuclear weapon, they should not own a rocket launcher, and \nthey should not own a military-style assault weapon.\n  Let me conclude with these thoughts:\n  The most important duty that government has to its citizens is to \nprovide for their safety.\n  When 20 kindergarteners are slaughtered by an assault weapon, our \ngovernment has failed to provide for their safety.\n  When 12 people are gunned down in a movie theater by an assault \nweapon, our government has failed to provide for their safety.\n  The firearms used in these massacres are weapons of war. They are \nweapons designed to kill the maximum number of people in the shortest \nperiod of time. We should be outraged by how easy it is for the \nperpetrators of these horrific crimes to purchase powerful weapons.\n  Let me say it as plainly as I can: weapons of war do not belong on \nour streets, in our schools, in our malls, in our theaters, or in our \nworkplaces.\n  We know the common denominator in these deadly massacres and these \ndaily shootings: easy access to killing machines designed for the \nbattlefield. The circumstances may differ, but the one constant is \nalways the guns.\n  These weapons not only take away the lives of our loved ones. They \nalso take away our freedom--our freedom to live without fear.\n  When a child is fearful of walking down the street outside his home, \nhe has lost his freedom.\n  When Americans wonder whether the next massacre with an assault \nweapon will take place in their town, they have lost their freedom.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to join me in this fight.\n  Join with our chiefs of police who say ``no'' to assault weapons.\n  Join with teachers from across our nation who say ``no'' to assault \nweapons.\n  Join with the emergency room doctors and medical professionals from \nevery corner of our country who say ``no'' to assault weapons.\n  Join with clergy from all denominations who say ``no'' to assault \nweapons.\n  Join with the 58 percent of Americans who support an Assault Weapons \nBan.\n  I am proud that the bill we are introducing has been endorsed by so \nmany organizations and public officials:\n  Law Enforcement: International Association of Campus Law Enforcement \nAdministrators; International Association of Chiefs of Police; Major \nCities Chiefs Association; National Law Enforcement Partnership to \nPrevent Gun Violence; Police Foundation; Women in Federal Law \nEnforcement; Charlie Beck, Chief, Los Angeles Police Department; Lee \nBaca, Sheriff, Los Angeles County; Scott Knight, Chief of Police, \nChaska Police Department (MN), and former chair, Firearms Committee, \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police; and Bill Lansdowne, \nPolice Chief, San Diego;\n  Localities: U.S. Conference of Mayors; Boston City Council; City of \nStockton (CA); County of Los Angeles Board of Supervisors; Ventura \nCounty Board of Supervisors (CA); Mayor David Glass, Petaluma, CA; \nMayor Emmett O'Donnell, Tiburon, CA; Mayor Jill Hunter, Saratoga, CA; \nMayor Hilary Bryant, Santa Cruz, CA; Mayor Bob Filner, San Diego, CA; \nMayor Bob Foster, Long Beach, CA; Mayor Michael Harris, Pleasant Hill, \nCA; Mayor Kevin Johnson, Sacramento, CA; Mayor Edwin M.

This will be a big fight.\n\n[[Page S291]]\n\n  It will be an uphill battle--all the way. I know this.\n  But we need to ask ourselves:\n  Do we let the gun industry take over and dictate policy to this \ncountry? Do we let those who profit from increasing sales of these \nmilitary style-weapons prevent us from taking commonsense steps to stop \nthe carnage?\n  Or should we empower our elected representatives to vote their \nconscience based on their experience, based on their sense of right and \nwrong and based on their need to protect their schools, their malls, \ntheir workplaces and their businesses?\n  This legislation is my life's goal. As long as I am a member of the \nSenate, I will work night and day to pass this bill into law. No matter \nhow long it takes, I will fight until assault weapons are taken off our \nstreets.\n  Put simply, we cannot allow the rights of a few to override the \nsafety of all.

A bill to amend section 520J of the Public Health Service Act \nto authorize grants for mental health first aid training programs; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  MR. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a very important \npiece of legislation--the Mental Health First Aid Act of 2013. The bill \nauthorizes grants for mental health first aid, similar to the first aid \ntraining offered by Red Cross chapters across the United States.\n  I introduced this bill last Congress and focused on higher education \nbecause many common mental illnesses happen at late adolescence or \nyoung adulthood. However, as the recent tragedy in Newtown reminded us \nin horrific detail, violence is not limited to college campuses.\n  My colleague on the House side, Rep. Ron Barber of Arizona, has \nalready introduced a companion bill in the House of Representatives. As \nyou know, he was critically wounded in a tragic shooting 2 years ago \nwith then Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.\n  Mental health first aid teaches the warning signs and risk factors \nfor schizophrenia, major clinical depression, panic attacks, anxiety \ndisorders, trauma, and other common mental disorders, crisis de-\nescalation techniques and equips college and university staff with a \nfive-step action plan to help individuals in psychiatric crisis connect \nto professional mental health care.\n  One in four adults and 10 percent of children in the United States \nwill suffer from a mental illness this year. We know what to do if \nsomeone has a heart attack, but how do we react to someone having a \npanic disorder? Why do we wait for a tragic event to take notice and \nthen bring out emergency measures?\n  When I was Mayor of Anchorage, we worked with local mental health \norganizations to train our police in Crisis Intervention Teams, a great \nimprovement for police officers responding to a crisis. But now we need \nto go further.\n  You have heard me say this before, and it is not something to be \nproud of: In Alaska we have one of the highest suicide prevalence rates \nin the country. Further, we are a very rural State, where access to \nmental health care and medical services is often very difficult.\n  Even today, it is not widely known that fully \\2/3\\ of Alaska can \nonly be accessed by airplane. By educating the general public about the \nwarning signs of common mental disorders, we can intervene early, \nfacilitate access to care, improve clinical outcomes, reduce costs, and \nmaybe save lives.\n  Mental disorders are more common than heart disease and cancer \ncombined and a recent Governing magazine article reports that many \nStates and localities are moving ahead--teaching their employees how to \nrecognize the signs of mental health problems and how to help. Wouldn't \nyou run to perform the Heimlich maneuver if a person was choking in a \nrestaurant? Of course. We should all learn how to intervene with \nsomeone who is having a mental health crisis.\n  In the Alaska tradition, I seek to work across the aisle and believe \nthis legislation merits bipartisan support.

Res. 12\n\n       Whereas, on January 12, 2010, an earthquake measuring 7.0 \n     on the Richter scale struck the country of Haiti, followed by \n     59 aftershocks measuring 4.5 or greater;\n       Whereas more than 220,000 people died as a result of the \n     earthquake, more than 300,000 people were injured, and more \n     than 3,000,000 people were directly affected by the disaster;\n       Whereas the total cost in terms of human lives, \n     infrastructure damage, and economic losses makes the \n     earthquake one of the worst urban disasters in modern \n     history;\n       Whereas President Barack Obama vowed the ``unwavering \n     support'' of the United States Government and pledged a \n     ``swift, coordinated, and aggressive effort to save lives and \n     support the recovery in Haiti'';\n       Whereas the initial emergency response of the men and women \n     of the United States Government, led by the United States \n     Agency for International Development and United States \n     Southern Command, was swift and resolute;\n       Whereas the Haitian diaspora, other individuals, \n     businesses, and philanthropic organizations throughout the \n     United States and the international community overwhelmingly \n     responded to the crisis by sending emergency relief supplies \n     and significant financial contributions;\n       Whereas the Senate passed 3 successive resolutions \n     expressing its profound sympathy and unwavering support for \n     the people of Haiti and urging all nations to assist the \n     people of Haiti with their long-term needs;\n       Whereas, 3 years later, significant challenges still remain \n     in Haiti as it works to recover and rebuild;\n       Whereas, according to the International Organization for \n     Migration, approximately 360,000 people remain in spontaneous \n     and organized camps in Haiti and hundreds of thousands of \n     poor people in Haiti continue to live in non-permanent \n     housing, conditions that make them vulnerable to future \n     natural disasters;\n       Whereas, according to an independent panel investigation by \n     the United Nations, on October 19, 2010, an imported strain \n     of cholera was detected in the Lower Artibonite region of \n     Haiti;\n       Whereas, according to the Haitian Ministry of Public Health \n     and Population, as of December 31, 2012, more than 7,900 \n     people in Haiti have died from cholera and more than 635,000 \n     have been infected with the disease since the earthquake on \n     January 12, 2010;\n       Whereas the United Nations Secretary-General announced a \n     plan to eliminate cholera from the island of Hispaniola \n     through enhanced treatment and prevention efforts and through \n     the development of clean water and sanitation infrastructure \n     that is accessible to all people in Haiti;\n       Whereas gender-based violence against women and girls in \n     Haiti continues to be a chronic problem, and judicial \n     barriers that have prevented victims from finding redress \n     remain a significant issue of concern;\n       Whereas, in 2012 alone, Haiti faced a long drought period \n     and 2 major tropical storms that destroyed 70 percent of \n     agricultural crops in Haiti, impacting the lives of millions \n     of people in Haiti facing food insecurity and further \n     crippling the economy of Haiti;\n       Whereas the sustained assistance to Haiti from the United \n     States and the international community bolsters the efforts \n     of the Government of Haiti to confront these challenges; and\n\n[[Page S292]]\n\n       Whereas, since the earthquake on January 12, 2010, the \n     people of Haiti have demonstrated unwavering resilience, \n     dignity, and courage: Now, therefore, be it\n         Resolved, That the Senate--\n         (1) mourns the loss of lives as a result of the tragic \n     earthquake in Haiti on January 12, 2010, and the subsequent \n     cholera epidemic;\n         (2) honors the sacrifice made by the men and women of the \n     Government of Haiti, civil society, the United States \n     Government, the United Nations, and the international \n     community in their response to those affected by the \n     calamity;\n         (3) reaffirms its solidarity with the Government and \n     people of Haiti as they work to rebuild their country and \n     livelihoods;\n         (4) supports the long-term reconstruction efforts of the \n     United States Government to improve housing, energy, job \n     creation, food security, health care, education, governance, \n     and rule of law in Haiti in full cooperation with the \n     Government of Haiti and civil society, and with the support \n     of the private sector;\n         (5) urges the President and the international community \n     to continue--\n         (A) to focus assistance on increasing the capacity of the \n     public sector of Haiti to sustainably provide services to the \n     people of Haiti;\n         (B) to develop, improve, and increase communication and \n     participation to more substantially involve civil society in \n     Haiti and the Haitian diaspora at all stages of the post-\n     earthquake response;\n         (C) to provide programs that protect and involve \n     vulnerable populations, including internally displaced \n     persons, children, women and girls, and persons with \n     disabilities;

and\n         (E) the recruitment, training, and provisioning of new \n     officers for the Haitian National Police; and\n         (7) urges the President--\n         (A) to continue reconstruction and development efforts, \n     closely coordinated with the Government of Haiti, the Haitian \n     diaspora, and international actors who share in the goal of a \n     better future for Haiti;\n         (B) to ensure close monitoring of the implementation of \n     aid programs funded by the United States Government; and\n         (C) to work with the Government of Haiti and private \n     landowners to prevent the forced eviction of internally \n     displaced people and communities and to provide sustainable \n     and safe housing solutions for the most vulnerable people in \n     Haiti.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/01/24/senate-section/article/S292-1", "month": "01", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 13--CONGRATULATING THE MEMBERS OF DELTA SIGMA THETA \n SORORITY, INC.
