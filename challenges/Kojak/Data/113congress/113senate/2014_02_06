Objection having been heard, the \nbill will be placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Max Baucus\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have had the good fortune of serving in \nCongress for more than three decades with a good man, the senior \nSenator from Montana Max Baucus. We hope to schedule a vote sometime \nthis afternoon on his confirmation to be our Nation's Ambassador to \nChina.\n  Senator Baucus has served in the Senate for a long time. At the end \nof this year, he will have served 36 years. Prior to that, he served in \nthe House of Representatives for 4 years. Prior to that, he served a \nterm in the Montana State legislature.\n  He has his undergraduate and law degree from Stanford. He is an \nextremely\n\n[[Page S776]]\n\nsmart person and is certainly versed on what goes on in the Congress.\n  After he received his law degree from Stanford, he worked as an \nattorney at the Securities and Exchange Commission and entered private \npractice in Missoula after that.\n  His mentor, and the person who got him interested in politics, was \nMike Mansfield. I didn't know him--I shouldn't say I didn't know him. \nHe attended the prayer breakfast, and I met him on a number of \noccasions at our Wednesday prayer breakfast. He was a very quiet man, \nand that is what everybody says about him. He was the worst guest in \nthe world to interview on a Sunday show because he wouldn't say \nanything. He would just answer yes or no. He was well respected in the \nSenate by Democrats and Republicans.\n  I heard Senator Baucus tell the story many times about how Mike \nMansfield suggested that he go into politics. Well, he did do that.\n  Senator Baucus served 2 years in the Montana State legislature before \nhe was elected in 1974 to the House of Representatives. He served, as I \nindicated earlier, 4 years in the House before coming to the Senate. He \nhas been elected and reelected to the Senate 5 times. As I said, at the \nend of this year, he will have served for 36 years in the Senate.\n  He has been chairman of the Finance Committee. He has been chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee. He has a been a member \nof the Agriculture Committee for a long time. By the way, he was \nappointed to that committee on a temporary basis many decades ago and \nnever left.\n  As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, he was instrumental in \ndeveloping lots of landmark legislation, but the most significant law \nhe helped to pass in this body was the landmark health care reform \nbill, the Affordable Care Act, which is saving lives and a lot of money \nfor American taxpayers.\n  He has been a long-time advocate for the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. He worked on that with a number of people--not the least of \nwhich is Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah.\n  While Senator Baucus is well-known nationally for his tireless work \non health care, tax reform, and as a member of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, he was also involved in public works projects.\n  I think the most important thing that Montanans will remember about \nhim is that he always put Montanans first. He is an avid hunter. He \nauthored one of the largest public land grant bills in American history \nwhich preserved 310,000 acres of forest land in northwestern Montana.\n  It is a testament to his love of the outdoors that Max Baucus walked \nalmost 1,000 miles across Montana in 1995 and 1996.\n  Max and I have an ongoing dialogue about running. I have run a number \nof marathons, but Max Baucus is a better runner than I am. He is \nfaster, and he has run--I ran one 31-mile race, but Max has run 50-mile \nraces, and he has trained for 100-mile races. During one of those, he \nfell and hurt himself quite significantly. He hit his head because of a \nfall.\n  We have exchanged news articles and stories about runners. We enjoy \nfocusing on our athletic skills. It was just the two of us, so we could \nsay whatever we wanted because there was no one there to listen.\n  He is someone who loves running. He is still an avid runner, and I \nhave admired him for his athletic skills in addition to his legislative \nskills.\n  Senator Baucus's independent spirit has made him a powerful advocate \nfor Montana and for the issues he cares about. He is a respected member \nof the Democratic caucus and has great respect from the Republican \ncaucus.\n  During the time that Senator Grassley was the ranking member--I can't \nvouch for this, but I think I am right--and Senator Baucus was chairman \nof the Finance Committee, they met every week for lunch. Every week we \nwere in session, they had lunch together.\n  His passion is well known to all of us. He has decades of experience \nin Congress. President Obama made an excellent choice in appointing \nSenator Baucus to represent America's interests in China, a growing \npower in our global economy.\n  He has never shied away from difficult issues of the day, and I have \nno doubt that his fearlessness will serve him well in his new role as a \nrepresentative for our country in China.\n  Although Senator Baucus will be missed by the entire Democratic \ncaucus and the Senate family, our loss will be the Nation's gain.\n  I wish the senior Senator from Montana the very best.\n  I hope we will vote this afternoon on Senator Baucus's nomination to \nbe Ambassador to China. We have not locked that in yet.\n\n\n                    Emergency Unemployment Insurance\n\n  We will also vote at 2 p.m. to advance a 3-month extension of \nemergency unemployment insurance that will not add a penny to the \ndeficit. We originally said 3 months and that it should not be paid \nfor, but the Republicans said it had to be paid for.\n  We have had two, I thought, really uncontroversial issues that paid \nfor it. The first one didn't work. I think that is wrong, but it didn't \nwork. No one complained about the second one, so certainly any ``no'' \nvote on extending unemployment benefits is a ``no'' vote because they \ndon't want to extend unemployment benefits.\n  For a number of years the junior Senator from Oklahoma has talked \nabout how millionaires should not draw unemployment benefits. I agree \nwith him. That is in Jack Reed's amendment, which we are going to vote \non later today. Under this legislation, we have accepted the suggestion \nof the junior Senator from Oklahoma that millionaires should not draw \nunemployment benefits.\n  We have virtually done everything that the Republicans asked. They \nwill come up with excuses about why we can't do this and how they want \namendments, but that is just a loss leader. We offered them 20 \namendments before, but it wasn't good enough.\n  I hope that we could have a few valiant Republicans vote to help the \npeople who are in desperate need of help. I am sorry to say that it \nappears Senate Republicans appear ready to filibuster this important \nlegislation a second time despite the fact that we have compromised on \nevery one of their demands. Republicans complained that the bill wasn't \npaid for, so we found an offset that was minimal to just about \neverything--at least certainly for those people who were originally on \nthe bill--Heller, Murkowski, Collins. It is my understanding they \naccepted that. I hope more do. We need five Republican votes.\n  The Republicans have complained after the first vote that they \nwouldn't vote on an extension of unemployment insurance without reforms \nto the program, so we did that also.\n  I am beginning to believe there is nothing that will get Republicans \nto yes. With the exception of a few Republicans who have taken the \nhuman toll of obstruction into consideration, Republicans simply don't \nwant to extend these benefits.\n  Their obstruction has already cost the Nation $2.2 billion in \neconomic activity--a body blow to small businesses around the country. \nEvery week they delay, another 73,000 Americans lose these crucial \nbenefits, benefits that help them keep food on the table and a roof \nover their heads while they search for a job.\n  I shared the story about a 57-year-old Nevada woman who is couch \nsurfing--I had never heard that term before, but I understand it--who \nis sleeping on friends' couches because she doesn't have a home \nanymore. She sold all her belongings so she could put gas in her car if \nshe gets a job interview. This woman has worked all her life. She \ndoesn't want a handout; she wants a job.\n  So I have had some good conversations with Republican Senators. I \nhope they will go ahead and let this important piece of legislation \npass. We are going to move as quickly as we can to some bills that have \nbeen reported on a bipartisan basis out of committees. We are looking \nclosely at the HELP Committee, the Energy Committee, and there are \nother committees we are going to look at to see if we can bring a \nbipartisan bill here to the floor, have an agreement on amendments, and \ntry to move forward on that basis.\n  So as we vote today, I hope my Republican colleagues will keep in \nmind that we need to move forward--it is so important--to help people \nwho are desperately in need of help such as this 57-year-old woman from \nNevada. I hope\n\n[[Page S777]]\n\nthey will work with us to advance this bill and legislation in the \nfuture more expeditiously than we have in the past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/06/senate-section/article/S777-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                The IRS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, just last year, IRS officials and an \ninspector general report confirmed what we have been hearing from \nconstituents for quite a while: The IRS was being used to target \nAmericans for daring to exercise their first amendment rights, for \ndaring to think differently, for daring to hold opinions contrary to \nhigh-ranking government officials. They confirmed that civic groups the \nadministration opposed, including at least one in my home State of \nKentucky, were harassed and bullied by the IRS. They confirmed that \nindividuals who supported these groups were intimidated and attacked, \nand they confirmed something else too--that this happened in the runup \nto a national election.\n  So Americans were rightly outraged--outraged--when the worst fears of \ncitizen organizations came to light. The American people rightly \nexpected the Obama administration to take concrete steps to end this \nharassment once and for all--to put safeguards in place that would \nensure the same kind of abuse never, ever happens again.\n  But that is not what happened. No, in fact, basically, the opposite \nof that happened. The Obama administration now seems to be trying to \nlegitimize the harassment after the fact, to enact regulations that \nwould essentially allow the IRS to bully and intimidate Americans who \nexercise their right of free speech. It is something they were \noriginally planning actually to slip by while the harassment was \nactually still going on.\n  But here is the thing. The administration knew it could never get \nanything like that through Congress the democratic way, so it is trying \nto quietly impose these new regulations through the back door--through \nthe back door--by executive fiat. Administration officials insist the \nrules change is just a minor bureaucratic adjustment. Nothing to it, \nthey say. They claim it is just a ``good government'' idea from the \nIRS--a response to the inspector general report that brought these \nterrible abuses to light.\n  Of course, we know that is not true. We know the administration had \nbeen working on this proposed rule for at least 2 years--2 years--\nbefore the inspector general report came out, and from the looks of \nthings there is nothing ``good government'' about this at all. As with \nso much of what we have seen with the Obama administration, it is \nalmost purely political--transparently political.\n  Under the administration's proposed regulations, many citizen groups \ncould be prohibited--prohibited--from participating in some of the most \nbasic civic engagement activities--things such as voter registration, \nissue advocacy, and educating citizens about candidates before an \nelection. This is just plain wrong. Grassroots groups shouldn't be \npersecuted for doing what Americans expect them to do. They shouldn't \nbe forced to shut up or shut down or for engaging in the very kinds of \neducational activities that the 501(c)(4) designation was designed to \nsupport.\n  The idea is to shut up and shut down the voices that oppose the \nadministration's priorities, and it comes on the heels of a long-\nrunning pet project of this administration to expose conservative \ndonors to harassment in order to try to dry up their funding.\n  Americans who care about the First Amendment need to stand up to this \nregulation before the administration has a chance to finalize it. The \nAmerican people need to stand up to this regulation before the \nadministration has a chance to finalize it. And they actually are. More \nthan 20,000 citizens have already submitted comments on this proposed \nrule at regulations.gov. Nearly all the ones I saw were opposed.\n  In the House, Representative Dave Camp has introduced legislation \nthat would prevent the IRS from implementing any such regulation, and \nnext week, I, along with Senator Flake, Senator Roberts, and others, \nwill introduce companion legislation that would do the same in \nthe Senate.\n\n  But I hope it doesn't have to come to that. There is a much easier \nfix available. There is a way out of this dilemma. The new commissioner \nof the IRS, John Koskinen, can put a stop to the rule right now if he \nchooses. He can stop this right now if he chooses. If he means what he \nsaid when the Senate confirmed him--the comments we heard about \nrestoring integrity to the IRS--then he will do just that. The Speaker \nand I, along with top Senate and House leadership and the leadership of \nthe relevant authorizing and appropriating committees, have just sent a \nletter to Mr. Koskinen on this topic, and we look forward to his \nresponse.\n  Back in the 1970s, Richard Nixon famously tried to influence the IRS \ninto helping him punish his political opponents. The IRS has been in \nthis spot before. Back then, the IRS commissioner stood up to President \nNixon and said, essentially: No, that is not what this agency is \nsupposed to do. So the history is that when a previous IRS commissioner \nhad a President of the United States try to use him to target his \npolitical enemies, the Commissioner of the IRS stood up to the \nPresident and said no. He said no to the President. The President \ncannot use the IRS to target the President's political enemies. That \nact of courage and independence became the defining act of an already \ndistinguished career, and it was something for which the American \ntaxpayer should be forever grateful.\n  So, today, Commissioner Koskinen has a similar choice. He can either \nbe remembered as the man who reformed this IRS at a time when Americans \nwere deeply distrustful of it or he can be remembered as the man who \nallowed himself to be used by the administration for its own political \nends. That is the choice.\n  The bottom line is this. Americans need to be able to trust the IRS \nagain, and that means getting our Nation's tax agency back into the \nmission it was designed to perform such as processing tax returns, not \nregulating free speech. The Obama administration's proposed rule has \nalmost nothing to do with actual tax policy. It is more about making \nharassment of its political opponents the official policy of the IRS. \nThat is completely unacceptable. Remember, this is an agency that has \naccess to some of America's most sensitive personal information: the \npower to audit, to penalize, to harass--power that is pretty wide-\nranging.\n  So it is not surprising that groups all across the political \nspectrum, from the ACLU to the Chamber of Commerce, have expressed \nconcerns about this rule.\n  Let's be clear. Let's be perfectly clear. Commissioner Koskinen knows \nthe IRS has no business regulating free speech. He knows that. The eyes \nof America are on the IRS commissioner. They are counting on him to do \nthe right thing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/06/senate-section/article/S777-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1845, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1845) to provide for the extension of certain \n     unemployment benefits, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Reed) amendment No. 2714, of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 2715 (to amendment No. 2714), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Reid motion to commit the bill to the Committee on Finance, \n     with instructions, Reid amendment No. 2716, to change the \n     enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 2717 (to (the instructions) amendment \n     No. 2716), of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 2718 (to amendment No. 2717), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 11 a.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the time until 2 p.m be \nequally divided and controlled between the two\n\n[[Page S778]]\n\nleaders or their designees and that all quorum calls during that time \nalso be equally divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, in a few hours this Chamber will have the \nopportunity to restore benefits for 1.7 million American job seekers \nand help reduce the national deficit by $1.2 billion. I believe my \ncolleagues understand that this is a fiscally responsible way to help \njob seekers who are still struggling in the aftermath of the great \nrecession.\n  Unemployment insurance helps people to look for work while at the \nsame time bolstering consumer demand and supporting the economy, which \nis why the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that \nrenewing unemployment insurance for 1 year will save 200,000 jobs.\n  This is an imperative. We must do it. On behalf of the families who \nare struggling, on behalf of our economy that needs the support, this \nis something which must be done.\n  Now the question is whether we can move this critical bill forward \nand send help to those who are struggling through no fault of their \nown. Everyone understands that to qualify for unemployment insurance, \nthey have to be working and they have to lose their job through no \nfault of their own, and they have to continue to search for work.\n  The reality in this market is that there are, in many cases, three \napplicants for every job. We have all heard the stories when we have \ngone home to our States.\n  There is a software engineer who worked for 20 years who has put out \n300 resumes and who has followed people around to give them resumes. \nThis individual was so persistent in trying to get a job in financial \nservices that he would show up early in the morning and put his resume \nin the local newspaper for the head of the bank where he was \ninterviewing. That eventually got him a callback, I am told, but not \nyet a job. It is very difficult.\n  We can do what we have always done--help these struggling Americans \nand help our economy.\n  At every point in this process, I believe we have responded to the \nissues raised by our colleagues to try to get this done. Instead of a \nfull year of extended unemployment benefits--which I proposed, which we \nusually do--we compromised on a short-term extension just to get it \ndone because since December 28 people have lost their benefits. They \nwent off a cliff. Every week an estimated 70,000 more Americans lose \ntheir benefits. It is up to 1.7 million now, and it will be several \nmillion before this year has run out. So instead of a typical 1-year \nextension, we are asking for 3 months. Most of it or a large part of it \nis retroactive to make up to those people who lost their benefits \nbeginning on December 28.\n  I was joined--and I must thank him for his tremendous leadership--by \nSenator Dean Heller of Nevada. This is a bipartisan effort because this \nunemployment problem--particularly this long-term unemployment \nproblem--knows no political dimension or geographic dimension or ethnic \nor gender dimension. It is an American problem, and Senator Heller and \nI are responding in a bipartisan way. We put what we thought was a \npathway to provide immediate aid to these job seekers and to give us \nenough time to work through these complex issues many of my colleagues \nhave raised, issues such as, can we make the program, overall, more \neffective? Can we incentivize individuals to seek employment more \nefficiently? Can we integrate training? All of those are important \nissues, but in the context of a 3-month emergency extension, the first \nthing to do is to get the relief to the people and then sit down and \nconscientiously and deliberately work on the details.\n  When this concession on the short term extension wasn't enough to \nbreak the filibuster, Democrats put forth another proposal, again after \nconsultation with our Republican colleagues. I thank Senator Heller, \nSenator Collins, Senator Portman, Senator Coats, and many others who \nconsciously and conscientiously provided thoughts, provided input, et \ncetera. So this process was not ``my way or the highway.'' This was \ntrying to find a bipartisan pathway, and we are still searching.\n  Based on those comments, we proposed a fully paid-for extension of \nunemployment insurance. We started off with 11\\1/2\\ months fully paid \nfor. We used the pay-for that would have been an extension of the \nmandatory savings agreed to in the bipartisan budget agreement, which \nhad been endorsed by House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan. We also \nincluded in that proposal, the long-term proposal, a major policy \nchange proposed by Senator Portman addressing overlapping unemployment \nand disability insurance payments. None of these were easy to accept on \nour side.\n  The tradition has been unpaid-for unemployment extensions. Very few \ntimes have we paid for these benefits because they are considered \nemergency spending. This is an emergency. People are struggling out \nthere. But we accepted the premise which our Republican colleagues \nsuggested that this has to be paid for. Then we also accepted the \npremise that we couldn't pay for it with tax revenues. It would have to \nbe paid for with something else. So we took a proposal that was \nembedded in the budget and we tried to use that together with a \nproposal that was first presented by Senator Portman. But we had a \nvote, a cloture vote, and none of our Republican colleagues supported \nit.\n  Then we had a vote on the underlying measure, the short-term \nextension, the 3-month extension unpaid-for offered by Senator Heller \nand me--Senator Heller joined us on that vote, and I thank him for \nthat--but we still did not have the significant number of Republican \ncolleagues necessary not only to move this measure forward but also to \ndo the right thing.\n  We are here today and we have had another round of extensive \ndiscussions, consultations, and we are now about to pay for a 3-month \nextension of unemployment benefits. Some of it is retroactive, all of \nit is fully paid for. I will point out that it is February and this \nextension will go forward until March. We are reaching the point, \nironically, where we might have more retroactive payments than \nprospective payments. That is why we have to move and we have to move \ntoday.\n\n  It is not everything we wanted, certainly. As I said initially, we \nwould have preferred a full year to give people certainty for the year. \nWe would have, as we have done more times than not, declared it \nemergency spending. But in order to conscientiously and thoughtfully \nand cooperatively and collaboratively work with our colleagues, we have \ncontinually agreed to make concessions. I used to think that was the \nnature of political compromise, principled political compromise, and we \nhave tried.\n  Now we have a 3-month bill that is paid for by a technique called \npension smoothing, which we have enacted on a bipartisan basis. In \nfact, the vote was 79 to 19 in the 2012 Transportation bill, MAP-21. So \nthis is not a controversial pay-for. This is something we have embraced \nbefore. It is something that does not involve raising revenues, which \nis one of the benchmarks our colleagues laid down. So we have a short-\nterm, fully paid-for UI benefit which can go out immediately to people \nwho are suffering and which is paid for by a noncontroversial \nmechanism.\n  Essentially, it will do what I think we have been requested to do by \nour colleagues on the other side. Our request is simply, support us in \nthis effort so that we can get this legislation accomplished.\n  One of the interesting things about this pay-for is that not only is \nit in the Transportation bill--due to expire, and we will extend it--\nbut also it has been used on numerous occasions by colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to pay for a various assembly of different \nlegislative proposals. So this is not a controversial mechanism. I \ndon't think unemployment insurance is controversial. I think people \nhopefully recognize that it is necessary in this situation.\n  We have also included a provision in this proposal that has been \nchampioned aggressively and thoughtfully by Senator Coburn that will \nbar individuals with income of over $1 million from receiving Federal \nunemployment insurance benefits. It has passed this Chamber by a vote \nof 100 to 0.\n  The other factor which I would argue to my colleagues is that as we \npay for this extension, we are also able to approve $1.2 billion over \n10 years to reduce the deficit.\n  If my colleagues are looking for proposals that are fully paid for, \nreduce\n\n[[Page S779]]\n\nthe deficit, and provide needed assistance to Americans who have \nworked, are looking for work, and desperately want a job, we need their \nvote this afternoon. I hope we can move forward on this bill and help \nunemployed Americans who are searching for work, help employers--this \npension-smoothing mechanism helps employers--and also reduce the \ndeficit. That is a very good trifecta, something I think we should \nsupport.\n  The other point I want to make is that the notion that unemployment \ninsurance, Federal long-term benefits, should be a political issue is \nin stark contrast to its history. Congress has renewed UI on a \nbipartisan basis in the past on numerous occasions. We did it three \ntimes under President Ronald Reagan. We did it five times under \nPresident George W. Bush. That is the precedent to get it done today. \nThat is a pretty good precedent on a bipartisan basis under two \nRepublican Presidents.\n  One of the questions that comes up is does the Republican \nleadership--not some of the Members whom we have collaborated with very \nclosely--want this to pass or will they say: No, no, forget the \nsubstance, it is so compelling. Let's talk about process. This is about \nhow many amendments we have. This is about whether we can reform and \nreauthorize an entire legislative program based on a 3-month \nextension--most of which is rapidly becoming more retroactive, than \nprospective, than going forward.\n  I think the American people see through this. The substance is clear. \nThis program has been repeatedly reauthorized to deal with long-term \nunemployment under Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents on a \nbipartisan basis. It is fully paid for. It is paid for by a \nnoncontroversial technique that does not include raising revenues. In \nfact, the pay-for is something the corporate world supports.\n  There are others who might say we are disappointed because there is \nanother major issue out there, and there is; that is, the COLA cuts for \nmilitary retirees. This is an issue that has to be dealt with, and it \nwill be dealt with. But, I wish to point out that COLA does not become \neffective--those reductions--until December of 2015. People receiving \nUI lost their benefits December of last year. They are already \nsuffering. There is no more time for them, in terms of our fixing it, \nbefore it takes effect. We need to act today.\n  Indeed, it has been estimated there are 20,000 veterans who have been \ndenied long-term unemployment benefits because of our failure to extend \nthis. So for those 20,000 veterans, I don't think it would be \nsufficient to tell them they are not going to get their unemployment \ninsurance because we are worried about what is going to happen in \nDecember of 2015 to other veterans. If we want to help veterans right \naway, today, we can help 20,000 of them by voting for this provision \ngoing forward.\n  Let us help both the unemployed and our veterans and not try to use \none group against the other, for a legislative advantage in terms of \nany one particular measure. The emergency for unemployment insurance \nthat encompasses at least 20,000 veterans is today, not a year or more \nfrom now.\n  We can't turn our back on 1.7 million Americans, with that number \ngrowing each week. We have to help them. It has been 40 days since \nunemployment insurance benefits expired for millions of Americans. That \nis 40 days too long for those who were downsized with the recession and \nnow find their unemployment insurance benefits being downsized again by \nCongress--downsized practically to zero.\n  I also wish to remind my colleagues about some of the reforms we \nalready accomplished in 2012, because many of my colleagues have some \nvery good ideas and they have talked about, well, if we are going to \ndeal with unemployment insurance, let us deal with it in a way we can \nalso make some structural reforms. In 2012, I was part of the \nconference committee between the House and the Senate where legislation \nwas formally considered in this body, in the other body, and brought to \na conference in regular order and we had a very vigorous debate about \nthe structure of unemployment compensation, and significant structural \nreforms were made to the program.\n  This is not a situation where we have neglected to look at the \nunemployment compensation program for years and years and years. It was \n2 years ago we made these changes. We strengthened the job search \nrequirement. We have indeed allowed States, if they choose to, to drug \nscreen applicants, which is an extremely controversial provision. That \nwas included because we were responding to particularly many Members of \nthe House of Representatives who said this had to be something the \nStates can do. Well, this is something the States can do. I don't think \nmost States have taken up the option, but this is something they can \ndo.\n  Indeed, after the House passed this agreement, Representative Camp \nissued a statement noting--in his words--the historic reforms of the \nFederal unemployment programs are an important part of this agreement. \nThese reforms will now help the unemployed get the training and \nresources they need to move from an unemployment check to a paycheck. \nThe package overturns arcane 1960s-era regulations and allows States to \ndrug screen and test those most at risk.\n  I am always willing to listen to proposals to make changes, but we \nhave to recognize we made significant changes to this program, in Mr. \nCamp's words--revising provisions that had been there since the 1960s, \nand that was about 2 years ago. So we have made these changes. But we \nare willing to work in good faith if additional changes are necessary. \nHowever, they shouldn't block a 3-month extension, much of it \nretroactive, that is pending before the Senate today.\n  Let me make one other point. In the context of this debate, there has \nbeen the suggestion that unemployment insurance is in some way \ninappropriate, immoral. It encourages people to avoid work. It makes \nus, as Americans, lazy and dependent. That is not what I see when I go \nback home. What I see are people who say--even recognizing my efforts \nto try to get this bill passed--that is fine, but what I truly want is \na job. I want to work. I want to work for many reasons. One, the $350 a \nweek I get, that barely keeps my family whole. It is a little help for \ngasoline, a little help with the rent, but I can't live on that. I have \nto have a job.\n  By the way, I think most Americans want to work because work defines \nus. Work gives us not just a place to go but gives meaning to all of \nus, just as family does. So this notion this is just this program that \nindulges those who don't want to work is profoundly wrong. Indeed, it \nis an insult to millions of Americans who desperately want a job.\n  By definition, unemployment insurance is based on an individual's \nwork history. This is not a program you qualify for by showing up. You \nhave to be let go, basically. You have to be told: We can't keep you \nanymore. We are sorry. You are a good worker, but we can't keep you. \nYou have to go. In fact, if you are not a good worker, if you are fired \nfor cause, you don't get these benefits. And then they actively have to \nkeep looking for work. As I said, in the 2012 legislative provisions, \nwe gave the States more authority to make that active search much more \nactive, much more real--not perfunctory but an active search.\n  Because of the obstructions we have seen, most Americans now are just \nsimply eligible for 26 weeks of assistance--the standard program \nadministered by the States. But the Washington Post notes it takes an \naverage job seeker about 32 weeks to get hired, and in some cases even \nlonger because of high unemployment. In my State it is 9.1 percent. \nThere are some States where it is remarkably low because of the \nparticular economic conditions there. But as the Post points out, for \nthe average worker, it is 32 weeks. Those 26 weeks will not cover their \nunemployment period as they desperately search for work.\n\n  The other cruel fact is the longer one is unemployed, the harder it \nis to get a job. That is what we know from research. That is what we \nknow from our own sense of the economy. So the notion that someone, \nsuch as a chemical engineer who has been out of work for 7 months, who \nhas a great work record--the first time he or she has ever lost their \njob--should take the first thing available to him or her at the lowest \ncost, the lowest wage, No. 1, I think devalues their lifetime effort; \nand No. 2, it potentially denies us of their productivity. I would \nrather see a\n\n[[Page S780]]\n\nchemical engineer work at a job related to chemical engineering than \nstocking shelves because his productivity, his or her contribution to \nsociety, would be much greater doing the job they were trained for and \nthey have the experience to do.\n  Our Nation is at its best when everyone has the opportunity to put \ntheir talents, their skills, and their experience to work. We need to \nget our country back to full employment. We all know that is the \nanswer. This is an emergency provision, a bridge, if you will, to a \njob. We have to do more not only to put people back to work but to make \nthe wages they receive allow them to live not just paycheck to paycheck \nbut to live with the sense they are building some security for \nthemselves and their family.\n  We have the resources to achieve this. We are paying for this \nprovision. We are not putting it on the shoulders of the next \ngeneration. We are limiting it to a very short period of time so there \nis an opportunity to work and look at what we did in 2012 and see if we \ncan do more. The question before us is, Does this Senate have the will \nto make it happen?\n  Renewing unemployment insurance isn't the end of our efforts. Our \nefforts are to get more jobs out there so people don't need \nunemployment insurance; that it is not 32 weeks to get a new job but is \nseveral days, we hope. This is the building block we need to put in \nplace to move forward.\n  This process, this expiration, has caused Rhode Islanders in my home \nState great hardship. It is time to end that hardship. So I urge my \ncolleagues to renew this program. This is one of those issues where it \nsimply comes down, in my view, to this: This is the right thing to do. \nI honestly believe there are many more than 60 of my colleagues who \nfundamentally believe this is the right thing to do and the right way \nto do it. The question is, Will they vote that way in a few hours? I \nhope they do.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized to speak as \nif in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Iran Sanctions\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I have been receiving a lot of phone calls \nand emails this week about the issue of Iran. Just last night, almost \nall of my colleagues on the Republican side and I, led by Senator Kirk, \namong others, sent a letter to the majority leader asking him to have a \nvote on additional sanctions on Iran. Of course, these sanctions would \nbe conditioned on failure of the additional negotiations which the \nadministration has announced will begin next week.\n  I wish to take a moment to explain to people back home, who are--\nrightfully so--writing and calling us about this issue, what is at \nstake and what is happening. So I will break it down to the most basic \nelements.\n  Iran is a country which, as we all know, beginning in 1979 was \novertaken by a radical Islamic revolution which took control of the \ncountry and has been a sworn enemy of the United States ever since. In \nfact, until very recently--and perhaps they still do--after Friday \nprayers, they used to end them with the chant ``Death to America.''\n  It is one thing to say those things. It is another to actually do \nsomething about it. In fact, Iran has. They have been one of the most \nactive sponsors of terrorism all over this planet but particularly in \nthe Middle East.\n  We know they are actively engaged in undermining our interests all \nover the world. They have been linked to terrorist attacks against \ndignitaries from other countries in other countries abroad. About 2 \nyears ago, a report emerged of the potential that they were trying to \nplot the assassination of a foreign ambassador here in Washington, DC.\n  In addition, they participate in things such as cyber attacks against \nthe country, they destabilize their neighbors, and they continue to \ndevelop their weapons capability.\n  In addition to all that which I have just outlined, over the last few \nyears Iran has begun to pursue a nuclear program. In order to have a \nnuclear weapon, you have to be able to process plutonium. This takes \ninfrastructure, and while people know how to do that per se, it takes a \nlot of investment of time, energy, and expertise to actually build the \nfacilities to enrich.\n  You can enrich for peaceful purposes. If you want to have nuclear \nreactors to power your cities, this requires enrichment up to a certain \nlevel. But Iran has gone well beyond that.\n  This is important for two reasons. The first is that there are plenty \nof countries in the world who have nuclear energy but don't enrich and \ndon't reprocess. They import that material to use in their reactors. In \nfact, that is what most countries who have nuclear reactors do.\n  But the second is that Iran's program has always had strong elements \nof secrecy. They have had all these secret facilities they hide from \nthe world--and the world is rightfully concerned.\n  The United Nations Security Council--which is lately usually a pretty \nuseless body, but the United Nations Security Council came up with a \nresolution demanding that Iran stop the enrichment process. But they \nkept going. In fact, not so long ago they discovered more secret \nfacilities where Iran was enriching uranium and reprocessing plutonium.\n  So the administration has made it a high priority, as has its \npredecessor, to stop that from happening, and they have made clear \nstatements: We are not seeking to contain a nuclear Iran; we want to \nprevent it. That is the right approach. Now, here is the problem.\n  We recently entered into these negotiations with Iran to get them to \nstop, to back away from this. If you want nuclear power, if you want \nnuclear energy, you can have it without the need to reprocess--like \nmost countries do, like many of our allies do.\n  The only reason why they even came to the table for those \nnegotiations is because the United States, to be frank--despite the \nresistance of this administration, which each and every time sanctions \nand sanctions bills have come before the Congress have threatened to \nveto them and have blocked them and have been against them--despite all \nof that, these sanctions have been in place. They have been applied at \na global level, and they have created a tremendous amount of pressure \non the Iranian economy. As a result, they have come to the table to \nnegotiate--not because the new president, Rouhani, is a reformer, as \nsome like to call him, but because they have so much internal pressure \nand their economy is under so much duress that they are afraid of what \ntheir people may do about it in the long term.\n  The administration is pretty optimistic about these negotiations \nwhich were reached: An interim agreement--a temporary agreement, as \nthey call it. A joint plan of action is the right terminology.\n  We had Secretary Sherman, who was in charge of those talks, here the \nother day before the Foreign Relations Committee. Her point is, we \naccomplished something. We got Iran to stop processing at a certain \nlevel and suspend it. That is her point. Now we are going to go into \nthe second phase of negotiating a longer term solution, and we have to \ngive diplomacy a chance.\n  The problem is that something is lost in translation. Perhaps before \nthe Internet we didn't catch these things, but now we can see these \nthings happening in real-time.\n  For some reason Iran does not have the same interpretation that the \nUnited States does of this joint plan of action.\n  For example, the head of Iran's atomic energy organization on \nNovember 24 said as follows:\n\n       Work at the Arak reactor will continue. . . . Research and \n     development will continue. All our exploration and extraction \n     activities will continue. There are no activities that won't \n     continue.\n\n  Their foreign minister on November 27 said:\n\n       Iran will pursue construction at the Arak heavy-water \n     reactor.\n\n  This is the same one I was just talking about.\n\n[[Page S781]]\n\n  Iran's top nuclear negotiator said--and this is really concerning:\n\n       We can return again to 20-percent enrichment in less than \n     one day, and we can convert the nuclear material again. . . . \n     Therefore, the structure of our nuclear program is preserved \n     . . . we . . . will in no way, never, dismantle our \n     centrifuges.\n\n  These are concerning statements. Their foreign minister said \nsomething else on CNN on January 22:\n\n       We did not agree to dismantle anything. . . . The White \n     House version both underplays the concessions and overplays \n     Iran's commitments . . . we are not dismantling any \n     centrifuges, we're not dismantling any equipment, we're \n     simply not producing, not enriching over 5%.\n\n  The problem is that maybe they are not enriching right now. Or, quite \nfrankly, it would be tough to tell because they have always had secret \ncapabilities we keep finding out about long after they have started. \nBut more complicated is that they are keeping all the process and the \nequipment in place. If they wanted to--as they accurately said--they \ncould return to enriching at whatever level they wanted in less than 1 \nday.\n  Now, we may ask ourselves: Why has Iran agreed to do these sorts of \nthings? Here is what I said at the beginning and I know now to be true \nmore than ever. Here is Iran's strategy. It is the same one employed by \nNorth Korea a few years ago:\n  Let's get into a negotiation. Let's see how many of these sanctions \nwe can get lifted off of our shoulders. But let's not agree to anything \nthat is irreversible.\n  Here is what they are gambling on. They are gambling that the world's \nattention will turn to something else; that the sanctions will erode \nand people will lose the discipline or the willingness to continue; \nthat countries who are export driven want to sell things to Iran or get \ngasoline and petroleum products from them and will therefore agree to \nnot continue with the sanctions.\n  Then eventually one day, in 1, 2, 3, 4 years or whenever, they can \ndecide to restart this stuff and suddenly announce: We want to be a \nnuclear weapons power after all.\n  Do you know why I know--I don't think, I don't suspect--that Iran \nwants nuclear weapons? There are two reasons.\n  The first is because they believe this is the ultimate insurance \npolicy. If they have a nuclear weapon, people can't interfere with \ntheir internal politics because they are a nuclear power.\n  The other reason why I know is because they are developing ballistic \nmissiles. Ballistic missiles are rockets that travel at long distances, \nand they cost a lot of money to develop and a lot of time. The only \nreason why you develop that capability is to deliver a nuclear payload, \nto be able to deliver a nuclear weapon against somebody else far away.\n  The administration's argument is this is all for domestic \nconsumption. This is all political posturing. This is what the \nadministration is saying in reaction to Iran's top diplomat, who once \nagain yesterday dismissed the Obama administration's demands on its \nnuclear program.\n  He said they have no value. The best part of this joint plan of \naction, he said, is that it is so clear that research and development \nhas no constraint; we can continue research and development and \nincreasing our capabilities; that all stays in place.\n  What he is really saying is this. Once the world is distracted and \nAmerica moves to another topic or some other crisis happens somewhere \nelse in the world, then we will do what we want to do.\n  That is what is happening here, and this is extremely dangerous for \nthe future. Having a nuclear Iran is bad enough, but it isn't going to \nstop there. If Iran develops a nuclear capability and a nuclear weapon, \nevery other country around them is going to want one as well. Saudi \nArabia is going to want one. Potentially, Turkey is going to want one. \nEventually, one day Egypt could want one. Could you imagine four or \nfive nuclear weapons powers in the most unstable, dangerous region in \nthe world? This is where we are headed.\n  What about these countries who don't enrich right now? South Korea is \nan example. We ask them not to enrich. We tell them: You don't need to \nenrich. We provide this stuff. How are we going to argue to them not to \nenrich now? How are we going to tell Jordan and Saudi Arabia and other \ncountries: You shouldn't enrich but we have agreed to allow Iran to \nkeep enriching? So we are going to tell our friends and allies: You \ncan't have this capability; you shouldn't have this capability; but we \nare going to tell an enemy of this country and of world peace that they \ncan?\n  This is why we want a vote on these sanctions. We don't have room for \nerror here. We do not have the space to be wrong. We can't afford to be \nwrong.\n  There is no guarantee sanctions will prevent Iran from going nuclear, \nbut it will make it extremely painful. It will influence their cost \nbenefit analysis.\n  Failure to put these sanctions in place is already having an impact. \nEvery day we see news reports of businessmen in Europe and around the \nworld flooding to Iran on the idea sanctions might be eroding. How are \nwe going to pull that back? We won't be able to.\n  I don't completely dismiss the notions the administration is saying. \nIt is ideal to reach a negotiated solution with Iran. But we have to be \nwise. We have to learn the lessons of history, and we have to \nunderstand human nature. Iran's regime wants a nuclear weapon because \nit gives them supremacy in the region and they believe it makes them \nimmune to outside pressure and interference in their internal affairs. \nThey are headed for a weapon, and they are using these negotiations to \nbuy time.\n\n  There are 59 Members of this Senate who have signed on to a sanctions \nbill and one Senator is preventing a vote on it, and that is wrong. We \nshould have a vote on a matter of this importance. The use of \nprocedural motions and the power of the majority leader to prevent a \nvote on something of this importance has extraordinary long-term \nimplications on our national security.\n  Let me just close by making one more point in this regard. I recently \nread statements that those of us who want more sanctions are banging \nthe war drum. That is false. On the contrary. We believe that a failure \nto put sanctions in place increases the likelihood of an armed conflict \nwith Iran. Are we prepared to allow Iran to become a nuclear weapons \npower?\n  We are going into these negotiations with one arm tied behind our \nback. They are saying: Under no circumstances will we ever agree not to \nenrich, and we are saying we are open to that.\n  I am saying this on the floor so that it is recorded and so people \nknow where I stood on this before it happened. If Iran is allowed to \nmaintain any sort of enrichment capability within our lifetime--in \nfact, I believe before the end of this decade, God forbid--Iran will \nhave a nuclear weapon and one day we will wake up to the news that they \nhave tested a device or proven the capability of having one. When that \nday comes, God help us all.\n  I hope we can have a vote on the Senate floor on this issue. Let's \nhave a debate on it. Let's have a frank and open discussion about it. \nWhy are we preventing that from happening? Why is the majority leader \npreventing that from happening? It is inexcusable. It is unacceptable.\n  I hope we will have a vote on it sooner rather than later.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday the Congressional Budget Office \nreported--and it continues to be the buzz about town--the latest report \nknown as the long-term outlook. Of course, we know from the news that \nits report on the Affordable Care Act is absolutely devastating.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, ObamaCare will reduce \nfull-time employment by 2 million workers in the year 2017 and 2.5 \nmillion by the year 2024. The reason for that is pretty clear. With the \nemployer mandate and the additional cost associated with ObamaCare, \nmany employers will simply put people from full-time work onto part-\ntime work in order to avoid the employer mandate and those penalties \nand additional costs.\n  We human beings are enormously sensitive to incentives--both positive \nand negative--and this is predictable, and it is tragic. The \nCongressional\n\n[[Page S782]]\n\nBudget Office says: The reduction will almost entirely be a reduction \nin labor force participation and in the number of hours worked.\n  In other words, this was a piece of legislation that we were told \nwould enormously benefit, not only individual Americans by getting them \naccess to care, but the President said it would benefit the economy as \na whole. The sad truth is it is hurting the economy and hurting the \nvery people whom I presume the President wanted to help.\n  I heard Representative Ryan on the news talk about this as a poverty \ntrap. Of course, many of the folks who supported the Affordable Care \nAct--and I am thinking about organized labor--have petitioned the \nPresident and his allies and said: This is turning into a nightmare for \nus. This is one of the things they mentioned--people are being moved \nfrom full-time work to part-time work.\n  I might just add, the answer is not to say: We are just going to \norder an increase of 40 percent in the minimum wage. In other words, \nyou can see that moving people from 40 hours a week to 30 hours a \nweek--perhaps there will be some people who say we will compensate for \nthat. We will order businesses to pay at least $10.10 an hour, when \nsimple common sense tells us that many of the people, again, whom we \nare trying to help, are the ones who will be hurt the most with high \nunemployment among minorities and teenagers.\n  What is a small business going to do when the government orders them \nto pay $10.10 an hour without regard to the markets or economics? They \nare going to hire fewer people or perhaps go out of business. This sort \nof micromanagement and attempts to compensate for the effects of \nObamaCare will make things worse, not better.\n  Needless to say, if the advocates of the Affordable Care Act had \nunderstood back in 2009 and 2010 what the facts would turn out to be \ntoday, then ObamaCare never would have passed. Millions of Americans \nsaid they liked the coverage they already had.\n  I think the poll numbers I have seen showed between 88 percent to 90 \npercent of the people said: We like what we have. We would like it to \nbe more affordable, but we like the coverage we have. If these people \nknew they were going to have their coverage canceled because it failed \nto meet the mandates of ObamaCare, ObamaCare never would have passed.\n  The people who liked the coverage they had would still be paying \nlower premiums than they are being charged in the exchanges under \nObamaCare, not to mention the huge deductibles. Families are now being \nasked to essentially self-insure up to $5,000 for their deductible. \nThey can say you get the tax subsidy and you have better coverage \nbeyond that, but you still have a $5,000 deductible, and those are the \nfirst dollars that come out of consumers' pockets. You might as well be \nself-insured but for catastrophic health care needs. Of course, there \nis a much cheaper way for people to buy that kind of coverage.\n  We also know an untold number of Americans would have access to at \nleast 40 hours of work, which is not the case, sadly. Under ObamaCare--\nand we now know because of the projections of the Congressional Budget \nOffice--things will continue to get worse.\n  The President's health care law has become a genuine public policy \ndisaster. By the way, even the Congressional Budget Office said at \nleast 30 million people will still be uninsured even if ObamaCare was \nimplemented exactly as advertised. So not even that addresses what I \nalways thought was the main reason for ObamaCare; that is, to cover \nmore people.\n  ObamaCare is reducing full-time employment at a time when the \npercentage of people participating in job seeking--the workforce--is at \na historic low. Many people have given up. They just quit looking, and \nthey get dropped out of the unemployment statistic. So when the number \ncomes down--and we actually think maybe we are doing better and maybe \nthe economy is stronger. We found out, for example, in December alone \nthat 345,000 people quit looking for jobs. They quit. They got worn \nout. They gave up because they have been looking for so long and the \njobs just are not there.\n  To be clear, the question in 2009 and 2010 was not whether we would \nexpand health coverage but how we would do it. ObamaCare represented \none option, and it is obviously the one our Democratic colleagues chose \nto adopt on a party-line vote. Despite what the President suggested, \nyet again, in his State of the Union Message, there are a lot of \noptions out there, so it is not ObamaCare or nothing, which is what is \nso often mentioned.\n  I hear some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say: We \nhave to have ObamaCare because only then can we cover people with \npreexisting conditions. That is poppycock. It is not true. We can do it \ncheaper and more effectively by other alternatives.\n  We hear people say: The only way young people can be covered up to \nage 26 is under their family's health care with ObamaCare. That is \npoppycock too. It is just not true. To suggest that you have to \nbasically have the whole enchilada--you have to buy all of ObamaCare, \nwhich is trillions of dollars, along with all of its negative \nconsequences--in order to address these health care concerns is false. \nIt is not true.\n  If I heard the President say this one time, I heard him say it 1,000 \ntimes. He said: If critics of ObamaCare have a better idea, just bring \nit to me.\n  I would like to respectfully suggest that the President has a tin ear \nwhen it comes to alternatives and he is not listening.\n  One of the latest proposals came out of three of our best experts on \nthe Republican side on the health care issue: Senator Orrin Hatch, the \nranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator Richard Burr, and \nSenator Dr. Tom Coburn. They released a comprehensive blueprint for \nwhat our alternative might look like.\n  At some point there has to be a resolution because policies are being \ncanceled. The costs for people with coverage are going up, and it is \nhurting the economy. It is turning full-time work into part-time work. \nAt some point--I don't know when it is. Maybe it will be sometime after \nthe November election. I am just guessing. At some point we will have \nto confront this reality and deal with it in order to protect our \nconstituents, the people we are privileged to represent.\n  The alternative to the government's takeover and the President's \ncommand and control--one-sixth of our economy--under ObamaCare is that \nthe government gets to choose, and under our alternative you get to \nchoose.\n  I wish to highlight a few more of the findings in the Congressional \nBudget Office report. Last March the President told ABC News that ``for \nthe next 10 years [America's national debt] is going to be in a \nsustainable place.'' I am afraid the President is falling in a trap \nbecause we are living in a surreal time when interest rates are so low \nbecause of what the Federal Reserve is doing that, yes, the interest we \nhave to pay on our debt is not as much as it would be if it went back \nup to historical norms--4 or 5 percent.\n  By the way, somebody is going to have to pay that back someday. These \nyoung people who are sitting here and listening will be the ones left \nholding the bag, as well as people such as my two daughters who are \nworking in Austin, TX. Somebody is going to have to pay that money \nback.\n  For the President to say our debt is sustainable for the next 10 \nyears ignores the fact that we have a moral obligation to deal with it \ntoday so as not to dampen the aspiration of these young people by \nsaddling them with a bunch of debt they didn't charge up.\n  The fact is our debt is highly contingent on three factors: the \neconomic growth of our economy--how fast our economy is growing; \ninflation is the second one; and interest rates, which I alluded to.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, if America's real \neconomic growth rate were just one-tenth of a percentage lower than it \nprojects currently each year over the next decade, our cumulative \ndebt--the annual difference between what we collect in taxes and what \nthe Federal Government spends over the next 10 years--would go up by \n$311 billion. That is with a ``b.''\n  Likewise, if annual inflation was 1 percentage point above what the \nCongressional Budget Office projects, our cumulative deficit--in other \nwords, the difference between what we bring in, in tax dollars and what \nthe Federal Government spends projected over 10\n\n[[Page S783]]\n\nyears--would be $762 billion higher. That is just inflation. Just minor \nchanges in the growth rate or in inflation can have dramatic \nconsequences in terms of the debt. Yes, you don't have to just pay the \nprinciple back, you have to pay the interest on that debt.\n  As I said, interest rates are at historic lows because of the \nquantitative so-called easing that the Federal Reserve is doing--\nchurning out dollars. Of course it has been a boon to the stock market \nand the top 1 percent of our economy. Working people are finding their \nwages have been stagnant for the last 5 years. If interest rates were \nto rise 1 percentage point above the current Congressional Budget \nOffice baseline each year, our cumulative deficits or our debt would go \nup $1.5 trillion--that is with a ``t'', not a ``b''--$1.5 trillion.\n\n  So these numbers confirm that despite the short-term deficit \nreduction produced by the Budget Control Act--we have seen some bending \nof the spending curve under the Budget Control Act; and, of course, \nthose caps have been lifted as a result of the budget negotiations \nbetween Senator Murray and Congressman Ryan--America is still \ndangerously vulnerable to a fiscal shock. We experienced one of those \nback in 2008, and we are still vulnerable to a fiscal shock, if things \nchange in terms of growth, inflation, and interest rates. Any one of \nthose could have a dramatic impact, making things much more difficult \nand much worse.\n  To quote the Congressional Budget Office once again: Over the next \ndecade, debt held by the public will be significantly greater relative \nto GDP than at any time since just after World War II.\n  Coming out of a world war, we can understand why the debt was high, \nbut debt held by the public will be significantly greater relative to \nthe economy than at any time since that time, and we haven't had a \ncomparable world war that would justify this huge runup of debt.\n  They went on to say:\n\n       With debt so large, Federal spending on interest payments \n     alone will increase substantially as interest rates rise to \n     more typical levels.\n\n  I mentioned that.\n  Going on, they say:\n\n       Moreover, because Federal borrowing generally reduces \n     national savings, the capital stock and wages will be smaller \n     than if the debt was lower.\n\n  That is what they call the ``crowding out effect.'' So if the Federal \nGovernment is borrowing all of this money, it makes it harder and more \nexpensive for the private sector to do the borrowing they need, and \nthere is a crowding-out effect and a depressing effect on economic \ngrowth.\n  America's massive debt is already hurting our economy. It is \nexacerbating the already difficult situation that people are \nexperiencing when they are looking for work and they can't find work, \nand the problem will get worse, not better, as time goes by because we \nhave seen the difference inflation, growth, and interest rates can \nhave, which can allow this to spiral out of control. That doesn't even \naddress the other concerns many of us have about the unsustainability \nof Medicare and Social Security. These are sacred promises we made to \nour seniors; that those programs would be there for them once they \nreach a qualifying age, and they will not be, on the current track. \nThese young people, I doubt any of them believe Social Security or \nMedicare will be there for them. We have a way to deal with that today \nif we will simply take advantage of that opportunity.\n  I wish to note that every single Member of the Republican caucus has \ncosponsored a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I hear it \nfrom Members of my own party who have said: You guys weren't all that \ngreat when you were in charge; you guys spent money we didn't have, and \nthat is true. We were pikers by comparison, because back in 1997, the \ndebt was $5.3 trillion--$5.3 trillion in 1997. That was the last time \nwe had a vote in the Senate on a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, and we came within one vote of passing a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. But today the debt is $17 trillion-\nplus--$17.2 trillion. The President says our debt is on a sustainable \npath. It is not true. It is whistling past the graveyard and it is \nendangering our prosperity and our opportunity, not only for the \nyounger generation but for people today who want to find work and want \nto provide for their families and pursue their version of the American \ndream.\n  We can't defy the laws of fiscal gravity forever, and we can't expect \nto keep piling up debt without damaging our economy.\n  I expect next week Senator Sanders of Vermont will bring a bill to \nthe floor ostensibly to help our veterans--something we all support--\nbut which is unpaid for and would add roughly $25 billion--at least $25 \nbillion--to the national debt. We just can't keep doing this day after \nday after day without enormous risk.\n  I see my colleague from New Hampshire on the floor, so I will close \nwith this thought: Here are the sad facts since President Obama took \noffice in January of 2009--admittedly coming off of a fiscal crisis at \na very bad place for our economy. This is his record over the last 5 \nyears: The number of long-term unemployed has increased by close to 1.2 \nmillion people--increased--and the labor force participation rate I \nmentioned a moment ago has fallen by 2.9 percent. There are 2.9 percent \nfewer Americans actually looking for work today than there were in \nJanuary of 2009.\n  Here is another sad statistic: Since January 2009, the average amount \nof time the unemployed have been without a job has nearly doubled. \nPeople have doubled the time they have been out of work, looking for \nwork, since January 2009, rising from 19.8 weeks to 37 weeks.\n  The number of people on food stamps has increased by 48.3 percent, \nreaching 37.4 million people in October. In 2008, the total cost of the \nFood Stamp Program--something we all support as a safety net program \nfor the most vulnerable--but we spent $37 billion in 2008, and now it \nhas more than doubled to almost $80 billion. This is under President \nObama's 5 years in office.\n  The number of people receiving Social Security disability has \nincreased from 7.4 million people to 8.9 million. Meanwhile, the total \nnumber of Social Security disability beneficiaries, including spouses \nand children of disabled workers receiving benefits, has increased from \n9.3 million to roughly 11 million.\n  This is not the way it is supposed to be. I know everyone who is out \nof a job wants a job and the dignity and the self-respect that comes \nwith it. Certainly we need to protect people who are at risk of falling \nthrough the safety net, but more than anything we need to give them the \nopportunity to get back to work and to provide for their family, put \nfood on the table. We can't be content with the status quo, with huge \namounts of money being spent on disability, huge amounts of money being \nspent on food stamps, and huge amounts of money being paid to people \nwho can't even find a job.\n  We have to get our economy growing again so these folks can lift \nthemselves up and get back in the workforce and provide for their \nfamilies and pursue their dreams.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I came to the floor because later today \nthe Senate will vote on a short-term extension of emergency \nunemployment benefits for thousands of citizens in New Hampshire--\nhundreds of thousands; really over 1 million throughout the country--\nwho are being hurt right now by our failure to act to extend \nunemployment benefits.\n  I have heard from a number of New Hampshire constituents since the \nunemployment insurance extension expired back in December. They make \nthe case much more eloquently than I can about why we need to extend \nthese unemployment benefits. I will read some excerpts from some of \nthose letters.\n  One of my constituents is a 62-year-old woman from Windham, and she \nexplained that despite her best efforts she will be one of the many \nlong-term unemployed without any unemployment benefits if she doesn't \nfind a job by March. She began working at age 8 delivering papers with \nher brother. She put herself through college and earned a master's \ndegree with the help of her employer. She wrote:\n\n\n[[Page S784]]\n\n\n       I am not too proud to do any honest job. I am losing my \n     house and can't afford to pay my mortgage any longer. There \n     are so many of us out there.\n\n  Another woman from Windham wrote to me. She is 55 years old. She has \nheld a job since she was 16. Last August, she was laid off in a merger. \nShe has been actively seeking a job in her field, which is health care. \nShe explained that her unemployment check has helped her pay for her \nessential living expenses. She and her sister take care of their 90-\nyear-old parents in their home, and this income is critical not just to \nher livelihood but to the care of her parents.\n  Then we heard from a 58-year-old woman from Merrimack who learned she \nlost her job in May of 2013 and has had nine interviews but no offers. \nWithout unemployment assistance, she will not be able to afford her car \npayment, her mortgage, food or utilities.\n  A constituent wrote to me explaining that after 29 years as a \nteacher, that teaching job has been eliminated. She has been on \nunemployment since June. She has applied for nearly 100 jobs. Think \nabout just getting up every day, trying to figure out where you can \napply to just have a shot at getting back to work. Her savings are \nexhausted. She is on the verge of losing her house since her \nunemployment benefits--her only source of income--have expired. She \nwrote:\n\n       This seems unfair to me. Having worked hard and been a \n     taxpayer into the system all my working life, I fail to see \n     how not extending benefits will be beneficial to me and the \n     1.3 million other Americans, especially in light of an \n     already fragile economy. Please do your best to remember \n     those of us who never planned to have to depend on \n     unemployment for this long, but who have fallen victims to \n     these times.\n\n  Then I did a tele-townhall conference on Monday night. I heard from \nthousands of people across New Hampshire. One of the people I heard \nfrom was a woman named Kathy from Danbury. She told me she had worked \nsince she was 14 and she is now out of a job. Her unemployment benefits \nhave expired and she doesn't know what she is going to do.\n  We need to think about Kathy and all of the people whom we are \nhearing from in our offices. We are supposed to represent the people \nwho need help across this country. My constituents are exactly right. \nWe are threatening the fragile economic recovery by failing to extend \nunemployment insurance.\n  The Economic Policy Institute estimates that the expiration of \nunemployment insurance is going to cost the economy an additional \n310,000 jobs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that each \ndollar we spend on extending unemployment insurance generates about \n$1.50 in economic growth. We learned this week that failing to act has \nalready drained more $2.2 billion from the economy, including $1.8 \nmillion from New Hampshire, not to mention all of the people whose \npersonal stories are tragic because they want to work, they are out of \na job through no fault of their own, and we need to provide them some \nassistance while they try and get back on their feet, so they do not \nlose their homes, so they do not lose their cars, so they can put food \non their tables.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to come together today. It is time for us to \nact, to support an extension of unemployment insurance. I certainly \nhope we are going to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania and I be permitted to engage in a colloquy as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              Small Business Tax Certainty and Growth Act\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the ongoing debate on unemployment \ncompensation shines a spotlight on the underlying problem; that is, \nextremely sluggish job growth in our still-lagging economy. Putting \npeople to work is my number one goal.\n  As American families continue to struggle to get the jobs they need \nat the wages they deserve, it is more important than ever for Members \non both sides of the aisle to come together on legislation to promote \neconomic growth and job creation. Today, I am pleased to join my good \nfriend and colleague Mr. Casey to discuss our legislation to do exactly \nthat: the Small Business Tax Certainty and Growth Act, which we \nintroduced last year. Our bipartisan legislation focuses on areas of \nconsensus that both parties can embrace to rekindle opportunity by \nhelping small employers start up or grow and create or add good-paying \njobs.\n  It is often said that small businesses are our Nation's job creators, \nand the data bear that out. According to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, small businesses generated 65 percent of the net new jobs \nthat were created between 1993 and 2009. Together, America's small \nbusinesses employ nearly half of our Nation's workers and generate half \nof our Nation's GDP.\n  Even the smallest employers have a huge impact on our economy; 18 \npercent of all private-sector employees work for businesses with fewer \nthan 20 workers.\n  Senator Casey and I recognize that employers cannot grow and add jobs \nunless they have the money to invest in building and expanding their \nbusinesses. That is why our bill focuses on making it easier for them \nto plan their capital investments and aims to reduce the burden and \nuncertainty of taxation, all in the name of creating jobs.\n  Let me explain a few of the provisions of our bill.\n  First, let me start by stating the obvious: Starting a new business \nthat can hire workers costs money. Our bill eases the tax burden on new \nemployers by permanently doubling the deduction for start-up expenses \nfrom $5,000 to $10,000.\n  There are two other provisions in our bill that affect employers both \nlarge and small that we propose to extend: first, the so-called bonus \ndepreciation, and second, the 15-year depreciation for improvements to \nrestaurants and retail facilities. Unfortunately, these important \nprovisions were allowed to expire at the end of last year, causing \ngreat uncertainty and thus discouraging investment and the creation of \njobs.\n  Just think about this: The law has reverted to a provision that says \nthat a restaurant has to depreciate its renovations over 39 years. Can \nyou imagine a restaurant waiting to renovate only once every 39 years \nbecause it is going to take that long to write off, to depreciate the \ncost? The 15-year depreciation schedule for improvements is far more \nrealistic.\n  Our bill also provides certainty for small employers who use section \n179 of the tax code. That is the small business expensing provision. \nRecent studies by the National Federation of Independent Business, \nNFIB, which has endorsed our bill, show that the constant changes in \nthe tax code are among the top concerns of small business owners. \nIndeed, I think the Senator from Pennsylvania and I have both found in \ntalking to smaller employers in our States that they are yearning for \nsome certainty in tax policy. They simply cannot deal with a tax code \nwhere one year the deduction is at one level, and the very next year it \nis uncertain whether Congress is going to renew the provision or let it \nexpire.\n  The level of expensing allowed under section 179 has been \nunpredictable from year to year, and has changed four times in the past \n7 years. This uncertainty makes it difficult or even impossible for \nsmall employers to take full advantage of this tax incentive in their \nlong-term investment planning. Our bill would fix this problem by \nmaking the maximum expensing allowable under this section permanent at \n$250,000 and indexing it for inflation. We also expand the ability of \nsmall employers to use simplified methods of accounting.\n  Let me give a real-life example of what the small business expensing \nand the bonus depreciation provisions can mean. Last year I spoke with \nRob Tod, the founder of Allagash Brewing Company, which is based in \nPortland, ME. Allagash makes some of the best craft beer in the \ncountry. In fact, Maine is known for its craft beers. Well, Rob's \noperation started out as a one-man show in 1995. In the 19 years since, \nit has grown into a firm that employs approximately 65 people and \ndistributes craft beer throughout the United States.\n  Rob noted to me that his company's ability to expand was fueled in \npart by bonus depreciation and section 179 expensing. New to the craft \nbeer business,\n\n[[Page S785]]\n\nRob had difficulty obtaining financing on favorable terms, but these \ncost recovery provisions allowed him to pay less in taxes in the years \nhe acquired the equipment needed to expand his business. Those tax \nsavings were then reinvested in his business, thus creating jobs.\n  Just think about that. What a difference these provisions made to \nthis company, which has gone from a one-man operation to employing 65 \npeople. This economic benefit is multiplied when you consider the \neffect of Allagash's investment on the equipment manufacturers, the \ntransportation companies needed to haul new equipment to his brewery, \nthe increased inventory, and the suppliers of the materials needed to \nbrew additional beer.\n  We are all too familiar with the litany of polls showing how little \nfaith the American people have in their elected leaders and how much \nthey want us to work together to solve our Nation's problems.\n  I have been privileged to work with Senator Casey to do exactly that. \nThe legislation that we have introduced is neither a Republican nor a \nDemocratic proposal. It is, instead, a bipartisan plan to help spur \nAmerica's economy, to assist our small employers, and, most of all, to \ncreate good-paying jobs. I urge my colleagues to support our bipartisan \nbill. I would ask our leadership to bring this legislation to restore \neconomic growth and job opportunity to the Senate floor for action as \nsoon as possible.\n  I yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania for his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I first want to commend and salute the work \nthat has been done already on this legislation by the senior Senator \nfrom Maine and for her leadership. Senator Collins appropriately \nfocused on the issue of jobs and jobs creation.\n  I know in our State at present we are finally below the half million \nunemployed number. We went many months where the unemployment rates \nwent as high as 550,000 people. It went down, but it hovered around \nhalf a million people for far too many months. We are below that. Now \nwe are at about 443,000. That is still a big number--below 7 percent \nbut just by a little bit.\n  So job creation has to be job one for me and for most of us if not \nall of us in the Senate. If that is the reality, that our No. 1 \nobligation is job creation, we have to be able to show the people we \nrepresent that we are doing something about it. We cannot do much of \nanything unless we can get bipartisan cooperation. That is why I am so \ngrateful Senator Collins has been willing to work with me on this \nlegislation and to move it forward and to come together as a team to \nsay to both of our leaders that we want to have legislative action on \nthis bill this year.\n  The reasons are pretty fundamental. If you have run a small business, \nyou know what we are talking about. But even if you have not, even if \nyou have not had that experience, you have encountered the challenges \nthat small business owners face. In some cases it is not just \nchallenges; it is real anxiety and worry that is compounded by \nuncertainty.\n  There is uncertainty created by what does not happen in Washington or \nwhat does happen. When you shut the government down, that creates not \njust uncertainty but more than that. But there is also uncertainty when \nthey do not see action here to bring the sides together. I am sure the \nPresiding Officer, who served as mayor of a big city, knows what it is \nlike to talk to small business owners and to hear about their \nstruggles, which have been especially acute in this very tough economy.\n  One part of their struggle is that even if they can identify the \nproblem and even maybe the solution to rectify the problem, they cannot \nhire a team of accountants or lawyers or tax professionals or \nconsultants to help them. They often have to do these things on their \nown. Giving them some measure of certainty as it relates to tax policy \nwould help enormously.\n  So that is why we came together on the bill, the Small Business Tax \nCertainty and Growth Act. Senator Collins outlined some of the \nprovisions. Let me just go through a couple of them by way of either \nreiteration or reemphasis.\n  One she mentioned is the 15-year depreciation, what is sometimes \nreferred to as the 15-year straight line depreciation schedule for \nrestaurants. Why would we go back to the old policy which was that you \nhad to get your increment--or piece of benefit I would call it--of \ndepreciation in little slices over 39 years.\n  Why not keep it at 15 years so that business owners know in each of \nthose 15 years they are going to have a negative depreciation. It is a \nmore realistic reflection of the useful economic life of the qualifying \nasset. It makes all the sense in the world to have that in place.\n  Senator Collins also mentioned faster cost recovery that is reflected \ndirectly in a company's bottom line. It frees up cash that can be used \nto expand business operations and hire new workers. These tax \nprovisions can actually allow folks to have the capacity to hire new \nworkers. This is especially important in the restaurant industry which \nsupports--get this number--535,000 jobs in Pennsylvania alone. That \nnumber is 13.5 million jobs nationwide in the restaurant industry.\n  A study by the National Restaurant Association found that uncertainty \nabout depreciation--the very thing we are talking about--and other tax \nprovisions forced restaurants to forego improvement projects that would \nhave produced around 200,000 jobs nationwide. So just one provision \nabout one type of uncertainty could unleash substantial job creation.\n  Secondly, the maximum allowable deduction, the so-called 179 \nexpensing. Again, why should a business that is already under \ntremendous pressure to meet a bottom line, to be able to deliver a \nproduct or a service, and has all of those pressures--why should that \nbusiness not have the certainty to know that this year and next year \nand for as long as they are in business, they can depend upon, rely \nupon a deduction level that is set at $250,000 instead of fluctuating \nas that number has fluctuated.\n  So making that deduction permanent is critically important. This \nsection, this so-called section 179, allows taxpayers to fully deduct \ncertain capital asset purchases in the year that they make the \npurchase. This type of extension provides an important incentive for \nbusinesses to make capital investments. We want them to make those \ninvestments. But we cannot just say to them: Go ahead and make that \ninvestment, and we hope we can help you in some uncertain way.\n  We need to tell them that the rules of the road are going to be much \nmore certain. That is the one provision that we believe should be made \npermanent.\n  The deduction under this section 179 has changed three times in the \npast 6 years. This unpredictably makes it difficult for businesses to \nplan, for obvious reasons, and neutralizes much of the impact. It is \nnot worth much if you are not sure it is going to be in place the next \nyear. So by making it permanent and indexing it to inflation is a very \nimportant point.\n  By indexing it, the bill provides the kind of certainty that \nbusinesses need to take full advantage so that they can hire more \nworkers--just what we are hoping they will do and just what we hope we \ncan help them do.\n  A third provision, the so-called bonus depreciation, would help small \nbusinesses in much the same way as the expensing rules I just talked \nabout. The bonus depreciation allows companies to expense half the \ncost. Imagine that--half the cost of qualifying assets that they buy \nand put into service in the same year. It provides an added incentive. \nAgain, that word is important because we try to put Tax Code provisions \nin place that incentivize the kinds of actions that lead to job growth.\n  Here are two studies I will cite quickly. In a 2013 report the U.S. \nTreasury Office of Tax Analysis concluded that this particular \nprovision, the 50-percent bonus depreciation policy, increased small \nbusiness investment by 31.2 percent between 2008 and 2009. Whether you \ncount that as 2 or 3 years, it is a rather short time period. That \nprovision alone, that bonus depreciation, increased small business \ninvestment by more than 31 percent.\n  A separate report from the same department, the Treasury Department, \nsaid that this provision lowered the cost of capital by 44.1 percent. \nSo no matter how you measure it, this bonus\n\n[[Page S786]]\n\ndepreciation policy works. It creates jobs, and it will keep working if \nwe put it in place and provide added incentive.\n  Two more provisions on deductions for start-up expenses are very \nimportant. In the accounting rules--we have heard this for years--just \nby doubling that threshold level for one particular type of accounting \nand allowing firms to have more leeway with those accounting rules, \nthey will have much more certainty and a much better policy.\n  In 2010, another study by the Kauffman Foundation found that start-\nups and young firms were responsible for most of the job growth in our \neconomy, creating 3 million jobs per year on average.\n  So when you add up all of this, it is really about common sense. I do \nnot say that in a theoretical way. We know these provisions work. We \nare certain of that. There is no dispute that each of those policies is \ndirectly responsible for substantial job growth. So that is the first \nthing we know. Second, we know they are supported across the board by \nboth parties.\n  Every Member of the Senate, even the newest Members, at one time or \nanother has either voted for one of these provisions or supported it. \nSo it makes sense in terms of the dynamic of how to get bipartisan \nlegislation done here. We should put ourselves as best we can to stand, \nso-called, in the shoes of others. We should try to stand in the shoes \nof small business owners, try to understand what they are up against, \nand try to understand some of the pressures they face.\n  One of the most difficult problems they face is something as simple \nas uncertainty. Putting these provisions in place would remove a \nsubstantial degree of uncertainty. If we can do that, they can unleash \njob creation the likes of which we probably have not seen in the last \ncouple of years.\n  I am grateful that Senator Collins was willing to work with me to \nmove forward with this bipartisan legislation which will be an \neffective and a proven creator of jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from \nPennsylvania for his remarks. I think it is obvious that both of us \nhave reached out to employers in our States and asked them what would \nmake a difference. What would allow you to create new jobs, preserve \nthe ones you have, and pay your workers more?\n  To a person, they identified provisions in the Tax Code, the \nuncertainty that occurs when they expire, the difficulty to plan and to \nhire new workers when you do not know what the Tax Code is going to be. \nThat formed the basis for our bipartisan bill. We listened to what \nemployers were telling us. I hope more of our colleagues will help us \nbring this bill to the Senate floor.\n  Every day that I am talking to an employer in Maine, I am asked: Are \nthe provisions that expired at the end of last year going to be \nrenewed? Will they be retroactive? Can we count on them?\n  They put their hiring plans on hold until we give them the certainty \nthat they deserve. So, again, it has been a great honor to work with my \ncolleague. I do urge our leaders to bring this important bill to the \nSenate floor.\n  Madam President, I do have another statement that I would like to \ngive seeing no one seeking the Senate floor. I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Russell Currier\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, the world's best athletes have come \ntogether in Sochi, Russia, for the 22nd Winter Olympic Games. Among \nthem is Russell Currier, from the small northern Maine town of \nStockholm. It is in Aroostook County. It is very near Caribou where I \ngrew up. I rise today to celebrate the determination, hard work, and \ncommunity spirit that enables Russell Currier to represent our great \ncountry in the Olympic Games.\n  Russell competes in the biathlon, the demanding and increasingly \npopular sport that combines cross-country skiing with sharpshooting. He \nsecured his place on America's team by winning three out of four \nqualifying races in January at the U.S. biathlon Olympic trials.\n  But Russell's snow-covered trail to Russia began long before that. \nFourteen years ago, as a seventh grader, he joined the local Nordic \nskiing program. A former coach described him as a quiet youngster with \nno particular interest in the sport.\n  That quickly changed. The next year, Russell won a county-wide middle \nschool championship. The year after that, he won third place at the \njunior nationals. Caring coaches and encouraging teammates lit a fire \nin him that burns so brightly today.\n  On Russell's personal profile on the U.S. Olympic Team Web site, he \nwrote that his favorite quote is, ``Less talking, more doing.'' He has \nembraced that motto with all of his strength, and his perseverance has \nturned his Olympic dream into a goal he has achieved.\n  I have a particular rooting interest in Russell's success. He and his \nparents, Debbie and Chris, are graduates of Caribou High School, as am \nI. Debbie and I grew up spending summers at Madawaska Lake at camps \nthat were very near each other, and we spent endless summers playing \ntogether. I have known this wonderful family for many years, and I am \nthrilled for them. While the world watches the Winter Olympics, the \nentire population of Aroostook County and indeed of all of Maine will \nbe riveted to the biathlon competition.\n  As the name suggests, the town of Stockholm, ME, was settled by \nSwedish immigrants. When the first 21 families came to Aroostook County \nin the 1870s, they brought with them an unsurpassed work ethic, a \nstrong sense of community, and a love of skiing. In fact, the entire \nski industry of Maine, both Nordic and alpine, can be traced to these \nhardy, outdoors-loving newcomers.\n  Nearly a century and a half later, the work ethic and the love of \nskiing remains strong, and the sense of community is more powerful than \never. When Russell won his place on the U.S. team, friends and \nneighbors held a fundraiser, a spaghetti dinner at Caribou High School, \nserving up more than 300 spaghetti dinners so Russell's parents, Debbie \nand Chris, could make the long and expensive trip to Russia to cheer on \ntheir son.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article the \nlocal newspaper, the Aroostook Republican, published on the community's \nsupport behind the Currier family.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Aroostook Republican]\n\n                 Benefit Supper Sends Curriers to Sochi\n\n                          (By Theron Larkins)\n\n       Caribou.--By now, Russell Currier is a household name for \n     residents all over Aroostook County and Sunday night was a \n     time to congratulate and support his family, as many County \n     residents attended a benefit supper held at the Caribou High \n     School.\n       The goal of the event was to raise enough money through \n     donations to send Russell's parents to Sochi, Russia, where \n     they will soon be able to watch their son compete for Olympic \n     gold. Thanks to hundreds, who came from all over Aroostook \n     County to attend the benefit, well over $6,000 was raised to \n     send Debbie and Chris Currier to the Sochi Winter Games.\n       There were a number of students, 'teachers and community \n     members who volunteered at the event. Whether volunteers were \n     serving food, taking donations, or playing piano in the \n     background, the towns of greater Caribou were well \n     represented, as citizens came to show their support and \n     appreciation for the pride Russell has brought to the region.\n       One Stockholm resident, who came out to show his support \n     was Russell's former coach and director of competitive \n     programs for Maine Winter Sports Center, Will Sweetser, \n     Sweetser coached Russell since junior high, but he certainly \n     recognized Russell's success was aided by much more than just \n     his coach, es.\n       ``They say it takes a community to raise an athlete, and I \n     think you can really see that in this room today,'' said \n     Sweetser.\n       Currier, who is already training for the Winter Games, in \n     Italy, could not be in attendance at the supper, due to the \n     rigorous schedule typical of any Olympic athlete. However, \n     that didn't hinder the community's reminiscing. Friends and \n     family stayed well beyond the supper's two-hour allotted time \n     to eat and share their stories about a young Russell, as they \n     watched a slideshow of photos capturing the native son not \n     only on the slopes, but in a number of candid moments, as \n     well.\n       ``A lot of people I've seen here tonight, throughout \n     Russell's entire career, have given pretty selflessly and \n     everyone is really excited to see him reach this point,'' \n     said Sweetser.\n\n[[Page S787]]\n\n       As Sweetser pointed out, a large number came out to back \n     the Currier family during this hectic time. The last few \n     weeks have been overwhelming for all of us, as Debbie \n     Currier, told many attendees, but the community coming \n     together in such a way has undoubtedly helped cope with the \n     stress.\n       ``It's wonderful, it really is,'' said Debbie. ``I see all \n     the faces who have come out to support us, a lot of the \n     parents who had children that grew up playing sports with \n     either my daughter or Russell, they've all just been so \n     supportive over the years. Since this whole thing started \n     we've been able to go to all the venues in different towns \n     and meet all the people who are part of the skiing community, \n     and it's really awesome that so many came,'' she added.\n       When asked how special it would be for Russell to have his \n     parents able to attend such a major event, Debbie's reply may \n     not have been what would expect.\n       ``Well, in the beginning he didn't really want us to come, \n     That's why, originally, we didn't have plans to go,'' she \n     said. ``But, I wanted to go so badly. I think he's kind of \n     worried. We are not travelers. We've never been to any of his \n     races outside of Maine and New Brunswick, so our very first \n     event to go to in Europe will he the Olympics, and it's in \n     Russia at a time when things are so unsettled.''\n       The concern over the last few weeks in relation to \n     continuous terrorist threats, in Russia, may be worrisome for \n     many, but 10,000 Americans are still expected to make their \n     way to snowy Sochi for the event. A spate of suicide bombings \n     and jihadist threats during the last months have left \n     potential travelers wary of attending the Winter Games but \n     Russian and American security forces are vehemently working \n     to put minds at ease.\n       Many precautions are being taken, not only by Vladimir \n     Putin's specially assigned task forces, but the U.S. will \n     also deploy two Navy ships to the Black Sea to evacuate \n     Americans should an incident occur.\n       The concerns regarding safety at the upcoming Winter Games \n     is certainly something that neither Russell, nor his parents \n     are overlooking, but for the most part the Curriers have \n     faith in the joint effort, between the Russians and \n     Americans, to keep athletes and spectators safe. Security \n     within the Olympic circle remains extremely tight, yet \n     there's still concern pertaining to transit points and \n     scanning areas leading into the venue. If nothing else, the \n     terrorist threats have succeeded in creating an atmosphere of \n     paranoia that is tainting what has always been a jovial \n     celebration of sport and country.\n       Andrew Kuchins of the Center for Strategic & International \n     Studies in Washington told journalists recently that Russian \n     authorities want to handle security alone, even though the \n     country ``has no experience with an event of this \n     magnitude.''\n       Thousands of tickets have yet to be sold for numerous \n     events in Sochi and there is a growing concern that the \n     increase in security will disturb the very nature of the \n     Games. While no country has yet withdrawn from the Games, \n     many are taking extra precautions, including the U.S. Olympic \n     Committee, which will be providing its own set of protective \n     agents and has advised American athletes against wearing any \n     clothing that may identify them as part of the team.\n       ``I think it worries him, but it worries us that he's there \n     too,'' said Debbie Currier.\n       Despite the negative publicity and numerous threats \n     surrounding the Games there is a sense that authorities are \n     doing everything possible to keep the event a celebration \n     rather than a tragedy, and Debbie and the rest of the Currier \n     family are confident that everything will go according to \n     plan.\n       The U.S. Biathlon Association sent out some information to \n     help guide us and they seem to think it's safe enough. They \n     believe that Russian and American authorities are doing \n     everything they can to keep us all safe.''\n       The Curriers are planning to leave Caribou on Feb. 5th and \n     hope to be landing in Moscow sometime late the next day.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Russell's dedication and his community spirit have a \nstrong ally in this remarkable story, the Maine Winter Sports Center. \nThe center was founded in 1999, with the purpose of rekindling \nAroostook County's skiing heritage, spurring economic development in \nthat rural region, bringing families together in wholesome recreation, \nand countering the sedentary lifestyle that leads to so many health \nproblems among our greater population. The Center's world-class \nfacilities in Fort Kent and Presque Isle, ME, have hosted national and \ninternational cross-country and biathlon competitions. For the 2006 and \n2010 Olympics, 13 Members of the U.S. biathlon team trained at the \nMaine Winter Sports Center, but Russell is the first homegrown Olympian \nto come up entirely through the center's program.\n  Russell Currier demonstrates that growing up in a community that \nworks hard and works together can be such a great advantage when \ncombined with individual desire, determination, and skill. The success \nRussell has achieved in realizing his Olympic dream and the support \nalong the way that he has received are truly inspiring.\n  I am so proud of Russell and all who helped him achieve his dream. I \nwish him and his teammates all the best.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Eightieth Anniversary of the ``first tva city''\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I rise today to commemorate a special \noccasion for the Tennessee Valley Authority and the city of Tupelo, MS.\n  Eighty years ago, on February 7, 1934, Tupelo, MS, became the first \ncity to receive electricity from the Tennessee Valley Authority. If you \nvisit today, you will see the sign at the intersection of Gloster and \nMain Streets proclaiming Tupelo as the ``First T-V-A City.''\n  Tupelo's connection to TVA power has had a tremendous impact, \nimproving the quality of life and economic well-being for residents of \nTupelo, the State of Mississippi, and across the South. The success \nhelped Northeast Mississippi become a pioneer of rural electrification. \nAs a resident of Tupelo myself, I am proud of the partnership \nMississippi has built with TVA over the past eight decades.\n  Anyone who has experienced a power outage can attest to our reliance \non electricity today. It touches almost every aspect of our lives. But \nimagine a time when access to electricity was confined to major cities \nand densely populated areas. Luxuries such as the radio, the washing \nmachine, and the refrigerator were known only to those who lived in \ncities because it was not profitable for energy companies to provide \nelectricity to rural areas.\n  In those days, the difference between life with electricity and life \nwithout it was so great that a large migration was taking place from \nrural to urban areas. Already impoverished regions of the country were \nat risk of lagging even further behind.\n  Like much of the rural South, Mississippi struggled with restricted \naccess to electricity and the economic limitations it perpetuated. It \nbecame clear that improving rural life depended on access to \nelectricity.\n  By 1930 nearly 85 percent of homes in large urban areas had \nelectrical service, but barely 10 percent of rural homes had the same \naccess. In Mississippi, only 1.5 percent of farm homes had \nelectricity--the lowest in the country.\n  The creation of the TVA was a game changer. As America spiraled into \na devastating depression, Mississippi Congressman John Rankin worked \nwith Nebraska Senator George William Norris to improve and expand rural \nelectrification. The result of their efforts was the TVA Act, passed by \nCongress on May 18, 1933. TVA began serving Mississippians in 1933 and \npowering Tupelo in 1934. The goal was simple: to improve the living and \neconomic conditions of seven Southeastern States. By providing \naffordable electricity to rural communities, TVA was an important \neconomic boost, delivering a needed commodity to one of the country's \npoorest regions.\n  Tupelo's proximity to the Wilson Dam on the Tennessee River enabled \nit to become the first TVA city in 1934, allowing its residents to \npurchase electricity at some of the most affordable rates in the \ncountry. This completely revolutionized life for the citizens of Tupelo \nand even more Mississippians as TVA expanded.\n  About 50 miles north of Tupelo, the town of Corinth, MS, was also at \nthe forefront of rural electrification, proving that an electric power \ncooperative could work. In McPeters Furniture Store, ``The Corinth \nExperiment'' led to the creation of the Alcorn County Electric Power \nAssociation--the first electric power cooperative in the United States.\n  In November of 1934 President Franklin Delano Roosevelt came to \nNortheast Mississippi, stopping in Corinth and Tupelo. We still talk \nabout that visit today.\n  The effort and dedication of the communities in Northeast Mississippi \npaid off. From 1930 to 1940 the number of farm homes in the State with \nelectricity skyrocketed from 4,792 to 27,670. Today TVA provides \nreliable, clean,\n\n[[Page S788]]\n\nlow-cost energy to more than 332,000 households in Mississippi.\n  The TVA of 1934 is much different from the Tennessee Valley Authority \nof 2014. Eighty years ago hydroelectric dams provided TVA's power. \nSince then, TVA has developed coal, nuclear, natural gas, and renewable \nenergy--all of the above serving approximately 9 million customers in \nseven States.\n  I look forward to TVA's continued success, and I congratulate the \nmany Mississippians who have contributed to the legacy of TVA over the \npast 80 years.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \ncalling on the Senate to pass an extension of emergency unemployment \ninsurance. I am deeply disappointed and frustrated that millions of \nhard-working Americans are now wondering how they will put food on \ntheir family's table and a roof over their heads because Washington has \nbeen unable to extend critical unemployment insurance.\n  A few weeks ago we had a bipartisan vote to move forward with debate \non the extension of what is called emergency unemployment compensation. \nI hope we can build on that vote and move forward as quickly as \npossible to restore this vital lifeline before more Americans who have \nworked hard and followed the rules their entire lives slip from middle \nclass into poverty.\n  The expiration of emergency unemployment insurance is an urgent \nproblem for tens of thousands of Minnesotans and for millions of \nAmericans. At the end of this past year, unemployment insurance expired \nfor 1.3 million Americans, including 8,500 Minnesotans. If we don't \nrenew that unemployment insurance over the next year, this lifeline \nwill run out for another 3.6 million Americans, including 65,500 \nMinnesotans. These are real people. These are fathers and mothers. They \nare people whose families and local communities are struggling.\n  As I have traveled around Minnesota, I have had the chance to speak \nwith many of the Minnesotans who are affected by the expiration of \nunemployment insurance. It is not the fault of these people or these \nworkers who have lost their jobs.\n  Very often, these workers were just unlucky enough to be working in \nthe wrong sector of the economy at the wrong time. Sometimes they were \nfrom communities that lost a large employer.\n  A few weeks ago I held a roundtable with unemployed workers who have \nbeen helped by unemployment insurance. These are long-term unemployed. \nThere were also some workforce professionals who are helping these \nfolks and others find jobs in today's recovering economy. The \nunemployed women I spoke with--Ann, Amy, and Robin--had been working \nand paying taxes for unemployment insurance for decades. One of them is \nin her forties, a mom with two kids, one a 3-year-old. The other two \nwomen are older workers, one in her fifties, the other in her early \nsixties. The one in her fifties was a meeting planner. When the \nrecession hit, businesses cut costs by holding fewer meetings, and she \ncouldn't find a job in her field but is trying to find a job in any \nfield. These women had all been skilling up, getting the skills they \ncould to try to get an office job and be more conversant in Excel or \nsome computer program.\n  All the Minnesotans I have spoken with have been working hard to find \njobs, but they face a tough situation in our economy. In November the \nLabor Department reported that for every job opening there are almost \nthree people seeking jobs. That doesn't mean you will get a job if you \napply for three jobs. A few weeks ago a job counselor in Minnesota told \nme that there are often hundreds of applicants for every good job \nposting and that these jobs are often filled internally. I am glad \nbusinesses are hiring from within or promoting from within, but it is \nstories such as these that highlight why we need emergency \nunemployment--to help those workers who were working in a sector that \nhas experienced a major downturn or live in a community where it is \nparticularly hard to find a job and particularly if they are of a \ncertain age.\n  One of the women I met at the roundtable, Ann from Eden Prairie, had \nalso written me. What she told me really illustrates the situation so \nmany Minnesotans are facing. Ann wrote:\n\n       I have been extremely active in my job search, but have \n     regrettably not found new employment. My Minnesota \n     Unemployment Insurance ran out last week and I applied for \n     Federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation just this past \n     week . . . I ask you to please ask yourself what you would do \n     to provide for your family. I have a 9 year old daughter . . \n     . and a 3 year old son. I am the sole provider for my family \n     . . . I am not looking for a handout, nor do I believe that \n     staying on unemployment insurance is in my best interest. But \n     the $483 a week it provides will at least allow me to make my \n     mortgage payment.\n\n  Ann is remarkably articulate. She volunteers at her son's school, \npartly because she wants to be involved in her son's life but also to \nnetwork. One of the counselors there said: The hardest job there is is \nlooking for a job.\n  Minnesotans such as Ann and the millions of Americans around the \ncountry in the same situation have worked for decades. Every one of \nthese women had worked and been paying into unemployment insurance for \ndecades. They don't deserve to be punished or to lose their homes \nbecause they are unable to find a job within 26 weeks. Often, they need \nunemployment insurance so they can put gas in the car to look for a job \nor so they can keep their phone.\n  The economy is recovering, but things are still tough for many \npeople. Now is not the time to cut off unemployment insurance. Not only \nis unemployment still above average, but the long-term unemployed--\nworkers who have been looking for work for at least 6 months--make up \n37 percent of today's unemployed. Congress has never allowed extended \nunemployment insurance to expire when the long-term unemployment rate \nis as high as it is today. Today the 2.5-percent long-term unemployment \nrate is nearly double the level it was when previous emergency benefits \nwere allowed to expire, and the current unemployment rate of 6.7 \npercent is 1.1 percentage points higher than when George W. Bush signed \nthe current round of emergency unemployment compensation into law.\n  We know the unemployment crisis is not over. It remains a significant \nissue for workers, especially older workers, who experience longer \nperiods of unemployment than younger workers when they lose their jobs.\n  Extending unemployment insurance also makes economic sense. In 2011 \nthe Congressional Budget Office stated that aid to the unemployed is \namong the policies with ``the largest effects on output and employment \nper dollar of budgetary costs.'' CBO estimates that extending benefits \nthrough 2014 would help expand the economy and contribute to the \ncreation of an additional 200,000 jobs. The Council of Economic \nAdvisers estimates that without a full-year extension, the economy will \ngenerate 240,000 fewer jobs by the end of 2014.\n  Unemployment insurance has been shown to help people stay in the \nworkforce, allowing them to contribute to our economic recovery rather \nthan slip into poverty. The Census Bureau estimates that unemployment \nbenefits have kept 2.5 million people who are trying to stay in the \nworkforce out of poverty in 2012 alone and have kept 11 million \nunemployed workers out of poverty since 2008.\n  Extending unemployment insurance for those who need it is far from \nthe only thing we should be doing to help people get back to work. I \nhave spoken many times about one of my highest priorities in this \narea--addressing the skills gap by supporting workforce training \npartnerships between businesses and community and technical colleges. \nThere are other things we should be doing, such as rebuilding our \ninfrastructure. But it would be a tremendous mistake to fail to renew \nthe unemployment insurance that has lapsed.\n  People such as Ann and Robin and all those I meet around the State of \nMinnesota, and the millions of others around the country, when they are\n\n[[Page S789]]\n\nlooking really hard for work, are spending hours a day looking for \nwork, almost 24 hours a day because they keep their phones on. They are \nthinking about it constantly. Let's not pull the rug out from under \nthem now. They are trying to catch up in an economy that is recovering \nbut still has a long way to go. We shouldn't be jeopardizing their \nfamilies' economic security and we shouldn't be jeopardizing our \nNation's economic recovery with a shortsighted decision like letting \nthis critical safety net expire.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Tribute to Senator Max Baucus\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise to speak of my colleague, our \nfriend Senator Baucus, who hopefully will be confirmed by the Senate to \nhis new post in a few hours.\n  I have, of course, known Senator Baucus since I came to the Senate, \nbut even before, one of my first impressions of him was a picture of \nSenator Baucus in his white cowboy hat on his ranch in Montana. To me, \na kid from New York City, he looked like the Marlboro Man. He was \nhandsome and he was in the cowboy hat. So I said: Wow.\n  When I met Senator Baucus, I found his heart, his brain, and his soul \nwere every bit as good as the outside. He was a great leader of the \nFinance Committee. First, he had great intellect. Max Baucus would see \nan issue, understand the issue, and get to the heart of the issue \nquicker than almost anybody else. He understood the vagaries of \nlegislation, and he knew how to try to get things done. He always \nworked in a bipartisan way. He reached out to Republicans, and many \ncriticized him sometimes for doing it, but given the gridlock in this \nbody, in retrospect, everybody would think: Wow, that is what we should \nbe doing. And he tried and tried.\n  Of course, his crowning legislative achievement was health care. I \nknow there are some--particularly on the other side of the aisle--who \ncriticize it, but I have no doubt that Max Baucus will be regarded as a \ngiant in what he did in coming up with the health care reform bill. I \nhave no doubt that as the kinks are worked out and as the effort moves \nforward, it will be regarded as one of the pieces of landmark \nlegislation of this decade and this century, and it wouldn't have \nhappened without Max Baucus.\n  There are 37 million Americans who now have access to health \ninsurance, a whole generation of young adults who will be insured \nthrough the age of 26, and protection of all Americans with preexisting \nconditions because of the diligence, the never-give-up attitude Senator \nBaucus had. On so many other things in the bill--getting after the \nprivate insurance companies; now community health centers are providing \nhealth care for the poorest among us in a better way--this is one of \nmany issues on which Max Baucus took the lead.\n  As I say, he was a premier legislator, worked long and hard, figured \nout what he thought the right thing to do was, tried to get colleagues \nfrom the other side of the aisle as well as on our side of the aisle to \nsupport it, and then got it done. The list of his accomplishments is \nlong. He took the bull by the horns, never backing off.\n  I know Senator Baucus will be an outstanding ambassador to China. It \nis one of the most important foreign policy positions our country has \nto offer, and having someone with Max Baucus's acute mind, great \npersistence, good heart, and good soul will mean a lot.\n  Not only are we going to miss Max, we are going to very much miss his \nwife Mel. She is terrific. They met not too long ago, and I know how \nhappy they make each other. I think it makes all of us feel happy as \nwell.\n  Max, you are truly the best of the ``Last Best Place,'' and we will \nall miss you.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I rise to talk about the impact of the \nAffordable Care Act on the workplace. A report by the Congressional \nBudget Office came out yesterday stating that the number of jobs \naffected by the Affordable Care Act was triple what they estimated in \n2009. At that time they estimated this would cost us up to 800,000 \njobs. Yesterday they said it would cost us up to 2.3 million jobs. I \nguess those who voted for it didn't have an impartial observer tell \nthem that there would be substantial workplace costs. Now that same \ngroup, after looking at the application and how the law is going to \naffect people, says there will be three times as many jobs lost because \nof people moving from full-time work to part-time work.\n  This is another strong indication that the Affordable Care Act has \nnot been good for the workplace, and I think we are seeing more and \nmore that the Affordable Care Act is not good for most people. I am \nsure that out there somewhere--just the law of averages--there are \npeople who benefit. I think there are other ways we could have reached \nout to those people and included them.\n  I have some emails and letters that were addressed to my office that \nI will read into the Record. We verified all of the correspondence with \nthe people involved. We wanted to make sure we could use their first \nnames so I could talk about this, and I believe the people who wrote \nus--some stories are beyond belief--were well intentioned.\n  John, from Farmington, MO, said he is one of the founding \nshareholders for his company and has been since 1975. They provided \ninsurance for their employees and their families, but this year their \ninsurance person came to them and said there will be a 50-percent \nincrease when they renew their coverage later this year. In this small \ncompany, they are currently paying $12,000 a month and will be paying \n$18,000 a month. John says: We are a profitable business, but we are \nnot so profitable that $6,000 a month doesn't make a big difference to \nus when our insurance premiums go up 50 percent.\n  Lisa, in Baldwin, MO, said she is an insurance broker. She contacted \nus to talk about the examples many of her clients have had and the way \nthey were affected by the health care bill. This is one of her letters:\n\n       I have a family of five people--a husband, wife, and three \n     children--who were paying $437/month for a Health Savings \n     Account plan. Their rate for a comparable plan under ACA was \n     $805/month.\n\n  So that $437 this family was paying--if they replace that, along with \neverything else they are doing in a given month--is now $805.\n  She says:\n\n       I have quoted plans for numerous people over the last few \n     months. All have lesser benefits than what they currently \n     have and are far more expensive.\n\n  She doesn't say ``some,'' she says ``most.'' And this is coming from \nsomeone who does this for a living. She said that in every case she has \nquoted, there have been higher costs and fewer benefits.\n  William, from Desloge, MO, said that his wife had a pacemaker \ninstalled 3 years ago. He goes on to say:\n\n       Recently, she called to set up a follow-up checkup on the \n     pacemaker with her hospital. She was told that due to the \n     budget constraints placed on the hospital due to the \n     Affordable Care Act they no longer provide those services.\n\n  According to William, instead of driving 10 miles for these services, \nthey have to drive 60 miles one way. They have to drive 120 to 150 \nmiles to go to one of the places located in St. Louis when they used to \ndrive just 10 miles. The reason the hospital gave is that the \nAffordable Care Act has created that.\n  This is a letter from a broker:\n\n       I have a client in her late 50s who makes $20,000 and \n     qualifies for the subsidy. Even with the subsidy, her premium \n     was around $300 a month for the lowest possible level in the \n     plan.\n\n  I think that level is called the bronze plan. For the lowest level \nplan, her subsidy is $300 a month, and that was about 50 percent more \nthan she had been paying for comparable coverage.\n\n[[Page S790]]\n\n  Mark and Janet, from Platte City, MO, were informed in September 2013 \nthat as of January 1, 2014, their premiums would double. Here is what \nthey say in their letter:\n\n       While we do not think ObamaCare, as it now stands, is good \n     for this nation, at least it was an attempt to do something--\n\n  These are people who were hopeful about this and were still not \ncritical of people who were trying to do something--\n\n     about out-of-control medical costs. It needs serious \n     revisions and parts of it should be repealed. People in their \n     60s do not need maternity coverage! And mental health/\n     substance abuse coverage should not be mandatory either.\n\n  That is the view of Mark and Janet.\n  Mary Ann, in Scott City, MO, said she has had continuous health care \ncoverage for 36 years without ever having a day without health \ninsurance coverage. After being diagnosed with cancer, her insurance \nwas canceled and she was forced to get insurance somewhere else. Why \nwas her insurance canceled? She had been in the high-risk pool that the \nState runs.\n  In 2009 I proposed other ways to do this and expand those high-risk \npools. I think by the time the high-risk pool went out of existence on \nDecember 31, there were slightly more than 1,000 people still in it. I \nthink we are eventually going to get 4,000 letters. What were they \npaying? They were paying 135 percent of the premium everybody else was \npaying. They had a high risk already, and they were generally able to \ngo to the doctors they wanted. According to the letters we get, they \nare no longer able to go to the doctors they want. Doctors are \nimportant, but, frankly, doctors are even more important if you have \nbeen sick. If a doctor has been your doctor through an illness, that is \nsomething Mary Ann and others would like to have finished.\n  Let me read one other:\n\n       As of December 23rd, I was finally able to enroll. It's \n     costing me more and I'm getting less. Unbelievably, \n     healthcare.gov wouldn't allow me to enroll my healthy 18-\n     year-old son. I thought he was the healthy young person they \n     needed in order to make this program work.\n\n  That may have been a Web site problem. The Web site will be solved. \nThe President said the Web site is working exactly the way it is \nsupposed to, so maybe that has been solved.\n  I don't think the appeals process is working yet. I am told there are \na lot of people appealing information that somehow wrongly got into the \nWeb site. They can't get that solved.\n  Mary continues to say that the ACA has been a disaster for her and \nher family. She says: Shame on us for letting this happen. I want my \nold insurance back. I don't appreciate being mandated at the last \nminute to buy something that has inferior health coverage. It is \nadministratively inept and costs more. Please resolve this disaster \nbefore it gets worse.\n  Myron, from Hannibal, MO, says:\n\n       My company told me last November to go to my wife's group \n     health insurance plan because they didn't know how ObamaCare \n     was going to work out.\n       On advice from an insurance broker, my company got me off \n     their group policy. As a result, my health insurance premiums \n     went from $198 a month to $549 a month.\n\n  Natalie, from Meadville, says:\n\n       My health insurance costs for my family of four have \n     doubled and my benefits have decreased. I no longer have \n     office visit benefits and my deductible has gone from $3,500 \n     to $10,000.\n\n  She said that she raised her deductible to try to lower her insurance \npremiums.\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       At the end of 2014, when we are forced to sign up for an \n     Obamacare plan, we will probably cancel our insurance if it \n     is cheaper to pay the penalty.\n\n  I can't tell you how many letters we have that say: My premium has \ngone up and my benefits have gone down. There has been a huge number of \npeople who have contacted us about that.\n  Pat from Kansas City is worried about her kids, her oldest daughter, \nand her family. Her premium went from $5,000 to $10,000 a year.\n  Scott from Lee's Summit says his premium went up 27 percent for \nhimself and his son. He was told it would have gone up 7 percent \nanyway, but 20 percent of that 27 percent--or actually more than 20 \npercent--that 20 percent of the increase was because of the change in \nhealth care policies.\n  I think the more we know, the more we know the kinds of things we \ncould do to make the health care system work better. I would like to \nsee us get back to doing that. Until we do, these letters are going to \ncontinue to come in, and we are going to continue to try to help these \npeople find a better answer. But the government involvement here may \nmean there is not a better answer until the government figures out how \nto create a bigger marketplace and more choices and let people have the \nhealth care they think meets their family's needs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, what is the order of business right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the unemployment \ncompensation bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise to talk about the absolute \nnecessity to pass this unemployment compensation bill. We should do it \nbecause it is the morally right thing to do, it is the economically \nright thing to do. We have listened to our Republican friends, and even \nthough they always said in the past: Do not worry about paying for it--\nthey passed it almost five times under George Bush without paying for \nit--now all of a sudden they say: Pay for it. We do pay for it in this \nbill. So I do not know what it is they exactly want.\n  They claim they are empathetic to people unemployed, the long-term \nunemployed, and we know that rate is very high--long-term \nunemployment--even though we have seen in the last, I guess, how many \nmonths, 8 million jobs--in about 46 months--but not everybody is \nfortunate to get those jobs. Clearly, we came out of the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression, brought about by Wall Street. It \nhappened under George W. Bush. We were bleeding jobs--bleeding jobs--\n700,000, 800,000 jobs a month. It was frightening. The GDP was \ncontracting.\n  President Obama turned it around. I predict he will go down in \nhistory as one of the great Presidents because we were almost flat on \nour backs, and yet he acted. Luckily, we had a few Republicans who \nhelped us pass that stimulus, which in my State made a huge difference \nand all over the country. It got us on our feet. We have made reforms \nthat are very important.\n  I also have to say, the ``Bad News Bears'' on the other side--every \nday, negative stories and negative stories and negative stories about \nObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act. I daresay, they ignore the millions \nand millions and millions of Americans who for the first time are able \nto get affordable health insurance. It is private health insurance, not \na government-run system, except for the Medicaid part, which we \nexpanded. The exchanges are private insurance.\n  They are able to afford it because the way we wrote the bill there \nare subsidies for the middle class on those exchanges, which is making \nit affordable for people. You should see the letters I get. I have read \nmany of them and put them in the Record. People who had a preexisting \ncondition, who never could get health care before, they write me they \nare thanking God--thanking God--that we passed that bill. Their kids, \nwho were going to be thrown off their health care, are now on that \nhealth insurance until they are 26 years old. Being a woman is no \nlonger an excuse to have your rates doubled and tripled. It is not a \npreexisting condition to be a woman anymore. If you have diabetes or \nyou have had cancer, you still get your insurance. The insurance \ncompany cannot walk out on you just when you need it the most. Come on.\n  I say to my Republican friends, step up to the plate. Yes, we have \nkinks in the system. We knew that when we said: If you love your \ninsurance, you could keep it--I admit, I should have said: If it meets \nthe basic standards because we do not want people having junk policies. \nBut we fixed that. The President has stepped up to the plate and fixed \nthat.\n  So all they do is focus on the negative, while people are on their \nknees thanking God they have health care, many for the first time.\n  I am kind of stunned at it, really. I really am. We are ready, \nwilling, and able to fix whatever glitches there are, and the President \nhas been totally honest about the disastrous rollout. We\n\n[[Page S791]]\n\nunderstand that. Despite that, we have millions and millions of people \nwith new, affordable health care for the first time.\n  Now we look at extending emergency Federal unemployment insurance for \nthe long-term unemployed.\n  We did not act in December. That was a moral outrage. We did not have \nthe votes. The Republicans are filibustering. We need to get 60. So 1.7 \nmillion Americans have lost their extended benefits since the end of \nDecember. In my home State, 276,000 people have lost their extended \nunemployment benefits. Think about it: 276,000 Californians. Some of \nour States have populations of 600,000, 700,000--276,000 people just in \nCalifornia.\n  What does that mean? It means they are suffering. It means their \nfamilies are suffering. It means they are faced with disaster. It also \nmeans they cannot go down to the corner store, they cannot go fill \ntheir car with gas. They have all these problems and it trickles down \nthrough the community and the community is hurting. That is why we know \nour bill is so important, because it not only helps the individual, it \nhelps the communities.\n  We know--we know--that GDP is, in fact, affected if we do not act. \nLast month my colleagues on the other side blocked a one-year extension \nof unemployment benefits, even after we offered to pay for it. We gave \nthem votes on the amendments of their choice. We gave them everything \nthey asked for. It is never enough. We had one Republican Senator, and \nI thank Mr. Heller, who voted for cloture last month.\n  I just hope my colleagues will listen to the people and support this \nextension. I would like to, for my remaining time, read to you some of \nthe letters I am getting and emails I am getting from real people--real \npeople.\n\n  This is Kristen from Chatsworth:\n\n       I am writing you to please continue to help get an \n     extension on unemployment.\n       After working over ten years in the clerical field, I was \n     let go and was on unemployment. I have been constantly \n     searching for jobs and after rejection after rejection I have \n     not given up. It is scary to hear that my claim will be up \n     after 26 weeks of unemployment. I do not know how I will make \n     ends meet if they do not extend unemployment.\n       I know I am not alone on this subject and millions are as \n     scared as I am. I have never been on welfare or any \n     assistance even being a teenage mother.\n\n  My friends on the other side are always talking about how if a \nteenager gets pregnant, she should have the child. Here is someone who \ndid that. We should help this woman. We should help this woman.\n  Here is another one, Jay from Albany:\n\n       Please keep pushing for the unemployment extension. I am \n     one of those who were cut off in December. I'm 61, have 3 \n     college degrees and am a Vietnam-era veteran.\n\n  This is a man who is a Vietnam-era veteran. He has three college \ndegrees. This is what he says:\n\n       I am not a number or a lazy or stupid individual as some \n     Republicans would like you to believe. Those checks are our \n     only lifeline.\n       With several lay-offs in the last twelve years, the Dot.com \n     crash, and the worst economy of my life, I have sadly had to \n     run through my life savings and 401Ks.\n\n  Think about it, having to run through your life savings and your \n401(k). Think about it, a veteran who put his life on the line for his \ncountry. He is insulted that the Republicans are intimating that he is \nlazy or stupid--his words. This is what this man writes--and then I am \ngoing to yield my time so my friend from Montana can add his eloquence \nto this--this is what he writes:\n\n       I have worked since I was 15 and fear I may be homeless \n     soon if I don't get those federal unemployment checks.\n\n  Listen to what he says:\n\n       I eat one meal a day . . . and I'm starting to feel quite \n     desperate. Please convince . . . your colleagues that this is \n     something we all paid into and desperately need now and not \n     in a month or two.\n       We are not receiving welfare checks, but checks we worked \n     for and earned. I know you have always stood up for your \n     constituents and those in times of need. I pray--\n\n  He writes:\n\n       I pray you are successful along with your fellow senators \n     and representatives.\n\n  This is Jay in Albany.\n  Jay, there are a lot of us here who are not giving up on this. Your \nvoice is heard.\n  I have to close with this one thing because it is so important. \nSylvia from Pasadena--this is how she talks about this:\n\n       I want to be a normal person again and talk with friends \n     and family about my day at work and what I achieved for my \n     company or the recognition I received from my boss. I am not \n     a lazy woman; I want and need to be a normal woman with a \n     fair chance at finding a job.\n       I want my government to be patient . . . and show some \n     compassion. Instead, I get Members of Congress calling me \n     names and making me feel ashamed for losing my job through no \n     fault of my own, and making me feel desperate because I don't \n     know how I will be paying my bills.\n\n  Sylvia writes to me:\n\n       Please don't give up on me Mrs. Boxer. I ask you to \n     continue to fight as I can still provide value to this great \n     country. . . . I believe I'm worthy of a little compassion \n     and not name calling.\n\n  These letters move me to tears, and I am not afraid to say it. I am \nnot afraid to say it. Our friends wanted a short-term bill. That is \nwhat they have before them. Our friends wanted a pay-for. This is a \npay-for they have agreed with. If they do not help us today--when I say \n``help us,'' I mean help those who have written to all of us with their \nstories--they are turning their backs on the backbone of this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I wish to very quickly thank the Senator \nfrom California for her remarks before I get into my prepared remarks.\n  We have just come through the worst recession since the Great \nDepression of the 1930s. Unemployment is still at 7 percent. We need to \nget it lower. The bottom line is there are still some folks out there \nwho need some help, and as the economy continues to improve--we are not \nwhere we need to be yet--we ought to give those folks the help they \nneed to get back on their feet, to give them the hope they need to \nreenter the workforce and become valuable parts of our economy again.\n\n\n                     Tribute to Senator Max Baucus\n\n  Madam President, there is a beautiful small town in the farthest \ncorner of northwest Montana. The town is called Libby, and it sits in \nthe heart of the Kootenai Valley, surrounded by majestic snow-capped \nmountains. It is a beautiful place. But despite Libby's postcard-worthy \nviews, the town has a troubled history.\n  Starting in 1919, mining companies began pulling vermiculite from the \nmountains outside of town. Vermiculite was used to bake, to build soil \nin gardens, and to insulate buildings. It was not long before the \nfamilies of Libby began to pay the price for keeping their fellow \nAmericans warm.\n  Mining vermiculite exposed Libby's miners and residents to asbestos \ndust. That asbestos got into their homes, their schools, and--\neventually--their lungs. Over the decades, hundreds of folks in Libby \ndied from asbestos exposure, and thousands more continue to suffer \ntoday.\n  When the W.R. Grace company bought the mines in 1963, the company \ndenied that asbestos caused the illnesses plaguing the town's \nresidents. Instead of sounding the alarm, they kept quiet while \nbuilding corporate profits on the backs of Libby's suffering families \nand workers.\n  Word about Libby's fate finally made it to national news in 1999. The \nplight of Libby's families caught the attention of one man in \nparticular, Montana's senior Senator Max Baucus.\n  Max soon began his crusade to get the EPA and the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to take action. Despite Max bringing \ncountless government officials to northwest Montana to see what \nasbestos had done to the men, women, and children of Libby, it took 10 \nyears for the government to declare this region a public health \nemergency, the first of its kind. Thanks to Max, Libby today is home to \na state-of-the-art medical clinic that screens and treats residents for \nasbestosis.\n  Thanks to Max, the Affordable Care Act extended Medicare coverage to \neveryone in the emergency zone. Thanks to Max, funds are flowing into \nLibby to remove asbestos from homes, schools, and playgrounds. Due to \nMax's hard work and the determination of the people of Libby, the town \nis slowly putting the sordid legacy of W.R. Grace in its rearview \nmirror. Max's hard work for the people of Libby is the Max Baucus that \nMontanans have come to know.\n  But Max's work for the people of Montana started many years before he\n\n[[Page S792]]\n\nled the fight to help the people of Libby. In the early 1970s when Max \nstarted in public service, he traveled to Butte to meet a fellow by the \nname of Harp Cote. Harp knew the lay of the land in Butte, but he did \nnot know Max. Max did not know Butte. Harp was instantly impressed with \nMax's willingness to work or, as Harp said it, Max's ``fire in the \nbelly.'' Max asked Harp to introduce him to Butte's leaders and voters. \nUnlike other candidates, Max did not want Harp to lobby the folks of \nButte on his behalf. Instead, Max went door to door himself to win \ntheir support.\n  That kind of work ethic, where you put your own shoe leather into the \nfight, is the reason for Max's many achievements in Congress, \nachievements that include saving Social Security from privatization, \nleading the charge to modernize the Clean Air Act, passing six farm \nbills and three highway bills to strengthen Montana's and America's \neconomy.\n  Folks in Washington do not always recognize Max's hard work. In a \ntown where too many people race for the nearest TV cameras, Max's \npreference for hard work does not always do him any favors. That is \npractically a mortal sin around here. But not for Max. Max has \nrepresented Montana in Congress since 1975.\n  His long record of service proves that Montanans do not want a \nshowman. They do not want someone who yells across the aisle. They want \nsomeone who will reach across that aisle and find a way to say yes even \nwhen saying no is easier to do. It is like the folks in Libby. Montana \nwants someone who will work hard for them, who will get results and \nfight to improve our quality of life. Montanans have a soul mate in Max \nBaucus.\n  I first met Max in 1998 at an economic development meeting in Havre, \nMT. Max is famous for his economic development summits in Butte. So it \nwas no surprise that we first crossed paths when Max was working to \nimprove Montana's economy. At that point in his career Max's record was \nalready impressive.\n  In 1972, as Director of Montana's constitutional convention, Max \nhelped pass one of the most progressive state constitutions to date, \nenshrining protections for clean air, for clean water, and for the \nright to a quality education into law. He then walked the entire length \nof our State to introduce himself to Montanans and win a seat in \nCongress, meeting more men and women along the way like Harp Cote.\n  As Max gained experience in the Senate, he became Chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. Soon thereafter, well into his \n50s, Max hiked 820 miles, from one corner of our State to the other, to \nearn the support of Montanans during his 1996 reelection. So Max, in \nyour new role as Ambassador, take my advice and do not try to walk from \none end of China to the other.\n  Max next rose to become Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. As \nchairman, Max did not have the luxury of not getting the job done. The \nFinance Committee has been home to some of our Nation's hardest-working \nSenators and greatest examples of bipartisanship because failing to \nsupport critical programs like Social Security and Medicare is simply \nnot an option.\n  On the Finance Committee, you cannot sit back and throw stones. You \nhave to roll up your sleeves, you have to find common ground, and you \nhave to get the job done. That is what Max did. He passed legislation \nto reduce Americans' tax burdens, improve children's health, and, most \nrecently, to reform our Nation's broken health care system.\n  Max's penchant for hard work and thoughtful, independent-minded \nleadership stems from another great Montanan that he and I both admire, \nformer Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield. Max met Mike as a \nteenager, and for many Montanans of today, myself included, Max \nconnects us to Mike's legacy as a champion for the greater good, as the \nchampion for putting service and sacrifice well before self, and a \nchampion for Montana.\n  Montana's leaders always put Montana first, and Max is no exception. \nJust as Montana has shaped Max, Max has shaped Montana. Max's \ndedication to our public lands is legendary. Montana is known as the \nTreasure State because of our incredible natural resources and \nunrivaled public spaces. From Yellowstone to Glacier, Montana is a \nplace like no other. Throughout his career, Max has set out to preserve \nour treasured lands for future generations to enjoy. In 2008, the same \nyear he won reelection and became the first person to win all 56 \ncounties in Montana, Max helped set aside 320,000 acres of prime \nhunting and fishing lands across our State.\n  This land, which will forever be open to the public, is part of Max's \nbrainchild called the Montana Legacy Project. Max's love of our \noutdoors extends to those who share his love. In March of 2000, he came \nto the Senate floor to remember a young Montanan, Sean-Michael Miles, \nwho had tragically died in a car accident just over a year before.\n  Max dedicated a scholarship in Sean's name. Max repeated Sean's \nwords:\n\n       I know this land may pay a price for being beautiful, as \n     change advances, carrying with it the prospect of loss. It is \n     a land I desperately love. It is a part of me. It hurts so \n     much to care so much. Yet as a westerner, I am invited to \n     breathe it all in deeply each day.\n\n  Max, Sean would be proud of your hard work to preserve our treasured \nplaces. I pledge to carry on your efforts so Montanans can continue to \ncherish our special places and pass our traditions down to our kids and \nour grandkids.\n\n  But it is not a stretch to say that I would not be here if it were \nnot for Max Baucus. Max has brought world leaders to Butte for his \neconomic development summit. He brought camera crews onto construction \nsites and small businesses as part of his famous Montana workdays. He \noperated forklifts in warehouses, made bread in Montana's bakeries, and \ndug ditches--all to get a better feel for hard-working Montanans each \nand every day.\n  He fought for Montana farmers and ranchers who feed our Nation. But \nhe also helped bring a dry-land farmer from Big Sandy, MT, to the \nSenate. Max, I cannot tell you how much you have meant to me as a \nfriend, as a partner, as a mentor. I have lost track of how many \nmeetings and rallies we have attended together across our State. But I \ndo know that at each one you have had my back.\n  So when I arrived in the Senate in 2007, it was because of you that a \nguy with seven fingers and a flat-top haircut quickly figured how to \nget from his office to the Senate floor. It is because of you that I \nhad a model for working across the aisle to pass thoughtful, \nresponsible legislation. It is because of you that I always know that I \nhave a friend to turn to when I need advice; that is, because along \nwith your tremendous staff, you have always put Montana first. You have \nbuilt the Montana Democratic Party into a beacon of common sense, \nfreedom, and opportunity in the West. Our party is stronger because of \nyou and your dedication to our State.\n  After retiring from the Senate in 1976, Mike Mansfield became the \nAmbassador to Japan. Now you are posed to continue following in Senator \nMansfield's footsteps as Ambassador to China. I know that you will \ncontinue to serve Montana, even as you serve our Nation's interests \noverseas. I wish you the best. While you are gone, I will keep up your \nfight for Montana, particular the Montanans who need someone to fight \nfor them. Montanans like Les Skramstad. Les was a long-time Libby \nresident. For years, he saw politicians come to Libby with a promise to \nhelp. That help never arrived.\n  When Max came to Libby, Les told him he would be watching. Les passed \naway in 2007 before Libby began getting its help. But Max keeps Les's \nphoto close because in Montana a promise to help is a promise to keep. \nThat is the Montana way. That is the Max Baucus way.\n  Max, it has been an honor to serve with you. It is an honor to call \nyou friend. The Senate will be a lesser body without you. I wish you \nGod's speed and good luck. This is an incredibly important job. I know \nyou are more than up to that task. Thank you for your service to this \nSenate and to Montana and to this country.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S793]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I know we are shortly going to be voting on, among \nother issues, the nomination of Senator Max Baucus to be the next U.S. \nAmbassador to China. I would expect that he would have a unanimous, if \nnot nearly unanimous, vote in the Senate.\n  I said in the Foreign Relations Committee this week that clearly one \nof the biggest challenges and the biggest opportunities before U.S. \nforeign policy today is getting the relationship between the United \nStates and China--in the context of our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific--\nright. I can think of few more able or qualified at this important \nmoment in history than our friend and colleague, the Senator from \nMontana, to help provide advice and guidance to the President and to \nCongress about how to get that relationship right.\n  He is an expert on trade issues. He understands what we face in the \ncoming years as China's economy continues to grow. He is fully aware of \nthe facts that we have had U.S. exports to China that have increased by \nalmost $40 billion in the past 4 years alone, creating and sustaining \nmillions of sustaining U.S. jobs in sectors across the board--\nautomobiles, power generation, machinery, aircraft, and other vital \nindustrial sectors. His trade missions to China, since he has been the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, have given him the perspective he \nneeds to deal with the realities of our policy options.\n  From the hearing he clearly understands that through the rest of the \n21st century and beyond, much of the strategic, political, and economic \nfuture of the world is likely to be shaped by decisions made by \nWashington, Beijing, and the capitals of Asia over the next 4 to 5 \nyears. How we get that rebalance right is incredibly important, and the \nAmbassador to China is incredibly important in that regard.\n  Finally, trade is not the only issue as it relates to China. Our \ncollective security, having China pursue a rules-based system, is \nincredibly important, as well as what happens in the South China Sea--\nall of the issues Senator Baucus addressed in his nomination hearing \nwith great ability, insight, and a willingness to take them on.\n  As the very final point, human rights is an incredibly important \nissue as it relates to China. I want to read briefly from the \ntranscript where he was asked about the question of human rights. He \ndescribed a moment as a Senator in which he raised the issue with then-\nPresident Jiang Zemin.\n  Senator Baucus said:\n\n       He said [the President of China] I did not know what I was \n     are talking about, basically. But then I went to Tibet, went \n     to Lhasa and raised the same point there. And sure enough, \n     within about 2 or 3 weeks, this person was released. . . .\n       Protection of human rights is the bedrock. It is the \n     underpinning of American and world society. . . . People look \n     to America, look to America to lead on so many issues, \n     including the protection of human rights, religious freedoms, \n     freedom of the press, all the rights that are enumerated in \n     the universal declaration. It is what most progress springs \n     from.\n       And the answer is yes, Senator [Cardin]. You have my \n     commitment [on human rights].\n\n  I think the totality of trade, currency manipulation, security, human \nrights, and the answers that he gave in his hearing, clearly show \nmanifestly that he is very capable of being the next Ambassador.\n  I urge a unanimous vote in the Senate, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. First let me add my accolades to those of the chairman of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee about Senator Baucus. He is \nsuperbly prepared to be our next ambassador to China. He is a friend \nand colleague. The President chose wisely, and I anticipate his \nconfirmation.\n  In a few minutes we will have the opportunity to provide relief to \n1.74 million job seekers, to help local business, to get people back to \nwork, and to do so in a fiscally responsible manner.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nthoughtfully engaged with us to find a path forward. Many of their \nideas are incorporated into this principled compromise. It has been 40 \ndays since these Americans have had their unemployment insurance cut. \nNow is the time to act and help our economy grow.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of providing aid to 1.7 million \nAmericans--growing each week by an estimated 70,000. This is the right \nthing to do. At this moment, this is the right way to do it, and the \nonly question before the Senate is will we do the right thing for the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, it has been over a month since \nCongress allowed the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program to \nexpire. That means that more than 1.5 million out-of-work Americans--\nincluding more than 6,000 Rhode Islanders--have by now lost a critical \nlifeline. While Republicans obstruct here in Washington, families in \nProvidence and Bristol and Westerly are scrambling to pay the mortgage \nor keep the heat on in the dead of winter. Over the coming months, \nthousands more Rhode Islanders will not be eligible to receive extended \nweeks of unemployment benefits as their regular unemployment benefits \nexpire.\n  Congress passed--and President Bush signed--the Emergency \nUnemployment Compensation program in response to the epidemic of \njoblessness brought on by the great recession, just as we have done \nduring previous economic crises. The program has been extended several \ntimes as our Nation continues to struggle under stubbornly high rates \nof unemployment. Yet Senate Republicans would not agree to extend this \nlifeline to families before the holidays, and just this week, they \nvoted to prevent us from restoring the emergency assistance.\n  Even with the worst of the recession behind us, too many Rhode \nIslanders are still unable to find work. The unemployment rate in my \nState--9.1 percent in December--remains well above the national \naverage. The sheer depth and duration of this jobs crisis have plunged \nunprecedented numbers of Americans into long-term unemployment. The \nshare of workers unemployed longer than 6 months is still greater than \nthe previous record set in the early 1980s. Now is not the time to pull \nthe plug on our fellow Americans.\n  Nationwide, there are three unemployed workers for every available \njob opening. For some, the jobs just aren't there, and a strategy to \nmake people desperate creates nothing but cruelty.\n  My Republican colleagues who think this assistance doesn't make a \nreal difference should talk to the 74 year-old woman from Westerly, RI, \nwho contacted my office. She was laid off in July after 11 years with \nthe same company and is still unable to find work. She has moved in \nwith a neighbor to cut costs. She says emergency unemployment \nassistance helped her keep her head above water.\n  Those who think extended unemployment discourages people from seeking \nwork should talk to the forty-five-year-old husband and father from \nWest Warwick, who finds himself unemployed for the first time in his \nlife. Since losing his job 5 months ago, he has applied to nearly 100 \njobs with no success. With only his wife's wages coming in the door, \nhis emergency unemployment helped this family to barely make ends meet.\n  Unemployment benefits spent on rent, groceries, and other basics \ncontribute directly to economic activity. In fact, the Congressional \nBudget Office has estimated that the country could lose 200,000 jobs if \nunemployment benefits aren't extended.\n  My senior Senator Jack Reed has led the fight to maintain this basic \nsupport for Americans still struggling to get back to work. He has \nworked tirelessly across the aisle to find a thoughtful compromise. \nRhode Islanders are grateful for his leadership and he has my full \nsupport in the effort to restore emergency unemployment assistance to \nAmerican workers. The Senate must not turn its back on those struggling \nthe longest to find work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent to yield back all remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto offer a motion to reconsider the previous vote by which cloture was \nnot invoked on S. 1845.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  Mr. REID. I know everyone is in a hurry to leave, and I will be very \nbrief. I wish to make sure I am clear where we stand. We are one \nRepublican vote away from restoring unemployment insurance for 1.7 \nmillion Americans, including 20,000 veterans who have lost their \nbenefits during the last 5 weeks. We all support this on this side of \nthe aisle.\n  Right now there is one Republican vote standing between 1.7 million \nAmericans and the lifeline they need to make ends meet. I ask my \nRepublican colleagues to think about the woman from Nevada who is 57 \nyears old. She is couch-surfing. Younger people know a little bit about \nthat term, but I hadn't heard the term before. She has because she has \nbeen forced to understand what it is--going around to friends' homes, \napartments, and sleeping on their couches. She is 57 years old, worked \nfrom the time she was 18 years old. She lost her job and can't find a \njob. She is long-term unemployed. If she had just lost her job last \nweek or a couple of months ago, she could go get unemployment, but she \nhas been out of work for too long to be able to get it. She has sold \neverything she has except a clunker of a car, sold all of her personal \nthings so she can buy gas in case she gets an interview.\n  People are in the same position as she in every State. Our job is to \ndo right by them. All we need is one more Republican vote, one more \nRepublican to step up and do the right thing. We are going to bring \nthis vote up again sometime. I have spoken to my colleague Senator \nHeller. I said: Dean, let's get this done. Tell me what is needed to \nget this done.\n\n[[Page S795]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/06/senate-section/article/S795-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF MAX SIEBEN BAUCUS TO BE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND \n    PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE PEOPLE'S \n                           REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume legislative session.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                     Tribute to Senator Max Baucus\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am pleased that my colleague and very \ndear friend Max Baucus was confirmed by this body the way he was. He \nwill make a fine ambassador to China. We all know what an honorable, \ndecent man he is. We all know of his abilities. We all know he has run \na very tough committee, a very important committee, and has done a \nterrific job in doing so.\n  All I can say is I rise to wish my good friend Senator Max Baucus \ngood luck as he departs to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador to China.\n  We are going to miss Max. I do not think it is fair to this body, \nbut, nevertheless, I think it is fair to our country because Max will \nmake a great ambassador. Senator Baucus first came to the Senate in \n1978 and has the distinction of being Montana's longest serving \nSenator. So, as you can see, I have served with Senator Baucus for a \nlong time--longer than the two of us would like to admit sometimes. \nOver the years I have come to respect his commitment both to his \nconstituents and to his principles. Having worked side by side with him \non the Senate Finance Committee, I know a lot about his constituents \nand his principles. He raises his constituents constantly and his \nprinciples I do not think he ever wavered.\n  If you want to understand my friend Max Baucus's priorities, take a \nlook at the sign on his Senate office desk. Like Max, it is to the \npoint and unequivocal. The sign says: ``Montana comes first.'' Plain \nand simple, not much nuance, the language is pretty declarative.\n  That is Max Baucus. In his long and distinguished Senate career, he \nalways put the people of Montana first.\n  Both Senator Baucus and I are westerners, and westerners expect a \ncertain amount of independence in their Senators. They expect us to \nwork across the aisle and attempt to solve problems and work together.\n  Of course, we Republicans tend to view that problem-solving as less \ngovernment and Democrats tend to view that problem-solving as more \ngovernment. That is not universal, but that is where the two sides \nusually come down. That being the case, Max and I have often found \nourselves on different sides of some of these issues. However, we share \nthe desire to solve problems and, as Max's sign says it, to put our \nconstituents' interests first. Senator Baucus has always understood \nthat notion very well, and I am here to declare that to everybody who \nlistens.\n  As a result, his disposition--particularly as chairman of the Finance \nCommittee--has been to try to find a way to a bipartisan yes rather \nthan a partisan no. I have always respected him for that.\n  Over the last few years, as I have served along side Max as the \nranking member of the Finance Committee, I have greatly appreciated his \nwillingness to put partisan differences aside for the greater good of \nall.\n  One adjective you could use to describe Senator Baucus is one that \nwas used by his predecessor as chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. The term I am thinking of is \n``indefatigable.''\n  Whether it was preparing for and running a marathon, walking across \nthe wide expanse of his home State, or working at one of the many jobs \nhe regularly undertook back home on recess visits, Max has been \nindefatigable.\n  He has been a tireless legislator. Just ask his staff. They will \naffirm that fact. As a Senator, he was always working. I have no doubt \nhe will do the same as our Nation's Ambassador to China, arguably the \nmost important diplomatic post in the world today.\n  As we saw today, the vote on his confirmation was not even close. \nThat is because all of his colleagues know that Max Baucus is a \ncommitted public servant who will serve the American people with \ncompetence, dignity, and a tireless commitment to our Nation and its \ninterests.\n  I have to say I feel personally about this nominee and about this \nnomination. I like Max very much. Having served with him on the Senate \nFinance Committee, he has always tried to be fair. He has always tried \nto consider the other's point of view. He has always tried to consider \ndifferent ways of solving problems, and he has worked to do so. That is \nabout all we can ask from our colleagues on the other side--either \nDemocrats or Republicans.\n  I just want to at this time wish Senator Baucus and his lovely wife \nMelodee and, of course, his family the best of luck in this and all \nfuture endeavors.\n  As Max departs the Senate, Senator Baucus leaves behind a great \nlegacy\n\n[[Page S796]]\n\nand very big shoes to fill. So at this particular point, I hesitate to \nsay farewell to my friend Max Baucus, but I only say farewell knowing \nthat he is going to go on to a very important job for our country, \nwhere I think he will do a very good job.\n  He will have my support as he serves over there, and let's just hope \nthat we on the Finance Committee can do a better job or at least an \nequivalent job to what Max has done to keep these very important issues \non the most important committee of the Congress moving along.\n  I have nothing but respect for Max. I appreciate him very much. I am \nhis friend, and I intend to continue this friendship as long as we both \nlive.\n  With that, I congratulate Senator Baucus. I am proud of the Senator, \nand I intend to support him while he is there as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, the Chinese New Year began, as you \nprobably know, just a couple days ago. I do not know a lot of words in \nChinese, but among the words I have learned is how to say ``Happy New \nYear.'' It is a new year in China. It is a new year for Chinese \nAmericans in this country as well. I think the way we say ``Happy New \nYear'' is ``Gong Xi Fa Cai.'' So I say that to my friend.\n  When word came out that Max had been nominated by the President for \nthis role, I say to our friend from Utah, I ran into Max. He was about \nto go into an elevator, I think in the Hart Building, and I said: I \nknow the President has nominated you for this, but you can't leave. We \nneed your leadership on tax reform. We need your leadership on an SGR \nfix and doctors and all these other issues--trade policy. You can't \nleave now.\n  He said: Well, the President has nominated me.\n  I said: Well, I am going to put a hold on your nomination.\n  He was about to get in the elevator and go away, and he put his head \nback out and said: Oh no, you are not.\n  I was tempted. I was tempted because there is a lot he leaves. \nActually, I think he leaves at a time when this place is working \nbetter. I am encouraged by that. Frankly, I am encouraged by the \nrelationship the Senator has kindled with Senator Hatch. I am \nencouraged by the relationship the Senator has kindled with our friend \nDave Camp from Michigan over in the House as chairman of the Ways and \nMeans Committee. Max has set an example for the rest of us.\n  It is ironic the chairman of the committee and the ranking member are \nsitting here across the aisle from each other, but the two of them, in \nterms of providing personal examples--the kind of leadership we need; \ndo as I do, not as I say--both of them are terrific at reaching across \nthe aisle, doing what the people sent us to do: find principled \ncompromises, get things done.\n  I wish to mention--let me just ask, and he can maybe nod his head--my \nrecollection is, when we took up the issue of whether there should be a \nMedicare prescription drug program that was supported initially by \nSenator Kennedy and by President George W. Bush, I think in the end the \nversion that prevailed was the version preferred by President Bush.\n  My recollection is that Senator Baucus may have gone across the aisle \nand supported that version of the bill and took me and probably another \n10 or so Democrats with him--not an easy thing to do.\n  I remember going back to Delaware--I have told him this story \nbefore--I went back to Delaware and held a number of townhall meetings, \nif you will, on that issue and got excoriated, eviscerated by mostly \nDemocrats. They would come and say: How could you do this? How could \nyou support that prescription drug program, the Medicare Part D \nProgram.\n  I explained I thought it was a principled compromise. I thought it \nwould work. A year later, it has an 85-percent approval rating by the \npeople who use it. For 6 or 7 straight years--it still has an 85-\npercent approval rating, a little higher than ours. If you look at how \nwe are doing in terms of anticipated costs, it is 7 years under \nbudget--under budget.\n  When the time came to try to find a compromise on comprehensive \nhealth care reform, I remember the Senator did not just work with 3 or \n4 Republican colleagues on the Finance Committee--Senator Grassley, \nSenator Snowe, Senator Enzi. The Senator did not work with them for a \ncouple of days to try a find a principled compromise, Senator Baucus \nworked with them for weeks--I think months--to try to do that. \nUltimately, the Senator was unsuccessful. But the Senator led us \nthrough a difficult mark-up in committee and on the floor. I know there \nare reservations in that law that we should tweak and change and make \nit better. But I think in the end, the Senator's leadership will be \nvindicated by a lot of Americans, just like we did with the Medicare \nprescription drug program. Obviously, that was the right thing to do. \nThank you for the leadership you provided.\n  On a personal level, I would say, as Senator Hatch has said, this is \na personal loss to me, and I know to many Democrats and Republicans. \nBut the Senator leaves behind a wonderful legacy. You leave behind a \nwhole lot of people, and they all have their resumes--no, not really. \nOne or two of them may have. But you have a reputation as surrounding \nyourself with really good people. I sought to do that. I kind of \nlearned from you and Senator Hatch, but I have always sought to \nsurround myself by people smarter than me. My wife always says that it \nis not hard to find them.\n  You have done a great job surrounding yourself with terrific people. \nThey are here today sitting behind you, over in the Republican side, up \nin the galleries--a lot of love here. I hope you feel it from all of \nus.\n  In the Navy when people pull up their anchor and prepare to sail off \ninto the sunset or the sunrise, whatever the case may be, we always \nlike to say: Fair winds and a following sea. Fair winds and a following \nsea. That is what I wish to you and to Mel. We are going to miss you \nhere, but we are really going to miss her. We hope we will have an \nopportunity to see you again and to work with you again.\n  We hope the same, that we will have an opportunity to see Mel. We \nthink the world of her. Good luck to both of you. May God bless you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I just want to make a brief statement \nbefore Senator Baucus speaks and thank him for his service in the \nSenate, thank him for representing Montana, and accepting some of the \ntoughest assignments in the Senate. We have a similarity in our \nbackground. We were both inspired to this position by Senators who \nserved before us; in his case, Senator Mansfield, who was an \nextraordinary leader in the Senate and an extraordinary man when you \nconsider his contribution to our country. He served in two world wars, \nif I am not mistaken, perhaps in three different branches of the \nmilitary. It was just an exceptional life of public service which ended \nwith his ambassadorship to Japan.\n  Now, Senator Baucus, who was inspired to public life by Senator \nMansfield and followed in his footsteps in representing the State of \nMontana, serving in one of the highest leadership spots in the Senate, \nis now off to an ambassadorship, which, when you consider the ebb and \nflow of history, is singularly the most important ambassadorial \nassignment which the United States of America can make.\n  Today, this overwhelming bipartisan vote in the Senate is a fitting \ntribute to Senator Max Baucus for his service, his friendship, and his \ncontinued dedication to be a servant of our Nation. I wish you and Mel \nthe very best in this new assignment. We hope to get a chance to come \nto see you, and also, more importantly, to work with you, to make sure \nthat our relationship with China remains strong for decades to come.\n  Thank you, Max, for being such a great colleague and a friend.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \ncolleague, Max Baucus. Senator Baucus has been a leader in the areas of \ntax, trade, health, agriculture and the environment. I have served with \nhim on the Finance Committee and the Agriculture Committee and have \nenjoyed working with him and learning from him. On the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus worked to improve the\n\n[[Page S797]]\n\nhealth care of all Americans, most notably with the passage of the \nAffordable Care Act. It should also be noted, one of his last acts as a \nSenator today was to introduce a bipartisan and bicameral agreement on \nMedicare physician payment reform. On the Agriculture Committee, he was \na passionate advocate for farmers. Max leaves a legacy he should be \nproud of. I wish him well in China and thank him for his continued \nservice.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I rise today to congratulate Senator Max \nBaucus for his confirmation as Ambassador to the People's Republic of \nChina. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve with him for \nseveral years in the Senate and on the Finance Committee, which he \nchairs.\n  Max's entire life has been dedicated to public service. He was a \nmember of the Montana House early in his career, before being elected \nto the U.S. House of Representatives and then the Senate in 1978. Few \npeople have served as long in the Senate as Max and led such an \nillustrious career here. Max has been behind many landmark pieces of \nlegislation that will benefit people's lives and the country for years \nto come. As chairman of the Finance Committee, he has influenced so \nmany issues that have an impact on American families every day, from \ntax policy to pensions, health care, and education.\n  What is more, I have seen firsthand Max's unique desire to work with \npeople across the political spectrum. Max's commonsense approach and \ncollegial nature, learned from growing up on a ranch in Montana, has \nplayed a significant role in his ability to get things done. I hope \nthat all Senators will learn from his example. In fact, I believe it is \nwhat we must do to best serve the people who elected us.\n  On behalf of all Floridians, I want to thank Max for serving his \ncountry in the Senate for more than 3 decades. And I wish him well as \nhe follows in the footsteps of his mentor, Senator Mike Mansfield, in \nbecoming Ambassador to the People's Republic of China.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, Max Baucus has never been afraid of the \nlong haul. As the son of Montana ranchers, he knows the meaning of a \nlong day's work. Before his 1996 election, he walked the length of \nMontana, more than 800 miles. In 2003, well past his 60th birthday, he \nran a 50-mile ultra-marathon.\n  For the last three decades, I have had the privilege of running a \ndifferent sort of marathon with Max. We entered the Senate together \nafter the election of 1978, and have served together since then. Today \nwe mark the end of that marathon, as Senator Baucus prepares to become \nAmbassador Baucus and assume one of our Nation's most important \ndiplomatic posts as ambassador to the People's Republic of China.\n  As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Max Baucus has played a \ncentral role in some of the most important legislative accomplishments \nof recent decades. He has helped bring health care coverage to millions \nof Americans by working toward establishment of the Children's Health \nInsurance Program and the Affordable Care Act. At the same time, he was \nworked tirelessly on issues of major importance to Montana, fighting to \nsupport his State's agriculture, and to support important educational \nand economic development initiatives.\n  He moves from this important role to another. Our relationship with \nChina is more important than ever. Decisions made today will affect \nthat relationship for decades to come. We are seeking to cement a \npositive relationship, one in which China joins with our friends and \nallies in the Asia-Pacific Region to support collective security and \neconomic growth, and fosters stability through adhering to \ninternational norms. As the representative of the American people in \nBeijing, Max will be instrumental in getting and keeping the U.S.-China \nrelationship on a positive footing. He will be in a crucial position to \nhelp open Chinese markets to American goods.\n  I will miss Max as a friend and a colleague, but I am grateful for \nhis willingness to take on this job, to continue serving his Nation in \na new and challenging capacity.\n  I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Let me begin by thanking so many of my friends here: \nSenators Durbin, Carper, Hatch, and so many others. I must say to you, \nyou have expressed your remarks, and they mean a lot to me. But they \nprobably mean more to me than I think you know. They mean so much to \nme. Thank you for what you have said.\n  I would also like to begin by thanking the people of Montana. The \npeople of Montana have given me the honor of representing them in the \nCongress for nearly 40 years. It is 39 now, and actually at the end of \nthis year it will be 40 years. I want to thank President Obama very \nmuch for the opportunity to serve the American people as Ambassador to \nChina.\n  I also want to recognize one of the best teammates and friends anyone \ncould ever ask for, Senator Jon Tester. Thank you, Jon. There is \nnothing greater in life than the love of family. I have been an \nincredibly lucky man. I would like to thank my wife Mel, my son Zeno, \nhis wife Stephanie. I would also to thank our children, Katie and Joey.\n  Mel, Zeno, Stephanie, Katie, and Joey, you inspire me daily. I am so \ngrateful for each of you. I am so blessed to have Mel in my life. Her \nenergy, her zest for life, her positive outlook, and her love have \ntransformed me. I am the luckiest guy in the world because of Mel. \nKatie and Joey are clearly inspired by their mother. They are great \nkids, great achievers. I think the last grades I saw--one is in law \nschool and the other is in college--they had all As. Why? Because they \nare inspired by their mother. That is why they do so well, in the best \nsense of the term.\n  My son Zeno is one of the best kids parents could ever wish for. I am \nso proud of him. He is so smart, intelligent, and decent. He is \ncurrently an assistant U.S. attorney, living in Helena with his wife \nStephanie. I am proud of him. You may have read about that case where a \nlady pushed her husband off a cliff in Glacier Park, MT. He is the \nprosecutor in that case.\n  I am very proud of him. Again, an indication of how proud I am of \nhim, I learned more about that case reading the papers than I did from \nhim. He keeps his cards close to his vest and is such a decent, smart, \neffective guy.\n  Stephanie, his wife, has jumped right into life in Montana. She is so \ntalented and special, and the Helena community is very lucky to have \nher.\n  Thanks so much to my parents Jean and John Baucus. I wish they were \nhere today.\n  Growing up on a ranch in Montana, you learn the simple lessons, the \nmeasure of life. You learn to cherish the land. It gets in your blood. \nYou work hard. It is humbling. There is so much you cannot control \nworking on a ranch. You cannot control the weather, whether it rains or \nit does not rain. You cannot control the prices. It gives you a little \nperspective to feel philosophical about life.\n  On the ranch you are charged also with nurturing life, nurturing \nlivestock, producing a small part of nature's bounty. You have an \nobligation to learn as a rancher.\n  It is also the Montana way to love the outdoors. We are outdoors \npeople in Montana. We hunt, we fish, we backpack, we hike, we grow \ncrops, we raise livestock, we mine coal, and we cut timber. I think \nMontanans are more outdoor people than any other people in the country. \nWe love it. It becomes part of our soul. Montana writer Bud Guthrie \nsaid: ``Somehow I am part of it, a mortal partner to eternity.''\n  I grew up this way, and it shored up my belief that we all have a \nmoral obligation to our kids and grandkids when we leave this place, to \nleave it in as good a shape or in better shape than we found it. That \ninternal compass is also a lasting gift from my parents and their love \nof the land. My mom is one of the most special persons one could have \nthe privilege to know. She had the class of Grace Kelly and the spunk \nand grit of Katherine Hepburn. She was a combination of them both--an \nintelligent, classy lady, always positive, always upbeat. She was so \nintelligent and so well read. She even read more books than I did. I \nwould come home at night and say: Mom, what are you reading?\n  She would tell me all about the book. One she was reading was \nPresident Obama's second book, which he wrote when he was a Senator. \nWhat do you think about that, mom?\n\n[[Page S798]]\n\n  Oh, it is a pretty good book. It has something to say. It is a little \nlong, though.\n  Anyway, she wrote a note to the President and told him that she liked \nit. He wrote back, and they became pen pals. It was very nice.\n  Someone asked me last week what my mother would have thought of all \nthis. She would have been incredibly excited and fascinated with the \nadventure ahead. Although I miss her every day--in fact, I talked to \nher every day at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. That hour goes by daily, \nbut I keep thinking of her. She is always on my mind, as is my father. \nHe loaded bombs on airplanes in Europe during World War II. A product \nof the Great Depression, he instilled in me the values of hard work, \nhumility, and good faith. He worked me hard on the ranch, stacked a lot \nof hay, a lot of fencing. I know why he did it--for the right reasons. \nI did not complain because I knew that he was trying to raise me in the \nway that he hoped would help me later in life.\n  He was also such a decent person. No one ever spoke an ill word of my \nfather--ever--such a rock solid character. The Republican Party in \nMontana asked him to run for Governor. He would not have anything to do \nwith it. He did not care about that politics stuff. He was a rancher \nand liked what he was doing--ranching. I was so blessed to have such \ngreat parents.\n  Now 52 years ago, I was full of youthful idealism and curiosity about \nlife beyond the ranch. I am sure it was caused somewhat by my parents. \nAs a college student at Stanford, I decided to take a year off from my \nstudies between my junior and senior year. I grabbed a knapsack and I \nhitchhiked around the world for 1 year. It was June-August 1962 to \nabout August-September 1963.\n  I set out to visit countries I had only imagined--India, Japan, and \nChina, to name a few. Before I departed, I had never thought about a \nlife in public service. But that trip opened my eyes. It charted my \ncourse. I realized how people across the globe were interconnected. We \nare all in this together.\n  I saw the indispensable role that America plays as a leader on the \nworld stage. It was so obvious. I knew right where I was, in the middle \nof the then-Belgian Congo, and I had an epiphany. All this realization \nhit me that we are so connected, that our natural resources are \ndiminishing. Somehow we have to work better together if we are going to \nhave better lives, not only for ourselves but for everyone on the \nglobe. We are so connected.\n  The world is getting smaller. Our natural resources, in fact, are \ndiminishing. We have to find a way to work better together. I returned \nhome with a commitment to a career where I could improve the lives of \nmy fellow Montanans and of all Americans. I would not be standing here \ntoday had it not been for that trip where I hitchhiked around the \nworld, probably the most defining era of my life.\n  It was by far the most influential, and that 1 year set into motion a \nseries of opportunities to serve that I would never have dreamed would \ntake me back to China to represent the United States 50 years later. \nWhen I first ran for statewide office in 1973, no one knew me from \nAdam. I had been away from the State for many years.\n  I needed some advice. I had met Mike Mansfield when I was in high \nschool. Instantly there was a man I totally respected and honored. He \nplanted the seed, I know, for later interest in public service. It was \nnot a defining moment, but I could tell at the time. He told me I \nshould run; I should go back home and serve. I was then working at the \nSEC, just a short distance from here.\n  If I wanted to run for Congress, he said, it would take a lot of hard \nwork, a lot of shoe leather, and a little bit of luck. I took his \nadvice literally. I wore out as much shoe leather as I knew how. I \nwalked the entire length of the State of Montana from Gardiner in the \nsouth--Gardiner is next to Yellowstone Park--up to the Yaak, a remote \npart of Montana near the Canadian border.\n  I got to know so many great people who later put me to work for them \nin the House. It was right in the middle of the Watergate political \nscandal. I joined a congressional class determined to restore good \nfaith and trust in government, a terrific bunch of folks. They were \njust great, the ``Watergate class.''\n  I think of my friends Chris Dodd, Tom Harkin, Paul Simon, Henry \nWaxman, and George Miller, to name a few. It was a great class. They \nwere running for office and serving for the right reasons.\n  When I hitchhiked around the globe as a young man, I also realized \nthat no country has a monopoly on religion, culture or virtue. We are \nall together. We are all in this together. All people basically have \nthe same dreams for their families--to put food on the table, to make \nends meet, to take care of the kids, health care they could afford, and \na clean environment for their families to explore and enjoy.\n  The Senate can make people's dreams a reality. We are so lucky as \nAmericans to have this institution under our Constitution written by \nour very perceptive forefathers. It offers what few institutions in the \nworld can boast--the opportunity to make a difference when history \ncalls.\n  One of the greatest privileges I have had in this job is having one \nof the best staffs on the Hill. They are sitting behind me--some of \nthem. They are terrific. They have always been ready with big ideas and \ndedication to answer history's call. If there is a vanguard of vision, \nmy staff has been in it.\n  I might say, parenthetically, I am very proud of my staff for another \nreason. My office has spawned about six marriages. A woman or a man \nworking in my office who didn't know each other until they started \nworking in my office got together and got married--six times--and they \nhave all worked but for one. I don't know, but maybe I worked them too \nhard or maybe not hard enough. Whatever the reason, over the years \nafter they were married, to see their kids, it has been terrific. It \nmeant so much to me.\n  How many people have served since the time I have been here? The \nanswer is 1,423 folks have worked on behalf of Montanans and on behalf \nof Americans, each person making a positive difference to the lives of \nothers.\n  I thank them all very much.\n  In the years I have been in the Senate, we voted to send our sons and \ndaughters to fight wars overseas, to protect our national security. I \nthink the strongest human instinct is self-preservation. When you come \nfrom a beautiful place such as Montana, and from the wonderful people \nof our State, you will stop at nothing to defend them.\n  Montana has a tradition of answering the call to serve. As a matter \nof fact, more Montanans have volunteered for service per capita than \nnearly any state in the Nation.\n  My own nephew Phillip left college to enlist in the Marines. Before \nlong he was far away in Anbar province serving our country. I loved \nPhillip as a father. His fellow marines looked to him for support, \ncounsel, advice, and leadership as they faced many firefights. He made \nlance corporal in record time. He gave his life to our Nation and then \nreturned to the family ranch for the very last time.\n  Phillip, like each one of the fallen heroes who bore our battles, \nleft behind big dreams undone and countless broken hearts. Dust to \ndust--we still shudder.\n  President Lincoln concluded his second inaugural address with a call \nfor the Nation to ``care for him who shall have borne the battle and \nfor his widow and his orphan.'' Lincoln's commitment remains our sacred \nduty today.\n  In the Senate we have made progress. We enacted tax credits for \nbusinesses that hire veterans and enacted a new GI bill. In the past 10 \nyears Congress has doubled support for the VA. That is an investment of \nwhich we should be proud. Someone once wrote: ``In war, there are no \nunwounded soldiers.'' It is important we remember that. We make the \ntough votes to authorize war, and we must also find the courage to band \ntogether so that our troops return to a nation that honors their \nservice.\n  Of all the bills that I have worked on, there are two that stand out. \nIn 2010 we took the Montana National Guard's model of improved PTSD \nscreening and expanded it nationwide. That concept of very meaningful \nPTSD screening began in Montana with the Montana National Guard. It \nworked so well I got it in the defense bill, and it is now being \nenacted nationwide to make sure we do the very best to protect our kids \nwho are coming home.\n  The new screenings have resulted in more than 800,000 servicemembers \nwho\n\n[[Page S799]]\n\nhave received personal and private one-on-one attention from a trained \nhealth care provider--both before and after deployment. Make no \nmistake; these screenings are saving lives.\n  I am also proud of another life-saving bill, the Affordable Care Act. \nIt has been almost 4 years since President Obama signed that act into \nlaw, and in that time the law has done more than any other in the past \nhalf century to expand access to health coverage. It has provided 71 \nmillion Americans free preventive service. More than 6 million seniors \nhave received discounts on vital prescription drugs.\n  More than 3 million young people have peace of mind knowing they will \nbe allowed to stay on their parents' health plans. I am especially \nproud that now no child will ever be denied health care coverage \nbecause they had been sick or had a preexisting condition.\n  It has been a tough road. It has been a challenge I am proud to have \ntaken on. While the debate over the law continues, I am proud to stand \nfor it because it is helping millions of Americans.\n  Take Julie from Helena. Julie wrote to me that she is self-employed \nand finally able to get access to affordable, quality health care \ncoverage because of the ACA.\n  John, from Missoula, has a daughter who survived ovarian cancer. \nThanks to the ACA, she was able to stay on her parents' insurance and \nwin her battle against cancer.\n  I am very proud of the role I played in helping to make health care \nmore accessible and more affordable to many Americans.\n  In this Chamber there are brilliant men and women. With great respect \nto my colleagues, I insist that, in the most important respect, \nSenators are just ordinary people--big, not-so-big, tall, short, men \nand women. We are just people.\n  It is only through the extraordinary institution of the Senate that \nthe ordinary people have the power to make life better for all \nAmericans. We belong to something bigger than ourselves. When I first \ncame to the Senate, Senators from opposing parties actually had lunch \ntogether in the private Senate dining room on the floor below the \nChamber. It was called the inner sanctum.\n  In those daily rituals we learned about each other's families, home \nStates, and developed real friendships. Senators dined together--no \nspouses, no staff, only Senators from both sides of the aisle. We \ncompared notes, talked about our kids, and talked about our family. We \ntalked about legislation, and we got to know each other. It was \nwonderful getting to know each other, to build trust, confidence, and \nunderstanding. It was the backbone of respect that we all relied upon.\n\n  Those friendships provided a refuge from the political firestorms and \ncommon ground to turn to after the wrangling over the disagreements of \nthe day.\n  Now schedules are packed with caucus meetings and political \nfundraisers. The Senate is losing the spirit of friendship and \nforgiveness that, in the words of Protestant theologian Reinhold \nNiebuhr, ``is the final oil of harmony in all human relations and which \nrests upon the contrite recognition that our actions and attitudes are \ninevitably interpreted in a different light by our friends as well as \nfoes than we interpret them.''\n  Friendship and forgiveness, that is the oil of human relations that \nbrings us together. That private Senate dining room now carries only \nthe echoes of the friendships once forged at its tables, and we are \npoorer for it. Yet there is nothing inevitable about this trend. The \nhope of this body lies in individual Senators. The heart set upon \nsolutions to problems will win over the heart devising traps for \npolitical gain.\n  It is my honor to have friendships that formed the basis for solving \nsome of the Nation's most difficult problems. I will never forget \nworking together with the late Senator John Chafee on the Environment \nand Public Works Committee.\n  I worked with John for years before finding out he was an amazing war \nhero, decorated for his service in Korea. He didn't tell us that. It \ntook years before I learned what a hero he was, a self-effacing kind of \nguy. Few people knew about his war record because he didn't brag about \nit or use it for political gain. He served because he believed in it, \nnot because he thought he could benefit from it. Without a doubt, we \nneed more John Chafees in the world.\n  Between 1989 and 1990, we sat together in a small room off the Senate \nfloor, facing wave after wave of unhappy Senators--sometimes until 1 or \n2 in the morning. He was the ranking Republican member of the EPW \nCommittee. I became chairman of the Environmental Protection \nSubcommittee.\n  Together we met with our colleagues ironing out the compromises on \nacid rain, ozone depletion, air quality permits, and scores of other \nissues. Senator Chafee later became chairman of the full committee. We \nhad our disagreements, but by-and-large under Senator Chafee's \nchairmanship I recall an oasis of civility.\n  That friendship helped us to pass the Clean Air Act Amendments of \n1990. I am very proud of that effort. I was chairman of the committee \nat that time, and we finally got it.\n  It is a small point, but I always respected that he never raised his \nvoice. He was always civil, always decent, always positive, upbeat, and \ntrying to find a solution. John never lost his temper. He listened \ncarefully to the other person's point of view.\n  He was a paragon of the Senate--as is my good friend from Iowa Chuck \nGrassley.\n  Chuck and I began our friendship by deciding to meet weekly face-to-\nface in his office or my office. It turned out to be 5:30 p.m. every \nTuesday. We would bring our staffs together. Pretty soon our staffs \nwere talking to each other. The health care staff after a while started \ntalking to each other and our trade staff started talking to each \nother.\n  Heck, we were basically one office. If you were a fly on the wall, \nyou would think this was one office where people were trying to get \ntogether to solve problems.\n  Chuck is a Republican; I am a Democrat. We have differences, but our \ngoal is to solve the problems and find solutions while adhering to our \nprinciples.\n  Our friendship led to a culture of respect and honesty in the Senate \nFinance Committee that helped us pass important agreements of other \nbills to expand trading opportunities with the rest of the world. I am \nespecially proud of our work together to successfully shepherd the \nMedicare Modernization Act of 2003. Senator Carper referred to it just \na short while ago.\n  I thank my good friend Dave Camp. Dave is chairman of the House Ways \nand Means Committee. We have worked together a lot over the past couple \nof years on tax reform. We have bridged the partisan divide to help \npass the most recent highway bill and the payroll tax cut. Dave is a \nsuper, super American and a wonderful man. I am very lucky to have him \nas a friend.\n  It has also been a terrific honor working with my good friend Senator \nOrrin Hatch.\n  Orrin, Dave, and I recently worked together to introduce Trade \nPromotion Authority legislation to make Congress a full partner in \ntrade negotiations. In trade, as in so many important areas, working \ntogether is the only way to get the job done. The Senator is a real \nAmerican--Orrin Hatch. He is the salt of Utah and cares about his State \nand his country. The Senator is a wonderful person to work with. I \ncan't thank him enough.\n  Thank you, Senator Hatch.\n  In 1961, President-elect John F. Kennedy said: ``Our governments, in \nevery branch, at every level, national, State, and local, must be as a \ncity on a hill--constructed and inhabited by men aware of their great \ntrust and their great responsibilities.\n  If we are indeed a city on the Hill, it rests firmly on the bridges \nthat Senators built when they faced even the deepest of divides. I \nmention my closest friendships across the aisle because it is those \nbridges that we lack the most today.\n  The epiphany I had as a young man hitchhiking around the world 52 \nyears ago I believe is even more relevant today. Advances in \ntechnologies and communications have made us more interconnected as \npeople than ever before.\n  The challenges of globalization bind us even more. Climate change--we \nare all in this together--terrorism, economic development, and \neducation can\n\n[[Page S800]]\n\nall be addressed with good faith and a commitment to finding common \nground.\n  I am committed in my next chapter to meet these challenges. The \nUnited States-China relationship I believe is one of the most important \nbilateral relationships in the world that will shape global affairs for \ngenerations. We must get it right.\n  Thirty-eight years ago, Mike Mansfield said farewell to this \ninstitution by simply declaring: ``There is a time to stay and a time \nto go.''\n  Now, as I face my own crossroads, I am humbled to have the \nopportunity to follow in his footsteps.\n  As America's ambassador to Japan, Mansfield worked hard to strengthen \nand improve America's relationship throughout history. I will try to do \nthe same.\n  Many of you know I love to run. I actually have my eye on the Beijing \nMarathon--but, to be more honest, maybe I will scale it down to a half-\nmarathon, something a little shorter. When I think about my next \nendeavor, I am reminded of something a professional runner, Paul \nTergat, once said:\n\n       Ask yourself: ``Can I give more?'' The answer is usually: \n     Yes.\n\n  I can give more; we all can. I thank President Obama for asking me. I \nam indeed energized to serve America in this new role and to look at \nthis as my sprint to the finish.\n  I trust Montanans to choose wisely as they have so well with my \nfriend, the great Senator from Montana Jon Tester.\n  My final message is not for my esteemed peers but for the young \npeople chasing their dreams across the Montana Hi-Line, searching for \nmeaning through the Yellowstone River Valley or climbing toward their \nfuture along the Rocky Mountain Front.\n  The headlines paint the picture that there is no honor in public \nservice. I disagree. I think the greatest noble human endeavor is \nservice--service to friends, service to family, to church, to \nsynagogue. Public service. The most noble human endeavor is service. So \nI urge you young folks to take up that challenge that politics is not \nan honorable profession. It is more than honorable. It is an obligation \nto serve. And I urge you to follow and serve. Choose to serve others. \nFor me, it has been the honor of a lifetime. I am so lucky. And be \nready--because history is calling.\n  It is with deep gratitude and respect that I say for the last time, \nwith full faith in the highest forms of the Senate, I yield the floor. \nBut before doing so, I just have to say I am not going anywhere. I am \njust taking a trip, maybe for a year or two, across the Pacific--just a \ntrip. I will be coming back because we all are together on different \njourneys that we take.\n  I thank all of you, my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, before he leaves the floor, I would like \nto make a few comments about Senator Baucus.\n  Our part of the world has sent to the Senate some of our most \ndistinguished and thoughtful Members. The great Pacific Northwest sent \nWayne Morse from my home State to the Senate and Warren Magnuson and \nScoop Jackson of Washington State. I note that Senator Cantwell is \nhere. Frank Church of Idaho was sent to Washington, and, of course, \nMike Mansfield, Senator Baucus's mentor and pioneer in terms of \npromoting closer relations between our country and Asia. It is very \nfitting that this afternoon Max Baucus joins that very special group of \nSenators from our part of the United States.\n  Second, I wish to caution Senators on one point, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah and I have had a little bit of a laugh \nabout this. Max is exceptionally friendly, and he always tells \nSenators: Our paths are going to cross again. I look forward to working \nwith you in the days ahead. And Senator Hatch and I just want everyone \nhere in the Senate: However close you are to Senator Baucus, that \ndoesn't mean every Senator can insist that Max come back from China to \ntalk about the latest twist in the debate about currency manipulation \nor some other issue.\n  The last point I want to mention is a personal one. When you are here \nin the Senate for more than three decades, you deal with scores of \nbills and amendments, and you talk about coalitions that were built to \npass measures that needed to be passed, and from time to time you have \nto build a coalition to stop something that shouldn't be passed. But \nwhat I want to do--out of those thousands of bills and thousands of \namendments--is talk about a special Baucus commitment that was \nespecially important to me; that is, the needs of senior citizens.\n  Max Baucus had some particularly celebrated wins in the fight for \nseniors--something in which the Presiding Officer of the Senate is very \ninvolved. The reality is that the person who did more to stop the \nprivatization of Social Security here on the floor of the Senate was \nMax Baucus. He was the one who led the coalition. He reached out to \nSenators on both sides and said: Look, of course we need to save more \nfor private retirement savings, but we are going to do that on top of \nSocial Security, not as a replacement for Social Security. So Senator \nBaucus was there building that coalition, making the case for why this \nspecial program, this intergenerational program has been so important \nfor our country.\n  What I remember best about Senator Baucus and seniors, though, is \nwhen the Finance Committee blew the whistle on some of these ripoffs in \nsupplements sold to older people, and eventually these supplements \nreally became the delivery system for Medicare as we know it in much of \nthe country. Senator Cantwell and I, of course, know of the Medicare \nAdvantage Program.\n  We would have hearings in the Finance Committee where we would hear \nabout efforts in the private sector to sell health insurance to seniors \nthat was not worth the paper on which it was written. I remember--kind \nof bringing my Gray Panther roots into the cause--talking to Max about \nthis change and that change, and it would get pretty dense pretty \nquickly. Max just said: This is wrong. This is wrong, to rip senior \ncitizens off this way. And we were able to get those changes. The \nconsumer protections Max Baucus locked into the law for the Nation's \nvulnerable seniors essentially remain the protections of today that are \nused as the model for senior rights.\n  Senator Cantwell and I, since we are both on the committee, also know \nthat in the budget discussions, when it came time for hard choices, Max \nalways made it a priority to stand up for what are known as the dual \neligibles--the seniors who are the most vulnerable, the seniors who \ndon't have political action committees and don't have clout and can't \nparticipate in all of what we normally think of as today's politics, \nfrom fundraising to all of the grassroots work.\n  I will close by saying that when you see somebody week in and week \nout stand for the most vulnerable people in society, such as those dual \neligibles, you learn a lot about what a person feels strongly about, \nwhat values are important to them. So I want to close by saying that \nwhen we talk about the Senators from our part of the world--and Senator \nCantwell remembers so well the legendary Warren Magnuson and Scoop \nJackson and Frank Church, who, by the way, was chair of the Senate \nSelect Committee on Aging. I met him for the first time when I was \ndirector of the Gray Panthers and had a full head of hair and good \nlooks. Max was always on those issues, year after year after year.\n  I hope today, as we reflect on his contributions and certainly all \nthe bills and amendments he offered in the Senate Finance Committee, \npeople will also remember that there is a reason Max belongs with those \ndistinguished Senators I mentioned from the Pacific Northwest. It is \nbecause he had a heart for people, he had a heart for seniors, and he \nhad the values that represent the best in public service.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I too come to the floor to say goodbye \nto our colleague from Montana and wish him well in his new endeavor as \nAmbassador to China--something the Pacific Northwest cares dearly \nabout. So I know we will be working with him in his new capacity, but \nit really is a very historic moment for all of us and certainly for \nthose of us in the Pacific Northwest.\n  I will never forget Max and I riding back to our offices on the \nsubway once\n\n[[Page S801]]\n\nand talking about the Inland Empire. I think people thought we were \nmaking something up, but that is how we refer to our part of the \ncountry and the interior, which is this huge economy that is built on \nagriculture, built on trade, built on natural resources that we hold so \ndear and for which we fight.\n  To come to the Senate and to sit in the seat Scoop Jackson once held \nand think about how you will have the wherewithal and ability to \nremember all of what Scoop and Maggie and everybody fought for and to \nknow the incarnation of that is right there in Max Baucus, the person \nwho worked with them, who saw them, and who then carried that torch on \nthese important policy issues, to me, is so important to recognize \ntoday because he really is a legislator in the mold of Magnuson and \nJackson.\n  I thank Max for one thing in particular; that is, doing deals. Around \nhere people sometimes criticize doing deals. But you know what. The art \nof compromise and moving our country forward requires that, and Max \nbecame a model dealmaker in the context of these important policies on \nwhich we have worked, whether the modernization of the trade \nlegislation for dislocated workers and expanding that program and \nmaking it more robust because it needed to be modernized or whether \nsome of the changes we have made to CHIP, because I can tell you he \ncertainly helped us in Washington State in making sure we had our fair \nshare as regards the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  Just speaking about CHIP in general, I can't say enough about CHIP as \na program. When you get discouraged around here about what we are \nactually getting done or what problems we are solving, if you think of \nnothing else but CHIP--just the Children's Health Insurance Program--\nand literally giving health insurance to millions of children across \nAmerica who wouldn't automatically get health insurance, this job is \nworth it right here and now. So I thank Max for that.\n  Certainly on the Affordable Care Act I have often said that Max \napplied his marathon skills to the patience of Job in actually crafting \nthat legislation. I think we probably worked every day for 2 years in \ncommittee to make that legislation a reality, and it took a lot of \npatience. Many times late at night I would have lost my patience with \nthe process and our colleagues, but Max didn't, and the end result is \nthat this country is moving forward on a major health care policy that \nI know 30 or 40 years from now will be in the same category as our \nother key programs such as Social Security and Medicare, as a \nfoundation and as a base of what we are doing to make sure people have \naffordable health care in this country.\n  Max, I thank you for the staff you hired as well because in the \nFinance Committee, while we didn't always agree on every single policy, \nthey also came to the table ready to make things happen, and I \ncertainly appreciate that.\n  To my colleagues, I feel as though we really are losing a piece of \nour institution today and somebody who really understood the issues \nthat I care about in the Pacific Northwest and somebody who really knew \nhow to make things happen. I know our path forward is a new course on \nthe Finance Committee, but I hope we will continue in the way that Max \nbrought forth issues because in the end it is about improving the lives \nof the people we represent, and that means we are not always going to \nagree, but we are going to have to put ideas on the table and we are \ngoing to have to get them passed into law.\n  So, Max, as you go across the big Pacific, I know you will remember \nus, but we will be looking to you too because there is a lot we have to \nget done. I know that as you are running around Beijing, you will have \nthat little app they now have that shows the level of pollution in \nBeijing that comes right off the U.S. Embassy, and you will be talking \nto the Chinese about how we have to work together on a clean energy \nstrategy, and we will applaud you for that. But don't forget all of us \nhere because there is a lot of work to be done. We are very proud to \ncall you a former colleague and a key leader in the history of the \nInland Empire. Thank you very much, Max.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, this past Sunday before the Super Bowl, \nPresident Obama sat down for an interview.\n  The President was asked about the failure of his healthcare.gov Web \nsite. He talked about how there are always glitches with technology. \nBut then he said this about the Web site:\n\n       It got fixed within a month and a half, it was up and \n     running and now it's working the way it's supposed to.\n\n  According to the President of the United States, healthcare.gov is \nnow ``working the way it's supposed to.'' The President of the United \nStates is in denial.\n  This is an incredible statement that he has made. I find it \nespecially hard to believe, when I looked at the Washington Post the \nnext morning--on Monday, the day after the President's interview where \nhe said ``it's working the way it's supposed to.''\n  Then look at the headline on the front page of the Washington Post on \nMonday, ``Health site can't handle appeals.'' Thousands of requests for \nfixes were filed but unprocessed.\n  Is this what the President of the United States means when he says \nnow ``it's working the way it's supposed to?'' Is the President \noblivious to what is happening in this country with his signature piece \nof legislation? According to this article:\n\n       Tens of thousands of people who discovered that \n     HealthCare.gov made mistakes as they were signing up for a \n     health care plan are confronting a new roadblock: The \n     government cannot yet fix the errors.\n\n  The President may think it is perfect, but there are a lot of errors \nwith his Web site. To say it is working the way it is supposed to, to \nme, cites Presidential denial.\n  ``About 22,000 Americans,'' the article says. Is this what President \nObama means when he says the Web site is working ``the way it's \nsupposed to''? I am talking about the front page of the Washington \nPost, above the fold. One woman quoted in the article says that because \nof a mistake by the Web site, she is paying $100 a month more than she \nshould and her deductible is $4,000 too high. She said she needed the \ninsurance, and now she is stuck.\n  Is this what President Obama thought the Web site was supposed to do? \nWas it supposed to overcharge this woman $100 a month and set her \ndeductible too high by $4,000? Was it supposed to prevent her from \nappealing that mistake?\n  You are stuck with it. The mistake was made by the Web site. You are \nstuck. This is what the President seems to think.\n  Here is another headline which ran on Monday, the day after the \nPresident's interview. This was in the Anchorage Daily News in Alaska. \nIt says, ``Enroll Alaska mistakenly releases hundreds of e-mail \naddresses.''\n  Alaska is one of the States which doesn't use their own exchange. \nThey are part of the Federal exchange which uses healthcare.gov.\n  The article says:\n\n       Enroll Alaska mistakenly released about 300 email addresses \n     Monday afternoon when an employee sent out a mass message \n     about a healthcare.gov glitch without masking its recipients.\n\n  So, No. 1, there was a glitch. Remember, the President says now \n``it's working the way it's supposed to.'' So there was a glitch; they \nsent out an email explaining the glitch, and they end up releasing all \nof the people's personal email addresses when they are trying to point \nout to the incompetence of the Web site in the first place. Is this the \nway President Obama thinks things are supposed to work with his Web \nsite?\n  This is the kind of security issue many of us have been worried about \nfrom the beginning. People have to provide a lot of their personal \ninformation in this Web site--financial information, health \ninformation, Social Security number, demographic information. There is \nnot enough assurance the information is being properly protected.\n  So this time they sent out people's email addresses. Maybe next time \nthey\n\n[[Page S802]]\n\nwill send out people's Social Security numbers, their health \ninformation, their financial information or other personal information.\n  That is not even talking about the lack of security on the Web site \nand whether hackers can break in and steal information. This is just \nhuman error, carelessness, and what people connected to the site are \nsending out by mistake. It is a very real concern.\n  For the President to not take this seriously--and I believe he \ndoesn't take it seriously. I believe he has his head in the sand on all \nof this, and he has dug in on this law. For the President to not take \nthis seriously and say that everything is going ``the way it's supposed \nto'' is a very real problem with the man in the White House.\n  That is just the Web site. That is what the President was talking \nabout in the interview. What else about the health care law is working \nthe way it is supposed to, I ask the Presiding Officer.\n  Is it the millions of people who will be dropping out of the labor \nforce because of the law? On Tuesday morning, the Congressional Budget \nOffice said that is exactly what is going to happen.\n  Here is how the papers reported it:\n  The New York Times, ``Health Care Law Projected to Cut the Labor \nForce.''\n  The Wall Street Journal, ``Health Law to Cut Into Labor Force.''\n  Here is how The Hill put it, ``ObamaCare will cost 2.5M workers by \n2024.''\n  Is this the way the Obama administration thinks its health care law \nis supposed to work? They are actually saying, yes, it is. Jason \nFurman, the President's top economist, said the health care law ``is \nhelping labor markets, is helping businesses, and is helping jobs.''\n  Helping labor markets?\n  Because of the failed policies of the Obama administration, we have \nthe lowest labor force participation rate in 35 years. People have \ngiven up looking for work. The administration should be doing all it \ncan to increase the labor force participation, not celebrating that its \nhealth care law is going to push that number even lower.\n  Middle-class Americans all across this country have seen their \ninsurance premiums go up significantly because of the health care law's \ncostly mandates. They have seen their deductibles go up. Millions of \nhard-working Americans have had their insurance policies canceled. Why? \nBecause of the law.\n  Now we are seeing people's personal information put at risk and we \nare seeing the damage the law is doing to the labor force.\n  President Obama says, ``It's working just the way it's supposed to.'' \nThe President is wrong. The Web site is not working and his health care \nlaw isn't working. It is not working for the American people.\n  The Web site is just the tip of the iceberg. People are finding they \ncan't keep their insurance even if they like it. The front page story \ntoday of the Wall Street Journal: It is harder to keep your doctor, \neven if you want to keep your doctor, in spite of the President's \npromise.\n  We have millions who have had their policies canceled, others losing \ntheir doctors. We have seen premium costs go up, we have seen \ndeductibles and out-of-pocket expenses go up and the issue of security \nfraud.\n  The Web site is a problem. The Web site failure is just a tip of the \niceberg. It is time to get rid of this terrible health care law and \nreplace it with real reform before it does additional damage to \nAmerica's labor force and to the American people.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about one \nof our greatest national security challenges, which is a nuclear-armed \nIran. I have long thought of it as a bipartisan national security \nissue, not a partisan political issue. At the end of the day, it is a \nnational security issue we must approach in the spirit of \nbipartisanship and unity, which has been the spirit for which we have \nworked together on this matter. I hope we will not find ourselves in a \npartisan process trying to force a vote on a national security matter \nbefore its appropriate time.\n  Let me say at the outset that I support the administration's \ndiplomatic efforts. I have always supported a two-track policy of \ndiplomacy and sanctions. At the same time, I am convinced that we \nshould only relieve pressure on Iran in exchange for verifiable \nconcessions that will dismantle Iran's nuclear program. Our success \nshould be measured in years, not months, and that it be done in such a \nway that alarm bells will sound from Vienna to Washington should Iran \nrestart its program anytime in the next 20 to 30 years.\n  I am here to unequivocally state my intention as chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee to make absolutely certain that any deal we \nmay reach with Iran is verifiable, effective, and prevents them from \never developing even one nuclear weapon.\n  Let's remember that while we in the Senate are not at the negotiating \ntable, we have a tremendous stake in the outcome and an obligation, as \na separate coequal branch of government representing the American \npeople, to provide oversight and an expression of what we expect as to \nwhat the end result would be. But it is the administration that is at \nthe negotiating table with the Iranians, not us. The administration is \nultimately responsible for negotiating a deal to conclusively end \nIran's illicit nuclear program. It is the administration that will have \nto come back to Congress and tell us whether Iran will continue to be a \nnuclear threshold state.\n  My sincere desire is for the administration to succeed. No one has \nworked harder for a peaceful outcome or to get Iran to comply with \nsanctions than I have. But based on the parameters described in the \nJoint Plan of Action and Iranian comments in the days that have \nfollowed, I am very concerned. This is not a ``nothing ventured, \nnothing gained'' enterprise. We have placed our incredibly effective \ninternational sanctions regime on the line without clearly defining the \nparameters of what we expect in a final agreement.\n  Ali Akbar Salehi, head of Iran's nuclear agency, spoke last month \nabout the agreement on Iranian state television and said:\n\n       The iceberg of sanctions is melting while our centrifuges \n     are also still working. This is our greatest achievement.\n\n  Well, it is my greatest fear.\n  Any final deal must require Iran to dismantle large portions of its \nillicit nuclear program. Any final deal must require Iran to halt its \nadvanced centrifuge and research and development activities, reduce the \nvast majority of its 20,000 centrifuges, close the Fordo facility, stop \nthe heavy-water reactor at Arak from ever possibly coming online, and \nit should require Iran's full disclosure of its nuclear activities, \nincluding its weaponization activities. For the good of the region and \nthe world, Iran cannot remain a nuclear weapon threshold state, period.\n  A final agreement should move back the timeline for a nuclear \nbreakout capability to beyond a year and insist on a long-term, 20-\nyear-plus monitoring and verification agreement. That is the only way \nto force Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons aspirations. Anything else \nwill leave Iran on the cusp of becoming a nuclear state while it \nrebuilds its economy and improves its ability to break out at a future \nday.\n  David Albright, a respected former International Atomic Energy Agency \ninspector, said that for Iran to move from an interim to a final \nagreement, it would have to close the Fordo facility and remove between \n15,000 and 16,000 of its 20,000 centrifuges. In testimony before the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, he had a long list of elements that \nhe thinks are critical toward a final agreement.\n  However, even after such dramatic steps, we are looking at a breakout \ntime of between 6 and 8 months--depending on whether Iran has access to \njust 3.5 percent enriched uranium or access to 20 percent enriched \nuranium. Dennis Ross, one of America's preeminent diplomats and foreign \npolicy analysts who has served Republican and Democratic Presidents \nalike, has said Iran should retain no more than 10\n\n[[Page S803]]\n\npercent of its centrifuges, which is, in essence, no more than 2,000.\n  These estimates are crucial because at the end of the day we in this \nbody will have to decide whether this is enough to merit terminating \nsanctions. Is a 6-month delay in Iran's breakout ability enough, even \nwhen combined with a robust 20-year inspection and verification \nregime--understanding that in allowing Iran to retain its enrichment \ncapabilities, there will always be a risk of breakout. It may be that \nthis is the only deal we can get. The real question is whether it is a \ngood enough deal to merit terminating sanctions.\n  My concern is that the Joint Plan of Action does not speak to these \nrecommended centrifuge limitations Dennis Ross or Dr. Albright \nsuggests. In fact, Iran has already made its views about the \nlimitations of the agreement quite clear. What the Joint Plan of Action \ndoes concede is that Iran will not only retain its ability to enrich \nbut will be allowed a mutually agreed upon enrichment program.\n  Here is what Iran's Foreign Minister Zarif said about the interim \nagreement:\n\n       The White House tries to portray it as basically a \n     dismantling of Iran's nuclear program . . . we are not \n     dismantling any centrifuges, we are not dismantling any \n     equipment, we're simply not producing, not enriching over 5 \n     percent.\n\n  That is a quote from their Foreign Minister.\n  What does President Ruhani of Iran say? He was adamant in an \ninterview on CNN in saying that Iran will not be dismantling its \ncentrifuges. He said:\n\n       We are determined to provide for the nuclear fuel of such \n     plants inside the country, at the hands of local Iranian \n     scientists. We are going to follow on this path.\n\n  On that program, Fareed Zakaria asked him:\n\n       So there will be no destruction of centrifuges, of existing \n     centrifuges.\n\n  President Ruhani said:\n\n       No. No, not at all.\n\n  In fact, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that Iran \nwould comply with the interim agreement by removing the connections \nbetween networks of centrifuges that have been used to enrich uranium \nto 20 percent so they can enrich only to 5 percent. Then he said:\n\n       These interconnections can be removed in a day and \n     connected again in a day.\n\n  That is not the type of safeguard we need. Clearly, their intention--\nat least in these negotiations--is to retain their capability \nnotwithstanding the agreement. That is pretty clear to me.\n  In January President Ruhani tweeted:\n\n       Our relationship with the world is based on Iranian \n     nation's interest. In Geneva agreement world powers \n     surrendered to Iranian nation's will.\n  When this tweet was broadly reported on, President Rouhani took it \ndown. In a speech when Rouhani was leaving his post as Iran's chief \nnegotiator in 2005, he said:\n\n       While we were talking with the Europeans in Tehran, we were \n     installing equipment in parts of the facility in Isfahan-- \n     which is a uranium conversion facility--\n\nwhich is a uranium conversion facility--\n\n     but we still had a long way to go to complete the project. In \n     fact, by creating a calm environment, we were able to \n     complete the work on Isfahan.\n\n  In essence, they were able to complete the work of the uranium \nconversion.\n  Now, sometimes I think it is worthy to listen to the words of these \nindividuals now in leadership positions to understand the mindset of \nthe negotiations that are taking place. Basically, what President \nRouhani was saying is that he was able to get the West to not pursue \nsanctions and ultimately to not take any other action, as Iran \ncontinued to march forward with its nuclear program. I find comments \nsuch as that deeply troubling. I find troubling the fact that even \nafter an agreement was reached in November, the Iranians reportedly \nfired a rocket into space to improve their ability to develop a long-\nrange ballistic missile system.\n  In an interview with Reuters, U.S. missile defense expert Rikki \nEllison said of the report:\n\n       If it's true, they continue to expand and grow their long \n     range missile capabilities regardless of their overture to \n     the West with self-reduction of their nuclear capabilities . \n     . .\n\n  These realities--these statements, these actions--are just as much \nabout the spirit of the interim deal as it is about the letter of the \ndeal, and it places in question the political will of the Iranians and \nour ability to reach a verifiable agreement with those who have been \nwilling to so deceive.\n  In terms of both Iran's political will and its ballistic missile \ncapability, James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, said \nthe following:\n\n       Tehran has made technical progress in a number of areas--\n     including uranium enrichment, nuclear reactors, and ballistic \n     missiles--from which it could draw if it decided to build \n     missile-deliverable nuclear weapons. These technical \n     advancements strengthen our assessment that Iran has the \n     scientific, technical, and industrial capacity to eventually \n     produce nuclear weapons. This makes the central issue its \n     political will to do so.\n\n  So what the analysis reveals is that years of obfuscation, delay, and \nendless negotiation has brought the Iranians to the point of having, \naccording to the Director of National Intelligence, the scientific, \ntechnical, and industrial capacity to eventually produce nuclear \nweapons. As to their will to do so, I would say that if they are--I \nwould say that what they are hiding at the Parchin Military Industrial \nComplex, if revealed, would clearly show their will to build a nuclear \nbomb. The only thing that has thwarted that will is crippling \nsanctions. The Iranians have fought back every step of the way with the \ninternational community getting access to Parchin, and the world \nlargely views Parchin as the place in which their militarization of \nnuclear energy--therefore nuclear weapons--was taking place. In my \nview, the Iranians are negotiating in bad faith, as we have seen them \ndo in the past. They say one thing behind closed doors in Geneva and \nsay another thing publicly. I know the administration will say this is \nwhat President Rouhani needs to do for his domestic audience.\n  But his deeds need to go beyond his words, and they need to be \nverifiable. In fact, in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, David Albright, of \nthe Institute of Science and International Security and an expert on \nthe proliferation of atomic weapons, said that under the interim \nagreement:\n\n       The breakout times, if Iran used its currently installed \n     centrifuges, would lengthen from at least 1 to 1.6 months to \n     at least 1.9 to 2.2 months.\n\n  That effectively means that without dismantling currently installed \ncentrifuges, Iran has a breakout time of 6 to 8 weeks, unless we demand \nreal consequences in a final agreement--6 to 8 weeks. That figure is \ngoing to be very important, as I will get to later, because 6 to 8 \nweeks is a lot shorter than the time frame to invoke and make sanctions \neffective.\n  Another major concern is the Arak heavy water reactor--a facility \nthat Dennis Ross has described as ``grossly inefficient for producing \nelectricity, but not for generating plutonium for nuclear weapons.''\n  The Senate was told that this facility would be taken care of in the \nfinal agreement, which most of us understood to mean that it would be \ndismantled. Now, the Joint Plan of Action and the implementing \nagreement suggest something less than dismantlement. The implementing \nagreement says that Iran has to ``take steps to agree with the IAEA on \nthe conclusion of a safeguards approach to Arak.'' Iran has not \nprovided required design information for Arak, as we thought was going \nto happen, and in the final agreement it seems possible that either \nIran will be allowed to complete the reactor and operate it under IAEA \nsafeguards or the reactor will simply be mothballed--not dismantled but \nmothballed--or perhaps converted to a light-water facility that carries \nits own risks.\n  Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister has said that the Arak reactor is the \nfastest way to get the material for a nuclear weapon. So while I \nunderstand the agreement also does not permit Iran to construct a \nrelated reprocessing facility at this time, the implication of the \nagreement's language is that the final agreement will not actually \nrequire the dismantling of the Arak reactor, meaning that Arak could, \nat a future date, give Iran a relatively quick path to a weapon, and I \nfind that simply unacceptable.\n  In my view, Iran's strategy, consistent with their past approaches \nthat\n\n[[Page S804]]\n\nhave brought them to a nuclear threshold state, is to use these \nnegotiations to mothball its nuclear infrastructure program just long \nenough to undo the international sanctions regime.\n  Iran is insisting on keeping core elements of its programs--\nenrichment, the Arak heavy-water reactor, the underground Fordow \nfacility, and the Parchin military complex. While they may be subject \nto safeguards so they can satisfy the international community in the \nshort run, if they are allowed to retain their core infrastructure, \nthey could quickly revive their program sometime in the future. At the \nsame time, Iran is seeking to reverse the harsh international sanctions \nregime against them.\n\n  The bottom line is this. If they get their way, if they dismantle \nnothing, we gut the sanctions, and troubling signs have already \nappeared.\n  Since the interim deal was signed, there was an immediate effort by \nmany nations--including many European nations--to revive trade and \nresume business with Iran. There have been recent headlines that the \nRussians may be seeking a barter deal that could increase Iran's oil \nexports by 50 percent; that Iran and Russia are negotiating an oil-for-\ngoods deal worth $1.5 billion a month--$18 billion a year--which would \nsignificantly boost Iran's oil exports by 500,000 barrels a day in \nexchange for Russian goods.\n  To the administration's credit, when we have raised this issue, they \nhave said they are aware of those concerns and have told the Russians \nthat, in fact, if they were to pursue that, it would be actionable, \nmeaning it would be subject to sanctions. But I am not sure that \nVladimir Putin really is going to be thwarted by such warnings.\n  A coalition of France's largest companies is already visiting Tehran. \nIran welcomed more than 100 executives from France's biggest firms on \nMonday, the most senior French trade mission in years. Since November \nthere have been 20-plus trade delegations from Turkey, Georgia, \nIreland, Tunisia, Kazakhstan, China, Italy, India, Austria, and Sweden. \nWhat is the result? Iran's economy is recovering. The Iranian rial, \nwhich is in essence their dollar, had plummeted from an official rate \nof 10,440 rials to the dollar to a staggering 41,000 to a dollar in \nOctober of 2012. But it has begun to recover. As of January 29, that \nrate has gone from 41,000 to a single dollar to 25,000 rials to the \ndollar.\n  International Monetary Fund figures also show Iran's negative growth \nturning around, with Iran having a projected growth rate of 1.28 \npercent to almost 2 percent in 2014 and 2015.\n  As Mark Dubowitz, the executive director of the Foundation for \nDefense of Democracies, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee this week, the $7 billion in actual relief Iran will \ndefinitively receive under the Joint Plan of Action is very \nsignificant--comprising approximately 35 percent of Iran's fully \naccessible cash reserves, which are estimated to be $20 billion.\n  So while the Iranian economy is described as being much larger, the \nassessment that this is a drop in the bucket is simply not accurate. \nMoreover, that relief fails to consider the $4 billion to $5 billion in \nrevenue that Iran would have lost if we had not suspended sanctions on \nIran's crude oil exports as required under existing law. Sanctions \nrelief, combined with the ``open for business'' sign that Iran is \nposting, is paying returns. It seems to me the sanctions regime we have \nworked so hard to build is starting to unravel before we ever get a \nchance to conclude a final agreement with Iran.\n  The fact is that any final deal as inadequate as the one I have \noutlined will end any pressure on Iran for the foreseeable future. Put \nsimply, we need a policy that guarantees Iran does not acquire nuclear \nweapons capability, period.\n  To understand how to proceed, we must also understand the facts. We \nneed to put the negotiating into context. First, Iran has a history of \nduplicity with respect to its nuclear program, using past negotiations \nto cover up advances in its nuclear program, and, most startling, at \nthe undeclared Fordow enrichment site, buried very deep in a mountain \nto prevent its discovery and protect against destruction. That begs the \nquestion: Why would they bury a facility so deep so that it could not \nbe discovered if it was solely for the peaceful purposes they claim? It \nseems unlikely, as Iran's leaders have made clear in recent days, that \nIran will make any concessions that fundamentally dismantle its nuclear \nprogram.\n  The fact is Iran is simply agreeing to lock the door on its nuclear \nweapons program, as is, and walk away. Should they later walk away from \nthe deal as they have in the past, they can simply unlock the door and \ncontinue their nuclear weapons program from where they are today. It \nsounds a lot like North Korea.\n  Let's not forget that President Rouhani, as the former negotiator for \nIran, boasted:\n\n       The day that we invited the three European ministers to the \n     talks, only 10 centrifuges were spinning at Natanz. We could \n     not produce one gram of U4 or U6. We did not have the heavy \n     water production. We could not produce yellow cake . . . Our \n     total production of centrifuges inside the country was 150 . \n     . . We wanted to complete all of these--we needed time. We \n     did not stop. We completed the program.\n\n  So 150 then; 20,000 today. The simple truth is he admitted to \ndeceiving the West.\n  Given President Rouhani's own words on his country's nuclear weapons \nambition, it seems to me a good deal is not one that equates \ndismantling with mothballing. A good deal would prevent Iran from being \nable to get back to work on its nuclear weapons program from where it \nleft off.\n  Second, despite diplomatic entreaties to the Iranians in recent years \nwhere hands were extended and secret talks were pursued, Iran has grown \nits support and advocacy for terror.\n  The history of Iranian terror against U.S. citizens and interests is \nlengthy and robust, grounded in the view that the United States is the \ngreat Satan, and with its funding and support of Hezbollah that has \ncarried out attacks against American interests. Colleagues will recall \nthat 241 American servicemen died in the 1983 Marine Corps barracks in \nLebanon and 19 in the Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia. In recent \nyears, we have traced responsibility for lethal actions against \nAmerican troops in Iraq and Afghanistan to Iran, as well as the \nfortunately thwarted attack on the Saudi ambassador at a Washington \nrestaurant in 2011.\n  Today Iran is actively sponsoring a proxy war in Syria, sending \nmoney, weapons, and fighters on a weekly basis.\n  Simultaneously, it is sponsoring attacks against Sunnis in Iraq and \npromoting regional sectarian violence that could easily result in a \nbroader regional conflict. So while smiling at our negotiators across \nthe table, they are simultaneously plotting in the backroom.\n  With all this in mind, I believe in the wisdom of the prospective \nsanctions I proposed. I believe in the lessons of history that tell us \nIran cannot be trusted to live up to its word without external \npressure, and I believe an insurance policy that guards against Iranian \nobfuscation and deception is the best way forward.\n  I know there is a difference of view, but I truly believe that what \ngot Iran to the negotiating table is the only element of peaceful \ndiplomacy that can keep it there and ultimately drive a successful \nnegotiation.\n  My legislation, cosponsored by 59 Senators, would simply require that \nIran act in good faith, adhering to the implementing agreement, not \nengaging in new acts of terror against American citizens or U.S. \nproperty, and not conducting new ballistic missile tests with a range \nbeyond 500 kilometers.\n  The legislation is not the problem and Congress is not the problem. \nIran is the problem. We need to worry more about Iran than we need to \nworry about the Congress. We need to focus on Iran's long history of \ndeceptions surrounding its nuclear program and how this should inform \nour approach to reaching a comprehensive deal.\n  To those who believe if negotiations do not result in a deal or if \nIran breaks the deal we can always impose new sanctions, then let me be \nclear: If negotiations fail or if Iran breaks the deal, we will not \nhave time to pass new sanctions that would have a real consequence.\n  New sanctions are not a spigot that can be turned off and on, as has \nbeen suggested. Even if Congress were to take up and pass new sanctions \nat the\n\n[[Page S805]]\n\nmoment of Iran's first breach of the Joint Plan of Action or if they do \nnot reach an ultimate agreement that is acceptable, there is a lag time \nof at least 6 months to bring those sanctions online and at least 1 \nyear for real impact to be felt.\n  That has been our history here. I authored most of these, and they \nneed a lead time. You need to give countries and companies the time to \nbe noticed as to what is going to be sanctioned so they can rearrange \ntheir engagements. Then you have to have the regulations to go through \nand then you have to have the enforcement take place.\n  This would bring us beyond the very short time Iran would need to \nbuild a nuclear bomb, especially since the interim agreement does not \nrequire them either to dismantle anything and basically freezes their \ncapability as it stands today. So let everyone understand, if there is \nno deal, I do not think we are going to have the time to impose new \nsanctions before Iran can produce a nuclear weapon.\n  Everyone agrees the comprehensive sanctions policy against Iran--\nwhich was led by Congress and originally opposed by the \nadministration--has been an unquestionable success. Iran's oil exports \nfell to 1.1 million barrels a day in the first 9 months of 2013, down \nfrom 1.5 million barrels in 2012. The fall in exports was costing Iran \nbetween $4 billion and $8 billion a month in 2013, and the loss of oil \nrevenue had caused the rial to lose two-thirds of its value against the \ndollar and caused inflation to rise to more than 40 percent.\n  There is no dispute or disagreement that it was the economic impact \nof sanctions that has brought Iran to the negotiating table in the \nfirst place. But passing those sanctions and having them in place long \nenough to be effective took time--time that I am concerned we no longer \nhave.\n  The question now is whether our goals align. Has the ideology of the \nregime altered so substantially in the last 6 months that they are \nready to forswear a 20-year effort--a 20-year effort--to develop \nnuclear weapons or are they, as the Supreme Leader has stated, seeking \nto beat us at the game of diplomacy--``to negotiate with the Devil to \neliminate its evil''--and retain their nuclear threshold and enriching \nabilities while degrading the sanctions regime?\n  Let's not forget it is the Ayatollah--I know we are placing a lot of \nfaith in President Ruhani and the Iranian Foreign Minister--but it is \nthe Ayatollah who holds the nuclear portfolio, and his main goal is \nwhat. Preservation of the regime. It is the Ayatollah who gave the \ngreen light to Ruhani to negotiate. Why? Because the sanctions were \ncausing the Ayatollah to be concerned about regime change taking place \nwithin Iranian society due to the consequences of sanctions on the \nIranian economy.\n  Interestingly enough, who benefits from the sanctions relief? The \nAyatollah. In a Reuters story with the title ``Khamenei's business \nempire gains from Iran sanctions relief,'' it goes on to talk about \nthat:\n\n       Khamenei controls a massive business empire known as Setad \n     that has invested in Iran's petrochemical industry, which is \n     now permitted to resume [its] exports.\n\n  It also states:\n\n       In an interview with Reuters this week, a Treasury \n     Department official estimated that Iran would generate at \n     most $1 billion in revenue--\n\n  Mr. President, $1 billion in revenue--\n\n     from petrochemical exports over the next six months.\n\n  Who is the one who has a great deal of interest in the petrochemical \nsection? The Ayatollah, by his control of Setad.\n  I have worked on Iran's nuclear issues for 20 years, starting when I \nwas a Member of the House, pressing for sanctions to prevent Iran from \nbuilding the Bushehr nuclear powerplant and to halt IAEA support for \ntheir uranium mining and enrichment programs.\n  For a decade I was told my concerns had no legitimate basis; that \nIran would never be able to bring the Bushehr plant online; and that \nIran's activities were not the most major concern.\n  History has shown us that those assessments about Iran's abilities \nand intentions were simply wrong. The fact is Iran's nuclear \naspirations did not materialize overnight. Iran has been slowly, \nmethodically working up to this moment for decades, and now--if its \ncapability is mothballed rather than dismantled--they will remain at \nthe cusp of being a declared nuclear state should they choose to start \nagain because nothing will have changed if nothing is significantly \ndismantled.\n  Make no mistake. Iran views developing a nuclear capability as \nfundamental to its existence. It sees the development of nuclear \nweapons as part of a regional hegemonic strategy to make Tehran the \ncenter of power throughout the region.\n  That is why our allies and partners in the region--and not just \nIsraelis, but Emiratis and Saudis, among others--are so skeptical and \nso concerned. Quite simply, our allies and partners do not trust \nIranian leaders, nor do they believe Iran has any intention of \nverifiably ending its nuclear weapons program.\n  So while I welcome the diplomatic efforts, and I share the hope that \nthe administration can achieve a final comprehensive agreement that \neliminates this threat to global peace and security, I am deeply--\ndeeply--skeptical based upon these 20 years--based upon these 20 \nyears--of experience.\n  The simple and deeply troubling fact is Iran is literally weeks to \nmonths from a breakout, and the parameters of the final agreement laid \nout in the Joint Plan of Action do not appear to set Iran's development \ncapacity back by more than a few weeks.\n  The Joint Plan of Action conceded, even before negotiations had \nbegun, Iran's right to some level of enrichment, despite a U.N. \nresolution calling for Iran to suspend enrichment.\n  It provides no guarantees that we will resolve our concerns about \nIranian weaponization activities, that Iran will cease advanced \ncentrifuge research. Why is that important? Because we heard testimony \nthat the more advanced the centrifuge, the less centrifuges you need, \nthe quicker you can produce enriched uranium to be able to acquire that \nbomb and the increasingly less verifiable it is. So Iran should have to \ncease its advanced centrifuge research. It also provides no guarantees \nthat we will resolve our concerns that the IAEA will gain access to the \nParchin military base, that Iran will dismantle thousands of \ncentrifuges or that the Iranians will disclose the scope of their \nactivities.\n  It suggests that the resolution for the Arak heavy-water reactors, \nwhich can provide a quicker plutonium pathway to nuclear weapons, may \nbe to put it under IAEA safeguards rather than require its \ndismantlement. It seems to me we do not have time, under the testimony \ntaken before the committee, for Iran to hedge and obfuscate. They have \ndone a pretty good job of that, and that is what has brought them to \nthe cusp of being a nuclear state. There should be no chance for Iran \nto buy more time, which, in effect, leaves us exactly where we are--\njust hitting a pause button--with the state of play unchanged and Iran \nweeks from breakout. To me that is a bad agreement, and in my view we \nshould be negotiating from a position of strength.\n  Last Tuesday night in the State of the Union, the President said:\n\n       If John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could negotiate with \n     the Soviet Union, then surely a strong and confident America \n     can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today.\n\n  I agree. But I would point out to my colleagues that they did so from \na position of strength. President Kennedy sent U.S. warships to face \ndown the Soviets in Cuba, and Ronald Reagan dramatically built up U.S. \nmilitary might to an extent that what was the former Soviet Union could \nnot keep up the pace. We need to negotiate with Iran from a position of \nstrength, and then, yes--then we should have no fear about any such \nnegotiation.\n  The concerns I have raised are legitimate. They are not, as the \nPresident's Press Secretary has said, ``warmongering.'' This is not \nsaber rattling. It is not Congress wanting to ``march to war,'' as \nanother White House spokesman said, but exactly the opposite.\n  I find it interesting--as someone who was then in the House of \nRepresentatives and was in a small minority voting against the war in \nIraq, when an overwhelming number of my colleagues and many Members of \nthis body were voting for the war--to somehow be portrayed as a \nwarmonger. It is my mind that the use of sanctions--which is a limited \npart of an arsenal of peaceful\n\n[[Page S806]]\n\ndiplomacy tools--can get us to the successful negotiations we want.\n  At the end of the day, trying to keep the pressure on Iran to \ncompletely satisfy the United Nations' and the international \ncommunity's demands for Iran to halt and reverse its illicit nuclear \nactivities is the best way to avoid war in the first place--to avoid \nwar in the first place.\n  Iran has proven in the past it will not negotiate in good faith \nexcept when it has no other choice--as the tough sanctions we passed \nhave proven, by getting Iran to the table.\n  Iran says it will not negotiate with a gun to its head. I would \nsuggest it is Iran that has put the potential of a nuclear gun to the \nworld's head.\n  At the end of the day, name-calling is not an argument, nor is it a \nsound policy. It is a false choice to say a vote for sanctions is \nequivalent to warmongering. More pressure on Iran does not in any way \nsuggest that Congress wants war or that the Iranians feel backed into a \ncorner and will themselves choose war over reason.\n  So let's stop talking about warmongering. Let's instead fixate on the \nfinal deal which, in my view, cannot and should not rely simply on \ntrust but on real, honest, verifiable dismantlement of Iran's \ncapability to produce even one nuclear bomb.\n  The ball is in the administration's court, not in Congress's. In \nfact, the agreement specifically states--there has been a lot of talk \nabout how we should not consider any new sanctions, even if they are \nprospective, which the legislation says nothing would happen until up \nto 1 year, unless Iran violates the interim agreement or fails to \nconclude an agreement in 1 year. But if we read the Joint Plan of \nAction, what does it say? It says:\n\n       The U.S. Administration, acting consistent with the \n     respective roles of the President and the Congress, will \n     refrain from imposing new nuclear-related sanctions.\n\n  It does not say the United States of America. It does not say the \nCongress. It says the ``Administration, acting consistent with the \nrespective roles of the President and the Congress, will refrain from \nimposing new nuclear-related sanctions.''\n  That is because the agreement acknowledges that the administration, \nnot Congress, will refrain from imposing new sanctions. The \nadministration knew it could not bind Congress to refrain from imposing \nnew sanctions because Congress is a separate coequal branch of \ngovernment.\n  So let's focus on what was agreed to by those at the table rather \nthan attributing blame to those who were not. We will not be the \nscapegoats for a bad deal if it does not take the nuclear weapons \noption off the table by insisting on dismantling existing capability, \nnot simply mothballing it.\n  So let me say I want diplomacy to work. That is why we worked so hard \nto get to the opportunity. I wanted to produce the results we all hoped \nfor and have worked for.\n  But at a minimum, we need to send a message to Iran that our patience \nis not unlimited and that we are skeptical of their intentions and a \nmessage to the international community that the sanctions regime has \nnot weakened, that this is not an opportunity to reengage with Tehran. \nI would urge everyone to look at the legislation I have drafted with my \ncolleague from Illinois and Members of both caucuses as a win for the \nadministration. They succeeded in convincing us--the administration \nsucceeded in convincing us to provide up to a 1-year window to \nnegotiate.\n  That is not the way the legislation was originally intended. But they \nconvinced us they needed an opportunity to negotiate and, hence, the \nlegislation was worked in such a way to create that opportunity. I \nbelieve that is significant and generous, given Iran's history of \ntreachery and deceit. If Iran steps away from the negotiations or does \nnot live up to its agreement, it will be because they are not serious \nabout reaching a comprehensive deal.\n  I have heard the concerns of the administration. I know we share the \nsame goals. We have taken steps in the Foreign Relations Committee in \npursuit of those goals. We have worked with the administration to pass \nlegislation to help reform the Organization of American States. We have \nmoved 129--more now with the last week of nominees--that the \nadministration has put forward. We worked through Labor Day in a \nbipartisan effort to quickly pass a resolution authorizing the use of \nmilitary force in Syria, which gave the President--there are those who \nare critical of that as well--but that authorization gave the President \nthe ability to go to Russia and get a deal to end the use of chemical \nweapons in Syria.\n  We passed and the President signed PEPFAR into law, the President's \nemergency plan for AIDS relief. We have worked with the administration \non embassy security after Benghazi. We have worked with countless \nadministration officials and held two hearings on the Convention on the \nRights of Persons with Disabilities. In all of those actions and much \nmore, I have worked closely with the administration. My intention now \nis to assist the administration again in its negotiations by keeping \nthe pressure on Iran, which has always proven an unreliable negotiating \npartner at best.\n  In my view, it is time to put Iranian rhetoric to the test. If we are \nto take President Ruhani at his word, when he said in Davos last week \nthat Iran does not seek nuclear weapons, if that is true, then the \nIranian Government should not have any problems with the obvious \nfollowup to that claim, starting with the verifiable dismantling of its \nillicit nuclear infrastructure. That is all the sanctions legislation \ndoes. I do not think we should settle for anything less.\n  So let's be clear. I do not come to this floor in opposition, I come \nin comity and in the spirit of unity that has always dictated our \nforeign policy. But the Senate has an obligation to challenge \nassumptions in a free and open debate. That is what is most \nextraordinary about our government, and it echoes in the many debates \nwe have held in this Chamber on war and peace, on justice and freedom \nand civil rights.\n  At the end of the day, we have an obligation to speak our minds on \nwhat we believe is in the best interests of this Nation. It is in that \nspirit that I come to the floor today. As GEN George Marshall said, \n``Go right straight down the road, to do what is best, and do it \nfrankly without evasion.'' Today I am advocating for what I believe is \nin our national interests and to do so as frankly and comprehensively \nas I can.\n  As John Kennedy said about having differences of opinion, ``Let us \nnot be blind to [them], but let us also direct our attention to our \ncommon interests and to the means by which those differences can be \nresolved.'' The administration and the Senate have a common interest to \nprevent a nuclear weapons-capable Iran. We have differences as to how \nto achieve it. We have an obligation to debate those differences and \nconcerns.\n  But I will not yield on a principled difference. It is our obligation \nto debate the issues, express our differences and outcomes, and come to \nthe floor to work together to resolve them. At the end of the day, my \nhope, as someone who has been working on this for 20 years, can see the \nfruition of a successful negotiation by the President and the \nadministration so Iran will never have a nuclear weapons capability.\n  But by the same token, I think we need to be poised to ensure that we \nuse the last elements of peaceful diplomacy, which is to ensure there \nare sanctions that create consequences to the regime so they can put \nthat in their equation as to it is better to strike a deal and end our \nillicit nuclear program than it is to pursue a course that creates \nnuclear weapons. Because, if not, I fear, if we continue down this path \nand our sanctions erode and all we do is limit and have safeguard \nnotices, warning signs, we will get the warning signs, but the \nsanctions will be gone and the only options left to a future American \nPresident will be do you accept a nuclear-armed Iran or do you have a \nmilitary option. Those are not desirable options.\n  It is our effort to avoid that being the ultimate question. That is \nwhat we embody in the sanctions legislation that has passed this \nChamber and has been signed by the President and that we believe, \nprospectively, can increase the pressure on Iran to come to that \npeaceful conclusion, so that option of either accepting a nuclear-armed \nIran or having to have a military option to prevent it from doing so is \nnot the option for our country and for any future American President.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S807]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Russian Relations\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I come today because tomorrow is the \nformal start of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. We certainly wish \nall of our athletes well. We have a few from Florida. Believe it or \nnot, the Sunshine State has contributed a number of athletes to the \nWinter Olympic efforts of our country. We wish them all the best.\n  We pray for their safety. We have all read media reports of the \npotential for attacks. We pray that does not happen. Of course, our \ngovernment has tried to be as cooperative as possible with the Russian \nGovernment in providing some level of security assistance. They have \nbeen less than open about that. So we hope and pray things will go well \nthere. Let me just say at the outset, Olympics should never be \npoliticized. I hope these are not either. So my comments are not about \nthe Olympics per se, but I do think it is an important time, given \nwhere they are occurring, to take a moment to reflect on the nature of \nand our Nation's relationship with the host country, with Russia, \nbecause they are going to be in the news a lot over the next few days.\n  We have all heard the debates about some of the more extreme examples \nof intolerance that exist within Russia, particularly as a result of \nPresident Vladimir Putin and his government.\n  I want to take a moment to describe where I think the relations \nbetween Russia and the United States stand and particularly how Russia \nviews itself--the government, I should say--in the world.\n  At the outset let me begin by saying that when I talk about \ngovernments, when I talk about countries such as Russia or China, for \ninstance, we are talking about the government leaders, not the people. \nIn fact, we know that in both of those countries--especially in Russia, \nin China, as well as in many other countries--there are people who do \nnot like the direction their political leadership is taking them.\n  In fact, I would say that in countries such as China and Russia it \nmight be the majority of people who strongly disagree with the \ndirection that its so-called leaders are taking. What we talk about is \nour relationship with their governments--and in this case our \nrelationship with Vladimir Putin and the decisions that he has made.\n  The best way to understand the situation with Russia is that there is \nprimarily a president who has nationalistic tendencies in Putin, and he \nwants Russia to somehow reclaim what he views as its glory days of \nworld prominence. He believes and has concluded that the best way to do \nthat is to be antagonistic and outright hostile to the United States. \nPart of that plan is an effort to create among his neighbors--\nparticularly those republics that used to be part of the Soviet Union--\nto bring them under Russia's sphere of influence.\n  We have two stunning examples of that over the past few years. The \nfirst is the Republic of Georgia, which they invaded a few years ago, \nand even now they occupy territory within it.\n  In fact, as part of these Olympics, one of the things Russia has done \nis it has sealed off portions of Georgian territory they claim they \nneed for a security buffer. That is completely outrageous, but that is \nhappening with very little attention on the international stage.\n  The other is to see what is happening in Ukraine and to see how they \nused the threat of noncooperation economically, and even subterfuge \neconomically, to try to force Ukraine to reject a deal to integrate \nwith the European Union and instead seek to be part of this new thing \nthat the Russian government is trying to create.\n  As part of that agenda as well, they have viewed themselves with the \nneed to be antagonistic toward the United States. But in the process of \ndoing that, not only have they been antagonistic toward the United \nStates, they have been antagonistic toward the cause of human rights \nand of world peace.\n  There are some stunning examples.\n  Certainly within Russia we have seen the targeting and the oppression \nof everything from a rock band to journalists. We know the story of \nSergei Magnitsky, who was doing nothing more than investigating rampant \nofficial corruption. We saw how what happened with him.\n  We have seen it line up on the international stage. For example, they \nare--perhaps other than Iran, and perhaps equal with Iran--the most \nimportant supporter of Assad and of what he is doing in Syria--the \nslaughter of innocent civilians. There are over 100,000 people dead and \nhundreds of thousands of others now living in refugee camps, displaced \nfrom their homes. This is who the Russian President and the Russian \ngovernment have lined up with.\n  Beyond that, we should see the attitude they have taken toward Iran. \nThey have not been, despite the administration's assertions, productive \nin dealing with Iran's nuclear ambitions. On the contrary, they have \nbeen supportive or at a minimum have been a roadblock to progress being \nmade with regard to preventing a nuclear Iran.\n  On issue after issue we see this Russian government lining itself up \ndiametrically opposed not only to the interests of the United States \nbut to the interests of the cause of world peace. I understand that the \nsituation in Syria is complicated, but how could one possibly find \nhimself to be such a strong and blind ally of a killer, a murderer, a \ncriminal like Assad?\n  There are problems in those rebel groups too. There are some \nterrorists involved in that. Unfortunately, it appears they have grown \nin prominence among the rebellion. It is not an easy issue to confront, \nbut at a minimum one would expect that a country that believes in human \nrights and the dignity of all the people would at a minimum add their \nvoice in condemnation of what is happening in Syria, and to the conduct \nof the Assad government.\n  Instead, they have been involved in trying to pursue ridiculous \nconspiracy theories, such as the notion that somehow the chemical \nattacks that occurred there were not conducted by Assad and his regime.\n  Beyond those things and what they have done at home and abroad, what \nhave they done directly toward the United States? Let's talk about what \nthey have done toward their neighbors and the constant threats to their \nneighbors--and in some instances a willingness to carry it out by \ninvading the Republic of Georgia.\n  Then, of course, we turn to their relationship with us. What have \nthey done? A couple of actions bear watching.\n  The first is what they have done with their weapons systems. They \ncontinue to invest an extraordinary amount of money--for a country that \nis going through the economic challenges that they are confronting--to \nbuild up their conventional weapons capabilities. They are again \nsending naval forces to different parts of the world, trying to flex \nsome muscle.\n  It is not as powerful as the Soviet Union, but they are trying to \nproject power in that way. Usually they find places to project power \nthat they know would somehow challenge the strategic interests of the \nUnited States. Last week we read in the New York Times that there is \nevidence they may be in violation of an arms control agreement.\n  In the face of all of this, the initial attitude of this \nadministration was that we need to reset policy toward Russia and \nunderstand what was behind that idea. What was behind that idea was the \nnotion that the reason we didn't have a good relationship with Putin \nand with Russia and the Russian government was because the U.S.--the \nprevious President, George W. Bush--was too abrasive. This is not only \nfor Russia, but this is a theory they applied all over the world. If we \ncould only reset that relationship, if we could just be more \ncooperative with them, and if we could show them that we were more \nwilling to talk and be open-minded, somehow that would affect their \nbehavior.\n  What did Putin and their government do? They did what any good former\n\n[[Page S808]]\n\nKGB agent would do. They took what we offered them and kept doing what \nthey wanted. They took whatever concessions we were putting on the \ntable, and they kept doing whatever they wanted.\n  What is stunning to me is not only the administration's unwillingness \nto acknowledge that the reset policy has not worked, but in some \ninstances their desire to double down on us. The President continues to \ntalk about additional reductions in strategic weapons vis-a-vis the \nRussians.\n  Yet last week we heard, as I said a moment ago, that they are \nprobably already in violation of an existing agreement. We have allowed \nthem to convince us not to pursue anti-missile technologies or advanced \nand additional anti-missile technologies and defense systems in Eastern \nEurope.\n  Our allies, by the way, look at us and say: What is going on? It adds \nto this air of instability. It adds to the questions that now exist, \nand it adds to the notion that we have now become an unreliable ally in \nthe world. Other countries are watching this as well, and they are \ntaking note. This is the situation that we face. Because the Olympics \nare in Russia, the whole world is about to see it.\n\n  For example, we can't say for sure that this had anything to do with \nthe government, but last night--I read a report today in the Wall \nStreet Journal that said that for one of its reporters, in the middle \nof the night someone opened the door to their room and tried to walk in \nfor a moment.\n  Again, do we know if that was the Russian government? No, we don't \nknow that for sure, but that seems to be a recurring issue there--the \nsort of surveillance state where opposition is oppressed and the people \nare watched, where political opponents could be arrested, jailed or \nexiled.\n  The Russian government is starting to look more and more every day, \nin its attitude, like the former Soviet Union--and in its behavior. I \nthink we have the right to be concerned about it.\n  When I come to the floor and talk about these issues, and other \ncolleagues do, this is not because we want confrontation. On the \ncontrary. We hope to avoid all of these things.\n  We have plenty of issues to focus on in this country, but we cannot \nbe naive. We must never forget the lessons of history that teach us \nthat when behavior such as this and attitudes like this go unaddressed, \nwhen your potential adversary shows weakness, insecurity, and \nindecisiveness, it invites them to be even more aggressive, and it \ninvites them to miscalculate.\n  While I do believe that the Olympics are an issue that should not be \npoliticized, our relationship with Russia is one that deserves serious \nattention in this body. This idea that somehow this is a relic of Cold \nWar issues and that we shouldn't be focused on it in the same way is \nnaive.\n  They still have an enormous nuclear arsenal. They still have a \nsignificant conventional military capability, and they have someone \nrunning their government who is not an ally or a friend of the United \nStates.\n  On the contrary. He has come to believe that what is bad for the \nUnited States is good for Russia. We should not be naive about that in \nour dealings, and we should not, under any circumstances, betray, \nundermine or abandon our commitment to our allies in the region and to \nthe countries that are Russia's neighbors for the sake of seeking to \nimprove the relationship with the Russian government because they will \ncontinue to do what they have already done. They will take our \nconcessions, and they will keep doing whatever they want.\n  I hope that as a part of this week and the next couple of weeks in \nthese Olympics we--as policymakers, with all of the issues happening in \nour country, and all of the challenges we face around the world--will \ntake more time to truly examine the nature of this government in Russia \nand what our relationship should be toward them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                     Ensuring Economic Opportunity\n\n  Mr. COONS. I come to the floor once again to talk about manufacturing \njobs and their importance for rebuilding the American middle class, \ntheir importance for our economy, and their importance for our future.\n  Last week President Obama delivered his State of the Union Address \nbefore a joint session of this Congress, and he talked about what we \ncan and should do together to invest in America's workers, to spur job \ncreation, and to expand economic opportunity. He said:\n\n       What I believe unites the people of this nation . . . is \n     the simple, profound belief in opportunity for all--the \n     notion that if you work hard and take responsibility, you can \n     and should get ahead. . . . Opportunity is who we are. And \n     the defining project of our generation is to restore that \n     trust.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. At a basic level, one thing we need to do is \nto put up a floor under the struggling workers in America who are \ncontinuing to seek work and to come together to extend emergency \nunemployment insurance for these long-term job seekers.\n  While jobs remain, sadly, more scarce than they should be in our \neconomy and as we continue in recovery, we can't let Americans fall \nthrough the cracks as they continue to seek work.\n  But since the extended unemployment insurance benefits expired last \nDecember, 1.7 million Americans, including more than 4,000 Delawareans, \nhave lost the unemployment insurance that is critical to their \nfamilies, to keeping food on the table and a roof over their heads.\n  Emergency unemployment insurance, which this body once again today \nfailed to extend, is a critical lifeline to Americans out of work \nthrough no fault of their own and who are doing everything they can to \nget back to work. While they are searching for jobs, we should make \nsure they can put food on their tables and keep their families sound.\n  One Delawarean I have heard from who relies on this lifeline is \nRaymond from Newark. Raymond was laid off last April from his job at \nthe EVRAZ steel mill in Claymont. He is not sitting at home based on \nthese unemployment benefits. He is not showing dependency, as some have \nsuggested here. He has averaged more than 30 job applications each and \nevery week. He has four children depending on him--one in college with \ntuition payments.\n  He wrote to me saying: ``My job search is more than finding a job; it \nis searching to make an honest living.''\n  Raymond, to you, and to the more than the 1 million Americans who \nrely on decent work to give meaning to their lives, to give support to \ntheir families, and to give purpose and opportunity to their children \nand their future, we can and should do more--not only by extending the \nunemployment insurance, not only by increasing the minimum wage, but by \nbuilding the middle class of this country to work together.\n  Folks such as Raymond have worked hard and paid their taxes. They \nhave earned the opportunity when they really need it to get \nunemployment insurance. That is why they paid into it for so many \nyears. But we need to do more beyond just extending unemployment \ninsurance.\n  We need to invest in Raymond's future. We need to invest in the \nskills that will help Americans like him transition from his job in a \nsteel mill to a plant that is open and has a job that needs to be \nfilled.\n  Throughout our history broad-based job growth and job creation have \nensured economic opportunity that was there for millions of millions of \nAmericans across several generations. Anyone who was able and willing \nto work in this country for a long time was able to find a decent job \nand a ladder into the middle class. By investing in our Nation's \nworkforce, our people, through public education, through the GI bill, \nand through access to higher education, we have been a country where \nanyone who was willing to work could make it if they combined their \nwork ethic and talents with the skills they needed.\n  During World War II, in the postwar boom, manufacturing was an \neconomic backbone. Our country was the pathway to the middle class that \nmade all of this possible. American manufacturing was the sturdy \nmanifestation of that central American idea that if you work hard and \nplay by the rules, you can provide for your family today so your \nchildren can get access to higher education, a brighter future, and you \ncan have a secure retirement tomorrow. That is the essence of the \nAmerican middle class.\n\n[[Page S809]]\n\n  The basic opportunity that manufacturing provided--those strong and \nstable rungs by which Americans could pull themselves up the ladder of \nopportunity--was the heart of America's economic engine, it was the \nglue that held communities together, but over the past few decades it \nhas changed dramatically. As the world has changed, as billions of \ncompetitors have entered global markets, from China to India to Russia, \nso has the nature of manufacturing, as technology has advanced and the \nplaying field on which we compete globally has changed fundamentally. \nThe critical impact of low wages abroad and of trade deals that were \nnot effectively enforced has been well documented. But too often people \ndraw the wrong conclusion about the future of manufacturing based on \nits recent past. I have heard many arguing that manufacturing is no \nlonger an industry, a sector where America can compete because this \nglobal playing field is tilted and there will always be workers in some \ncountry who will work for less, and so we are relegated to inevitably \nlose what is left of our manufacturing in a race to the bottom. The \nsuggestion has been made in some sectors that we should thrive with \nservice and high-skilled research and development and financial \nservices but not manufacturing. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth.\n  In my view, only if we continue to be a country where we invent \nthings, grow things, and make things will we continue to be a leading \neconomy where there is real opportunity for all Americans. Why? Because \nmanufacturing jobs are high-quality jobs both for those who work in \nthem, who get higher wages and higher benefits, but also for the local \neconomy, where manufacturing jobs provide more of a compounding benefit \nthan any other sector.\n  Some suggest we just can't compete because our labor standards, our \nenvironmental protections, and our wages are too high. But look to \nGermany and Europe, and you can see this isn't true. They have higher \nlabor standards and higher environmental protections than we do, and \nyet more than double the percentage of their economy, the percentage of \ntheir GDP is manufacturing because their government, their education \nsector, and their private sector work in close harmony to do what we \nneed to do.\n  Since manufacturers invest the most in private sector R, where \nthere is manufacturing, there is also a wealth of high-skilled research \nwork. That is one of the other benefits of manufacturing. Tech \ndevelopment works the best when research centers are close to where \nproducts are made. Over the long term it is hard to have one without \nthe other. So as our manufacturing base has moved offshore, we have \nbeen at risk of losing our research base. But just in the last few \nyears there has been a dynamic that is encouraging of jobs coming back \nto this country. As our productivity continues to grow, as our energy \ncosts go down, and as that wage gap closes, we have actually been \nregaining ground in manufacturing.\n  I am convinced that if we want to rebuild an economy that is dynamic \nand that grows, one that provides opportunities to the middle class, \nmanufacturing must be at the center--in fact, must be the foundation.\n  What is true is that because the global economy has shifted so \ndramatically, we need to shift our strategy and our approach. The \nmanufacturing that America excels at today is more advanced and \nrequires higher skilled workers than ever before. Rather than repeating \nthe same tasks over and over, workers today in manufacturing have to be \nable to carry out complex and varying tasks; to be able to see what is \nnot going right and fix it as a collaborative team; to understand the \nmanufacturing process and to innovate continuously. They have to have \ncritical thinking and problem-solving skills. The sorts of things \nworkers weren't expected to do 30 years ago are a minimum requirement \ntoday. They need to understand manufacturing, and they need to be able \nto program and to improve the caliber and productivity of the machines \nthat do most of the repetitive simple labor of manufacturing today.\n  We can train Americans for these jobs, but our schools and our \ninstitutions of higher learning, our community colleges and \nuniversities have to be tightly integrated into a skill-training system \nthat is demand-driven rather than giving people training and praying \nthat somehow they will find their way to an appropriate employer.\n  That is why I was so encouraged when President Obama placed such an \nemphasis on workplace skills training and manufacturing in his State of \nthe Union speech. By modernizing our education system and building real \nand enduring partnerships between schools and businesses, we can ensure \nour workers have the skills that employers actually need today and \ntomorrow; so when a guy like Raymond from a steel mill in Claymont is \nlaid off, he can have the opportunity to improve his skills, to retool \nhis abilities, and to move right into an open and available \nmanufacturing job. A recent study showed there were more than 600,000 \nmanufacturing jobs--high-skilled, high-wage, high-benefit jobs--in \nAmerica today unfilled because of this skills gap.\n  While I understand and even appreciate President Obama's commitment \nto making some progress in the coming year through Executive orders, he \nshould not give up on working with Congress. It is just February. It is \ntoo early in this year for us to give up on the possibility of passing \nbipartisan legislation together.\n  I think more than ever, because of the message it sends domestically \nand internationally, we have to find a way to work together to make \nprogress on the critical issue of manufacturing skills and to do what \nwe can together to grow our economy and rebuild our middle class. That \nis why I have been working so hard with my colleagues on the \nManufacturing Jobs for America campaign here in the Senate. \nManufacturing Jobs for America is a campaign to build support for good \nmanufacturing legislation on which Democrats and Republicans can agree. \nSo far we have had 26 Democratic Senators introduce 32 bills. Almost \nhalf of them have Republican cosponsors already, and we are seeking \nmore each and every week.\n  Our bills focus on four areas that, if we were to enact them, could \nhave a real and substantial impact on manufacturing and opportunity in \nour country: strengthening America's modern workforce skills, as I have \nspoken to; fighting for a more level global playing field and opening \nexport markets to America's manufacturers of all sizes. Medium and \nsmall businesses have been growing their exports, but we could grow so \nmuch more, and that would sustain the growth in manufacturing; third, \nmaking it easier for manufacturers to access capital and invest in the \nR I spoke to a moment ago; and fourth, ensuring a coordinated \ngovernment-wide effort in support of a national manufacturing strategy. \nAll of our competitors have them. We alone don't, and we need a \nnational manufacturing strategy to make sure that skills, access to \nexports, and access to capital all happen.\n  Madam President, adapting our economy to the realities of a new era \nis a challenge we have struggled with for more than a generation. Yet \nfiguring out how to realize an economy where growth is both strong and \nmore equitable--one that is dynamic and creative and globally \ncompetitive and also has a broad middle class, provides security for \nworking families, and leaves no one behind; an economy that invests in \nthe dreams and aspirations of our children--building that economy is \nthe central challenge we face. Manufacturing can and should be the \nfoundation of that economy.\n  If we want America to be as strong in the 21st century as it was in \nthe 20th, we need American manufacturing. Let's work together and get \nthis done.\n  I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for their \npartnership, their interest, and their work. I so much look forward to \nworking together in the weeks ahead to prove to the American people \nthat we can make bipartisan progress on manufacturing.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, it was fascinating to watch the \nheadlines change over the course of the day after the CBO report on the \nstatus of the implementation of health care was released. At first, the \nheadlines flashed that the CBO report said the health care reform law \nwas going to cost 2\\1/2\\\n\n[[Page S810]]\n\nmillion jobs, and Republicans ran to the cable networks to trumpet that \nnumber. In fact, many mainstream newspapers actually ran initial \nheadlines suggesting the same. But then, as people actually started to \nread the CBO report, they discovered the truth. They discovered the \nfact that the CBO report actually says the economy is going to grow \nbecause of the health care law. And to the extent there are reductions \nin the hours people work, it is going to be because individuals are now \nno longer required to work simply because they need to get health care. \nThey can now make decisions about what they want to do with their life, \nthe kind of work they want to do and the amount of time they want to \ndevote to it, not simply because they are job-locked due to health care \ninsecurity.\n  So I wanted to come to the floor today, as some of my colleagues \nhave, to set the record straight on what the implementation of the \nhealth care law really means for the economy and to specifically focus \non this issue of what it means to individuals who for decades have been \nforced to make decisions about their labor connected only to the kind \nof job that would provide for health care for them and their families.\n  I think back to a day not long after we passed the bill, a day that I \nwas taking my little then-2-year-old son to our community pool in \nCheshire, CT. I was in the pool splashing around with my son, and a guy \nnot more than a few years older than I came across the pool and tapped \nme on the shoulder.\n  He said: I am really sorry to interrupt, but I just wanted to say \nthank you.\n  I said: That is nice. ``Thank you'' for what?\n  He said: I wanted to say thank you for passing the health care reform \nlaw because I have a little son too, and he has a congenital heart \ndefect. We spend a lot of money trying to take care of his illness. \nFirst, the health care bill is going to save us a lot of money, but \nthat is not really why I am so thankful for what you did. What I am \ntruly thankful for is the fact that I can rest easily at night now \nknowing that my son's life and that his career won't be dictated by his \nillness; that my son can now live out his dreams, do whatever he wants \nto do with his life rather than spending his life searching for a job \nthat will cover his illness and worrying about whether a small gap in \nemployment will forever take him off the rolls of the insured forever.\n  That has been the reality in our country for too long. If you had a \nchronic illness or a genetic illness or a condition that was on the \nlist of preexisting illnesses at America's insurance companies, A, you \nhad a hard time finding a job because a lot of people didn't want to \nhire somebody who came with those high insurance costs, and then once \nyou found the job, you could never leave because you couldn't risk \nlosing the insurance that was paying your bills.\n  The health care reform law unlocks economic possibilities for \nmillions of people all across this country who haven't gone out and \nstarted that business they knew could grow, they knew could result in \ndozens of employees being hired, because they couldn't leave their \nexisting job and the insurance it provided for them and for their \nfamilies.\n  That is what the CBO report says. The CBO report says that to the \nextent there are going to be less hours worked, it is because \nindividuals will no longer be tied to their jobs because of their need \nto get health care benefits. That is the real story of the CBO report. \nIn fact, the CBO report says this: Expanded Federal subsidies for \nhealth insurance will stimulate demand for goods and services, and that \neffect will mostly occur over the next few years. That increase in \ndemand will induce some employers to hire more workers or to increase \ntheir employees' hours during that period.\n  That is economic growth. That is not economic contraction.\n  Now, this is a really simple chart. I am not going to claim that the \nnumbers in it are a reflection simply of the legislation we passed. But \nfor all my Republican colleagues who rushed down to either the floor or \nto the cable news networks to decry the CBO report and who in general \nhave continued to make the case that the health care law is hurting the \neconomy, this is about as simple a chart as you need.\n  In the decades before we passed the Affordable Care Act this economy \nlost 3.8 million jobs, and in the 45 months since we passed the \nAffordable Care Act this economy has created 8.1 million jobs.\n  Nobody is satisfied with the pace of job growth, but nobody can say \nthe passage of the Affordable Care Act has hurt jobs. Anecdotally, \nanybody can bring one or two stories to the floor suggesting an \nindividual businessperson decided to not hire someone because of the \nAffordable Care Act. But the CBO report also says this: In CBO's \njudgment, there is no compelling evidence that part-time employment has \nincreased as a result of the ACA. That is a specific talking point that \nopponent of the ACA after opponent of the ACA brings out into the \npublic debate, that what is going to happen is that because there is a \nrequirement to provide insurance for full-time employees and not part-\ntime employees, we are going to see millions of full-time jobs \neliminated and put into part-time employment. CBO says, in CBO's \njudgment, there is no compelling evidence that part-time employment has \nincreased as a result of the ACA. They say the effect of the Affordable \nCare Act will increase demand and induce some employers to hire more \nworkers or to increase their employees' hours during that period.\n  But the news is even better because we are also getting definitive \nresults on the amount of money we are spending as taxpayers when it \ncomes to our health care budget.\n  Here is a simple chart that tells us what the current law projection \nwas with respect to health care spending in this country. This builds \nout the trendline all the way to 2085. I will concede it is probably \nnot worthwhile to necessarily predict what health care expenditures \nwill be in 2085, but we don't even have to go there to see that pretty \nquickly the actual average of annual growth rate of health care is \ngoing to come in way lower than what the current law projection is. In \nfact, it is going to come in at such a lower rate because of the \npassage of the Affordable Care Act, we are going to be saving on \naverage $250 billion a year. Not wholly because of the health care law \nbut in large part because of the implementation of the health care law, \nwe are going to be saving $250 billion a year just in Medicare spending \nbecause we are starting to build a health care system which focuses on \nprevention--every Medicare participant now gets free wellness visits--\nand a system which rewards outcomes rather than volume, which rewards \nquality health care rather than just lots of health care.\n  So it is time that we start talking about the true economic impact of \nthe Affordable Care Act. For all of the political and rhetorical \nbluster, CBO tells us that the economy will grow because of the act and \nthat full-time employment will not turn into part-time employment.\n  To the extent there are less hours worked in this country, as the CBO \nreport clearly says, it is because individuals are finally going to be \nempowered to make decisions for themselves about what the proper work \nschedule for them and their family is, not based on whether they can \nget health care.\n  I will share one story that illustrates the decisions being made out \nthere right now today when it comes to the economic benefit that can \naccrue from the Affordable Care Act.\n  A small business owner in Enfield, CT, just wrote this:\n\n       I am a small business owner in Enfield who struggled for \n     the last 26 years with finding affordable, quality health \n     insurance coverage. For the last three years, I've been \n     paying our current carrier . . . $1,552.00 a month to cover \n     myself and my 17-year-old son. My son was injured in the fall \n     while playing high school football and required surgery on \n     his shoulder. My deductible for the surgery was $3,000.\n       Paying for health insurance and medical bills has been a \n     constant struggle. That's why I decided a week ago to check \n     out Access Health CT to see if I could get help going \n     forward. After I entered my information on the website, I \n     discovered that my son and I could stay with [that same \n     carrier] with a better package including eye exams and \n     glasses coverage for only $328 a month and a $500 deductible. \n     I signed up the same day. My new insurance starts March 1st.\n       This is far better than I ever thought it would be. I was \n     worried that health insurance would put me out of business \n     after all those years, but now I feel I can keep my business \n     going. I may even hire a new employee. I want to say thank \n     you to everyone\n\n[[Page S811]]\n\n     from the state to the federal level that has made Access \n     Health CT a reality. Don't believe the rumors--check it out \n     yourself. I am so glad I did.\n\n  Don't believe the quick snap headlines that get written when a \ncomplicated economic report comes out, as it did yesterday, because if \nwe read beyond the headlines, we will find that the economic evidence--\nthe budget evidence is saying over and over that the Affordable Care \nAct is going to create jobs; that the Affordable Care Act is creating \njobs; that the Affordable Care Act will save taxpayers billions of \ndollars; that the Affordable Care Act is saving taxpayers billions of \ndollars.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Luger Nomination\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I rise again today to urge a vote in \nthe Senate to confirm Andrew Luger to be Minnesota's U.S. attorney.\n  For 2\\1/2\\ years--or 890 days--Minnesota has not had a full-time U.S. \nattorney. During those years, from August 2011 to August 2013, Todd \nJones was responsible for doing two jobs--as the Minnesota U.S. \nattorney and then also as Acting Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Over the summer, the Senate confirmed \nTodd Jones as Director of the ATF, leaving the Minnesota U.S. \nattorney's position open.\n  Even before the confirmation of Todd Jones this summer, Senator \nFranken and I--upon the recommendation of our bipartisan U.S. attorney \nadvisory committee--had already recommended Andrew Luger, a respected \nlitigator and former assistant U.S. attorney, to fill the position. \nThis was 199 days ago. In November President Obama nominated Andrew \nLuger to become the new U.S. attorney, and the Judiciary Committee \napproved his nomination unanimously on January 9.\n  It is time we do what is right by quickly confirming Andrew Luger to \nmake sure Minnesota has its highest law enforcement officer in place.\n  I also note that there is an opening in the Iowa U.S. Attorney's \nOffice. The Judiciary Committee also unanimously approved the \nPresident's nomination for that position, and that person is also \nawaiting confirmation. In fact, I learned today he is in one city and \nhis family is in another city in Iowa, and they would like to be \nunited. That nomination is also pending.\n  I thank Senator Grassley, who has supported our nominee, as I have \nsupported his in Iowa. I think Senator Grassley is also aware of some \nof the issues with the Minnesota U.S. Attorney's Office due to the fact \nthat we have not had a full-time attorney for 888 days. He has been \nsupportive of our efforts to quickly move Mr. Luger's nomination.\n  The position of U.S. attorney is a law enforcement post that the \nFounders regarded as so vital that they created it during the very \nfirst Congress in the Judiciary Act of 1789. This is the same act which \ncreated the Attorney General and the structure of the Supreme Court and \nlower courts.\n  According to the act, each judicial district would be provided with \n``a person learned in the law to act as attorney for the United States \n. . . whose duty it shall be to prosecute in each district all \ndelinquents for crimes and offenses cognizable under the authority of \nthe United States, and all civil actions in which the United States \nshall be concerned.''\n  The U.S. attorney is a position so necessary that President Zachary \nTaylor appointed Henry Moss--a name somewhat lost in history--to the \npost within 2 days of Minnesota becoming a State. Now Minnesota has \nbeen waiting for a full-time U.S. attorney for 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  I know my colleagues understand the importance of their own U.S. \nattorneys. Some of my esteemed colleagues have a very deep \nunderstanding of the position, having served as U.S. attorneys prior to \njoining the Senate. Senator Sessions was appointed by President Reagan \nand served as U.S. attorney in Alabama for 12 years. Senator Whitehouse \nwas U.S. attorney for Rhode Island, appointed by President Bill \nClinton. And Senator Blumenthal was appointed to be U.S. attorney for \nConnecticut by President Carter.\n  Other colleagues have been assistant U.S. attorneys, and my guess is \nthat when they were assistant U.S. attorneys, they had a full-time U.S. \nattorney in their office. Assistant U.S. attorneys included in the \nSenate are Senator Lee of Utah and Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico. \nThey know firsthand how crucial it is for these offices to have a U.S. \nattorney and other top leadership in place. I think they would agree \nwith me that 890 days without a full time U.S. attorney in Minnesota is \nfar too long.\n  Since 1849 the District of Minnesota's 31 U.S. attorneys have upheld \nthe rule of law, the Constitution, and the rights of our State's \ncitizens, and tirelessly pursued justice on their behalf.\n  Over the past 48 years, for the past half century, more than half of \nthe U.S. attorneys for Minnesota, appointed by Republican and Democrats \nalike, were confirmed within a day of when they passed out of the \nJudiciary Committee. One-fourth were confirmed the very same day. \nDuring this timeframe, they were confirmed within an average of 28 days \nof being passed out of committee.\n  It has now been 28 days since Mr. Luger was approved by the Judiciary \nCommittee. Compare that to Thomas Heffelfinger, who was nominated by \nPresident George W. Bush to be U.S. attorney for Minnesota on September \n4, 2001; he was confirmed on September 13. His entire confirmation \nprocess took only 11 days. Mr. Luger was nominated 77 days ago; that is \nseven times longer. In 1998 the Senate confirmed Todd Jones within 2 \nweeks of his nomination by President Clinton.\n  The Senate has a history of filling this important position quickly. \nNominees have not been used as pawns in some kind of a disagreement \nover issues. They have simply been confirmed. We have simply gotten it \ndone.\n  The quick action by President Taylor and the speed with which the \nSenate has confirmed the past U.S. attorneys for Minnesota show how \nmuch our government has historically valued this position, how much we \nhave wanted to keep politics out of the way of this position.\n  The over 100 employees who work for the U.S. attorney in Minnesota \ndon't run as Democrats or Republicans. We don't even know what their \npolitical parties are. They deserve a boss in their office to take this \nposition, which has been historically filled almost immediately after \nit gets through the Judiciary Committee. They deserve a boss in their \noffice.\n  With each day that passes we are doing an injustice not only to the \nFounding Fathers who emphasized the position's importance and the \nPresidents who have acted quickly to fill it but also to the more than \n100 people who work in that office.\n  The men and women in the Minnesota U.S. Attorneys Office exemplify \nthe professionalism, high ethical standards, and unwavering commitment \nto the rule of law and public safety that we expect of prosecutors. \nThey work to protect the public safety by focusing on offenders who \nharm our community--terrorists, the worst of the worst, violent \ncriminals, drug traffickers, and major financial fraudsters.\n  They also work closely with local law enforcement to ensure that \nlocal and Federal resources are used efficiently and effectively to \nprevent crime and lock up criminals. For example, the office recently \nwon a conviction in a $3.65 billion Ponzi case--the second biggest \nPonzi scheme in U.S. history. The biggest was the Madoff case. The \nsecond came out of the District of Minnesota, $3.65 billion. Of course, \nthat case was initiated when we had a full-time U.S. attorney. That \ncase was prosecuted mainly when we had a full-time U.S. attorney.\n  What else does the office have? It has an ongoing terrorist \ninvestigation that has led to charges against 18 people for aiding the \nterrorist organization al-Shabaab. If you asked anyone over at the \nFBI--including the FBI Director who was recently quoted in a story in \nthe Los Angeles Times about the importance of this investigation--they \nwould tell you it would be pretty nice to have a full-time U.S. \nattorney in that office. Eight of the people who\n\n[[Page S812]]\n\nhave already been charged have been convicted. Some received sentences \nup to 20 years in prison.\n  Other major work from the office includes Operation Highlife, a major \ndrug trafficking investigation involving more than 100 local, State, \nand Federal law enforcement officers, resulting in 26 indictments, 25 \nguilty pleas, and sentences up to 200 months in prison.\n  I would note that right now we are experiencing--as they are in many \nplaces around the country--a heroin epidemic in Minnesota. Over 50 \npeople in Hennepin County died last year from heroin overdoses. That is \nwhat we are talking about.\n  We have a heroin epidemic, and then we have to go home and tell the \npeople of our State that the Senate has not yet confirmed a U.S. \nattorney.\n  He went through the committee unanimously--not one objection. The \ncommittee he was voted out of includes a very diverse group of \nSenators, including Senator Cruz, Senator Grassley, Senator Cornyn, and \nSenator Whitehouse.\n  I recommended Andrew Luger to the President, and he was nominated. He \nhas the support of our Republican Congressmen near the Twin Cities. \nAndrew Luger went through that committee without objection and deserves \nto be voted on by this Senate.\n  Operation Brother's Keeper is another example of a successful \ninvestigation and prosecution of a RICO case involving a regional 200-\nmember gang which took 22 dangerous criminals off the street.\n  Operation Malverde received national attention and had a prosecution \nof 27 defendants associated with the Mexican drug cartel--including the \napprehension of the cartel's regional leader--with sentences as high as \n20 years in prison.\n  The office also recently prosecuted a case involving a major \nsynthetic drug seller in Duluth, MN. This head shop was a huge problem \nand a scourge in the community. They went after it, prosecuted the \nowner, and found $700,000 in plastic bags hidden in his bathroom, and \nthey won that case.\n  These are just a few of the major cases this office has worked on \nover the last few years. It has been 890 days since we had a full-time \nboss, which was due, in part, to the delay in filling the position of \nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. It took nearly \n1 year for this body to act on that nomination because this body had \nnot confirmed anyone for that full-time job for 7 years.\n  After Operation Fast and Furious, and the disaster with that case, it \nwas finally decided that we need a full-time, confirmed Director at the \nATF. Our U.S. attorney agreed to work at both jobs for 2 years and was \nfinally confirmed. We finally have a nominee, and that person is now \nwaiting. That is how we get to 890 days without a full-time boss.\n  The Senate has always served the people of Minnesota well in making \nsure that our State has a U.S. attorney. I think we need to continue \nthat tradition and honor the value our Founding Fathers entrusted in \nthis position.\n  It is time we vote on Mr. Luger's nomination. He is a dedicated \npublic servant whose breadth of experience and strength of character \nand commitment to justice makes him a well-qualified candidate.\n  No one has questioned or shed any doubt on his qualifications; that \nis not the issue. Oftentimes that is an issue with nominees, but that \nis not the issue in this case. The issue is that we simply--as we have \nin the past--allowed a voice vote on these nominations. It has taken an \naverage of 8 days after coming out of the committee for the District of \nMinnesota. The first U.S. attorney for Minnesota took 2 days. We have \nnow waited 890 days.\n  It is time to get this done.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner).\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FRANK CHEATHAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \naccomplished educator from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Dr. Frank \nCheatham is the senior vice president for academic affairs and \nprofessor of math and computer science at Campbellsville University. \nHis impending retirement in December will conclude a career of over 40 \nyears devoted to Christian higher education. Campbellsville University \nis an acclaimed university in central Kentucky with more than 3,600 \nstudents that prepares them as Christian servant leaders for life-long \nlearning, continued scholarship, and active participation in a diverse, \nglobal society.\n  No more than 20 miles of country road separates Frank's birthplace of \nMerrimac, KY, from the campus on which he has spent the majority of his \nlife as both a student and a professor. Dr. Cheatham was born on \nFebruary 3, 1943, to Gladys and the late Jeff Cheatham. Of his eight \nsiblings, four went on to become teachers, including his brother, Don, \nwho also teaches at Campbellsville.\n  Dr. Cheatham wields an impressive arsenal of post-secondary degrees. \nAfter completing his undergraduate studies at Campbellsville in 1965, \nhe continued to earn a master of science from Tennessee Technological \nUniversity, his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Kentucky, \nand a second master of science in computer science education from the \nUniversity of Evansville.\n  Dr. Cheatham began his career teaching math and biology at Taylor \nCounty High School in 1965. He then served as a teaching assistant at \nTennessee Tech and the University of Kentucky and as an assistant \nprofessor at Campbell College in North Carolina before landing at \nCampbellsville University in August of 1973. Ever since then, save for \na single year of leave during which he taught at Western Kentucky \nUniversity, Dr. Cheatham has taught math and computer science at \nCampbellsville. In 1999, he was offered and accepted the position of \nsenior vice president for academic affairs. The university's president, \nDr. Michael V. Carter, recalls that it was ``the very first decision I \nmade after becoming president.''\n  Dr. Cheatham's excellence as an educator needs no validation aside \nfrom the many successes and accomplishments of his students. \nNevertheless, he has been honored for his service at Campbellsville \nUniversity time and\n\n[[Page S813]]\n\ntime again. He has twice been named Campbellsville/Taylor County \nChamber of Commerce Educator of the Year, in 1992 and 2000. He was \nawarded the Sears-Roebuck Foundation Teaching Excellence and Campus \nLeadership Award in 1989 and the Campbellsville University Student \nGovernment Association Challenger Award a year later. In 1996, he \nreceived the Board of Advisors Academic Excellence Distinguished \nProfessor award, and in 2002, he became a Campbellsville University \nDistinguished Alumnus.\n  Despite his tireless devotion to teaching, Dr. Cheatham has also \nfound time to pursue his passions outside the classroom. Among his many \nextra-curricular pursuits, he led the discussion on bringing the \ninternet to Campbellsville University in 1994, and served as president \nfor the Consortium for Computing in Small Colleges.

Mr. President, after more than a year of debate, \nnegotiation and compromise, the farm bill has finally been approved. \nThis legislation is a win for the family farmers and rural economy that \nis at the heart of Upstate New York. While the final product does not \ninclude everything that we fought for, the farm bill's passage was of \nthe utmost importance to New York. It maintains or grows scores of \nprograms for our dairies, fruit and vegetable farmers, maple syrup \nproducers, rural development projects and iconic New York companies \nlike Hickey Freeman in Rochester, NY.\n  The farm bill is unique in that it touches the lives of all Americans \nby ensuring the health of our nation's food supply. It does that by \nsupporting our hard working farmers. The bill supports innovative \nagricultural research that helps make our farms some of the most \nproductive on the planet. I am proud that this will include the Acer \nAccess and Development Program or Maple Tap Act, which will provide \ngrants to promote maple tapping and research across New York. This bill \nmakes common sense reforms like eliminating direct payments and \nexpanding opportunities for crop insurance and even linking crop \ninsurance with conservation compliance. This bill does this all while \nproviding a safety net for our farms that often face unpredictable \nnatural disasters.\n  However, this bill is more than just an agriculture bill; it is the \nbedrock of our food and agriculture policy for the next 5 years. The \nFarm Bill will drive our rural economy into the 21st Century by making \ninvestments not only in our farms, but in water, broadband, and energy \ninfrastructure. This bill provides opportunities to grow small business \nin rural communities, such as helping a rural entrepreneur turn \ngrandma's award winning jam into a commercial product ready to be sold \non store shelves across the great state of New York and across the \ncountry. This farm bill pulls our rural and urban communities ever \ncloser, as it expands opportunities for farmers markets and food hubs \nto communities that for so long have lacked access to local fresh food.\n  Another very important provision in this bill that I would like to \nhighlight is extension of the Wool Trust Fund. For more than a decade \nwe have had in place this successful program to protect the workers at \nAmerican manufacturers of men's suits from an unfair trade anomaly. \nWhile we allow finished suits to be imported into this country duty-\nfree from many countries, we impose a 25% duty on the fabrics that our \ndomestic suit manufacturers must import. This anomaly has acted as a \nhuge tax on companies that wanted to stay and manufacture here in the \nUnited States. Therefore, more than a decade ago, we enacted the Wool \nTrust Fund program to provide both duty refunds and licenses to import \nlimited quantities of suiting fabrics at reduced duties. The \ncombination of these steps helped to level the playing field and keep \nmanufacturing jobs from moving abroad.\n  The Farm Bill will extend and modify this program. For example, it \nwill consolidate the duty refunds and duty reductions with the \nintention of maintaining the same amount of benefits for the same \nmanufacturers as would have been achieved under the current program. \nWhile the program has been modified it continues its central purpose--\nproviding a mechanism to reduce the tariff burden of companies that \nstay in the United States to manufacture apparel without harming the \ndomestic textile industry.\n  I am proud to say that one company that benefits from this program \ntoday, and that will continue benefiting, is Hickey Freeman and its 410 \nemployees in Rochester, New York. I am proud to be a customer of this \niconic brand. I am also proud to have stood up for these workers by \nhelping establish this program more than a decade ago and extending it \nthrough the years. I am certain that the provisions of this bill will \nbe implemented as intended so that Hickey Freeman and its employees--\nalong with many other companies in New York and across the country--\nwill continue to benefit fully from this program in the same way that \nit has benefited for more than a decade.\n  From suit manufacturing in Rochester to maple taps in the \nAdirondacks, from dairies in the Central part of my state, to apple, \npear, cherry and berry growers in the Hudson valley, from the wineries \nat end of Long Island to those near Niagara Falls, the industries that \nbring life to our rural communities will be better because we passed \nthis Farm Bill. Their crops will grow fuller and stronger, and so will \nour economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/06/senate-section/article/S813-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S813-S814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AGRICULTURAL ACT OF 2014\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Farm bill policies touch the lives of all Americans, \nnot just those who work in the agricultural sector. In addition to \nreauthorizing farm programs, this legislation deals with domestic and \ninternational food aid, conservation and the environment, trade, rural \ndevelopment, renewable energy, forestry, and financial markets, among \nother issues. This year's reauthorization presented an opportunity to \nenact significant reforms in these areas. While some progress was made, \nI believe the bill falls short of its potential, and ultimately I could \nnot support it.\n  The farm bill takes an important step toward reform by ending the \nlongstanding practice of giving direct payments to farmers of certain \ncommodity crops regardless of whether they experienced losses or even \nplanted a crop. It also tightens limits on the amount of farm payments \nan individual can receive, expands crop insurance opportunities for \nspecialty and organic crops, establishes conservation compliance as a \nrequirement for receiving premium insurance subsidies, and invests in \nrural broadband.\n  In spite of these successes, however, the farm bill does not do \nenough for Rhode Island families.\n  Of greatest concern to me, it cuts $8.6 billion over 10 years from \nthe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, also known as food \nstamps. These cuts could reduce food stamp benefits for as many as \n850,000 households across the country, including tens of thousands in \nRhode Island. SNAP is our Nation's most important antihunger program. \nIn this challenging economic climate, it is wrong to cut critical food-\nassistance funding.\n  In addition, this farm bill, like its predecessors, fails to provide \nadequate support for our fishermen in Rhode Island and nationwide. Farm \nbill programs provide billions of dollars in subsidies and technical \nassistance to farmers every year. In comparison, fishermen have little \naccess to similar kinds of Federal assistance. Despite attempts to \ncorrect this inequity, fishermen remain second-class citizens when it \ncomes to Federal support.\n  Finally, American agriculture springs from the richness of our land\n\n[[Page S814]]\n\nand natural resources, and the farm bill has long supported programs to \nconserve and protect those resources. As the harmful effects of climate \nchange become more prevalent, our agricultural policy should reflect \nthe threat posed to farming and food production by these changes. In \nthis farm bill, ``climate change'' and ``extreme weather'' are hardly \nmentioned. Congress can start by opening the Regional Conservation \nPartnership Program to climate change adaptation and mitigation \nprojects.\n  The farm bill is important and wide-ranging legislation. \nUnfortunately, the conference report leaves out essential protections \nfor low-income Americans, hard-hit fisheries, and precious natural \nresources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/06/senate-section/article/S814-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE USS FORRESTAL\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today marks the last voyage of the Ex-USS \nForrestal, the world's first supercarrier. On this occasion, I believe \nit is fitting to recognize the ship and all who sailed on her in \nservice to a grateful nation. Launched almost 60 years ago in Newport \nNews, VA, she was named after former Navy Secretary and first Secretary \nof Defense James Forrestal.\n  Forrestal represented American ingenuity and shipbuilding excellence, \nintegrating operational needs, and engineering insight that created the \nfirst steam catapult, angled flight deck, and use of optical landing \nsystems.\n  During her 38 years of active service, Forrestal and its attached air \nwings were involved in missions around the globe. At the beginning of \nher sea life, she was sent to the eastern Mediterranean during the Suez \nand Lebanon Crises and over the course of her service life was involved \nin dozens of NATO operations, overseas deployments, patrol missions, \nand strategic port visits around the Atlantic and Sixth Fleets. She was \n``home'' to thousands of the Nation's finest sailors and aviators this \ncountry has ever known.\n  Forrestal's contributions to the war effort in Vietnam are well \ndocumented. Unfortunately, so is the terrible fire that engulfed the \nflight deck on July 29, 1967, killing 134 shipmates, injuring 161 more, \nand destroying more than 20 aircraft. I will never forget when that \nZuni rocket hit my A-4 Skyhawk after it was accidentally fired from \nacross the flight deck, rupturing the fuel tank and setting that \nhorrific, costly fire.\n  I will always remember and honor my brave comrades who died in the \nForrestal fire. Although the ship is being towed to Brownsville, TX, to \nbe physically dismembered, her legacy, the bonds forged, and memories \ncreated among shipmates will live forever. I bid her a final ``fair \nwinds and following seas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/06/senate-section/article/S814-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S814-S815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HIGHER EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, earlier this week I spoke to the \nNational Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of my remarks be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n\n     NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES\n\n       A few weeks ago, the National Conference of State \n     Legislators gave me an award--for defending the 10th \n     Amendment. It's the first time in ten years they were able to \n     give that award. There hasn't been much protection of the \n     10th Amendment going on in Washington. As grateful as I am \n     for both awards, the award that I am working even harder to \n     earn is one for deregulating and simplifying the federal role \n     in higher education.\n       If I were to earn that, it would be the first time in \n     American history that honor had been bestowed. Truth is, for \n     a long time it wasn't needed.\n       The federal government didn't begin to focus on colleges \n     and universities--almost all of them private at the time--\n     until 1862 when President Lincoln signed the Morrill Act. \n     That Act provided each state with 30,000 acres of federal \n     land for each member in their congressional delegation. \n     States were then required to sell the land and use the \n     proceeds to fund public colleges that focused on agriculture, \n     engineering, and military science. States were expected to \n     contribute to the maintenance of its land-grant institution \n     as well as to provide its buildings. But Congress was \n     otherwise sparse on advice for how to establish these \n     institutions and there was little federal intervention.\n       The federal government didn't focus much more on higher \n     education again until 1944, when Congress passed the G.I. \n     Bill. This included federal financial assistance to help any \n     veteran who served at least 90 days between December 1941 and \n     1946 pay for college or vocational training programs at the \n     public or private institution of their choice. This even \n     included high schools. The big news here was not just the new \n     federal money, but the way it was spent. Instead of \n     establishing a Washington program for colleges serving the \n     needs of veterans, the federal money followed veterans to the \n     college of their choice.\n       Not all of the independent private colleges thought this \n     was such a good idea. The president of the University of \n     Chicago said the G.I. Bill would turn universities into an \n     ``educational hobo jungle.''\n       The only limitation on choice of institution for those \n     using the G.I. Bill was that it had to be approved by the \n     appropriate state educational agency or by the Administrator \n     of the Veterans Administration.\n       So you see, the dreaded ``voucher,'' which raises the \n     hackles of the K-12 establishment, was the very foundation of \n     federal funding for colleges and universities for seventy \n     years.\n       Last week I introduced a bill to give federal money to \n     elementary and secondary students in the same way we do with \n     the G.I. Bill, Pell Grants and student loans--let the money \n     follow students to the schools they choose. If you just take \n     41 percent of the federal dollars we are already spending on \n     K-12 education, you can turn that into $2,100 scholarships \n     for 21 million low-income children.\n       But as you can imagine, these Pell Grants for Kids created \n     an uproar from the K-12 establishment. My response was, if \n     vouchers helped created the best system of colleges in the \n     world, why don't we try it for our schools?\n       But back to the history of federal involvement in higher \n     education.\n       After the G.I. Bill, the number of Americans enrolled in \n     college more than doubled in just six years between 1943 and \n     1949.\n       Then came the Korean G.I. Bill in 1952.\n       And this brought more federal regulation. The Korean G.I. \n     Bill specified that institutions of higher education needed \n     to be accredited by a federally recognized accreditor in \n     order for a veteran student to use their benefits.\n       Still it was not much regulation. Only a single page of \n     paper.\n       By the way, in 1952, roughly 35 percent of students were \n     graduating from high school and only 6 percent were \n     completing college.\n       Now move ahead to Sputnik in the late 1950s. Congress \n     passed the National Defense Education Act that created the \n     first federal loan program in order for students to attend \n     college. Between 1952 and 1965, college enrollment increased \n     from more than 2.1 million to nearly 6 million (almost 30 \n     percent of the 18-24-year-old population).\n       Still, after 100 years of federal involvement, there were \n     not many rules and regulations.\n       This brings us to 1965 and the passage of the Higher \n     Education Act.\n       Now here is the problem. Congress has reauthorized the \n     Higher Education Act eight times since 1965. With each \n     reauthorization came many well-intentioned good ideas and \n     another stack of additional regulations. The laws and \n     regulations have piled so high since 1965 that I voted \n     against the 2008 reauthorization because the stack of \n     regulations was as tall as I was then and I believed that a \n     new bill would eventually double that stack.\n       Here is a concrete example of unnecessary complication in \n     the higher education system: the application for federal aid.\n       It is a ten-page document that asks more than 100 questions \n     and is accompanied by a 72-page instruction booklet.\n       This is considered a victory in Washington. I know that \n     when I came here 11 years ago, I was determined to simplify \n     this application\n\n[[Page S815]]\n\n     form. So were many other senators. And this is the result.\n       Despite well-meaning intentions over the years, our system \n     has become too complicated and burdensome. It wastes time and \n     dollars that ought to be spent helping students.\n       So today, I am here to ask for your help. I want to reverse \n     this trend of piling on layer after layer.\n       To begin with, I have asked my staff to consider drafting a \n     new Higher Education Act from scratch. Start all over. \n     Include everything that needs to be included and consider new \n     regulations that need to be written. This is not an \n     ideological exercise. It is an effort to clean out the \n     clutter. Call it a long-delayed spring cleaning.\n       The Senate education committee has begun to hold hearings \n     on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\n       Chairman Harkin and I have worked closely together on these \n     hearings and the chairman has been very thoughtful in how we \n     are approaching them.\n       At a recent financial aid hearing, here is what the \n     witnesses told us and they all told us the same thing:\n\n       o The application for a Pell Grant could be reduced to a \n     post-card by collecting only income and family size\n       o The federal aid system should consist of one grant, one \n     loan, and one tax credit\n       o Students should know how much the federal government will \n     invest in them in their junior year of high school\n       o We can use social media to reach those in middle school \n     about potential aid opportunities\n\n       We were told that these four big ideas would:\n\n       o Save money\n       o Reduce regulation\n       o Increase access for low-income, disadvantaged students\n\n       To take these ideas and others and put them into law, I \n     have created a Task Force on Government Regulation of Higher \n     Education.\n       I am joined in this by Senator Mikulski, Senator Burr, and \n     Senator Bennet; Brit Kirwan of the University of Maryland \n     System and Nick Zeppos of Vanderbilt University have agreed \n     to co-chair this task force. And 14 other college presidents, \n     university system heads, and other leaders representing all \n     sectors in higher education will work with the American \n     Council on Education to:\n\n       o Identify duplicative or unnecessary regulations\n       o Determine the cost of complying with federal regulation\n       o And offer suggestions for improving the current structure \n     of regulating.\n\n       Other members of NAICU serving on this panel include:\n\n       o Hartwick College (which has done tremendous work in this \n     area already)\n       o Tennessee Independent Colleges and Universities \n     Association\n       o Colorado Christian University\n       o American University\n       o Hiram College.\n\n       In addition, Congress has provided $1 million to the \n     National Research Council to conduct a study on \n     overregulation of higher education funding for which I have \n     fought since the last reauthorization of the Higher Education \n     Act in 2008.\n       So we have a bipartisan group of senators and a task force \n     which has its first meeting next week and a National Research \n     Council $1 million study to help us doour job.\n       But we need one more thing: your help.\n       Ronald Reagan once said that the eight most dangerous words \n     were: ``I'm from Washington and I'm here to help.''\n       Well, I'm from Tennessee. So, while I may be here in \n     Washington, I am here instead to ask for YOUR help.\n       The task force needs to hear specific examples of rules and \n     regulations that are no longer needed, overly burdensome, \n     costly, and confusing.\n       I would suggest that you do it in the easiest, most \n     specific and practical way. Start with the easiest thing that \n     will make the most difference and save the most money and \n     time that would be better spent on students, and make that \n     first. And the next one, second. In every case, make it as \n     specific as possible. You're the experts. You know what's \n     happening at your institutions.\n       Send your specific recommendations to this organization \n     (NAICU), my staff, and directly to Chancellor Zeppos.\n       But I would also like to recommend that you share these \n     with your home state senators and representatives.\n       Now sometimes I've said that you don't need to come to \n     Washington, and sometimes I get in trouble for saying that, \n     but it's true. In fact, it's better if you see them at home. \n     Think about it. Here they've all flown to Washington, they \n     think the plane flight somehow made them smarter, they're \n     away from their grounding, and they're busy. They have lots \n     to do here.\n       Now, you all have flown up here and spent a lot of money to \n     get here, and you're doing the right thing--that's a good \n     thing, it's helpful, it's appreciated, it's important.\n       But let me tell you something that's more important. Take \n     ten people from your congressional district and ask to see \n     your congressman or congresswoman at his or her district \n     office. Or go see your senator in his state office. You'll \n     have more to say, it will cost you a lot less to travel, \n     they'll have more time to hear you, and it will make a much \n     bigger difference.\n       Visit them at home!\n       Tell them that you are forwarding a list of duplicative, \n     unnecessary rules and regulations affecting higher education \n     that you have identified for elimination.\n       Explain to them the importance on institutional autonomy, \n     the accreditation process and the marketplace that produces \n     competition allowing students to choose schools and why this \n     has helped to create the best system of higher education in \n     the world.\n       They will have questions, and they are entitled to have \n     questions. Last year Congress appropriated $33 billion in \n     taxpayer dollars for Pell Grants, more than $100 billion in \n     loans and $38 billion for university-sponsored research.\n       We'll need allies to make progress, and if you tell your \n     elected representatives what you are doing and exactly how to \n     deregulate higher education, I bet they will listen.\n       Let me give you an example of why this is worth your time, \n     the story behind the America COMPETES legislation.\n       In 2005, I was sitting at a Senate Budget Committee hearing \n     and I was worried about how all the Medicaid and Medicare \n     spending was going to squeeze out investments in education. \n     So, that afternoon, I walked over to the National Academy of \n     Sciences and said, ``I believe if you'll tell Congress 10 \n     things in priority order that Congress would need to do in \n     order to help make us more competitive in the world, I \n     believe Congress would do it.''\n       The Academy created a very good group led by Norm Augustine \n     of Lockheed Martin and produced a report called ``Rising \n     Above the Gathering Storm.'' It had 20 specific suggestions \n     in priority order--Congress enacted about 2/3 of them, and \n     within 4 to 5 years, funded most of them.\n       In other words, the point I'm trying to get across here is \n     that most ideas in Washington fail for lack of the specific \n     idea.\n       You'll be surprised that the more specific you are, the \n     more likely things are to get done.\n       Now, I am among the converted.\n       I believe we have the best system of colleges and \n     universities in the world.\n       Despite that, you will hear me urging you to focus on \n     worker training, to stop this business of shutting down such \n     valuable assets during the summer, and to confront disturbing \n     political correctness.\n       In the history of the world, universities have changed less \n     than any other institution. But in the Internet age, they \n     will need to change more. You need to learn from the same \n     lesson that applied to the American automobile companies in \n     the 1960s and 1970s which nearly led to their demise.\n       So my mission today is to deregulate and simplify the \n     federal role in higher education. To do this, I need your \n     help. First, to suggest concrete examples of overregulation. \n     Second, to remind your elected representatives of the \n     importance of autonomy and the marketplace that has created \n     the best higher education system in the world.\n       And if all of that effort earns the award for deregulation \n     and simplification of higher education, I will gladly share \n     it with each of you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/06/senate-section/article/S815-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S815-S816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING JEANNE HULIT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Ms. Hulit is returning to the private sector \nafter more than 4 years of service to her country at SBA. She stepped \nup last year when former Administrator Karen Mills stepped down, \nstaying on for longer than anticipated to ensure that the government \nagency responsible for helping America's nearly 28 million small \nbusinesses had the leadership it needed. We should thank her for \nhonoring her commitment to America's entrepreneurs.\n  Prior to assuming the role of Acting Administrator, Ms. Hulit served \nas Associate Administrator for SBA's Office of Capital Access since \nFebruary 2012, where she was responsible for advising SBA Administrator \nKaren Mills and overseeing the agency's loan programs. During her \ntenure at SBA, the agency saw its two highest years of small business \nlending on record.\n  Ms. Hulit's service at SBA began in 2009 when she was appointed to \nserve as SBA's New England Regional Administrator. As Regional \nAdministrator, she was responsible for carrying out SBA's core mission \nof assisting small businesses with the ``three C's''--capital, \ncontracting and counseling--in six New England States.\n  Prior to joining SBA, Ms. Hulit spent 18 years in banking, serving as \nsenior vice president for commercial lending at Citizens Bank, vice \npresident and middle market lender at KeyBank, and manager of KeyBank's \nInternational Banking Division. Prior to that, she served as deputy \ndirector of the International Division at the Maine Department of \nEconomic and Community Development. Ms. Hulit has also held a number of \ncivic and economic leadership roles, including her tenure as a founder \nand chair of the Maine International Trade Center and her service as \nchair for the University of Southern Maine Board of Visitors.\n  Ms. Hulit's experience in both the public and private sector and her \nexpertise in lending gave her unique insight into the importance of \ngetting capital into the hands of entrepreneurs. This came across \nclearly in her success at SBA. During her time at SBA, the agency \nsupported more than $126 billion in lending to more than 260,000 small \nbusinesses and entrepreneurs. This includes two record years of \ndelivering more than $30 billion annually in loans in fiscal year 2011 \nand fiscal year 2012 and more than $29 billion in 2013.\n  Later this month, Ms. Hulit will be moving back home to Maine and \ntaking a job at Northeast Bank. While it is tough to see the SBA lose \nsuch a talented and loyal public servant and America's small businesses \nlose a tireless advocate, I am happy to see her get to return home to \npursue this great opportunity. I wish her all the best in this and \nfuture endeavors, and I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking her \nfor her loyal and dedicated service at SBA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/06/senate-section/article/S816-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S816-S817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING MAINE VETERANS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the men and women \nwho have defended America with their service and to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues some of the many outstanding ways in which \ncitizens of Maine are honoring those who served and, in some cases, \ngave their lives for our country.\n  U.S. Marine Corps Maj. David Cote, a Maine native, recently \nestablished the Summit Project, a living tribute to remember and \nmemorialize each Maine servicemember who has been killed in the line of \nduty since September 11, 2001.\n  As part of this living memorial, Major Cote has traveled across Maine \nto visit with the families of the fallen. He has asked each family to \nsearch for a stone to represent their loved one who gave his or her \nlife so we could live in peace. From backyards and fishing holes to \nnational forests and lakeside camps, these stones have been hand-picked \nfrom across Maine to represent each fallen hero.\n  Beginning this Memorial Day and annually thereafter, Major Cote will \nlead commemorative tribute hikes, in which volunteers will each carry a \nstone in honor of a specific fallen servicemember. During these hiking \nexpeditions, the memories of the fallen, recounted by widows, mothers, \nfathers, and friends, will be shared with the hikers embarking on their \njourney to the summit of mountains in Maine. The Summit Project was \nlaunched to help the families who have suffered such painful losses \ntruly heal, and to ensure that the experiences of these heroes inspire \na new generation of patriots. It will honor the heroism and patriotism \nof those who gave all for our country since 9/11 and will ensure that \ntheir stories and sacrifices are added to Maine's proud history of duty \nto country.\n  In another unique effort, which started 23 years ago in Maine and \nwhich has now spread to include the entire United States and beyond, \nthousands of volunteers each year have the opportunity to recognize the \nultimate sacrifice made by our brave servicemembers by participating in \nWreaths Across America. This annual effort, which provides holiday \nwreaths to mark the graves of fallen servicemembers, was begun by \nMorrill and Karen Worcester of Harrington, ME.\n  On December 14, 2013, approximately one dozen tractor-trailer trucks \nladen with 143,000 ``remembrance wreaths,'' all proudly made in Maine, \nwere escorted to Arlington National Cemetery by the Maine State Police \nand Patriot Guard Riders. Numerous volunteers spent the morning placing \nthe wreaths on the headstones of deceased veterans and reflecting on \ntheir courage, selflessness, and sacrifice. All told, Wreaths Across \nAmerica shipped more than 470,000 wreaths to adorn veterans' graves in \nall 50 States and around the world.\n  The mission of Wreaths Across America is to ``Remember, Honor, \nTeach.'' In addition to honoring America's fallen, the group seeks to \npromote awareness of the sacrifices made by servicemembers through \nvarious veterans' events and wreath laying ceremonies at State Houses \nand the U.S. Capitol. These solemn ceremonies allow us the opportunity \nto pause and remember the many men and women who have died to preserve \nour freedoms, and they encourage us to instruct younger generations so \nthat those sacrifices are never forgotten.\n  For those veterans who have returned home from war, our Nation must \nensure that we facilitate their transition to life as civilians. In \nmany cases, these veterans have suffered severe injuries and need \nfurther assistance. The third effort I highlight today focuses on one \nveteran's effort to encourage other veterans.\n  U.S. Army SSG Travis Mills was on his third tour of duty in \nAfghanistan when he was critically injured by an improvised explosive \ndevice while on patrol. As a result, Travis lost portions of both legs \nand both arms. He is one of just five quadruple-amputees from the wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan to survive their injuries.\n  While Travis recovered at Walter Reed Medical Center, he dreamed of \nproviding a camp in Maine as a recreation center for disabled veterans \nand their families--an affordable place which would provide much-needed \nquality time for families to spend together. Through the assistance of \nDean Lachance, executive director of the Bread of Life Ministries, \nTravis was connected with Joel and Crista Lavenson, co-owners of \nKennebec Camp's Maine Golf & Tennis Academy. Together, they transformed \ntheir vision into a reality, creating the National Veterans Family \nCenter, where wounded veterans and their families can enjoy much needed \nrest and relaxation while participating in outdoor activities that \ninclude fishing, boating, and archery.\n  We must never forget the sacrifices that have been made by all \ngenerations of veterans, as well as those who still serve. I am proud \nthat Maine has a long history of great patriots who have died in the \nservice of their country. Low on ammunition and men, Joshua Chamberlain \ncourageously led the charge at Little Round Top at the Battle of \nGettysburg. MSG Gary Gordon demonstrated great bravery during the \nBattle of Mogadishu in 1992, which led to his receiving the Medal of \nHonor. The brave Americans who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our \nfreedom are no longer with us, but through efforts like The Summit \nProject, Wreaths Across America, and the National Veterans Family \nCenter, we can honor their sacrifice and ensure that their legacies \nlive on.\n\n[[Page S817]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/06/senate-section/article/S817-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             2014 OLYMPIANS\n\n  Mr. SANDERS.

Mr. President, today I wish to remember the life \nof a dear friend of mine, and Montana's, Art Ortenberg.\n  Art grew up in Newark, NJ, the son of a Russian upholsterer father \nand a Polish seamstress mother. As a boy, Art lived across the street \nfrom a public library, where he spent countless hours devouring its \nofferings. The local library was a second home to Art. It gave him the \nchance to expand his horizons and dream of opportunities and lives that \nhe had never before imagined.\n  Art, with his wife of almost 50 years, Liz Claiborne, built a Fortune \n500 fashion empire--the first to be headed by a woman. Art was utterly \ndevoted to Liz. They were deeply in love and they were inseparable. \nTogether, they made high fashion affordable and revolutionized the \nfashion industry. While Art and Liz may be known for their exploits in \nthe fashion world, Montanans know, and love, them for their unassuming \ngenerosity and deep sense of community.\n  Art and Liz first came to Montana seeking a respite from the rigors \nof the business world in Montana's wide-open spaces. Once there, they \nmade Montana their home.\n  Art and Liz loved Montana as deeply as any Montanan. And, as John \nSteinbeck famously recognized, it's difficult to analyze love when you \nare in it. To Art, the slow, switchbacking country highway on the way \nto his Triple 8 Ranch was ``a glorious, intoxicating drive,'' the road \n``traversing [the] landscape in serpentine coils.''\n  I don't think anyone has so lovingly described Route 279's slow crawl \nover the Continental Divide, and it shows the depth of Art's affection \nfor Montana.\n  But Art's deep love for Montana didn't stop at mere admiration for \nour outdoors--it spawned action. Indeed, Art and Liz were \nphilanthropists in the true sense of the word: They loved the people \nand communities of Montana. They adopted Montana as their home, and \nthey gave generously of their time, their energy, and their resources.\n  Art and Liz wanted to open doors for young Montanans in the way that \nthe local library did for Art. Together, they started preschools and \nmusic programs in small mountain towns, saved local libraries from \nclosure, and loaned money to a local timber mill so that it could make \ndownpayments on new equipment. They encouraged our young people to take \npride in their hometowns through the Montana Heritage Project, \nfostering a sense of community in a generation of students.\n  Art and Liz recognized the importance of providing our young people \nwith an opportunity to dream and grow, just like that Newark library \nhad done for Art.\n  Art and Liz also cared deeply about conservation, funding projects to \nrestore the Blackfoot River, reintroduce endangered species, and \nconserve valuable habitat and public lands. They recognized that \nMontana's public lands are our greatest assets and the importance of \npreserving our outdoor heritage for future generations.\n  As Art once said, ``What we do here matters.'' He knew that few are \nas fortunate as he and Liz had been. Art and Liz gave to Montana's \ncommunities generously and quietly. They sought to leave the world a \nbetter place than they found it, and they pursued this goal without \npretension. In fact, Art and Liz could often be found down at the \nWindbag Saloon in Helena, quietly eating cheeseburgers in an old \nfrontier brothel.\n  Liz is buried at the Triple 8 Ranch in Montana, in an unmarked \ngravesite in a ``Liz Red'' urn. Art planned to be buried next to her, \nreturning to rest in the State where they both gave so much to so many. \nI know he will be missed.\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and \nlegacy of Arthur ``Art'' Ortenberg, an apparel manufacturer and \nconservationist, who passed away yesterday in New York City.\n  Art and his late wife, designer Liz Claiborne, founded Liz Claiborne \nin 1976. After incredible early success, the company went public and \nsoon appeared on the Fortune 500 list of America's biggest industrial \nfirms.\n  Fourteen years after the creation of Liz Claiborne, Art and Liz \nretired from day-to-day management of their fashion company and chose \nto start a foundation dedicated to conservation. The Liz Claiborne and \nArt Ortenberg Foundation supports projects in the United States, \nEurope, and Central and South America, but their main focus is on \nAfrica. To this day, the foundation continues to support efforts to \nsave the jaguar, the tiger, and the African elephant.\n  Art also had a particular passion for the American West, spending \nmuch of his time over the past 25 years on his ranch in Condon, MT. Art \nand Liz provided assistance to the Seeley Lake Elementary School, \nhelped Pyramid Lumber in Seeley Lake convert to a more efficient mill \noperation, and supported public radio, Humanities Montana, the Canyon \nCreek Fire Department, the Helena Public Library, and the Montana \nWildlife Federation.\n  As we bid farewell to Art, we recognize that he was a true pioneer \nfor the fashion industry and a leader in the conservation community.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with Art's partner, Cathy Horyn; his son, \nNeil; daughter, Nancy; stepson, Alexander Schultz; and all of his \nfamily and many friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/06/senate-section/article/S818-3", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S818-S819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JEFF NELSON\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \ncongratulate Jeff Nelson on his well-earned retirement after nearly 40 \nyears of service at East River Electric Cooperative in Madison, SD, \nincluding 23 years as General Manager.\n  Jeff's wealth of knowledge and friendly demeanor have helped him \ndevelop close relationships with his colleagues and with community \nleaders\n\n[[Page S819]]\n\nthroughout our State. He has been a tireless advocate for the \npopulation served by East River, and deeply engaged in discussions of \nenergy and economic development policy for decades. As he has worked \nwith me and my staff over the years, his input has always been \nappreciated and valued. He leaves behind an undeniable legacy of \nthoughtful and progressive leadership.\n  Jeff's work has left a mark on many facets of energy policy. Under \nhis tenure as General Manager, East River has received national \nrecognition, being named the 2013 Wind Energy Cooperative of the Year \nby the Energy Department. He undertook the daunting task of \nestablishing a load-management system, the largest in the world at the \ntime of its implementation. He also looked out for the unique interests \nof rural South Dakota in discussions of hydropower access and in \nhelping the ethanol industry gain a foothold.\n  It is also important to note the vital economic development work Jeff \nhas been involved in through the Rural Electric Economic Development, \nREED, Fund. The REED Fund has been crucial for the establishment or \nexpansion of many South Dakota businesses and his work in this area has \nfacilitated an improved rural economy.\n  He has been active in public service in his personal time, as well, \nusing his expertise to make continued contributions to his community \nand our state. This service includes serving as Chair of the National \nRural Electric Cooperative Association's Power and Water Resources \nCommittee and Board President of the South Dakota Wind Energy \nAssociation, among other commitments.\n  Beyond his commendable career, I also take this opportunity to thank \nJeff, and his wife Trudi for their years of friendship to me and \nBarbara. It was also a pleasure having Jeff and Trudi's son, Erik, \nserve as a valuable member of my staff for many years.\n  Though he will be missed at East River, I know that Jeff will \ncontinue to be engaged in policymaking and service projects. Once \nagain, I am pleased to recognize Jeff for his many years of service to \nthe people of South Dakota and applaud him for his exemplary \ncareer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/06/senate-section/article/S819-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR FOREIGN STUDY\n\n Mr. MURPHY.

In 2014, AIFS \nwill be celebrating its 50th year of providing unique cultural and \neducational opportunities to young people around the globe through its \nmission--``we bring the world together''.

A bill to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to \nrequire the consent of parties to contracts for the use of arbitration \nto resolve controversies arising under the contracts and subject to \nprovisions of such Act and to preserve the rights of servicemembers to \nbring class actions under such Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, our Nation has a strong tradition of \nensuring that our service members are protected while they serve To \nkeep us safe. As the challenges facing our service members change, we \nmust work to ensure that our laws continue to keep pace. In this \nregard, I have worked with my colleagues over the years to strengthen \nthe protections for service members and their families under the \nServicemember Civil Relief Act, SCRA.\n  One such effort, the Servicemember Housing Protection Act, which I \nauthored and was recently reported out of the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, would enhance protections relating to the housing needs of \nour service members. I am pleased that these provisions have also been \nincluded in legislation the Senate will hopefully soon take up, Senator \nSanders's Comprehensive Veterans Health and Benefits and Military \nRetirement Pay Restoration Act, which I have cosponsored. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this critical legislation.\n  Today, I am joining Senator Graham in introducing on a bipartisan \nbasis legislation to further enhance SCRA protections. The SCRA Rights \nProtection Act seeks to protect service members from being forced to \naccept mandatory arbitration clauses as part of everyday transactions, \nsuch as those relating to mortgage origination, automobile leases, and \nstudent loans. Often service members sign contracts that include \narbitration clauses buried in the fine print, and this eliminates their \naccess to the courts, which can limit their ability to assert their \nrights and reach a fair resolution. In disputes involving SCRA rights, \nthis bill would make arbitration clauses unenforceable unless all \nparties consent to arbitration after the dispute arises, and would also \nensure that service members retain their right to join with other \nservice members to file a case together as a class.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting these improvements to \nthe SCRA that will better protect our military families while the men \nand women of our Armed Forces protect our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/06/senate-section/article/S823-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S823-S824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 345--STRONGLY SUPPORTING THE RESTORATION AND \n   PROTECTION OF STATE AUTHORITY AND FLEXIBILITY IN ESTABLISHING AND \n DEFINING CHALLENGING STUDENT ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND ASSESSMENTS, AND \n STRONGLY DENOUNCING THE PRESIDENT'S COERCION OF STATES INTO ADOPTING \n THE COMMON CORE STATE STANDARDS BY CONFERRING PREFERENCES IN FEDERAL \n                     GRANTS AND FLEXIBILITY WAIVERS\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Lee, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Scott, Mr. \nInhofe, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Wicker, and Mr. Enzi) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S.

``The \n     $4,350,000,000 Race to the Top program that we are unveiling \n     today is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the Federal \n     Government to create incentives for far-reaching improvement \n     in our Nation's schools.'';\n       Whereas, on July 24, 2009, Secretary Duncan also stated, \n     ``But I want to be clear that Race to the Top is also a \n     reform competition, one where States can increase or decrease \n     their odds of winning Federal support.'';\n       Whereas, under the Race to the Top program guidelines, \n     States seeking funds were pressed to implement 4 core, \n     interconnected reforms, and the first of these reforms was to \n     adopt ``internationally benchmarked standards and assessments \n     that prepare students for success in college and the \n     workplace'';\n       Whereas, on July 24, 2009, President Obama outlined the \n     connection between common education standards and Race to the \n     Top program funds, stating, ``I am issuing a challenge to our \n     [N]ation's governors and school boards, principals and \n     teachers, businesses and non-profits, parents and students: \n     if you set and enforce rigorous and challenging standards and \n     assessments; if you put outstanding teachers at the front of \n     the classroom; if you turn around failing schools--your State \n     can win a Race to the Top grant that will not only help \n     students outcompete workers around the world, but let them \n     fulfill their God-given potential.'';\n       Whereas the selection criteria designed by the Department \n     of Education for the Race to the Top program provided that \n     for a State to have any chance to compete for funding, it \n     must commit to adopting a ``common set of K-12 standards'';\n       Whereas Common Core State Standards establish a single set \n     of education standards for kindergarten through grade 12 in \n     English language arts and mathematics that States adopt;\n       Whereas Common Core State Standards were, during the \n     initial application period for the Race to the Top program, \n     and remain, as of the date of the adoption of this \n     resolution, the only common set of kindergarten through grade \n     12 standards in the United States;\n       Whereas, on July 24, 2009, Secretary Duncan stated, ``To \n     speed this process, the Race to the Top program is going to \n     set aside $350,000,000 to competitively fund the development \n     of rigorous, common State assessments.'';\n       Whereas, since the Race to the Top program's inception, \n     States have been incentivized by Federal money to adopt \n     common education standards;\n       Whereas States began adopting Common Core State Standards \n     in 2010;\n       Whereas States that adopted Common Core State Standards \n     before August 2, 2010, were awarded 40 additional points out \n     of 500 points for their Race to the Top program applications;\n       Whereas 45 States have adopted Common Core State Standards;\n       Whereas 31 States, of the 45 total, adopted Common Core \n     State Standards before August 2, 2010;\n\n[[Page S824]]\n\n       Whereas States that have adopted Common Core State \n     Standards are given preference in the application process for \n     the waivers issued under the authority of section 9401 of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     7861) that provide flexibility with respect to certain \n     requirements of such Act;\n       Whereas States that have adopted Common Core State \n     Standards are currently collaborating to develop common \n     assessments that will be aligned to the Common Core State \n     Standards and replace existing end-of-the-year State \n     assessments;\n       Whereas these assessments will be available in the 2014-\n     2015 school year;\n       Whereas 2 consortia of States are developing common \n     assessments: the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for \n     College and Careers (PARCC) and the Smarter Balanced \n     Assessment Consortium (SBAC);\n       Whereas national standards lead to national assessments and \n     national assessments lead to a national curriculum;\n       Whereas education standards help teachers ensure their \n     students have the skills and knowledge they need to be \n     successful by providing clear goals for student learning;\n       Whereas challenging academic standards are vital to \n     ensuring students are college and career ready;\n       Whereas blanket education standards should not be a \n     prerequisite for Federal funding;\n       Whereas States are incentivized to adopt Common Core State \n     Standards by the explicit correlation between the adoption of \n     the Common Core State Standards by the State and the \n     preference provided to such States through the Race to the \n     Top program and the flexibility waivers issued under the \n     authority of section 9401 of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7861);\n       Whereas the Secretary of Education has created a system of \n     grants and waivers that influence, incentivize, and coerce \n     State educational agencies, commissions, and boards into \n     implementing common elementary and secondary school standards \n     and assessments endorsed by the Secretary;\n       Whereas when Federal funds are linked to the adoption of \n     common education standards, the end result is increased \n     Federal control over education and a decreased ability of \n     schools to meet the individual needs of the students in their \n     schools;\n       Whereas the implementation of Common Core State Standards \n     will eventually impact home school and private school \n     students when institutions of higher education are pressured \n     to align their admission and readiness standards with \n     curricula based on the Common Core State Standards;\n       Whereas the 10th amendment of the Constitution of the \n     United States reads, ``The powers not delegated to the United \n     States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the \n     States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the \n     people''; and\n       Whereas, throughout the course of United States history, \n     States have maintained the responsibility of education based \n     on the 10th amendment because the explicit power of educating \n     children was not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) States and local educational agencies should maintain \n     the right and responsibility of determining educational \n     curricula, programs of instruction, and assessments for \n     elementary and secondary education;\n       (2) the Federal Government should not incentivize the \n     adoption of common education standards or the creation of a \n     national assessment to align with such standards; and\n       (3) no application process for any Federal grant funds, or \n     for waivers issued by the Secretary under the authority of \n     section 9401 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 (20 U.S.C. 7861), that occurs after the date of adoption \n     of this resolution should award any additional points, or \n     provide any preference, for the adoption of the Common Core \n     State Standards or any other national common education \n     standards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url":

Res. 348\n\n       Whereas May 19, 2013, marks the four-year anniversary of \n     the end of the 26-year conflict between the Liberation Tigers \n     of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Government of Sri Lanka;\n       Whereas the people of Sri Lanka suffered greatly as a \n     result of this conflict, the impact and aftermath of which \n     has been felt especially by women, children, and families;\n       Whereas the Government of Sri Lanka established a ``Lessons \n     Learnt and Reconciliation Commission'' (LLRC) to report \n     whether any person, group, or institution directly or \n     indirectly bears responsibility for incidents that occurred \n     between February 2002 and May 2009 and to recommend measures \n     to prevent the recurrence of such incidents in the future and \n     promote further national unity and reconciliation among all \n     communities;\n       Whereas the LLRC report was presented to the Sri Lankan \n     Parliament on December 16, 2011, and officially translated \n     into Sinhala and Tamil on August 16, 2012;\n       Whereas the LLRC report acknowledges important events and \n     grievances that have contributed to decades of political \n     violence and war in Sri Lanka and makes constructive \n     recommendations on a wide range of issues, including the need \n     to credibly investigate widespread allegations of \n     extrajudicial killings; enforced disappearances; intentional \n     targeting of civilians and noncombatants; demilitarizing the \n     north and the country as a whole; reaching a political \n     settlement with minority communities on the meaningful \n     decentralization of power; and promoting and protecting the \n     right to freedom of expression for all through the enactment \n     of a right to information law and additional rule of law \n     reforms;\n       Whereas the Government of Sri Lanka developed the National \n     Plan of Action to implement just 82 of the 285 \n     recommendations of the LLRC in August 2011, and although the \n     Government of Sri Lanka has made some progress on \n     rehabilitation, resettlement of displaced persons, and \n     improvements of infrastructure in the North and East, there \n     are still many issues of major concern;\n       Whereas the Government of Sri Lanka has yet to reasonably \n     address issues of reconciliation and accountability through \n     internal processes;\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2012 Human Rights Report \n     on Sri Lanka outlines ongoing concerns regarding \n     landownership and property restitution, particularly in the \n     Jaffna Peninsula, where large numbers of persons have not \n     received restitution for land that remains part of government \n     high security zones, and while citizens generally were able \n     to travel almost anywhere in the island, there continues to \n     be police and military checkpoints in the north, and defacto \n     high-security zones and other areas remained off limits to \n     citizens;\n       Whereas the Government of Sri Lanka has not taken tangible \n     steps toward demilitarization of civilian functions, \n     particularly in the North and East, and continued military \n     presence on private lands in the North is preventing the \n     resettlement of internally displaced persons who desire a \n     return to peaceful life;\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2012 Human Rights Report \n     on Sri Lanka also includes reports of serious human rights \n     violations such as unlawful killings by security forces and \n     government-allied paramilitary groups, often in predominantly \n     Tamil areas; torture and abuse of detainees by police and \n     security forces; and arbitrary arrest and detention by \n     authorities;\n       Whereas the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) \n     resolution supported by the United States and adopted by the \n     UNHRC on March 21, 2013, expresses concern at the continuing \n     reports of violations of human rights in Sri Lanka, including \n     enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, torture, and \n     violations of the rights to freedom of expression, \n     association, and peaceful assembly, as well as intimidation \n     of and reprisals against human rights defenders, members of \n     civil society and journalists, threats to judicial \n     independence and the rule of law, and discrimination on the \n     basis of religion or belief;\n       Whereas the Government of Sri Lanka expressed its \n     commitment to addressing the needs of all ethnic groups and \n     has recognized, in the past, the necessity of a political \n     settlement and reconciliation for a peaceful and just \n     society; and\n       Whereas tangible progress on domestic and international \n     investigations into reports of war crimes, crimes against \n     humanity, and other human rights violations during and after \n     the conflict and promoting reconciliation would facilitate \n     enhanced United States engagement and investment in Sri \n     Lanka: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the representatives of the United States on \n     their leadership on United Nations Human Rights Council \n     Resolution (UNHRC) 22/1, adopted by the UNHRC on March 21, \n     2013, which promotes reconciliation and accountability in Sri \n     Lanka;\n       (2) calls on the United States and the international \n     community to establish an independent international \n     accountability mechanism to evaluate reports of war crimes, \n     crimes against humanity, and other human rights violations \n     committed by both sides during and after the war in Sri \n     Lanka;\n       (3) urges the Government of Sri Lanka to allow unimpeded \n     access for media, international aid agencies, and human \n     rights groups into all regions of the country, as well as to \n     detention sites that may hold political and war prisoners;\n       (4) urges the Government of Sri Lanka to end its media \n     restrictions, including the obstacles to the flow of \n     information in the North and East, and bring to justice those \n     responsible for attacks on journalists and newspaper offices; \n     and\n       (5) calls upon the President to develop a comprehensive \n     policy towards Sri Lanka that reflects United States \n     interests, including respect for human rights, democracy and \n     the rule of law, economic interests, and security interests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/06/senate-section/article/S825-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 349--CELEBRATING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WALLA \n                WALLA VALLEY AMERICAN VITICULTURAL AREA\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL (for herself and Mrs. Murray) submitted the following \nresolution;

Res. 270\n\n       Whereas October 24th of each year is recognized \n     internationally as World Polio Day;\n       Whereas polio is a highly infectious disease that primarily \n     affects children and for which there is no known cure;\n       Whereas polio can leave survivors permanently disabled from \n     muscle paralysis of the limbs and occasionally leads to a \n     particularly difficult death through paralysis of respiratory \n     muscles;\n       Whereas polio was once one of the most dreaded diseases in \n     the United States, killing thousands of people annually in \n     the late 19th and early 20th centuries and leaving thousands \n     more with permanent disabilities, including the 32nd \n     President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt;\n       Whereas severe polio outbreaks in the 1940s and 1950s \n     caused panic in the United States, as parents kept children \n     indoors, public health officials quarantined infected \n     individuals, and the Federal Government restricted commerce \n     and travel;\n       Whereas 1952 was the peak of the polio epidemic in the \n     United States, with more than 57,000 people affected, 21,000 \n     of whom were paralyzed and 3,000 of whom died;\n       Whereas safe and effective polio vaccines, including the \n     inactivated polio vaccine (commonly known as ``IPV''), \n     developed in 1952 by Jonas Salk, and the oral polio vaccine \n     (commonly known as ``OPV''), developed in 1957 by Albert \n     Sabin, rendered polio preventable and contributed to the \n     rapid decline of the incidence of polio in the United States;\n       Whereas, although the United States has been free from \n     polio since 1979, this preventable disease still needlessly \n     lays victim to children and adults in several countries where \n     challenges, such as active conflict and lack of \n     infrastructure, impede access to vaccines;\n       Whereas the Federal Government is the leading public sector \n     donor to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative and provides \n     technical and operational leadership to this global effort \n     through the work of the Centers for Disease Control and the \n     United States Agency for International Development;\n       Whereas the eradication of polio is the highest priority of \n     Rotary International, a global association founded in 1905 in \n     Chicago, Illinois, that is now headquartered in Evanston, \n     Illinois, and has more than 1,200,000 members in more than \n     170 countries;\n       Whereas Rotary International and its members (commonly \n     known as ``Rotarians'') have contributed more than \n     $1,000,000,000 to, and volunteered countless hours in, the \n     global fight against polio;\n       Whereas Rotary International, the World Health \n     Organization, the United States Government, the United \n     Nations Children's Fund (commonly known as ``UNICEF''), the \n     Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the United Nations \n     Foundation have joined together with national governments to \n     successfully reduce cases of polio by more than 99 percent \n     since 1988, from more than 350,000 reported cases in 1988 to \n     223 reported cases in 2012;\n       Whereas polio was recently eliminated in India and is now \n     endemic only in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan;\n       Whereas terrorist and militant groups continue to target \n     and murder health care workers who seek to save the lives of \n     children;\n       Whereas the sanctity and neutrality of health care workers \n     must be respected, as these workers deliver the most basic of \n     life-saving interventions to children and communities;\n       Whereas the recent polio outbreak in the Horn of Africa, \n     comprising Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya, continues to result \n     in new cases of the disease, exacerbating the protracted \n     humanitarian crisis in the region and highlighting the urgent \n     need to finally eradicate polio before progress is lost;\n       Whereas countries around the world are placing an \n     unprecedented emphasis on polio eradication, including by \n     implementing Emergency Action Plans to boost vaccination \n     coverage in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan;\n       Whereas the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has \n     developed the Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan \n     2013-2018 (referred to in this preamble as the ``Endgame \n     Strategy'') to capitalize on the opportunity to eradicate all \n     polio disease;\n       Whereas the Endgame Strategy also outlines a legacy \n     planning process to ensure that lessons learned in the effort \n     to eradicate polio, as well as the assets and infrastructure \n     built in support of that effort, are transitioned to benefit \n     other development goals and global health priorities, \n     including the continued delivery of health services to the \n     most vulnerable children in the world;\n       Whereas the global effort to eradicate polio is the largest \n     internationally coordinated public health
