The extent is being estimated at this time--5 to 15 dead, a \ncouple hundred who were injured.\n  But I am troubled and feel so badly about those who were hurt. They \nwere working. They were sleeping. They were having dinner. I offer my \ncondolences to those who lost loved ones and those who have people who \nwere injured.\n  We will continue to follow the news from Texas as it develops today. \nI am going to do everything I can with my colleagues to ensure that \nthis terrible tragedy has the resources of the Federal Government \navailable to help the people of that city as they recover from this \ntragedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/18/senate-section/article/S2775-8", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2775-S2776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this Nation has simply dealt with too much--\ntoo much--loss during these last few months. Once again I offer my \ncondolences to the families who joined us here yesterday to honor the \nloved ones they lost to gun violence and to lobby for stronger \nbackground checks. The mothers and fathers of the murdered children \nfrom Newtown were here, family and friends of those who were injured \nand killed in Aurora, CO, were here. We had people here from the \ntragedy where 32, 33 people were killed in Blacksburg, VA, at Virginia \nTech. They were here yesterday.\n  We knew the effort to keep America's streets safe from gun violence \nwould not be easy. I commend Senator Manchin and others for setting \naside partisanship to negotiate this compromise. Unfortunately, even \nthough we got a strong, strong majority vote--well over 50--55 Senators \nvoted in favor of this. And Frank Lautenberg came. He had not been here \nfor a while. He has been ill. He voted. We voted with a strong majority \nto change things here in America so that people who have serious mental \nillness would have to have a background check before they can buy a gun \nor that criminals would have to have a background check before they can \nbuy a gun.\n  Even people who are selling the guns think there should be some \nbackground check. The man who sold the gun to the man who walked into \nthe courthouse in Las Vegas and blasted away--\n\n[[Page S2776]]\n\nthat man who sold that gun said he sold guns to lots of people who were \nbad people, but he did it legally. He thinks the law should be changed. \nSo the vast majority of the Senate agreed that should be the case. But \nwe could not get to 60, the magic number here in the Senate.\n  Yesterday the families of gun violence victims watched as Republicans \ndefeated a commonsense proposal to expand background checks that has \nthe support of 90 percent of Americans.\n  But make no mistake, the debate is not over. This is not the end of \nthe fight. Republicans are in an unsustainable position--crosswise with \n9 out of 10 Americans.\n  In an event we did out this backdoor yesterday, Senator Schumer \nsaid--I think he summed it up about as well as you could when he said: \nAmerica today on background checks is in about the same place America \nwas a few years ago dealing with immigration, gay marriage, and things \nrelated to gender equality.\n  I believe Senator Schumer is right. This is the beginning, and it has \nto happen. Anytime in America, on those rare occasions when 90 percent \nof the American people agree something should be done, it should be \ndone. And it will be done. It is only a question of time.\n  The brand of the Republicans is further tarnished by going against \nwhat 90 percent of the American people want. Democrats will continue to \nstand with the families from Newtown, Aurora, Tucson, Carson City, and \nI assure the 90 percent of Americans who support meaningful background \ncheck legislation that I personally will continue this fight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/18/senate-section/article/S2776-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate suffered a notable and stunning \ndefeat of bipartisanship this week during the debate over background \nchecks. They said a week ago we would never get on the bill, but the \nSenate joined together and we got on the bill. Then yesterday, as I \nhave indicated earlier, we got a significant majority of the Senate \nvoting to move forward on this background check. Ninety percent of the \nDemocrats, which is in keeping with the American people, and four \nvaliant Republicans joined to put us where we are today.\n  But the week did not bring only bad news from the legislative front. \nA bipartisan group of eight of my Senate colleagues--it would never \nhave happened a few years ago, but it is going to happen now. As I \nindicated, quoting Senator Schumer, background checks is about where \nimmigration was just a few years ago. A bipartisan group of my Senate \ncolleagues--four Democrats and four Republicans--from all different \npolitical persuasions introduced a comprehensive plan to reform our \nbroken immigration system. Senators Schumer, McCain, Durbin, Menendez, \nGraham, Bennet, Rubio, and Flake worked very hard on this legislation. \nAll one needs to do is look at the legislative pedigree of these eight \nSenators. They are all over the book--liberal, conservative, moderate. \nAnd that is the way it should be.\n  I commend each of them for setting partisanship aside--both Democrats \nand Republicans setting partisanship aside--on an issue that is \ncritical to our great Nation. The four Democrats did not get everything \nI wanted in that legislation they now have before the American people. \nThey did not give me, they did not give Democrats everything they \nwanted in these negotiations. But, as I have said on this floor \nnumerous times, that is what legislating is. It is the art of \ncompromise. It is not the art of getting everything you want.\n  I have been in this body a long time, and I have been very fortunate \nto put my name on things that have passed here, and I have helped guide \nthings through this Senate in the last many years. I have to on \noccasion swallow hard and say: Well, we are going to have to compromise \nhere to get this done.\n  That is what we need to do. People have been in a situation where \nthey have been unwilling to compromise. There are things that have \nhappened in the great history of this body that have come by \ncompromise. I have never ever gotten everything I wanted. Republicans \nin these negotiations dealing with immigration, I guarantee you, did \nnot get everything they wanted, just as Democrats did not.\n  But I am satisfied with this legislation. It continues to secure our \nborders, the northern and southern borders. It improves our \ndysfunctional legal immigration system. Our immigration system is \nbroken, and has been for quite some time, and needs to be fixed.\n  Another thing that is important, it requires 11 million people who \nare undocumented to pass a criminal background check, pay fines, start \non a path to citizenship, and, yes, learn English. It does not put them \nat the head of the line; it puts them at the back of the line. It takes \nabout 12 or 13 years to finally get up there. But at least the program \nis moving forward. I look forward to hearings on this measure that will \nbe led by Senator Leahy.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a minute to commend Chairman Leahy. He \nis the most senior Member of the Senate, he is the President pro \ntempore of the Senate, but he also has an important responsibility as \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  The reason we were able to get the legislation on the floor that we \nhave been working on this past few weeks is because of Senator Leahy, \nbecause he had his committee--even though, as I have just indicated, \nSenator Leahy did not agree with everything that came out of that \ncommittee of his; he comes from the State of Vermont which is much \ndifferent than other places people on that committee come from around \nthe country, but he brought it forward, and everything we voted on as \nthe base bill came out of that committee.\n  It is the same as is going to happen on immigration. Senators--these \neight--a significant number of them want to do hearings. They want to \nhave a markup. Other Senators said: Let's just move to the floor. Well, \nthere are a number of Senators who believe it should come out of the \ncommittee first, so that is what is going to happen. So I commend \nSenator Leahy for agreeing to do this.\n  He is going to have a hearing tomorrow and another one on Monday. He \nhas estimated a time for the markup. So I commend him for his \nleadership with Judiciary.\n  I repeat, I look forward to hearings on this measure before the \ncommittee, and to a thoughtful debate on the Senate floor.\n  We are going to have ample time to discuss and consider this \nlegislation. I am going to do what I can to get this bill across the \nfinish line, which I think we are going to do. I think we are going to \ndo it pretty soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/18/senate-section/article/S2776-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2776-S2777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MAIL SAFETY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we deal with a lot of controversial things. \nThat is the way it has always been here. We deal with controversial \nissues that elicit passionate responses, including the immigration \nproposal I just outlined and the antiviolence legislation I talked \nabout earlier. We try to deal with these issues thoughtfully and with \nrespect. Those who serve and work in the Senate do so out of a sense of \npatriotism and a love of country.\n  I disagree with a number of my Republican Senators. Jeff Sessions and \nI--I do not think we have ever voted on anything the same way, but I \nhave tremendous respect for him as a person. He does what he believes \nis right. His colleague from Alabama, Richard Shelby, is one of my dear \nfriends. He and I do not vote much alike, but our relationship is one \nof respect and admiration for each other. That is what we have to do in \nthis body.\n  I never question the patriotism or love of country of any Senator \nbecause if I did, I would be wrong. So it was deeply disturbing that an \nanonymous individual would attempt to send deadly poison to Senate \noffices as well as the White House. It appears that with the swift \naction of the Capitol Police and Federal law enforcement officials, the \nsuspect in these cowardly, anonymous attacks has been apprehended. I \nhope he will be brought to justice very soon.\n  We should all understand that incident does not appear in any way to \nbe related to the tragedy in Boston. Nevertheless, it is a reminder to \nthe Senate community and to all Americans to remain vigilant during \nthese unsettling\n\n[[Page S2777]]\n\ntimes. It is also a reminder that Senate offices should continue to \nfollow the mail policies that are in place for their safety in this \ninvestigation.\n  Fortunately, the system in place to protect the Senate community \nworked. Maybe people say: Well, it is not good enough. It is good. I \nremember what happened when we had anthrax with Senator Daschle and \nSenator Leahy in previous years. So the system that is in place to \nprotect the Senate community has worked. That is good. These suspicious \nletters were found and intercepted before they reached the Capitol.\n  I applaud the postal employees and law enforcement officials who \ndetected and neutralized this threat. I commend the Senate Sergeant at \nArms, Chief Gainer, and the Capitol Police for their diligent work to \nkeep the Senate community safe. I rest easier knowing the safety of \neveryone who works and visits the Capitol is their first priority. I \nknow that to be the case.\n  I apologize to my friend the Republican leader for talking longer \nthan I usually do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/18/senate-section/article/S2777-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        prayers For West, Texas\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it is perhaps an understatement to say \nthat it has been a difficult week for our country.\n  As Americans hold the city of Boston in their thoughts and prayers, I \ncome to the floor to ask for another prayer for the small town of West, \nTX, in McLennan County, which is very close to Waco, TX.\n  I just got off the phone talking to the county judge, Scott Felton, \nand he described for me the terrible tragedy that occurred last night \nand the ongoing efforts to recover from that tragedy.\n  Apparently a fire started at an ammonia facility that then caught \nsome tanks of anhydrous ammonia on fire and they literally exploded. \nAnd for those who aren't aware of the use of anhydrous ammonia, it is \nactually a source of nitrogen used in the cultivation of crops. You can \nimagine that at this time of year, springtime, when planting is \nstarting, there is a lot of use for this essential fertilizer.\n  The fire started at about 7:30 last night, and the volunteer fire \ndepartment/first responders were called. The problem was they showed up \nfor a fire but ultimately ended up being victims of the explosions that \nensued a short time thereafter when tanks of this anhydrous ammonia \nexploded. They don't yet know the number of fatalities.\n  I saw in press reports it could be between 5 and 15. Judge Felton \ntells me he fears it could be on the higher side of that number or even \nhigher; they just don't know. They are continuing to try to find the \nvictims and help those who need help.\n  We do know more than 100 people were wounded. An unknown number have \nlost their lives, as I said, but we do know that among the dead are a \nnumber of firefighters, volunteer firefighters, and other first \nresponders. As typical, and as we actually saw in Boston, during a time \nof crisis in tight-knit communities such as West and cities such as \nBoston, we see some acts of real heroism that are encouraging at a time \nwhen we could use a little encouragement. We are seeing the resilience \nof a tight-knit, self-sufficient community in the aftermath of this \nterrible tragedy.\n  Businesses have reportedly stayed open throughout the night and \nneighbors have opened their doors to help support the victims. As is so \noften the case, ordinary citizens ran toward danger as they offered \nassistance. One resident loaded his car with people and made three \nsuccessive trips to the hospital. This morning, as I was waking up and \nwatching the news, I saw one gentleman who said he made multiple trips \ninto the nursing home for nursing home residents who were not able to \nwalk out themselves, to bring them to safety.\n  As one police officer at the scene said, ``The people of West will \nnot let a person stand out in the rain.''\n  We, of course, grieve for those who lost their lives and we pray for \nthose who are injured and still missing. I ask all Americans to keep \nthe people of West, TX, in their thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                            Gun Legislation\n\n  Mr. President, on another note--and I say this more in sadness than \nin anger--I watched the President of the United States say it was a \npretty shameful day for Washington--on the national news. That was \nyesterday. I agree, but for different reasons than the President \nhimself articulated. When good and honest people have honest \ndifferences of opinion about what policies our country should pursue \nwhen it comes to the Second Amendment and gun rights and mass gun \nviolence, the President of the United States should not accuse them of \nhaving no coherent arguments or caving to the pressure. The President \ncould have taken the high road, could have said, ok, now that we have \nbeen unsuccessful in these measures, let's move on to the area where we \nknow there is consensus and that has to do with the mental health \nelement in so many of these mass gun tragedies.\n  Instead, he chose to take the low road. I agree with him it was a \ntruly shameful day. I and many of my colleagues are not worried, as \nsome of the press like to portray it, about the gun lobby who would \nspend a lot of money and paint us as anti-Second Amendment. I don't \nwork for them. I don't listen for them. I work for 26 million Texans, \nand I am proud to represent them. The views I represented on the floor \nof the Senate are their views. If I do not represent their views, then \nI am accountable to them and no one else, and, no, those of us who did \nnot agree with the President's proposals are not being intimidated, as \nhe said yesterday. It is false, it is absolutely false to say it comes \ndown to politics, as he said.\n  For me, it comes down to a meeting I had with the families who lost \nloved ones at Sandy Hook Elementary\n\n[[Page S2778]]\n\nSchool. I told them I was not interested in symbolism, in things we \nmight be able to do that would have had no impact on the terrible \ntragedy that day or in Tucson or at Virginia Tech or in Aurora, CO. I \nam not interested in passing legislation that would have had no impact \non those incidents and then patting ourselves on the back and \ncongratulating ourselves, saying, haven't we done a wonderful thing, \nwhen in fact it would be to celebrate symbolism over solutions. I am \ninterested in trying to come up with a solution.\n  I told them that day, the family members who came to visit with me as \nwe grieved with them for their terrible loss, I told them that as I \nunderstood what they were telling me, they were not coming to sell a \nparticular political point of view or an agenda or legislative laundry \nlist of things they wanted to see passed. It boiled down to this. These \nfamilies--who lost children and parents and spouses--want to make sure \ntheir loved one did not die in vain. They want to make sure something \ngood comes out of this terrible tragedy. Why wouldn't we want to work \ntogether to try to help them achieve their goals?\n  The President indicated yesterday that the legislation he actually \nwas pursuing, the so-called assault weapons ban, the background check \nbill, and others--he said none of that legislation would have solved \nthe problem these families were experiencing. I happen to agree with \nthat part of what he said. But instead of calling the President names \nand taking the low road as he did yesterday and chastising my fellow \nSenators for their good-faith disagreement on the best policies to \npursue in order to make sure these families' loss was not in vain, I am \nhere to ask for his help. I am here to ask for the help of every \nMember, to try to make sure we actually continue to look for measures \nwe might be able to get behind to actually make things better, that \nwould have offered a solution to some of these problems.\n  I have heard Senator Feinstein, who so eloquently spoke in favor of \nher proposed assault weapons ban. She conceded--I think as she had to--\nthat Adam Lanza would not have been stopped by an assault weapons ban \nbecause he stole weapons his mother legally possessed, and he murdered \nhis own mother before he then went to Sandy Hook Elementary School and \nmurdered innocent children and other adults. The background check bill \nwould not have had any impact on that. As Senator Feinstein conceded, \nas she must, neither would the assault weapons ban we voted on \nyesterday.\n  What might have an impact on incidents such as occurred at Virginia \nTech? What might have had an impact on incidents that occurred in \nTucson, where Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was shot and others killed? \nWe know the background check system, the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System, the NICS system that the FBI maintains, \ndepends on the States sending information to the FBI that they could \nuse to screen out gun buyers. As a matter of fact, the shooter at \nVirginia Tech had been adjudicated mentally ill by the State of \nVirginia, but that information was never forwarded to the FBI to be \nused on a background check so he could therefore purchase weapons \nwithout a hit occurring on the NICS background check system.\n  After 2008, we passed legislation encouraging the States, trying to \nincentivize them to send that information to the FBI so that would not \nhappen again. We know from the Government Accountability Office, the \nGAO, that the record of compliance with that law is dismal indeed. Many \nStates simply have not done it. I believe there are things we can do to \nfurther incentivize the States to send that information so the \nbackground check system, maintained by the FBI, actually works to \npreclude shooters such as the Virginia Tech shooter from legally buying \nweapons because there would be a hit on the background check system and \nhe would be stopped from that source of these weapons.\n\n  We know in Tucson, for example, the shooter there failed a drug test \nwhen he tried to volunteer for the military. That is also a \ndisqualifying incident that had it been reported to the background \ncheck system, as it could have and should have been, would have \nprevented him from purchasing weapons legally without being blocked by \na hit on the background check system. Why in the world wouldn't we look \nfor ways to improve the current background check regime, to stop people \nlike that from buying weapons and committing these mass atrocities?\n  I believe there is actually a way forward for us, and I hope Senator \nReid, the majority leader, who controls the agenda on the Senate floor, \nwill not choose to quit in our effort to try to find solutions, indeed \nsomething we need to pursue instead of just symbolic gestures which \nwould have had no impact on these mass gun tragedies.\n  We do not know what the majority leader is going to choose to do. He \nmay choose to get off the gun bill and get onto other business. It is \nhis prerogative to file the appropriate paperwork to ask the Senate to \ndo that. But it is our prerogative to say, no, we believe we ought to \nstay on this topic until we pass commonsense solutions that would \nactually make a difference in terms of these mass tragedies, and so \nthese families could say, no, my loved one--amidst all this terrible \ntragedy, amidst this terrible grief and heartache they are experiencing \nthat we can all just barely imagine, that they can say something good \ncame out of their loss because Congress moved forward, putting politics \naside, setting the talking points aside, and looked for some sort of \ncommon ground that would advance the cause of public safety and, \nhopefully, just hopefully, prevent some of these tragedies from \noccurring in the future.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           The CDH Resolution\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss S. Res. 85. I am \npleased that the Senate has unanimously declared April as National \nCongenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Awareness Month. I would like to thank \nmy friend and able colleague, Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, for \njoining me in this legislation. This Resolution is very important to me \nand my family, as my grandson, Jim Beau, is a CDH survivor.\n  CDH is a birth defect that occurs when the fetal diaphragm fails to \nfully develop. The lungs develop at the same time as the diaphragm and \nthe digestive system. When a diaphragmatic hernia occurs, the abdominal \norgans move into and develop in the chest instead of remaining in the \nabdomen. With the heart, lungs, and abdominal organs all taking up \nspace in the chest, the lungs do not have space to develop properly. \nThis may cause the lungs to be small and underdeveloped.\n  A diaphragmatic hernia is a life-threatening condition. When the \nlungs do not develop properly during pregnancy, it can be difficult for \nthe baby to breathe after birth or the baby is unable to take in enough \noxygen to stay healthy.\n  CDH will normally be diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound, as early as \nthe 16th week of pregnancy. If undiagnosed before birth, the baby may \nbe born in a facility that is not equipped to treat its compromised \nsystem because many CDH babies will need to be placed on a heart-lung \nbypass machine, which is not available in many hospitals. All babies \nborn with CDH will need to be cared for in a Neonatal Intensive Care \nUnit, NICU.\n  Babies born with CDH will have difficulty breathing as their lungs \nare often too small, biochemically and structurally immature. As a \nresult, the babies are intubated as soon as they are born, and parents \nare often unable to hold their babies for weeks or even months at a \ntime.\n  Most diaphragmatic hernias are repaired with surgery 1 to 5 days \nafter birth, usually with a GORE-TEX patch. The abdominal organs that \nhave migrated into the chest are put back\n\n[[Page S2779]]\n\nwhere they are supposed to be and the hole in the diaphragm is closed, \nhopefully allowing the affected lungs to expand. Hospitalization often \nranges from 3 to 10 weeks following the procedure, depending on the \nseverity of the condition.\n  Survivors often have difficulty feeding, some require a second \nsurgery to control reflux, others require a feeding tube, and a few \nwill reherniate and require additional repair.\n  Awareness, good prenatal care, early diagnosis, and skilled treatment \nare the keys to a greater survival rate in these babies. That is why \nthis resolution is so important.\n  Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a birth defect that occurs in 1 \nout of every 2,500 live births. Every 10 minutes a baby is born with \nCDH, adding up to more than 600,000 babies with CDH since just 2000. \nCDH is a severe, sometimes fatal defect that occurs as often as cystic \nfibrosis and spina bifida. Yet, most people have never heard of CDH.\n  The cause of CDH is unknown. Most cases of diaphragmatic hernia are \nbelieved to be multi-factorial in origin, meaning both genetic and \nenvironmental are involved. It is thought that multiple genes from both \nparents, as well as a number of environmental factors that scientists \ndo not yet fully understand, contribute to the development of a \ndiaphragmatic hernia.\n  Up to 20 percent of cases of CDH have a genetic cause due to a \nchromosome defect or genetic syndrome.\n  Approximately 40 percent of babies born with CDH will have other \nbirth defects, in addition to CDH. The most common is a congenital \nheart defect.\n  In 2009, my grandson Jim Beau was diagnosed with CDH during my \ndaughter Mary Abigail's 34th week of pregnancy. Although she had both a \n20-week and a 30-week ultrasound, the nurses and doctors did not catch \nthe disease on the baby's heartbeat monitor.\n  Thankfully, when Mary Abigail, her husband Paul, and daughter Jane \nRitchie moved to southeast Georgia, the baby's irregular heartbeat was \nheard at her first appointment with her new OB. She was sent to \nJacksonville for a fetal echo.\n  The technician there told her that she wasn't going to do the echo \nbecause there was something else wrong with the baby. She asked my \ndaughter if she had ever heard of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Of \ncourse, she had not, and at that time our family did not know the \nextent of our grandson's birth defect.\n  My daughter and her family moved to Gainesville, FL, on November 16 \nand Jim Beau was born 2 weeks later on November 30. They heard their \nson cry out twice after he was born, right before they intubated him, \nbut they were not allowed to hold him.\n  The doctors let his little lungs get strong before they did the \nsurgery to correct the hernia when he was 4 days old. Unfortunately, it \nturned out that the hernia was worse than they expected. The hole in \nhis diaphragm was very large, and he had almost no posterior diaphragm. \nHis intestines, spleen, and one kidney were up in his chest.\n  Thankfully, Jim Beau did not have to go on a heart-lung bypass \nmachine, but he was on a ventilator for 12 days and on oxygen for 36 \ndays. In total, he was in the NICU for 43 days before he was able to go \nhome.\n  Fortunately for my family, and thousands of similar families across \nthe United States, a number of physicians are doing incredible work to \ncombat CDH.\n  The CDH survival rate at Shands Children's Hospital in Gainesville, \nFL, where my grandson was treated, is unprecedented. The survival rate \nof CDH babies born at Shands is between 80 percent and 90 percent, \nwhile the nationwide average is significantly lower.\n  Dr. David Kays, who was the physician for my grandson's surgeries, \nuses gentle ventilation therapy as opposed to hyperventilation. Gentle \nventilation therapy is less aggressive and therefore protects the \nunderdeveloped lungs. My family was very lucky that Jim Beau's defect \nwas caught before he was born, and that they were in the right place to \nseek excellent care for his CDH.\n  The resolution Senator Cardin and I introduced is important because \nit will bring awareness to this birth defect, and this awareness will \nsave lives. Although hundreds of thousands of babies have been \ndiagnosed with this defect, the causes are unknown and more research is \nneeded. Every year more is learned and there are more successes. I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation to bring \nawareness to CDH.\n  Tomorrow, April 19, is the International Day of Congenital \nDiaphragmatic Hernia Awareness. In commemoration of this day, a march, \nthe Parade of Cherubs, will take place tomorrow here in Washington, DC. \nWe will be joined in our efforts by multiple cities across the Nation, \nall of which are hosting their own Parade of Cherubs. Events like these \nwill help increase awareness of this devastating birth defect.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am here today with sadness and anger \nafter one of the saddest and most troubling days in my career in public \nservice. Yesterday the Senate turned its back on the families of \nNewtown--some of them sitting in this very gallery, along with victims \nof other shootings.\n  The first words I heard when Vice President Biden banged the gavel to \nend the vote on the background check bill yesterday were, ``Shame on \nyou.'' ``Shame on you'' were the words of a rightfully angry mother of \na Virginia Tech student who was shot in the head twice 6 years ago this \nweek. This heartbroken mother had the courage and the fortitude to say \nthe words that all of us who have been fighting for commonsense laws to \nreduce gun violence felt at that moment.\n  Shame on us. Shame on the Senate. It was, in fact, a shameful day for \nthis Nation and for our democracy. The hardest part of that day was to \nexplain to the loved ones who lost children, spouses, family members in \nNewtown that day how 90 percent of the American people--the majority of \ngun owners and even NRA members--and 54 Members of the Senate could \nfavor a proposal that failed to become law. How could that be in a \ndemocracy?\n  Part of the answer relates to the filibuster, which is a now proven \ndespicable antidemocratic feature of this body. I have voted several \ntimes to, in effect, eliminate it, and yesterday's vote was a nail in \nthe coffin of the filibuster because the American people simply will \nnot stand for a result that so typifies an antidemocratic result but, \neven more, an antidemocratic process.\n  The filibuster fight is for another day. The fight today is to \ncontinue this effort against gun violence. I will pledge to every \nMember of this body, every person in Connecticut, and anyone who is \nengaged in this fight, that I will continue with redoubled \ndetermination.\n  When I tried to explain to one of the family members yesterday how \nthis process could be so broken and reach such an intolerable result, I \nsaid: We are not done. And she said to me: We are not even close to \ndone.\n  So resolute and resilient are these families that they should inspire \nus and uplift us in their determination to continue this work for the \nsake of the loved ones they lost and to keep faith with the 3,400 \ninnocent people who have perished as a result of gun violence since \nDecember 14 and the thousands who perished before.\n  It is not just our opportunity in the Senate--one of the great \ninstitutions in the history of the world--but our obligation, as public \nofficials and as Members of a body that holds a trust for democracy and \nfor safety, to provide better security for our people and our children.\n  The mother of that Virginia Tech student was sitting in the same \ngallery with those members of Newtown, CT, who lost 20 precious, \nbeautiful children and six brave, great educators. They were keeping \nvigil as the Senate turned its back on them.\n  Despite their profound and harrowing loss, those parents, husbands \nand wives, sons and daughters, sisters and brothers, grandmothers and \ngrandfathers have kept faith. They have\n\n[[Page S2780]]\n\nspent the last 4 months tirelessly and relentlessly advocating for \nchanges and reforms in our gun laws so that the loss they suffered will \nnot have been in vain. Still, the Senate failed in its responsibility \nin turning its back on them.\n  I do not want to relive December 14 when I went to Sandy Hook and \nheard and saw the grief and pain of those parents and loved ones as \nthey emerged from the firehouse. That unspeakable and unimaginable \nhorror I do not want to see again.\n  Yesterday was demoralizing and discouraging but not defeating \nbecause, ultimately, this reform will be delayed but not denied.\n  The massacre of 20 innocent children and their teachers will bring \nus, ultimately, to our senses, but so will the violence, carnage, and \nkilling since then. In the words of Mark Barden, whose son Daniel is in \nthis picture: We are not defeated. We are here now. We will always be \nhere because we have no other choice. The ``Connecticut effect'' is not \ngoing away. The Bardens are not going away, nor are any of the Newtown \nfamilies. The advocates of sensible, commonsense gun reform are not \ngoing away. We are here to stay.\n  For Mark and Jackie Barden and all of the other families from Newtown \nand every other victim of gun violence in this country, there is no \ngoing back. There is no turning back the page. We must simply move on \nto the next issue. As the bicycle team who came from Newtown to \nWashington, Team 26, said, we must go on pedaling. The only way to keep \na bicycle upright is to move forward. That is a simple lesson of life \nthe families of Newtown learned in their horrific tragedy. I will \ncontinue to stand with them and all of the other victims of gun \nviolence to work, to fight another day.\n  I say to every one of my colleagues, my friends who sided with the \nproponents of fear, do not underestimate the power of the Newtown \nfamilies and the other victims of gun violence. They are not going \naway. They will help to hold accountable and answerable to the people \nof America the actions that were taken here, the votes that were cast. \nVotes have consequences, just as elections do. The people of America \nwill remember. Our job now is to raise awareness, spread the rage that \nwe feel, raise that rage, and organize and enable and empower citizens \nto be heard and heeded by this body, whether in the next election or \nbefore then. My hope is that it will be before then because we must act \nbefore the next election. That action is an opportunity, a historic \nmoment we must seize.\n  Not everyone in this body turned their back on the victims of Newtown \nor on this cause yesterday. There were genuine profiles in courage on \nthis floor, in this body: first and foremost, Senator Manchin, who led \nthe fight on background checks and forged a compromise that should have \nwon the day, and Republicans who chose to buck their own leadership and \nfollow their hearts and consciences--Senators McCain, Collins, Kirk, \nand Toomey. The American people will thank you.\n  There are Democrats who took some tough votes--tough votes \nparticularly for their States. I thank Senators Hagan, Casey, Landrieu, \nHeinrich, Mark and Tom Udall, Jon Tester, and Senator Shaheen. These \nSenators put saving lives above the politics of the moment. They showed \ntrue leadership in the face of lies and fearmongering. They deserve our \nthanks and praise.\n  I wish to pay tribute to the Senators who have led this effort over \nmany years: Senators Feinstein, Lautenberg, Schumer, and Durbin. I \nthank my colleague Chris Murphy for his leadership and his courage. \nSenators Feinstein, Lautenberg, Schumer, and Durbin have been a \ntireless foursome on behalf of this fight. They have been dogged and \ndetermined. No amount of NRA deception or dishonesty has deterred them \nor stopped them.\n  I thank the majority leader, Harry Reid, for his courage. He has \npersevered in seeking a path forward on this legislation in the face of \nsome of the most difficult political and procedural obstacles. He has \nbeen as passionate and persevering in this cause as any one of the \nadvocates in these last weeks.\n  If you want to know the definition of ``resilient,'' look up ``Frank \nLautenberg'' in the dictionary because there he was, right here \nyesterday, after weeks of debilitating illness, with his wife Bonnie in \nthe gallery. She cheered him on, and so did we. Nothing was going to \nkeep him from voting on the gun control bills he had championed for a \nlifetime.\n  In moving forward, let's take heart and inspiration from the families \nof Newtown, who have been resolute and resilient at every turn, from \nthe continued strength of the advocates, from the courage of our \ncolleagues who stood strong yesterday, and from the American people.\n  I have said, along with others, that at the end of the day the \nAmerican people would be the ones to make a difference. Their rage and \ndisbelief is palpable. They will be there for Daniel Barden. He is only \none among thousands. We have seen their pictures. They have been on \ndisplay on this floor. Their names have been recited and their memories \nrevived.\n  Yesterday the Senate said no to America, but the people of America \nwill not take no for an answer. As Martin Luther King said, ``The arc \nof history is long, but it bends towards justice.'' We are on the right \nside of history, which will eventually vindicate this cause. I look \nforward to being here, if not within days, at least in the very near \nfuture when we take another vote and we stand 60 or more strong to make \nsure that Daniel Barden's memory is not in vain and that his brave \nparents are also vindicated in their trust in us.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 717\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 717 offered by the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Barrasso.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, this amendment protects the privacy and \nsafety of law-abiding gun owners. When government officials release gun \nownership information, it puts many lives at risk. This includes the \nlives of lawful gun owners, the lives of law enforcement, and the lives \nof victims of domestic violence.\n  State or local governments which release private gun owner \ninformation will be penalized 5 percent of their Federal program \nfunding. This includes the release of private information on \nindividuals who have licenses to purchase, possess, or carry firearms. \nThe funding which is withheld will then be redistributed to the States \nwhich are in compliance. This amendment will ensure gun owners across \nthe Nation do not have their private gun owner information publicly \nreleased.\n  I urge all Senators to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is a case of Washington being Big \nBrother and telling each one of the States--whether it is Wyoming, \nVermont, or Connecticut--what they must do. We have no idea how it will \naffect them. We do know it is going to cut off a lot of money to law \nenforcement because it is telling States, even though the State \nlegislators have gone out for the year, they need to have a one-size-\nfits-all. There has not been a hearing on it. It is a feel-good \namendment. It will hurt our States but, most importantly, it will hurt \nlaw enforcement.\n  If you wish to have a discussion on this subject, that is fine. Let's \nhave a hearing. Let's find out what it is. To do this feel-good \namendment and inform every one of our 50 States there is 2 minutes of \ndebate, inform our 50 States we know better than they do and this is \nwhat they should do, makes no sense.\n  I oppose the amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Barrasso amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n\n[[Page S2781]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of amendment \nNo. 730, which I have offered along with Senator Alexander and a \nbipartisan group of colleagues. This amendment would reauthorize and \nimprove programs administered by both the Department of Education and \nHealth and Human Services related to awareness, intervention, \nprevention of mental health conditions, and the promotion of linkages \nto appropriate services for children and youth.\n  Basically, title I focuses on school settings by promoting schoolwide \nprevention through the development of positive behavioral interventions \nand supports. Title II focuses on suicide prevention and also helping \nchildren recover from traumatic events.\n  I wish to make it clear this amendment passed our committee last week \nunanimously--unanimously. It has a number of Republican and Democratic \ncosponsors, so I hope, regardless of how we might agree or disagree on \nall the stuff about guns and the stuff that has come up, we can all \nagree we need to do a better job of early identification, intervention, \nand providing support services for the mental health of our children in \nthis country.\n  With that, I yield to Senator Alexander.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this bill was unanimously accepted in \ncommittee. It has the contributions of many Senators on both sides. It \nimproves prevention and intervention in our schools, universities, \ncommunities, doctors' offices, and mental health clinics. I urge a \n``yes'' vote. It is an authorization bill and, therefore, has no score.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. WICKER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under previous order requiring 60 votes for \nthe adoption of this amendment, the amendment is agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, earlier this week, as the debate on this \nlegislation began, the distinguished majority whip said that ``we are \nhere because of Newtown, Connecticut.'' I agree. Had that horrific \nevent not occurred last December, this legislation would not have been \nintroduced.\n  I share with all Americans the sorrow, frustration, and anger that \nfollows a tragedy like what happened in Newtown or earlier in Aurora, \nColorado, and Arizona. I share the sense that we must respond in some \nway, that we must prevent such tragedies in the future. We feel that \nway even though we know that such a guarantee is impossible, especially \nin a country that we want to remain free. But when a tragedy like that \noccurs, our fellow Americans look to Congress as if to say: Don't just \nstand there, do something.\n  If we are here because of Newtown, if this legislation is indeed a \nresponse to that tragedy to prevent it from happening again, then it \nseems obvious that there should be some connection between what \nhappened there and what is happening here. Common sense would say that \nNewtown must have exposed some deficiency in our laws or some gap that \nneeds to be filled. Common sense would say that a legislative response \nto Newtown would be something that could have prevented this tragedy \nand, therefore, can prevent a similar tragedy in the future.\n  That is what common sense would say, but it is just not true. In \nfact, the same day that the majority whip said that we are here because \nof Newtown, liberal columnist Richard Cohen wrote in the Washington \nPost that this legislation would do ``absolutely nothing to avoid such \na tragedy.'' Expanding background checks, for example, would not have \nprevented the Newtown shooting because Adam Lanza did not purchase the \nweapons that he used, nor would they have prevented the Aurora shooting \nbecause James Holmes not only legally purchased the weapons he used, \nbut would have passed a background check even under the bill before us. \nWe may be here because of Newtown, but the bill we are considering \nsimply does not respond to that tragedy.\n  As I said, I share the feeling after a tragic event that we must take \naction. We must, however, resist the temptation to believe that more \nlegislation is always the answer. The truth is that the Newtown and \nAurora shooters, as well as the Columbine shooters before them, broke \ndozens of Federal, State, and local laws already on the books. Federal \nlaw has already created more\n\n[[Page S2782]]\n\nthan 60 different firearms offenses. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nand Firearms posts on its Web site a reference guide to Federal \nfirearms regulations. It is 243 pages long. But during the first decade \nof the 21st century, according to the Census Bureau, the percentage of \nintentional homicides from handguns, rifles, or shotguns all declined \nrather than rose.\n  Even more important than these legislative considerations is the fact \nthat public policy in this area impacts fundamental constitutional \nrights. When other tragedies occur, even terrorist attacks, we often \nhear that such circumstances must not weaken our commitment to the Bill \nof Rights, and I do not believe we should do so now.\n  One of the disturbing arguments I have heard so often during this \ndebate is that Americans do not ``need'' certain guns for certain \nactivities or do not ``need'' to exercise their Second Amendment rights \nin certain ways. This dangerous view gets it exactly backwards. The \nplace to start is with the individual right that the Constitution \nguarantees and the burden should be on the government to justify \ninfringing or limiting that right. Imagine if the government told us \nhow much speech or the exercise of religion we ``need'' under the First \nAmendment or if the government told us how much privacy we ``need'' \nunder the Fourth Amendment. My liberal friends would howl in protest if \nwe treated other provisions of the Bill of Rights in the way they want \nto treat the Second Amendment.\n  The Second Amendment guarantees a fundamental right of individuals to \nkeep and bear arms. In fact, the Second Amendment merely codifies a \nright that already existed, a right that predates the Constitution \nitself. In 1982, when I chaired the Judiciary Subcommittee on the \nConstitution, we published a landmark report on the history of this \nfundamental right. More than 25 years before the Supreme Court \nofficially said so, our report established that the Second Amendment \n``was intended as an individual right of the American citizen to keep \nand carry arms in a peaceful manner, for protection of himself, his \nfamily, and his freedoms.''\n  The President yesterday called it ``shameful'' that the Senate \ndefeated gun control proposals that he favors. I disagree. There was \nnothing shameful about opposing legislation that failed to respond to \nthe Newtown tragedy, that cannot prevent such tragedies from ever \nhappening again, and that undermines the Bill of Rights.\n  Two things will always be true as we continue grappling with violence \nin our society: people, not guns, kill and harm other people and \ncriminals will not obey the law. It does no good to pretend otherwise \nor legislate for a society in which those things are not true, in other \nwords, for a society that does not exist. We have to address the \nsociety we have, a society we want to remain free, a society in which \nwe are protected by the Constitution. I could not support the \nlegislation before us because it failed to meet this standard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/18/senate-section/article/S2782-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of Analisa Torres, of New \nYork, to be United States District Judge for the Southern District of \nNew York and the nomination of Derrick Kahala Watson, of Hawaii, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the District of Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 15 \nminutes for debate equally divided in the usual form prior to votes on \nthe nominations.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, Monday's confirmation of Judge Beverly \nO'Connell marked the 150th confirmation of a Federal trial court \nnomination by President Obama. Thanks to Senate Republicans' concerted \neffort to filibuster, obstruct and delay his moderate judicial \nnominees, it took almost 1 year longer to reach this milestone than it \ndid when his Republican predecessor was serving as President, 10 months \nin fact. I have repeatedly asked Senate Republicans to abandon their \ndestructive tactics. Their unwillingness to do so shows that Senate \nRepublicans are still focused on obstructing this President, rather \nthan helping meet the needs of the American people and our judiciary.\n  The ability of hardworking Americans to get their day in court and \nhave their rights protected should not be subject to this kind of \nwrongheaded, partisan obstructionism. Today, the Senate is being \nallowed to vote on just 2 of the 15 judicial nominees ready for \nconfirmation. Ten of the judicial nominees confirmed this year could \nand should have been confirmed last year. There are still four judicial \nnominees in that category, who are part of the backlog on which Senate \nRepublicans insist on maintaining. And like so many of President \nObama's district court nominees, Analisa Torres and Derrick Watson have \nhad to wait more than 60 days after being voted on by the Judiciary \nCommittee to be considered by the Senate. These systematic delays help \nexplain why we remain more than 20 confirmations behind the pace we set \nwith President Bush's nominees. We can make up much of that ground if \nSenate Republicans would just agree to a vote on all 15 nominees \ncurrently pending on the Executive Calendar. All of them received \nbipartisan support in committee, and all but one were unanimously \napproved by the committee. There is no good reason for further delay, \nespecially at a time when judicial vacancies remain at 85.\n  Let us clear the backlog of judicial nominees ready for confirmation. \nRepublicans have recently started pointing to 2004. In 1 month in 2004, \na presidential election year, we were able to clear a backlog of \nconsensus nominees by confirming 20. This insistence on delay and \nholding over consensus nominees from 1 year to the next has been \nconstant. Seventeen of the confirmations for which Senate Republicans \nnow seek credit over the past 2 years should have been confirmed more \nthan 2 years ago in the preceding Congress. That is when they allowed \nonly 60 judicial confirmations to take place during President Obama's \nfirst 2 years in office, the lowest total for a President in over 30 \nyears. Indeed, during President Obama's first year in office, Senate \nRepublicans stalled all but 12 of his circuit and district nominees. \nThat was the lowest 1-year confirmation total since the Eisenhower \nadministration, when the Federal bench was barely \\1/3\\ the size it is \ntoday.\n  The fact is that we have these 15 nominees waiting for a vote. We \nhave 15 judgeships that can be filled so that hardworking Americans in \nNew York, Hawaii, Louisiana, California, Florida, Oregon, Pennsylvania, \nNorth Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, \nArkansas, New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming can \nhave better access to justice. All Senate Democrats are prepared to \nvote on all of these nominees today.\n  Judge Analisa Torres is nominated to serve on the US District Court \nfor the Southern District of New York. She currently serves as a New \nYork State Supreme Court Justice. Previously, she served as an acting \nNew York State Supreme Court Justice, a judge for the Civil Court of \nthe City of New York, and as a judge for the Criminal Court of the City \nof New York. She received her A.B., magna cum laude, from Harvard \nUniversity and her J.D. from Columbia Law School. Judge Torres has the \nstrong support of her home State Senators, Senator Schumer and Senator \nGillibrand.\n\n[[Page S2783]]\n\n  Derrick Kahala Watson is nominated to the US District Court for the \nDistrict of Hawaii. He currently serves as the chief of the Civil \nDivision in the US attorney's office in the District of Hawaii. Prior \nto that, he was an assistant United States attorney in the same office. \nFrom 1995 to 2000, he served as an assistant United States attorney in \nthe Northern District of California and served as deputy chief of the \nCivil Division from 1999 to 2000. In addition to his service at the US \nattorney's office, he was in private practice for more than a decade. \nDerrick Watson received his J.D. from Harvard Law School and his A.B., \ncum laude, from Harvard College. He has the support of his home State \nSenators, Senator Hirono and Senator Schatz.\n  Both nominees were unanimously approved by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee by voice vote 2 months ago.\n  Like almost all of the other nominees pending on the Executive \nCalendar, these are the kind of mainstream and consensus nominees who \nshould be confirmed quickly. For nearly 4 years vacancies have been at \nor above 80, putting an unnecessary strain on our Federal courts. \nSequestration cuts have added to the pressure on our justice system. \nLet us vote on the remaining nominees so that they can get to work for \nthe American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \nnomination of Derrick Kahala Watson to be a district judge for the U.S. \nDistrict Court of Hawaii. But before I discuss this nomination, I would \nlike to join with the rest of my colleagues in acknowledging the week \nwe have had and how trying it has been for all Americans. The horrific \nbombing at the Boston Marathon, the targeting of Senate offices and the \nPresident with mail containing poison, other actions at the Capitol, \nand now this tragic explosion in Texas have captured our attention and \ngiven us all perspective on what is important in life. Our hearts go \nout to all the victims and their families.\n  Turning now to Mr. Watson's nomination, I thank Chairman Leahy and \nRanking Member Grassley of the Judiciary Committee for their quick \nconsideration, referring this nomination to the full Senate for a vote. \nMr. Watson was born in Hawaii. He attended Harvard college and Harvard \nLaw School and started a successful career in law in San Francisco, CA, \nbefore returning to Hawaii to serve as an assistant U.S. attorney.\n  Mr. Watson testified before the Judiciary Committee in January at my \nfirst hearing as a Senator. He demonstrated that he had the \nqualifications, ability, and temperament to be an outstanding judge for \nHawaii.\n  Once he is confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Watson will be the only \nperson of Native Hawaiian descent serving as an article III judge, and \nonly the fourth to serve in the history of the United States.\n  In addition, once he joins the Federal bench in Hawaii, that court \nwill be the first majority Asian American Pacific Islander article III \ncourt in American history.\n  I am proud to support Judge Watson, and I am happy that the Senate \nwill vote to confirm him today. I certainly urge all my colleagues to \ncast a unanimous vote for his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I am deeply honored to stand here \ntoday in support of Analisa Torres's nomination to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York. I also want to \nthank President Obama for acting on my recommendation and nominating \nanother superbly qualified female jurist to the Federal bench.\n  I know Judge Torres as a fair-minded woman of great integrity. Her \nlifetime of public service and legal experience, serving as a jurist, \nan attorney, and serving her community has earned her the respect of \nher colleagues. Her body of work demonstrates her qualifications to \nserve on the Federal bench.\n  Since 2000, she has served as a judge in various courts, including \nthe Criminal Court of the City of New York, and in 2012 she was elected \nto a 14-year term as a New York State Supreme Court Justice. Judge \nTorres has previously worked in private practice, as a law clerk, and \nas a teacher. In her current role, she has exemplified pragmatism and \nhas demonstrated a consistent commitment to thoughtful, sound and fair \nreasoning.\n  In addition to her professional work, she has shown an enduring \ncommitment to her community.\n  There is no question that Judge Torres is extremely well qualified \nand well suited to serve as a Federal court judge. I strongly believe \nthis country needs more women like her serving in the Federal \njudiciary--an institution I believe needs more exceptional women.\n  Today, women make up only 30 percent of the Federal bench.\n  According to the National Women's Law Center, only 66 women of color \ncurrently serve as active Federal judges--that is less than 10 percent \nof the Nation's active Federal bench.\n  We have to do better.\n  Judge Torres's nomination has been pending before this body for over \n150 days. I urge my colleagues to put aside partisan differences and \nhelp us move forward on the 14 judicial nominees who have been forced \nto deal with this unprecedented delay.\n  I remind my colleagues that greater diversity, of gender, ethnicity \nand professional backgrounds, are not just ideals that we should aspire \nto, but steps we must take to have a judiciary that is more diverse, \nand more reflective of the great country we live in. I have no doubt \nthat having Judge Torres serving in the Federal judiciary will bring us \ncloser to that goal.\n  I was proud to recommend her for this position. I urge all my \ncolleagues to join me and vote in support of her nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I will be voting for both of these \nnominees for judges, but I would like to make some comments because I \nhear rumblings of how Senate Republicans are obstructing judicial \nnominees. I would just like to remind my colleagues of how well we are \nproceeding.\n  Today the Senate will consider two more judicial nominations. These \nnominations are people, as I just said, I am going to approve. This is \nthe third of this week, and with today's expected action we will have \nconfirmed 4 circuit and 9 district nominees during this Congress, for a \ntotal of 13. At this point in 2005, during President Bush's second \nterm, the Senate had confirmed not 13 like now, with us, not 9, not 4, \nbut only 1 judicial nominee. So that would be a record of 13 for this \nadministration and 1 for a counter time during the second Bush \nadministration.\n  As I stated last week, the quick pace of this year comes on top of a \nvery productive 112th conditioning, in which 111 judges were confirmed. \nThat was more judges confirmed than any other Congress going all the \nway back 20 years. Overall, with today's actions, we will have \nconfirmed 184 judicial nominees. Divide it this way, 34 circuit judges \nand now 150 district judges. The Senate has defeated only 2 nominees. \nThat is a record of our passing 184 to 2 that have not been approved. \nThat is a .989 batting average. So I do not know who is shedding tears \naround here, but they ought to look at the record.\n  Other nominees are still being considered by the Senate and a few \nremain in committee. I note we have a hearing scheduled next week for \nanother circuit and district judge, so we are continuing to move \nforward. But even counting those pending nominations, the President has \na confirmation rate that is comparable to that of President George W. \nBush, President Clinton, and exceeds that of President George H.W. \nBush.\n  Again, there is no credible basis to say this President is being \ntreated differently from previous Presidents. What is different, \nthough, in the case of this President is the manner in which he has \nallowed vacancies to accumulate before submitting nominations. It is \nabout time that down at the White House they get down to work, decide \nwho they are going to nominate, and get the nominations up here. His \nfailure to make judicial nominations a priority in his first year when \nDemocrats had a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate resulted in an \nincrease of vacancies. That was not the fault of Senate Republicans.\n  Throughout his administration it has been the case that a majority of \nvacancies have had no nominees. Presently, do you know that three of \nfour vacancies have no nominees up here?\n\n[[Page S2784]]\n\n  For the 36 vacancies categorized as ``judicial emergencies,'' there \nare only 8 nominees. So I just want to set the record straight before \nthe vote for these nominees because I get tired of these crocodile \ntears being shed. Particularly, I am sick of hearing about us not \nmoving on judges when three-fourths of them we don't even have the \nnominees here yet. So quit crying.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I share the perplexed attitude of the \nSenator from Iowa about our friends' concern about nominations. The \nPresident has even talked about it. I have gone back and looked at the \nrecord. There was a Washington Post article 3 weeks ago. I gave a copy \nof it to the President. This is what it said: On Cabinet nominations, \nthis Senate has considered President Obama's Cabinet nominations more \nrapidly than they did the last three Presidents. That is Cabinet \nnominations. Never in the history of the Senate has the Senate denied a \nCabinet nomination by filibuster, with the exception of the Democrats \nblocking John Bolton in the George W. Bush administration. So the \nPresident is treated better on Cabinet nominations.\n  Evidence from the Congressional Research Service says President \nObama's circuit judges in his first term were considered more rapidly \nthan President George W. Bush's circuit judges. Senator Grassley just \npointed out that in the second term of President Bush he had 1 judge \nconfirmed by this time; President Obama has 13.\n  On district judges, according to the Congressional Research Service, \nduring the first term of President Obama his district judges were \nconsidered a little more slowly than President George W. Bush's, but \nthe Senate changed the rules earlier this year to cut down the \npostcloture debate time to make it easier to bring judges to the floor \nand get them through more rapidly. Perhaps that is why the score is 13 \nto 1, with Obama getting 13 judges and Bush getting 1 in the same \nperiod of time in the second term.\n  I do not know where this is coming from. In addition, we have never \nblocked a district judge by filibuster--neither party in the history of \nthe Senate. In the circuit judges we never blocked a circuit judge \nuntil George W. Bush made some nominations about the time I came to the \nSenate 10 years ago, and the Democrats started it. They caused Miguel \nEstrada to be blocked and a number of others, and they brought up \ncloture motions time after time and we had a gang of 6, 8, 10 or 14 who \nslowed it all down. But still the score is 5 to 2; 5 Republican judges \nblocked for confirmation by the Democrats under President Bush, and 2 \nby Republicans with President Obama.\n  We worked pretty hard for the President to confirm his nominations. \nWe had two sets of rules changes, and we have a number of expedited \nnominations which come now to the desk. We had about 170 nominations \nthat have been completely removed from Senate confirmation. I would \nthink the Obama administration would be thanking the Senate for its \nwork to make it easier for any President to get confirmations. In any \nevent, when we are talking about Cabinet Members, President Obama is \nbeing better treated than the last three Presidents. When we are \ntalking about circuit judges he is better treated than George W. Bush. \nWhen we are talking about district judges he is treated a little worse \nin his first term than George W. Bush, but we changed the rules to \nspeed up district judges. The score in the second term, as I have said \ntwice now, is Obama 13, Bush 1--Obama way ahead.\n  I like to see confirmations move ahead. I hope I do not hear this \nmuch more, when the record shows that in fact it is a manufactured \ncrisis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent all time be \nyielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Analisa Torres, of New York, to be United States District Judge for \nthe Southern District of New York?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Watson \nnomination.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Derrick Kahala Watson, of Hawaii, to be United States District Judge \nfor the District of Hawaii?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, this bears repeating: We knew all along \nthat efforts to pass stronger background checks and keep guns out of \nthe hands of criminals wouldn't be easy, and it hasn't been. But \nkeeping America's streets safe from gun violence is worth the effort.\n  Yesterday the families of gun violence victims watched as Republicans \ndefeated a commonsense proposal to expand background checks. It is \nsupported by 90 percent of the American people. It is not some hocus-\npocus. What it says is that if a person is a criminal, that person \nshouldn't be able to buy a gun. It says that if a person has severe \nmental issues, that person shouldn't be able to buy a gun. That is all \nit said.\n  Yesterday the families of gun violence victims watched, but despite \nthe\n\n[[Page S2785]]\n\nfact that a strong majority of the American people feel this way, we \nweren't able to get this done. Despite the fact that a strong majority \nof the Senate voted in favor of stronger background checks--a strong \nmajority--Republicans once again filibustered a commonsense proposal. \nWe were able to get 4 Republicans--4 out of 45.\n  Yesterday President Obama said it was a shameful day for the Senate, \nand it probably was, I agree. But we should make no mistake; this \ndebate is not over. In fact, this fight is just beginning.\n  I have spoken with the President. He and I agree that the best way to \nkeep working toward passing a background check bill is to hit ``pause'' \nand freeze the background check bill where it is. In the meantime, we \nwill keep moving forward with the people from Aurora, CO, Blacksburg, \nVA, Newtown, CT, and other places to make sure we are able to get \nsomething done. This will allow Senators to keep negotiating.\n  We had nine amendments yesterday. They were not easy to vote on--not \nfor us or for the Republicans--and I understand that. But it was a good \nprocess by which to move forward and get some of these contentious \namendments on both sides out of the way--or voted on, rather, is a \nbetter way to phrase it.\n  So we are going to come back to this bill. I feel obligated to \nSenator Stabenow. She should have an opportunity to offer her amendment \non mental health. I feel an obligation to Senator Coburn. He should be \nable to offer his amendment on background checks. I feel an obligation \nto a number of Senators who believe we have to do a better job dealing \nwith the issue of veterans.\n  So we are going to have time to work on what people want to do before \nwe come back to this. It will give opponents an opportunity to decide \nwhat they want to do when we get back on this, and it will give gun \nviolence advocates time to make their voices heard by Republican \nSenators. This option will preserve the progress we have made on the \nbill. We passed a couple of amendments today--we passed a Republican \namendment and a Democratic amendment. I suggest to the Senate that this \noption will prevent us from having to return to square one \nprocedurally, and I think that is good.\n  I am committed to ensuring that any bill we pass includes an \nexpansion of background checks, closing the gun show loophole, as well \nas covering private sales.\n  This afternoon I am going to file cloture on the motion to proceed to \nthe Marketplace Fairness Act, which would give brick-and-mortar stores \nparity with Internet-only retailers. It is only a matter of time before \nwe bring this anti-gun violence measure back to the floor for a vote.\n  The stand of the Republicans is not sustainable. It is a question of \nhow long they are going to stand firm, but it is not sustainable.\n  I assure the 90 percent of Americans who support meaningful \nbackground checks that I am going to continue this fight. I assure the \nfamilies of Newtown and Aurora and Tucson and Blacksburg that we are \ngoing to continue to stand by their side.\n  To those Senators who have indicated they want to offer amendments, \nwe will be back and try to do another tranche of amendments, and when \nwe get there, I hope we can proceed the way we did this week to line up \namendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/18/senate-section/article/S2785-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2785-S2792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MARKETPLACE FAIRNESS ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, as I understand it, Leader Reid moved to \nproceed to the Marketplace Fairness Act a bit ago. I have deep \nreservations about this legislation, so I am not able to support the \nmotion to proceed. The leader has filed cloture on his motion, and I \njust want it understood at this point that if cloture is invoked, I \nwill not be able to support a reduction in the amount of time available \nfor Members to debate this.\n  The Presiding Officer and I have talked about this a number of times, \nbut just for purposes of this discussion, I think it is extremely \nimportant that the Senate and the country think through the \nimplications of what this bill is all about.\n  What this bill is all about is that the advocates essentially want to \ntake a function that is now vested in government--State tax \ncollection--and, in effect, outsource that function of government to \nsmall businesses, particularly these small online retailers.\n  This has been a big source of employment, good wages, innovative \napproaches, new apps. It has been a big boost for our country. I think \nit is important for the Senate to think through what this means and try \nto see if we can come up with something that is sensible.\n  For example, the proponents of the legislation are going to argue \nwith considerable passion that this is not going to be a hard task for \nthese small businesses on which they have imposed this new assignment--\nas they call it, outsourcing the function of State tax collection, \nwhich is done by government, to these small businesses.\n  The proponents say it is not going to be hard for small businesses to \nhandle this. They are going to say there is a lot of new technology \navailable--computer software and the like--and that the Marketplace \nFairness Act will not be difficult to administer as a result of these \nnew technologies.\n  Having been involved in this debate now for years and years--having \nbeen the original author of what is a different subject but has some of \nthe same connections, the Internet tax fairness legislation--I have \nheard the proponents of this legislation say, year after year after \nyear, this is not going to be a hard assignment, the process of these \nsmall businesses collecting these taxes, that new technologies are \navailable, and that the law ought to be passed because it can be done.\n  But year after year we have seen that the idea that this is so simple \nand it can be done is not borne out. If it were so simple, it would \nhave been done already. The reason this bill comes to the floor of the \nSenate is because it is, in fact, not so simple. It is not going to be \na piece of cake for these small businesses.\n  There are more than 5,000 taxing jurisdictions in our country. Some \nof them give very different treatment for products and services that \nare almost identical. So this is a big lift to say we are going to have \nsoftware and computers and technology and it is just going to be a \npiece of cake for these small businesses to be able to handle this.\n  I think that is part of what needs to be discussed in a debate on the \nfloor of the Senate because, fundamentally, the idea of taking a \nfunction of government--tax collection--and handing it over to small \nbusinesses--and small businesses being a big part of our country's \neconomic engine--is something I think ought to give every Senator \npause.\n\n[[Page S2786]]\n\n  In addition to that, I want us to think through the aspects of this \nthat relate to America's ability to compete in tough global markets.\n  I know when we talked about this in a brief way during the Senate \nbudget debate, several Senators said that, oh, back in the days when we \nwere just debating the Internet, they could see the need for some of \nthese policies in the digital age, but now the Internet is all grown \nup. We do not need any of these kinds of approaches such as \ntechnological neutrality and nondiscrimination with respect to taxes \nand regulation.\n  My response to this is, yes, it is a different day. There is no \nquestion about it. I chair the Senate Finance Subcommittee on \nInternational Trade. As part of my obligations there to look at trade \nand competitiveness, I have come to the conclusion that the Internet is \nthe shipping lane of the 21st century.\n  I think about what the Finance Committee looked like 30, 40 years \nago--people moving goods physically from North Dakota, Oregon, and the \nlike. It is very different today. With a lot of economic activity, in a \nsense, being conducted online on the Internet, to a great extent it is \nnow the shipping lane.\n  This bill, I want the Senate to know and the country to know, will be \na big leg up for foreign retailers and foreign businesses. The reason I \nsay that is the Marketplace Fairness Act, in effect, tries to take \nlocal law and apply it to the global economy. It is unprecedented.\n  What it will mean--if passed in its present form--is that if you are \non the northern border--say you are in North Dakota or Washington State \nor other places that are on the northern border--if you are an online \nretailer, you are going to say to yourself: Why in the world would you \nwant to stay on the U.S. side of the border and try to comply with the \nrules of thousands of taxing jurisdictions when you can move, in \neffect, half an hour away outside the borders of the United States and \nnot be subjected to this?\n  So maybe the sponsors of the bill want to rename their bill--now \ncalled the Marketplace Fairness Act--the shop Canada and the shop \nMexico bill because that is truly what it would mean.\n  I have heard some in favor of the bill say that is not the case, that \nthere are long-arm statutes and the like. Good luck with that. Good \nluck with the idea we have not been able to figure out a way to do this \nin the United States, now we are going to write a bill that says it \ndoes not apply to the foreign retailer or the foreign business, and we \nare going to say we are going to be able to hook those people somehow \nwith a long-arm statute. I do not see it.\n  That is what the point of this debate is all about. So we had the \ndiscussion in the context of the budget. I think then it was sort of \nseen as kind of a general proposition. But now we are getting ready to \nwrite a real law. My own preference would be to have this go back to \nthe Senate Finance Committee chaired by Chairman Baucus--we work very \nclosely in a bipartisan way, Chairman Baucus and Senator Hatch--and \nthat we have a chance to think through the implications here.\n  I can think of some commonsense ideas where the Presiding Officer and \nI would agree on some kind of uniformity. I mean, if we were talking \nabout uniformity rather than 5,000-plus taxing jurisdictions, that \nwould be one thing. We saw the jobs numbers last month. They were not \nwhere they ought to be. The idea that now we are going to take steps \nhere in the Senate which would hinder the growth of the innovative \nengine of the American economy strikes me as something we should not be \ndoing.\n  Personally I would very much like to be part of an effort to work \nthis out. I have always said the American economy is now about bricks \nand clicks. We now have most of our businesses looking to try to have \nstorefronts and online operations. I want both of them to prosper. Some \nof Oregon's most illustrious companies look at just that principle, \nbricks and clicks.\n  But let's not hammer the innovation sector, that online aspect of the \nAmerican economy, especially given what we have seen of late. I mean, \nthink about the Friday after Thanksgiving. Were the malls and the \nstores empty the Friday after Thanksgiving? They certainly were not. \nThe traditional part of the American economy, stores and malls--people \ncould not find a parking place. Those stores were offering hours \nearlier and earlier in order to meet consumer demand.\n  So, yes, let's promote bricks and clicks, but let's not precipitously \ntake steps that will harm so much of the American economy. When I got \ninvolved in these issues years ago--I think I told the Presiding \nOfficer about this. When I came to the Senate, I had just become \nOregon's first new Senator in 30 years. I made it clear I was going to \nspend a lot of time on timber and natural resources issues. I chair the \nEnergy Committee. I am going to continue to do that, because that is a \nbedrock part of the American economy and a bedrock part of Oregon's \nfuture and small communities and what our State is all about.\n  I said in addition to that focus on timber and natural resources, \nwhen I came to the Senate, I am going to spend a lot of time looking at \ntechnology and innovation and new areas for our State to get into. That \nled me into some of those initial kinds of efforts, passage of the \nsection of the Communications Decency Act which encouraged investment \nin social media, Facebook and Twitter and social media, because had we \nnot gotten that passed, we were told a lot of people who might think \nabout investing in the social media would see that someone who ran a \nWebsite would get held liable for someone who posted on that site and \nthe owner of the site would not know anything about it and could not \nfigure out how to get rid of that. So with that, and with the Internet \ntax freedom bill and others, we said with respect to technology and \ninnovation, let's do two things: First, let's do no harm. Let's not \ntake steps actively where we damage our economy and our future. Second, \nlet's not discriminate. Let's not single out this sector which has \nshown so much promise.\n  At a minimum, the marketplace fairness legislation, as written today, \nwill violate that first principle. It will do harm. It will force those \nsmall online retailers to, in effect, take on a government function, \ntax collection. I do not know of any civics book that talks about \noutsourcing a function of government--tax collection--to small \nbusinesses. That is what the marketplace fairness legislation does.\n  Second, in a tough global economy--I know the Presiding Officer cares \na great deal about global commerce and global trade coming from her \nState--this bill will favor foreign businesses that will not be \nsubjected to it. That is something that cannot be corrected in this \nbill in its present form. There may be other ways to correct it; there \nmay be other ways to correct a number of aspects of the bill. That \ncannot. It will favor foreign retailers.\n  As I chair the Finance Subcommittee on Global Commerce and Global \nTrade, I do not see how that makes sense. That is why I have made it \nclear today that given the state of where the Senate discussion is now \nwith the leader having filed cloture on his motion--I want to make it \nclear that if cloture is invoked, I will not support a reduction in \ntime for this discussion.\n  I yield the floor and I would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, this week I joined my colleagues in \nintroducing immigration reform legislation that seeks to end de facto \namnesty by achieving the strongest border security enforcement measures \nin U.S. history but also by modernizing our legal immigration system so \nit can unleash the strong economic growth and job creation potential \nthat immigration has.\n  Let me begin by stating the obvious, and that is that America is a \nnation of immigrants. We know that because every single one of us can \ntrack our lineage back to someone who came here from somewhere else. \nThe truth is it is one of the things that make us different and special \nfrom the rest of the world.\n  If we think about the history of the world, it is basically people \nbeing told\n\n[[Page S2787]]\n\nthey can only do what their parents did for a living. How far you are \ngoing to go in life depends on what your parents used to do and who you \nare and to whom you are connected. What made America truly unique and \nwhat made the idea of America truly revolutionary was the idea that \nevery single human being, no matter where they were born, how they were \nborn, into what kind of family they were born, and into what \ncircumstances they were born, had the God-given right to go as far as \ntheir talent and their hard work would take them. We may take that for \ngranted--those of us, like me, who were born and raised here our entire \nlife--but this is the exception rather than the rule throughout human \nhistory, and it is one of the things that have made America so special \nbecause the belief and commitment to that ideal unleashed here the \nrevolutionary power of the human spirit and transformed this country \ninto the single most powerful and greatest and freest Nation in all of \nhuman history.\n  This is the story of immigration in America, and it is why we as \nAmericans understand that legal immigration is critically important for \nour future and a critical part of our heritage. The problem is that for \ntoo long both Republicans and Democrats have failed to enforce our \nimmigration laws, and the result is that today we have millions of \npeople living in the United States in violation of our immigration \nlaws. The other problem is that our legal immigration system is broken. \nIt is just broken. It doesn't reflect the 21st century. It doesn't take \ninto account special skills and talents. It doesn't allow us to attract \nthe world's best and brightest. In fact, it doesn't allow us to keep \nthe world's best and brightest, many of whom are students in our \nuniversities who learn from our best schools--that our taxpayers are \npaying for--and when they are done learning, we ask them to leave and \ntake what they have learned here and use it somewhere else to compete \nagainst us. It makes absolutely no sense.\n  Let me start by saying that if there wasn't a single illegal \nimmigrant in the United States, we would still have to do immigration \nreform because the immigration system is broken. I am pleased this bill \nwe have offered as a starting point reforms our legal immigration \nsystem in a very serious and profound way. It turns it into a merit-\nbased system that takes into account skills, talents, and job \nopportunities. It creates a system where agriculture can get the \nworkers into this country legally--by the way, workers who feed not \njust our families but the world. It allows our business community, in \ntimes of labor shortages where there is very low unemployment, to be \nable to provide for themselves the kind of guest and seasonal labor \nsome industries depend upon but to do so in a legal way. These reforms \nare significant.\n  By the way, in the high-tech industry, where we are not graduating \nnearly enough people in the high-tech fields--science, engineering, \ntechnology, and math--shame on us as a country that more of our \nchildren are not graduating with the skills they need to do those jobs. \nWe have to change that.\n  In the meantime there are thousands of jobs that are going overseas \nbecause we can't fill them here. These companies in the high-tech \nindustry are creating these jobs, but then they are taking them \nsomewhere else because that is where the workers are. It is pretty \nsimple: They go to a university, they interview the students, they find \nsomeone they like, and if they can't hire them in the United States \nthey will hire the same person in some other country. And that is \nterrible for America.\n  So this bill modernizes our illegal immigration system--something we \nwould have to do even if there wasn't a single illegal immigrant in the \nUnited States.\n  Next, the bill actually enforces our laws. It begins by creating a \nuniversal entry-exit tracking system.\n  You may not know this, but 40 percent of the people who are illegally \nin the United States didn't come illegally. They came on a visa, on a \npermit, and then the permit expired and they stayed--40 percent. We \nhave no idea who they are because we don't track people when they \nleave. We only track them when they come in. This bill will change \nthat.\n  We all understand the magnet for illegal immigration. It is jobs. It \nis pretty simple: There is a supply of people willing to work, there is \na supply of jobs on this side of the border we can't fill domestically, \nand those two are meeting. They are just not meeting legally.\n  This bill will require every employer in America to comply with E-\nVerify, to basically check the documents their workers are providing \nagainst the national data base that provides employment eligibility \ninformation. The next thing it does on enforcement is the border \nregion--let me say this about the border. The border is not just about \nimmigration. It is about national security. It is a national security \nrisk. The border must be secured.\n  This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to come up \nwith not one but two plans--a border plan and a fencing plan--to \nachieve 100 percent ability to be aware of the entire border and 90 \npercent apprehension, that we apprehend 9 out of 10 people who are \nillegally crossing. We give the Department of Homeland Security 5 years \nto reach that goal.\n  If they do not reach the goal in 5 years, then the issue is turned \nover to a commission made up of State officials, local officials on the \nborder to take care of the job themselves--and they will. If the \nFederal Government refuses to secure the border, the States of New \nMexico and Texas and Arizona and California, through their Governors \nand their leaders, will finish the job.\n  The next thing this bill does is deal with the millions of people who \nare in this country in violation of our immigration laws. Let me begin \nby saying this: No one has a right to illegally immigrate to the United \nStates. There is no legal right to be here illegally. As a sovereign \ncountry we have a right to enforce our immigration laws.\n  If we do something to accommodate those who are here illegally, we \ndon't do it because we legally have to. We do it for two reasons: \nFirst, because it is in the best interest of our country. When we \ndebate this immigration issue, we need to understand that when we talk \nabout millions of illegal immigrants, this is not a theory, this is a \nreality; they are here now. We are not talking about bringing these \npeople in; they are already here and they will be here for the rest of \ntheir lives. So we have to deal with that reality. It is in our \nnational interest to deal with that reality.\n  The second reason we are dealing with it is because that is who we \nare. We are a compassionate people. We are not going to deport 11 \nmillion people, so we have to deal with this. We believe we handled \nthis in a very professional and effective way.\n  If there are people in this country illegally who entered here before \nDecember 2011, they have to present themselves. They will undergo a \nbackground check. If they have committed serious crimes in the U.S., \nthey will be deported. If they have not, they will have to pay an \napplication fee, a fine. They will have to start paying taxes, and they \nwill receive a permit that will allow them to work in the United States \nand pay their taxes.\n  They will not qualify for any Federal benefits--no welfare, no \nObamaCare, no food stamps--but they will have a chance to work and will \nno longer have to hide. They are going to have to remain in that system \nfor 6 years, and then they have to go back and get their permit \nrenewed. It is not a permanent grant of a temporary status; it is a \ntemporary grant of a temporary status.\n  In 6 years they have to go back and apply again for this permit. When \nthey reapply, not only do they have to pay another fine and another \napplication fee, but they are going to have to prove they have been \npaying taxes the last 6 years and that they are gainfully employed in a \nway that means they are not going to wind up on public assistance.\n  If the border plans have been completed, if E-Verify is in place, if \nthe entry-exist system is in place, assuming their permit is renewed, \nafter 10 years has gone by, then the only thing that happens is they \nare given a chance to apply for a green card just like everybody else \ndoes, not a special process. They are at the back of the line. Everyone \nwho applied before them legally goes first.\n\n[[Page S2788]]\n\n  The only thing that happens after 10 years goes by and the border is \nsecured, E-Verify is in place and the entry-exit system is in place, we \ndon't give them anything. All they have now is the opportunity to apply \nfor a green card.\n  By the way, during the first 5 years of a green card under existing \nlaw, people don't qualify for Federal benefits either. The point is, \nthis is a reasonable way to deal with a real problem that faces our \ncountry.\n  The alternative is to do nothing, which leads me to one of the points \nthat people are using, and we will be talking a lot about this issue. \nOne of the arguments against this is how much money it is going to \ncost.\n  First of all, over the first 10 or 15 years, all these things about \nthe fence and the things we are doing are paid for in the bill. Beyond \nthat, as far as the economy of the United States--a couple points.\n  First of all, we can't compare this bill to nothing. We have to \ncompare it to what we have now, and what we have now is worse. What we \nhave now is costing our economy. We have people in this country \nillegally. They get sick, they go to the emergency room, and the \ntaxpayer pays for it.\n  We have people in this country who are having children who are U.S. \ncitizens and they go to our schools; they are driving on our streets \nwithout a driver's license, which means they have no car insurance, \nwhich means all of us have to pay more in car insurance as a result. \nThis is obviously not good for them, but it is not good for us.\n  What we have today is devastating and horrible for our economy. We \ncan't continue to have this. We have to fix this problem, and we have \nto fix it in a way that is fair to the people who have done it the \nright way and fix it in a way that makes sure this never ever happens \nagain. I believe the bill we are working on does that, and I look \nforward to the input that my colleagues have.\n\n  One more criticism I hear is that it is being rushed through. That is \njust not true. Just yesterday we voted on a series of amendments that I \nhad less than 12 hours to review, and these amendments dealt with a \nfundamental right to Second Amendment constitutional rights. This bill \nhas been online for 48 hours. The Committee on Judiciary would not even \nbegin to consider amendments to this bill until next month. People are \ngoing to have 3 to 4 weeks to review it. It is posted on my Web site. \nPeople can go on there now and see it. It will be available all these \nweeks. Then it is going to go through an extensive committee process. \nThen it will be brought here, hopefully, to the floor of the Senate \nwhere we can debate it openly as well.\n  I am not claiming the bill is perfect. I am sure it can be improved, \nand I hope my 99 other colleagues will work hard to improve it because \nwe have an opportunity to do something important.\n  My last point, and I address many of my fellow Americans who share my \ndeep commitment to upholding the Constitution of the United States, to \nlimiting the size and scope of government, to encouraging the free \nenterprise system as the best way to create economic opportunity. \nAmerica is a nation of immigrants, but both Republicans and Democrats \nhave failed to enforce our immigration laws and, as a result, we have \nmillions of people here illegally. We are not going to deport them. So \nlet's secure the border and let's identify these people. Let's have \nthem undergo a background check, get in the back of the line, pay a \nfine, and pay taxes. No Federal benefits.\n  We all wish we didn't have this problem, but leaving it the way it is \nis amnesty. We have to solve this problem, and I hope we will.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Flooding in Illinois\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I want to draw attention to the major \nflooding going on in Illinois at this moment, particularly in Chicago \nand its suburbs but not exclusively. It is affecting downstate as well.\n  Hundreds of families have been evacuated from their homes, and more \nthan 30,000 people are without power and we are experiencing a major \nstorm. The Rock, Fox, DuPage, Illinois, and Mississippi Rivers have \novertopped their banks, damaging hundreds, if not thousands, of homes \nand businesses. Several levees are near the breaking point.\n  In many areas, the flooding is so bad it exceeds what we saw during \nthe major floods in 2008 and in 1987. The ground is so saturated that a \nsinkhole in Chicago swallowed three cars this morning, and Libertyville \nHigh School has sunk a foot into the muddy soil.\n  More than 300 flights have been cancelled out of O'Hare and Midway \nAirports, and hundreds of schools in and around Chicago were closed \ntoday because of dangerously high water.\n  People along the Des Plains and Fox Rivers in Grundy, Kane, and \nLaSalle Counties have been evacuated--and the evacuations are ongoing.\n  More than 30 major roads in northeastern Illinois are closed due to \nflooding. Heavy rain has completely filled the large underground flood \ncontrol system known as the Deep Tunnel in Chicago. This project was \ndesigned to handle sewer backup problems and water pollution in Cook \nCounty. The Chicago River has swelled by 6 feet, triggering locks to \nopen and for the flow to be reversed back to Lake Michigan.\n  For the first time in recent memory, the DuPage County government is \nshut down because of flooding. All county government buildings, \nincluding the health department, are closed. Governor Patrick Quinn has \nissued a state of emergency for the entire State of Illinois. National \nGuardsmen are on hand helping to evacuate people and monitor water \nlevels and road closures. First responders are supplying sandbags, \npumps, life vests, generators, and other supplies along the threatened \nriverbanks. Sandbagging operations are ongoing in Boone, DeKalb, \nGrundy, Kane, McHenry, and Will Counties.\n  My office is in close contact with Mayor Nicholas Helmer of Prospect \nHeights--where many people have been evacuated. We are also working \nwith Mayor-elect Matthew Bogusz and the interim mayor, Mark Walsten of \nthe city of Des Plaines. They are working hard to make sure the \ncommunities are safe.\n  Communities all along the Mississippi River and the western part of \nthe State could be next in the flooding. Water is already rising in \nQuincy and the Quad Cities, and communities downstate--such as East St. \nLouis and Cairo--could see major flooding this weekend as storm runoff \nfrom up north works its way south.\n  My colleague Senator Mark Kirk and I are ready to help the affected \ncommunities in any way. We have cosigned a letter to the Governor to \nput in writing what we have said orally: We stand prepared to work with \nall of the Federal agencies available to help our State during this \nflooding challenge.\n  We understand they are doing everything possible at the local level. \nIf the situation continues to worsen, there may be need for Federal \nassistance. Senator Kirk and I will work together on a bipartisan basis \nto make sure it is there. My thoughts are with the people and families \naffected by floodwaters in Illinois, especially those who had to leave \ntheir homes. I am particularly grateful for the people who are working \naround the clock to control these rivers. I have spoken to John Monken, \nDirector of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency, and am monitoring \nthe efforts on a minute-by-minute basis. I will continue to work with \nFederal, State, and local officials to make sure vital resources are \nmade available for the flood control effort.\n  Madam President, a short time ago there was a press conference that \nwas historic in nature. Eight Senators, four Democrats and four \nRepublicans, came together to announce the introduction of an \nimmigration bill. It is a bill we have worked on for months. The four \nSenators on the Democratic side are Senator Schumer, Senator Menendez, \nSenator Bennet of Colorado, and myself; on the Republican side, Senator \nMcCain, Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, Senator \nMarco Rubio of Florida.\n  When you put the eight of us in a room you have the full political \nspectrum in the Senate. But we decided as a group to try to do our best \nto write\n\n[[Page S2789]]\n\na law to deal with the immigration challenge in America. It is a \nsubstantial challenge. America's immigration system is badly, badly \nbroken. I say that because we estimate there are 11 million people \nliving in this country who are undocumented. They are people who get up \nand go to work every day. They may have picked the fruits you put on \nyour cereal this morning. They could be cleaning your room in the hotel \nyou stopped in in Chicago. They could be taking care of your mother in \nthe nursing home this evening. They are spread across the economy. They \nare hard-working people. Most immigrants are. But they are \nundocumented. They have no country. About half of them are here because \nthey came judicially as visitors or college students and they stayed. \nThey are here illegally, there is no question about it. They are \nundocumented. The question we asked ourselves over and over for the \nlast many years is, What are we going to do?\n  In the last Presidential campaign, Governor Romney said they should \nself-deport themselves, they should leave. That is not going to happen. \nIt may be good campaign rhetoric but it doesn't reflect reality. What \nyou find when you get to know the undocumented is they do not live in \nhouses filled with undocumented people. It is not uncommon to find that \ndad is a citizen, the children were born here and they are citizens, it \nis mom who is undocumented. These stories are repeated over and over.\n  So the eight of us sat down and said: What are we going to do to deal \nwith this and what are we going to do to deal with the problem this \ncreates in the economy? Here is what it is. It is not a matter of 11 \nmillion people working in the economy undocumented. It is the fact that \nthey end up taking jobs and being paid the lowest possible wages, so \ntheir work depresses wages.\n  In addition, in most cases--many cases, I should say--they are being \npaid in cash. Their employers are not paying into unemployment, workers \ncompensation, Social Security, Medicare. They are off the books. That \ndoesn't help our country if they are not paying taxes and if their \nwages are so cheap and so low it hurts the jobs of American workers.\n  In addition, many of these workers are mistreated. It is not unusual \nfor me to hear that in Chicago a group of workers worked a whole week \nand then their boss said: Oh, the money didn't come through. We are not \ngoing to pay you. What are they supposed to do, call the police? Go to \ncourt? They are undocumented. There are abuses that take place when it \ncomes to these workers and it does not help the overall economy.\n  There are other issues as well. About 12 years ago I got a phone call \nin my office from the Merit Music Program in Chicago, which offers to \nkids, low-income-family kids, musical instruments and instruction. And \n100 percent of these kids end up going to college. One of them, Tereza \nLee, was Korean and very good playing the concert piano. She was \naccepted at Julliard and the Manhattan Conservatory of Music, which was \namazing. She came from such a poor family that many times she would go \nto school and go through the trash basket to find uneaten food to try \nto get through the day. But, boy, was she good at a piano, and it was \nrecognized. When she went to fill out the application to go to school \nthere was a box that said nationality, citizenship. She said to mom, \nWhat do I put here? Her mom said, I don't know. We brought you in on a \nvisitors visa at the age of 2 and we never did anything. So she said we \nbetter call Durbin's office. They called my office and we checked into \nit. The law is very clear. She is not documented, she is not a citizen, \nand she needs to leave America for 10 years and see if she can get back \nin, get a green card to come back--10 years. This girl was 18 years \nold. She had never done anything wrong. She came here at the age of 2.\n  I put in this bill called the DREAM Act and it said if you, like \nTereza Lee, came here, no fault of your own, no criminal record, \nfinished high school, we will give you a chance. Go to college, enlist \nin the military, and we will let you become a citizen someday soon.\n  The DREAM Act has been out there for 12 years and didn't pass but we \nstill have hundreds of thousands of these young people. Half a million \nof them have signed up under the President's Executive order not to be \ndeported if they are eligible for the DREAM Act. There are many more \nout there. That is one of the unresolved issues in our immigration \nsystem. I could go on and give you volumes of problems with the current \nimmigration system in America.\n  We decided to sit down and do something about it. In the first \nmeeting we had, the Republicam Senators, Senator McCain, Senator Flake \nfrom Arizona, as well as Senator Graham and Senator Rubio, said the \nfirst item on the agenda: Fix the border. It does us no good to deal \nwith immigration problems within the country if we do not deal with the \nflow of people into the country.\n\n  The border is strong today, stronger than it has ever been in 40 \nyears. But there are weaker parts. There are about nine different \nsections of our southern border and about three of them are \nproblematic. Six are pretty strong. So we agreed, let's make sure the \nnine sections of the border have the investment they need to be as \nstrong as possible. Then let's do more. Let's create a computer system, \nexpand the one we have called E-Verify so if you go to apply for a job \nin America and you are asked to show a picture ID, such as your \ndriver's license, the employer can enter the information into a \ncomputer right at work and up pops a picture which should match your \npicture on the license. If it matches, you can be employed; you are \nhere legally. If it does not match, there is a question, you may not be \nemployed. So E-Verify will make sure that in the workplace you have to \nbe part of the system. You have to be registered in America.\n  The third element involves visitors visas. We give a lot of people an \nopportunity to visit this great country from all over the world. Some \nof them never go home and we don't know it. We know they came in; we \ncheck that. But we don't know if they ever left. We are finally going \nto finish that system so we know, we have information collected not \nonly when they enter, when they leave, and if they overstay, we can go \nafter them. So those things which we debated and included in our \nimmigration bill deal with the draw of people into America, the border, \nemployment, visitors visas.\n  Then we asked, what to do with the 11 million people? What to do \nrealistically and honestly. Here is what we suggested in the bipartisan \nbill we have introduced. We said first you have to step forward and \nregister with the government. You have lived in the shadows. You have \nalways feared a knock on the door and deportation. Now come forward. If \nyou come forward and register, we will put you through a criminal \nbackground check. If you have a serious crime in your background, you \nare finished, we don't want you, goodbye. If you do not, we will go \nforward. We will give you a chance to register with the government, pay \nyour taxes, pay a fine, make it clear you are learning English and \nworking in America. If you do that, you can stay here legally and you \ncan work here legally. You can even travel outside the country legally \nand come back. It is a provisional recognition of an opportunity for \nlegalization. At the end of 10 years, after you paid the fines, after \nyou have been reviewed on a regular basis, you will have a chance to \nget a green card and move toward citizenship over a 3-year period of \ntime.\n  This is basically the system, a system that strengthens the border \nand creates a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people. And, as far \nas the DREAM Act I mentioned earlier, this is the strongest version of \nthe DREAM Act of any I have introduced, any I have proposed on the \nfloor of the Senate in the last 12 years. It is going to give these \nyoung people a chance.\n  There was a young woman here at the press conference named Tolu \nOlubumai. She was born in Nigeria. She came here at an early age and \nwent through high school and then went through college. She received a \nchemical engineering degree from a prestigious Virginia university. \nThat was 10 years ago. She has never been able to work 1 day as an \nengineer, despite her talent, because she can't get licensed. She is \nundocumented. She deserved a chance. She will get a chance under this \nbill, under the DREAM Act, as she should.\n\n[[Page S2790]]\n\n  I can go through stories--I have told about 54 different ones on the \nfloor of the Senate--of young people in her circumstances, came here as \nkids, knew no other country. As Bob Menendez often says, pledged \nallegiance to the flag every day in the classroom, only knows our \nnational anthem. They have no country. They will have a chance because \nof this bill.\n  There are other parts of this bill that are important too. When it \ncomes to employment, the first rule I insisted on, we all insisted on, \nwas that any job opening had to be offered to an American worker first. \nThat is in every part of this bill, because we still have people \nunemployed and they should have first priority on any job opening. But \nif the job can't be filled--and let's be honest, some of these jobs \nAmericans are not standing in line for, particularly agricultural \nworkers, backbreaking work of picking fruits and vegetables. There are \nmany of these jobs that will go unfilled unless migrant workers, for \nexample, agricultural workers, come to fill them. So what we say is \nbasically offer the job to an American first at a wage that is the \nprevailing wage, average wage in the industry. If it goes unfilled, \nthen a foreign worker has an opportunity--only if the unemployment rate \nin this country or in the region where the person works is below 8.5 \npercent. So we want to make sure American workers have the first \nchance.\n  Then what to do about the extraordinarily educated and talented \npeople who can make a difference in the American economy? It was 6 or 8 \nyears ago when I spoke to the Illinois Institute of Technology \ncommencement. It was at the Chicago Theater on State Street in the city \nof Chicago. It was a happy day. All of these graduates from the \nprestigious Institute of Technology were getting their chance. They \nwent through the baccalaureate degrees and they were pretty diverse. \nBut then, when they got into the advanced degrees, the master's degrees \nand Ph.D.s, it took a little longer because it was tough to pronounce \nall of the names from the South Asian continent, India and places \nnearby. These are graduates, foreign students, admitted in the United \nStates, trained in the United States, receiving their degrees from this \nprestigious institution, and the next thing we did after handing them \ntheir diploma is, figuratively, gave them a roadmap to show them how to \nleave America, to take their talents and everything they learned to go \nsomeplace else to compete with American business.\n  We are going to change that. If foreign students come here and are \neducated here and have skills we need in our economy and can help \ncreate jobs and grow our businesses, we are going to give them that \nchance with a green card. That makes sense. They can expand the \neconomy. Some of the major high-tech corporations in America today were \nactually created by immigrants to this country who came here because \nthey loved the freedom, the opportunity no other country can offer. We \nhave to give more just like them a chance to build tomorrow's Intel, \ntomorrow's Google, and they will do it and create American jobs in the \nprocess.\n  We want the United States to be a magnet for this kind of job \ncreation. We also want the United States to have more homegrown \nengineers ourselves. Maria Cantwell brought this up at our Senate \nluncheon this afternoon and I told her it was an issue I felt strongly \nabout, not only making sure we have the talent we need but that we grow \nthe talent we need--improve our schools, focus on the STEM subjects--\nscience, technology, engineering, mathematics--and bring more American \nstudents to the point where they can make a good living using those \nskills. That is part of our responsibility as well.\n  There are many aspects to this bill, immigration reform, that will \ncome tomorrow before the Senate Judiciary Committee. I will be there. \nWe will be having a hearing to discuss it on Friday, then again on \nMonday. Then soon after, after we come back from our break in the first \npart of May, we will have an actual markup of the bill in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  The bill has been filed now. It is available for everyone to read. We \nare not trying to push anything through in a hurry. It will be \ndiscussed, debated, and amendments will be offered in the committee and \non the floor, as they should be. At the end of the day, it gives us a \nchance to make sure we fix this broken immigration system in this \ncountry.\n\n  I come to this debate with some personal history. It was in 1911 when \nmy mother was carried off a ship in the Baltimore Harbor. My \ngrandmother, whom I never met, brought my mother and her brother and \nsister over from Lithuania. They were immigrants to America in 1911. \nSomehow or another--although they could not speak English--they found \nthe right train, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and took that train \nto St. Louis.\n  They got off the train when they came to a town called East St. \nLouis, IL, where my grandfather was waiting. That immigrant family made \na home there, and that is where I was born and grew up.\n  My mother was an immigrant to this country, a naturalized citizen, \nand I am first-generation American. I am blessed to be standing on the \nfloor of the Senate. That is my story, that is my family, but that is \nalso the American story. Every single one of us has a version of that \nstory. It may not be your parents or grandparents, but go back far \nenough and you will find a story just like that in your background.\n  I said many times on the floor of the Senate that I had the good \nfortune to go back to my mother's village in Lithuania, Jurbaricas, \nwhich is near Kaunas. My mother never made it back to her village.\n  When I got there, I asked the people in that village what was left \nfrom the time my mother was there in 1911. They said the Catholic \nChurch where she was baptized was still there as well as an old well in \nthe center of town that everybody used for water. They said, your \nfamily must have used it.\n  I took a look at the old well, and I could not even pick it out now \nbecause of all the traffic circles around it and everything. I thought \nabout that moment when my grandparents said to their relatives and \nfriends: We have an announcement. We are leaving. We are picking up \neverybody and going to America. We are going to a place called East St. \nLouis, IL, because there are some Lithuanians there from this area who \nfound work.\n  Stanley Yochiss, who was the pharmacist and druggist in that area, \nwas kind of like the Godfather. People who didn't trust the local banks \nwould leave their money with Stanley. The Lithuanian community, similar \nto many communities, worked the toughest jobs in the packing houses, \nsteel mills, and jobs such as that.\n  I often thought about that meeting my grandparents had when they \ncalled in their relatives and friends and what might have happened \nafterward when they left. As they were walking away from my \ngrandparents' home, I bet one of them said to the other: Can you \nbelieve this? The Kuticaite family is leaving. They are going to \nAmerica. They don't even speak English. They are leaving their home, \ntheir church, all their relatives and friends, the dog, the cat, and \nchickens. They are all leaving. They will be back. This will not work. \nThey never looked back.\n  Repeat that story millions of times and we have the story of America. \nWe have the story of people who came to this country and have somewhere \ndeep in their DNA this appetite and thirst for a better life. They were \nwilling to risk everything for it to get to this country, and it still \nhappens.\n  We hear about people walking across the desert on their way to \nAmerica and dying in Arizona and Texas. We hear of all the dangerous \nthings they do to get to this country. That is what is great about \nAmerica and that is what is great about Americans and what is in our \nDNA as a people. We should never forget how important immigration is to \nus. Those who criticize immigrants have forgotten where they came from. \nThose who criticize immigrants don't realize the diversity of America, \nthe talent of America, the drive of America is all about immigration. \nWe have to control it. We have to make sure it is done legally and done \nin a systematic way. We cannot absorb everybody who wants to come here. \nBut by bringing in new blood to America, we revitalize the American \ndream every single generation.\n  This bill is an important one. We have not done anything to \nimmigration\n\n[[Page S2791]]\n\nin 25 years, and it shows. We have a mess in this country, and it is \ntime to straighten it out.\n  Eight Senators produced a bill--four Democrats, four Republicans. I \nthink the bill is balanced and should be debated and considered. I hope \nit passes. I hope the day comes soon when it is signed into law by the \nPresident, who fully supports comprehensive immigration reform.\n  I said today at the press conference that I want to be at at least \none of the naturalization ceremonies when my DREAMers get a chance to \nbecome part of the only country they have ever called home. They are \ngoing to make this a better and stronger nation, and they are part of \nour citizenry.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Celebrating U.S. Air Force Reserve 65th Birthday\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, this year marks the 65th anniversary of \nthe Air Force Reserve, created by President Harry S. Truman on April \n14, 1948.\n  Since the founding of the United States, citizens have answered the \ncall to arms, accomplished their mission with professionalism and \nhonor, and returned to their civilian lives to await the next call to \nserve.\n  Truman envisioned a new Reserve component to continue this tradition \nof service--being ready when called upon--that was founded by the Army \nAir Service reservists of the First World War who flew wood and canvas \nbi-planes.\n  The forerunner of our modern Air Force Reserve was authorized by the \nNational Defense Act of 1916. Today, Air Force reservists, known as \ncitizen airmen, perform leading roles in military operations, \nhumanitarian crises, and disaster relief around the globe. The Air \nForce Reserve consists of officers, enlisted, and civil servants who \nare tasked by law to fill the needs of the Armed Forces wherever \nnecessary. More than 860,000 people make up the Ready, Standby, \nRetired, and Active-Duty Retired Reserve. This includes 70,000 selected \nreservists who are ready now and serve on the frontlines of daily \nmilitary operations around the globe.\n  The creation of the Air Force Reserve followed the birth of the Air \nForce itself by about 7 months earlier on September 18, 1947. The newly \ncreated Air Force had gained its independence from the Army, tracing \nits roots back to the Aeronautical Division of the U.S. Army's Office \nof the Chief Signal Officer, which took charge of military balloons and \nair machines in 1907.\n  Ten years later the first two Air Reserve units were mobilized, and \none of them, the first Aero Reserve Squadron from Mineola, NY, deployed \nto France as the United States entered World War I in 1917. The new Air \nService Reserve program provided the war effort with about 10,000 \npilots who had graduated from civilian and military flying schools.\n  Later, reservists played a critical role in World War II when 1,500 \nReserve pilots, along with 1,300 nonrated officers and 400 enlisted \nairmen, augmented the Army Air Corps in the war's early days. This \nincluded the legendary Jimmy Doolittle, who was ordered to Active Duty \nto work in Detroit to convert automobile manufacturing plants into \naircraft factories and later went on to lead Doolittle's Raiders, the \nfirst American bombing attack on the Japanese mainland.\n  After World War II ended, the young Air Force Reserve was barely 2 \nyears old when it mobilized nearly 147,000 reservists for the Korean \nWar.\n  In the 1960s five Air Force Reserve C-124 aircraft units, along with \n5,613 reservists, were mobilized for a year to support the Berlin \ncrisis. By 1962 an additional mobilization of 14,220 reservists and 422 \naircraft were supporting operations during the Cuban missile crisis.\n  During the Vietnam War, the Air Force Reserve provided strategic \nairlift as well as counterinsurgency, close air support, tactical \nmobility, interdiction, rescue and recovery, intelligence, medical, \nmaintenance, aerial port and air superiority until U.S. involvement \nended in 1973.\n  As our Nation entered a period of peace for the next few years, the \nAir Force Reserve periodically engaged in emergency response missions. \nThis included the rescue of American students from Grenada in 1983, \naerial refueling of strike aircraft conducting the raid on Libya in \n1986, and operations to oust Panamanian dictator Manual Noriega in 1989 \nthrough 1990. Air Force reservists also supported humanitarian and \ndisaster relief efforts, including resupply and evacuation missions in \nthe aftermath of Hurricane Hugo in 1989. All the while, they stood \nready to answer the call to arms as our Nation entered the final days \nof the Cold War.\n  More than 23 years of continuous combat operations began with \nOperation Desert Shield in response to Saddam Hussein's invasion of \nKuwait in 1990. In the aftermath of coalition victory, Air Force \nreservists continued to enforce no-fly zones over northern and southern \nIraq while also performing humanitarian relief missions to assist \ndisplaced Iraqi Kurds.\n  In 1993 Air Force Reserve tanker, mobility, and fighter units began \noperations in Bosnia, and in 1999 they were also supporting Operation \nAllied Force over Serbia and Kosovo.\n  When terrorists attacked the United States on September 11, 2001, Air \nForce reservists responded in full force. Air Force Reserve F-16 \nfighter airplanes flew combat air patrols to protect American cities, \nwhile KC-135 tankers and AWACS aircraft supported security efforts.\n  In October 2001 Operation Enduring Freedom began as U.S. military \nforces entered Afghanistan to combat the Taliban and terrorist \nsanctuaries. In March 2003 Operation Iraqi Freedom began in order to \nend Saddam Hussein's regime. Air Force Reserve units and reservists \nplayed key roles in all combat operations as Air Force Reserve MC-130 \nCombat Talon aircraft became the first fixed-wing aircraft to penetrate \nAfghan airspace while Air Force Reserve F-16 crews performed the first \ncombat missions.\n  In recent years citizen airmen have supported every Air Force core \nfunction and every combatant commander around the world. Air Force \nreservists were engaged in surge operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThey supported combat and humanitarian missions in Haiti, Libya, Japan, \nMali, and the Horn of Africa. Also, they provided national disaster \nrelief at home in the United States after Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, \nthe gulf oil spill, and the wildfires in the Western States.\n  Throughout their history, citizen airmen have volunteered \nunconditionally, demonstrating without fail that they were ready when \nneeded. Since inception in 1948, the Air Force Reserve has evolved from \na unit-mobilization-only force into an operational reserve that \nparticipates in missions around the globe. From its headquarters at \nRobins Air Force Base in my home State of Georgia, the Air Force \nReserve serves with distinction to provide for our national security on \na daily basis. Spanning 6\\1/2\\ decades--with the last 2 decades of \ncontinuous combat--the Air Force Reserve has fulfilled the promise of \nearly air pioneers and exceeded the potential foretold by the \nvisionaries who created it.\n\n  Congratulations to all citizen airmen, past, present, and future, on \nthe 65th anniversary of the U.S. Air Force Reserve.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Big Sky Honor Flight\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, on April 21, 88 World War II veterans from \nMontana will be visiting our Nation's Capital.\n\n[[Page S2792]]\n\n  With a great deal of honor and respect, I extend a hearty Montana \nwelcome to each and every one of them. Together they will visit the \nWorld War II Memorial and share stories about their service. This \njourney will no doubt bring about a lot of memories, and I hope it will \ngive them a deep sense of pride as well.\n  What they achieved together seven decades ago was remarkable. The \nmemorial is a testament to the fact a grateful nation will never forget \nwhat they did or what they sacrificed. To us, they are the ``greatest \ngeneration.'' They left the comforts of their family and their \ncommunities to confront evil from Iwo Jima to Bastogne.\n  Together they won the war in the Pacific by defeating an empire and \nliberating the continent by destroying Hitler and the Nazis. To them, \nthey were simply doing their jobs. They enlisted in unprecedented \nnumbers to defend our freedoms and our values. They represented the \nvery best of us and made us proud. From a young age, I remember playing \nthe bugle at the memorial services of veterans of the first two World \nWars. It instilled in me a profound sense of respect which will be with \nme forever.\n  Honoring the service of every generation of American veterans is a \nMontana value. I deeply appreciate the work of the Big Sky Honor \nFlight, the nonprofit organization which made this trip possible.\n  To the World War II veterans making the trip, I salute you and \nwelcome you to our Nation's Capital. We will always be grateful, and we \nwill never forget your service or your sacrifice.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business for \nup to 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Fair Minimum Wage Act\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Seventy-five years ago, President Roosevelt signed the \nFair Labor Standards Act. This legislation, proposed by Senator Hugo \nBlack in 1932, ultimately ensured American workers would receive a \nminimum wage, reasonable work hours, and an end to child labor.\n  President Roosevelt led our country out of the worst economic climate \nwe have ever faced. He led us to decades of prosperity by ensuring hard \nwork in our Nation is met with two fundamental American rights--fair \nwages and decent working conditions.\n  In the 20th century, the minimum wage lifted millions of Americans \nfrom poverty and allowed them to begin the step toward joining the \nmiddle class. In the 21st century a fair livable minimum wage can \ncontinue moving our country forward.\n  Even as corporate executives and Wall Street banks are earning record \nprofits, too many families are struggling. Americans who work hard and \nplay by the rules should be able to take care of their families. Too \nmany people in my home State, in places such as Youngstown, Lorain, \nPortsmouth, and Norwood are working harder than ever and barely getting \nby.\n  Nearly 1.3 million Ohioans in places such as Chillicothe and \nMansfield work in a minimum wage job. Working full time in a minimum \nwage job in Ohio pays about $16,000 per year because our minimum wage \nis a bit higher. The Federal minimum wage today pays only $15,000 per \nyear, $3,000 below the poverty level for a family of three.\n  It is not much to live on for families trying to put food on the \ntable, fill a gas tank, send their children to school or provide a safe \nplace for them to live. The minimum wage in this country should be a \nlivable wage.\n  This is why I am fighting to pass the Fair Minimum Wage Act. It would \nraise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour in three 95-cent increments, \nthen provide for automatic annual increases linked to changes in the \ncost of living.\n  The bill would also gradually raise the minimum wage for tipped \nworkers for the first time in 20 years. The tip minimum wage now stands \nat $2.13 an hour. This bill would increase it to 70 percent of the \nregular minimum wage.\n\n  More than 1.2 million people in Ohio would receive a raise because of \nour bill. Millions of people around the country in places such as \nHelena, Butte, and Billings would have an increase in their standard of \nliving.\n  The vast majority of minimum wage earners, despite what some in this \nbody say--some 88 percent--are adult workers. They are not 16- and 17-\nyear-old high school students. They are 18 and above, with many of them \nsupporting families. More than half are women.\n  Eighteen million children, nearly one-quarter of all American \nchildren, have parents who would receive a raise. Over the past 2 \nweeks, I have met with people in my home State who earn low wages, and \nI listened to their stories.\n  Ms. Walter, a server from Youngstown in northeast Ohio, struggled to \nraise three boys as a single mother.\n  Ms. Day, a cake decorator from Bowling Green, works two jobs because \nthe salary of one isn't enough to provide for her two children. She \nsays she doesn't need a lot but just a little more.\n  This bill matters. It matters for the grandmother who works an \nevening shift at a restaurant to enable her to care for her \ngrandchildren during the day. It matters for the elder care worker who \ntakes two buses to work, and it matters for all of the working-class \nfamilies who work hard and play by the rules. It is not only about the \nfamilies who will be directly affected.\n  Increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour will also help the \neconomy. It will increase GDP by more than $30 billion over the course \nof 3 years as workers spend their raises in local businesses and \ncommunities. Opponents to the increase in minimum wage say people will \nnot hire; it will cost jobs.\n  It is actually the opposite. This economic activity created by more \nspending in communities as a result of more money in minimum wage \nearners' pockets would generate 140,000 new jobs over these 3 years. \nThis is why business owners support raising the minimum wage.\n  The owners of Brothers Printing and Synergistic Systems in the \nCleveland area both pay their workers more than the minimum wage. It \nmeans they have less turnover. It means their workers have a better \nstandard of living, and it helps their community. They do this because \nit is the right thing to do. It helps them keep their best employees \nand strengthens their businesses and their commitment. Plain and \nsimple, ensuring a fair wage is good for America's families. It is good \nfor America's economy.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, fifty years ago, when Bob Butler was sworn \nin as mayor of Marion, IL, the town was literally on fire.\n  Just outside city hall, one of the largest fires in the city's \nhistory was raging.\n  It may not have been, as Mayor Butler has described it, an \n``auspicious''\n\n[[Page S2793]]\n\nstart I will go a little farther and call it what it was: a baptism by \nfire. But through his five decades of thoughtful leadership, he has \nalways been devoted to the city he loves and has never stopped working \nto improve the lives of its residents.\n  During his time as mayor, the local population has increased, area \nbusinesses have grown, and the economy has expanded.\n  And along the way, some have reported, Bob Butler became the longest-\nserving currently active mayor in America.\n  After first being elected, a fire wasn't the only problem he had to \ndeal with he also had to dig the city out of financial trouble.\n  Under Mayor Butler's guidance, Marion got itself back in the black \nand began building a platform to allow for future growth.\n  And then, a few years later, another disaster hit. A tornado tore \nthrough the city, killing 10 and injuring hundreds including the Mayor \nand leaving tens of millions of dollars of damage.\n  After crawling out of his car, which had been thrown 300 feet and \nturned upside down, Mayor Butler showed the sort of resilience we don't \nsee much anymore and dove headfirst into recovery efforts.\n  His efforts, along with those of many others, helped lead to a boom \nin economic and residential development that we still see effects of \ntoday.\n  Without Mayor Butler's leadership, Marion would look very different \nthan it does now. His touch can be seen on everything from the civic \ncenter to the city's businesses to the local minor league team, the \nMiners.\n  His leadership helped guide Marion through many trying experiences, \nand the city's voters kept their faith in Bob Butler. He has served \nthem well each and every year.\n  Despite all of his hard work and his clear record of results, Mayor \nButler has always remained humble.\n  He may be mayor, but he always gives credit to the people of Marion \nfor their city's success.\n  This week, the people of Marion are gave some credit back to Mayor \nButler.\n  They honored his five decades of good work with a life-size bronze \nstatue at the site where that fire once raged so many years ago--in \nTower Square, just across from city hall.\n  I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Mayor Butler and his family \nfor this impressive achievement and wish him the best when he enters \nretirement at the end of this term.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/18/senate-section/article/S2793-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO PASTOR JOSEPH R. JORDAN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in my hometown and in cities and towns \nacross this country, houses of worship and the men and women who lead \nthem care for the spiritual needs of our people. But they do more. They \nare pillars of neighborhoods. They minister to the sick in body or \nspirit. They feed the hungry. They help resolve the lamentable but all-\ntoo-human divisions in our communities.\n  This has been the role of Corinthian Baptist Church in Hamtramck, MI, \nand its pastor, the Rev. Dr. Joseph R. Jordan, who will in a few days \nbe honored for leadership and community spirit. Under Pastor Jordan's \nleadership, Corinthian Baptist has been a rock for its community. \nPastor Jordan is a thoughtful and respected shepherd of his flock. He \nand the church are actively engaged in community service, helping to \nfight hunger and sickness in Hamtramck and Detroit. His service and \nleadership include serving on the board of trustees of Henry Ford \nHealth System, one of the Nation's largest medical service providers.\n  Pastor Jordan has been a tireless seeker of justice. Nothing \nexemplifies this better than his long years of work and advocacy to \nhelp resolve a housing discrimination case that dates back to the \n1960s, the resolution of which has taken decades. Pastor Jordan and \nothers never gave up on their community or on the idea of justice, and \nthanks to the hard work of many, and despite significant challenges, \nthe case has been resolved.\n  I should note that I am among the many who have benefitted from \nPastor Jordan's wisdom and leadership. Over the years, I have valued \nhis friendship and his counsel. And so I am pleased that the city of \nHamtramck will, on April 28, rename a section of Caniff Street, \nincluding the block on which Corinthian Baptist sits. It will be known \nas Rev. Dr. Joseph R. Jordan Street. I join Pastor Jordan's many \nfriends in congratulating him for this honor, and I personally thank \nhim for his decades of service to his church and his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/18/senate-section/article/S2793-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WORLD WAR II VETERANS VISIT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a very important event \nthat will be occurring this Sunday and Monday. About 90 World War II \nveterans from Montana will take part in the ``Big Sky Honor Flight,'' \nand come to Washington, D.C. to visit their monument--the WWII \nMemorial.\n  Their trip is hosted by the Big Sky Honor Flight program. The mission \nis to recognize American Veterans for their sacrifices and achievements \nby flying them to Washington, D.C., to see their memorials at no cost. \nThe program, which has already sent 184 Montana veterans to visit the \nmemorials, is generously funded by businesses, student groups, and \nfolks all across Montana.\n  These veterans come from all parts of our great State, and while they \nare in Washington, they will see the WWII Memorial and other monuments, \nenjoy a banquet honoring their service to the country, and fly home the \nnext day.\n  This is a special two days for this group of heroes, but it is also a \ntime to give thanks for the courage and sacrifice of all our veterans \nand servicemembers. It is a time to reflect on the sacrifices made by \nthose who fought on the front in Europe, on the battlefields of Korea, \nin the jungles of Vietnam, the deserts of Iraq, and those who are \ncurrently fighting in the mountains of Afghanistan. We must not forget \ntheir sacrifices.\n  I am so pleased I will be able to meet with these courageous \nMontanans.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize David J. \nThatcher, a remarkable Montanan and American. On April 18, 1942, \nThatcher was one of 80 Doolittle Raiders who carried out the first air \nraid on Japan during World War II. The unit was named for their \ncommander, Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle, who planned and led the mission \nthat dealt a devastating psychological blow to the Japanese Empire in \nthe wake of the Pearl Harbor attacks.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in honoring Mr. Thatcher \nand his comrades for their heroic deeds, carried out 71 years ago \ntoday.\n  Staff Sergeant Thatcher was born on July 31, 1921 in Bridger, MT and \nentered the Army in December 1940. He volunteered for the secret \nmission that later became known as the Doolittle Raid and was assigned \nas an engineer/gunner to Crew 7 of the ``Ruptured Duck.''\n  On April 18, 1942, the Doolittle Raiders launched their B-25 bombers \noff the USS Hornet aircraft carrier, 250 miles\n\n[[Page S2794]]\n\nfurther out than planned because they had been discovered by a Japanese \nfishing boat. During their approach to Tokyo, the crew of the \n``Ruptured Duck'' spotted a formation of enemy planes, but because of \ntheir special training and unique flying tactics, the Japanese \nformation never detected the ``Ruptured Duck.'' Crew 7 successfully \nbombed the Nippon Steel Factory in Tokyo.\n  Following their airstrikes, all 16 aircraft either ditched at sea or \ncrash landed because they did not have enough fuel to make it to their \nintended landing sites on the Chinese mainland. The commander of Crew \n7, LT T.W. Lawson, attempted to land the ``Ruptured Duck'' on a beach, \nbut instead struck the water a quarter mile off the Chinese coastline. \nThe crew was forced to swim to shore.\n  Staff Sergeant Thatcher, the only member of Crew 7 who was unharmed, \ncared for the injured until the Chinese arrived to help. Sadly, 11 \nDoolittle Raiders were killed or captured by the Japanese during the \nraid but, remarkably, 69 of them were eventually rescued.\n  Staff Sergeant Thatcher went on to serve in England and became an \nengineer/gunner on a B-26 for the invasion of North Africa. He was \ndischarged from the service on July 11, 1945.\n  For his gallantry in action during the raid on Japan, he received the \nSilver Star. He was also awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the \nAir Medal with four Oak Leaf Clusters, along with the Chinese Army, \nNavy, and Air Corps Medal, Class A, 1st Grade.\n  Today, I would like to honor the four courageous Doolittle Raiders \nwho remain with us: Richard E. Cole, Robert L. Hite, Edward J. Saylor \nand David J. Thatcher.\n  Let us also take a moment to honor the 76 others who have passed.\n  The success of the Doolittle Raid marked a turning point in the war. \nIt provided a morale boost for the United States and it proved to the \nJapanese people that they were no longer invulnerable.\n  The Doolittle Raiders have earned a hallowed place in our American \nhistory, and today I commend Mr. Thatcher and his comrades for their \ncourage and sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/18/senate-section/article/S2794-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO REAR ADMIRAL ROY A.

Nash, who will retire on May 2, 2013, as the \nCommander of the Eighth Coast Guard District of New Orleans.\n  Since graduating from the Coast Guard Academy in 1979, Rear Admiral \nNash has served in a variety of operational and staff assignments \nduring his 34 years of service. A few of his assignments during his \nyears with the Coast Guard include serving as the Special Assistant to \nthe Deputy Commandant for Operations, Deputy Director of the National \nMaritime Intelligence Center, Commander of the Coast Guard Sector \nSoutheastern New England, Commanding Officer of the Coast Guard Marine \nSafety Center, and Commanding Officer of Marine Safety in Portland, ME.\n  Rear Admiral Nash will retire as the Commander of the Eighth Coast \nGuard District in New Orleans, where he was responsible for Coast Guard \noperations that span 26 States, including over 1,200 miles of coastline \nand 10,300 miles of inland waterways. Prior to this assignment, Rear \nAdmiral Nash served as the Deputy Federal On-Scene Coordinator for the \nDeepwater Horizon oilspill response. In this capacity, Rear Admiral \nNash joined more than 40,000 responders to provide needed relief for \ncitizens, wildlife, and the environment. His outstanding leadership in \nthese operations played an integral role in resolving the unparalleled \nproblems posed by the ongoing spill.\n  Rear Admiral Nash's illustrious career includes many military \ndecorations. Among them are the Legion of Merit, Coast Guard \nMeritorious Service Medal, Coast Guard Commendation Medal, and Coast \nGuard Achievement Medal.

Every day, hundreds of Toledoans \ntake public transit to work, to the doctor's office, to school.\n  As a driver for the Toledo Area Regional Transit Authority with some \n16 years of experience, Ms. Mitchell keeps a watchful eye--for children \nchasing balls into the street, for passersby crossing busy roads in \nfront of on-coming traffic. So, on an afternoon in March, Ms. Mitchell \ndid not hesitate to act as she witnessed a woman attempting to commit \nsuicide along the bus route. Ms. Mitchell immediately stopped her bus \nand ran to the woman's aid.\n  Bus passengers and Corey Bush, an off-duty police officer from a \nneighboring jurisdiction, also ran to help as Ms. Mitchell performed \nCPR to keep the woman alive before emergency responders arrived. \nAccording to the Toledo Police Department, the victim would have died \nif not for Ms. Mitchell's quick actions.\n  A police officer responding to the incident entered the woman's home \nand found a man unconscious. Both individuals were taken to Mercy St. \nVincent Medical Center--and they are alive today.\n  Ms. Mitchell and her fellow citizens are heroes whose actions saved a \nlife, potentially two. They didn't give any thought to their own \nsafety. They did what many of us hope we would do by acting swiftly \nwhen a fellow citizen was in danger. Together, they exhibited the \ncourage worthy of recognition here today. In addition to receiving the \nToledo Police Department's Meritorious Public Service Award, it is my \nhonor to commend Ms. Mitchell on the Senate Floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/18/senate-section/article/S2794-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2794-S2795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING NELA PARK\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise in recognition of General \nElectric's famed Nela Park, which is celebrating its 100th Anniversary \nthis year.\n  Nela Park was built in 1913, but its roots go back even further.\n  In 1879, American hero and one of Ohio's great luminaries, Thomas \nEdison, invented the carbon filament lamp. This invention led to the \nfounding of Edison Electric, which in 1892 would merge with a \ncompetitor to become General Electric.\n  GE had many competitors by the turn of the century. When the National \nElectric Lamp Company, NELA, was acquired by GE, it prompted the \ndevelopment of Nela Park in East Cleveland. The 92 acre campus was \ncompleted 2 years later and was the world's first industrial park, \nanother example of Ohio's leadership and trailblazing spirit.\n  Nela Park is famous for its Georgian Revival architecture and every \nyear features a world-renowned Christmas lighting display, modeled \nafter the lighting display in Washington, DC. By 1975, the park earned \nthe recognition it deserved and was listed as a Historic Place in the \nU.S. Department of the Interior's National Register.\n  Today, Nela Park is the national headquarters of GE's Lighting & \nElectrical Institute and serves as a source of innovation and a \ntestament to Ohio's manufacturing strength. In an age of environmental \nand efficiency conscientiousness, GE lighting still illuminates the \nworld, advancing new technologies such as fluorescents and light-\nemitting diodes.\n  For more than a century GE has employed Ohioans--at all levels of the \ncompany--and has been a significant part of our State and our Nation's \neconomy. I commend GE for its positive impact on Ohio, the United \nStates, and the world.\n  I am proud that GE Lighting calls Ohio its home, and I look forward \nto its continued production and innovation in the Buckeye \nstate.\n\n[[Page S2795]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/18/senate-section/article/S2795-1", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/18/senate-section/article/S2795-2", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/04/18/senate-section/article/S2795-3", "month": "04", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:45 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to \nsection 4(b) of the World War I Centennial Commission Act (Public Law \n112-272), and the order of the House of January 3, 2013, the Speaker \nappoints the following individual on the part of the House of \nRepresentatives to the World War I Centennial Commission: Colonel \nThomas N.

A bill to designate as wilderness certain Federal portions of \nthe red rock canyons of the Colorado Plateau and the Great Basin \nDeserts in the State of Utah for the benefit of present and future \ngenerations of people in the United States; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce America's Red \nRock Wilderness Act of 2013. This legislation continues our commitment \nto preserve natural resources in this country.\n  America's Red Rock Wilderness Act will designate as wilderness some \nof our Nation's most remarkable, but currently unprotected public \nlands. Bureau of Land Management, BLM, lands in Utah harbor some of the \nlargest and most remarkable roadless desert areas anywhere in the \nworld. Included in the 9.2 million acres I seek to protect are well \nknown landscapes, such as the Grand Staircase-Escalante National \nMonument, and lesser known areas just outside Zion National Park, \nCanyonlands National Park, and Arches National Park. Together this wild \nlandscape offers spectacular vistas of rare rock formations, canyons \nand desert lands, important archaeological sites, and habitat for rare \nplant and animal species.\n  I have visited many of the areas this act would designate as \nwilderness. I can tell you that the natural beauty of these landscapes \nis a compelling reason for Congress to grant these lands wilderness \nprotection. I have the honor of introducing legislation first \nintroduced by my friend and former colleague in the House of \nRepresentatives, Wayne Owens. As a member of the Utah delegation, \nCongressman Owens pioneered the Congressional effort to protect Utah's \nred rock wilderness. He did this with broad public support, which still \nexists not only in Utah, but in all corners of the Nation.\n  The wilderness designated in this bill was chosen based on more than \n20 years of meticulous research and surveying. Volunteers have taken \ninventories of thousands of square miles of BLM land in Utah to help \ndetermine which lands should be protected. These volunteers provided \nextensive documentation to ensure that these areas meet Federal \nwilderness criteria. The BLM also completed an inventory of \napproximately 7.5 million acres of the land that would be protected by \nAmerica's Red Rock Wilderness Act and agreed that the vast majority \nqualify for wilderness designation.\n  For more than 20 years, Utah conservationists have been working to \nadd the last great blocks of undeveloped BLM-administered land in Utah \nto the National Wilderness Preservation System. The more than 9 million \nacres of lands that would be protected by this legislation surround \neleven of Utah's national park, monument and recreation areas. These \nproposed BLM wilderness areas easily equal their neighboring national \nparklands in scenic beauty, opportunities for recreation, and \necological importance. Yet, unlike the parks, most of these scenic \ntreasures lack any form of long-term protection from commercial \ndevelopment, damaging off-road vehicle use, or oil and gas exploration.\n  Americans understand the need for wise stewardship of these wild \nlandscapes. This legislation represents a realistic balance between the \nneed to protect our natural heritage and demand for energy. While \nwilderness designation has been portrayed as a barrier to energy \nindependence, it is important to note that within the entire 9.2 \nmillion acres of America's Red Rock Wilderness Act the amount of \n``technically recoverable'' undiscovered natural gas and oil resources \namounts to roughly 6 days of oil and a little more than three weeks of \nnatural gas at current consumption levels. In fact, protecting these \nlands benefits local economies because of the recreational \nopportunities they provide. In fact, for many Utah cities and counties, \noutdoor recreation is the largest sector of the local economy providing \nup to 44 percent of non-government jobs in the region.\n  Unfortunately, scientists have already begun to see the impacts of \nglobal warming on public lands throughout the West. Hotter and drier \nconditions, larger wildfires, shrinking water resources, the spread of \ninvasive species, soil erosion, and dust storms are all expected to \nincrease over the next century. These threats make the need to protect \nthe remaining undisturbed landscapes and wildlife habitats in Utah's \nred rock wilderness even more urgent.\n  America's Red Rock Wilderness Act is a lasting gift to the American \npublic. By protecting this serene yet wild land we are giving future \ngenerations the opportunity to enjoy the same untrammeled landscape \nthat so many now cherish.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues who are original cosponsors of \nthis measure. Original cosponsors are Debbie Stabenow, Mark Udall, \nElizabeth Warren, Michael Bennet, Jack Reed, Sheldon Whitehouse, \nBernard Sanders, Tom Harkin, Barbara Boxer, Patty Murray, and Benjamin \nCardin. Additionally, I would like to thank the Utah Wilderness \nCoalition, which includes The Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club, the \nNatural Resources Defense Council, Earthjustice, and the Wasatch \nMountain Club, the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, the Outdoor \nIndustry Association and all of the other national, regional and local, \nhard-working groups who, for years, have championed this legislation.\n  Theodore Roosevelt once stated:\n\n       The Nation behaves well if it treats the natural resources \n     as assets which it must turn over to the next generation \n     increased and not impaired in value.\n\n  Enactment of this legislation will help us realize Roosevelt's \nvision. To protect these precious resources in Utah for future \ngenerations, I urge my colleagues to support America's Red Rock \nWilderness Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 769\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na special resource study of President Station in Baltimore, Maryland, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today marks an important day in history as \nour nation continues to honor the sesquicentennial of the Civil War. \nThere are many landmarks in my hometown of Baltimore that are \nsignificant to the history of the Civil War that I believe are in the \nNation's interests to protect for future generations to experience. As \nour nation pays tribute to this trying time in our nation's history, I \nam proud to re-introduce the President Street Station Study Act which \nwould initiate the process for preserving one such landmark in the \nheart of Baltimore. President Street Station played a crucial role in \nthe Civil War, the Underground Railroad, the growth of Baltimore's \nrailroad industry, and is a historically significant landmark to the \npresidency of Abraham Lincoln.\n  The station was constructed for the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and \nBaltimore, PW, Railroad in 1849 and remains the oldest surviving big \ncity railroad terminal in the United States. This historical structure \nis a unique architectural gem, arguably the first example and last \nsurvivor of the early barrel-vault train shed arches, also known as the \nHowe Truss. The arch-rib design became the blueprint for railroad \nbridges and roofs well into the 20th century and was replicated for \nevery similarly designed train shed and roof for the next 20 years.\n  The growth of President Street Station and the PW railroad mirror \nthe expansion of the railroad industry throughout the country in the \nlatter half of the 19th century. This station played an essential role \nin making Baltimore the first railroad and sea-rail link in the nation \nand helped the city become the international port hub it is today.\n  In its heyday, President Street Station was the key link connecting \nWashington D.C. with the northeast States. Hundreds of passengers \ntraveling north passed through this station and, by the start of the \nCivil War, Baltimore had become our Nation's major southern railroad \nhub. Not surprisingly, the station played a critical role in both the \nCivil War and the Underground Railroad.\n  Perhaps the most famous passenger to travel through the station was \nPresident Abraham Lincoln. He came through the station at least four \ntimes, including secretly on his way to his first inauguration in 1861. \nPresident-elect Lincoln was warned by a PW private detective of a \npossible assassination plot in Baltimore as he transferred trains. \nWhile it is unclear if this plot existed and posed a serious threat, \nLincoln nevertheless was secretly smuggled aboard a train in the dead \nof night to complete his trip to Washington.\n  Just a few months later, President Street Station served as a \nbackdrop for what many historians consider to be the first bloodshed of \nthe Civil War. The Baltimore Riot of 1861 occurred when Lincoln called \nfor Union volunteers to quell the rebellion at Fort Sumter in \nCharleston. On this day in history, April 19, 1861, Massachusetts and \nPennsylvania volunteers were met and attacked by a mob of secessionist \nand Confederate sympathizers. The\n\n[[Page S2805]]\n\nbloody confrontation left four dead and 36 wounded. As the war \ncontinued, the Station remained a critical link for the Union. Troops \nand supplies from the north were regularly shuttled through the station \nto support Union soldiers.\n  It is well known that Maryland was a common starting point along the \nUnderground Railroad and that many escaped slaves from Maryland's \nEastern Shore plantations were destined for Baltimore and the President \nStreet Station to travel North to freedom. A few weeks ago, President \nBarack Obama honored Maryland's own Harriet Tubman, the Underground \nRailroad's most famous ``conductor'' by establishing the Harriet Tubman \nUnderground Railroad National Monument, the first National Monument to \ncommemorate an African American woman. While she personally led dozens \nof people to freedom, her courage and fortitude also inspired others to \nfind their own strength to seek freedom. President Street Station was \nindeed a station on this secret network. Prior to emancipation in 1863, \nseveral renowned escapees, including Frederick Douglass, William and \nEllen Craft, and Henry ``Box'' Brown, traveled through the Station, \nrisking their lives for a better and freer life.\n  Others' journeys for a better life also passed through President \nStreet Station. From its beginning and into the 20th century, Baltimore \nwas both a destination and departure point for immigrants. New arrivals \nfrom Ireland, Russia, and Europe arriving on the eastern seaboard \ntraveled by way of the PW railroads to the west.\n  For decades, President Street Station has long been recognized as \nhaving an important place in history: In 1992, it was listed on the \nNational Register of Historic Places and the city of Baltimore has \ndedicated it a local historical landmark. For many years it served as \nthe Baltimore Civil War Museum, educating generations of people about \nthe role Maryland and Baltimore played in the Civil War and the early \nhistory of the city. In recent years, the museum, run by dedicated \nvolunteers from the Maryland Historical Society and Friends of \nPresident Street Station, have struggled to keep the station's doors \nopen and keeping the station's character true to its historical roots. \nThe area around President Street Station has changed dramatically over \nthe decades, but the Station has worked to preserve its place in \nhistory. It has been many years since trains passed through the \nPresidents Street Station and it is clear that today the best use for \nthis building is to preserve the building and use it to tell Station's \nAmerican story.\n  President Street Station is one of America's historical treasures. As \nwe commemorate the 152nd Anniversary of the Baltimore Riot and the \nstart of National Park Week this weekend, we honor some of our \ncountry's greatest leaders and remember our own rich and innovative \nhistory. This bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na special resource study of President Street Station to evaluate the \nsuitability and feasibility of establishing the Station as a unit of \nthe National Park Service. President Street Station, a contributor to \nthe growth of the railroad, and a vital player in the Underground \nRailroad, Lincoln Presidency and Civil War, is part of this history.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Youth Prison Reduction \n     through Opportunities, Mentoring, Intervention, Support, and \n     Education Act'' or the ``Youth PROMISE Act''.\n\n     SEC. 402. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n     Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention.\n       (2) Community.--The term ``community'' means a unit of \n     local government or an Indian tribe, or part of such a unit \n     or tribe, as determined by such a unit or tribe for the \n     purpose of applying for a grant under this title.\n       (3) Designated geographic area.--The term ``designated \n     geographic area'' means a 5-digit postal ZIP Code assigned to \n     a geographic area by the United States Postal Service.\n       (4) Evidence-based.--The term ``evidence-based'', when used \n     with respect to a practice relating to juvenile delinquency \n     and criminal street gang activity prevention and \n     intervention, means a practice (including a service, program, \n     activity, intervention, technology, or strategy) for which \n     the Administrator has determined--\n       (A) causal evidence documents a relationship between the \n     practice and its intended outcome, based on measures of the \n     direction and size of a change, and the extent to which a \n     change may be attributed to the practice; and\n       (B) the use of scientific methods rules out, to the extent \n     possible, alternative explanations for the documented change.\n       (5) Intervention.--The term ``intervention'' means the \n     provision of programs and services that are supported by \n     research, are evidence-based or promising practices, and are \n     provided to youth who are involved in, or who are identified \n     by evidence-based risk assessment methods as being at high \n     risk of continued involvement in, juvenile delinquency or \n     criminal street gangs, as a result of indications that \n     demonstrate involvement with problems such as truancy, \n     substance abuse, mental health treatment needs, or siblings \n     who have had involvement with juvenile or criminal justice \n     systems.\n       (6) Juvenile delinquency and criminal street gang activity \n     prevention.--The term ``juvenile delinquency and criminal \n     street gang activity prevention'' means the provision of \n     programs and resources to children and families who have not \n     yet had substantial contact with criminal justice or juvenile \n     justice systems, that--\n       (A) are designed to reduce potential juvenile delinquency \n     and criminal street gang activity risks; and\n       (B) are evidence-based or promising educational, health, \n     mental health, school-based, community-based, faith-based, \n     parenting, job training, social opportunities and \n     experiences, or other programs, for youth and their families, \n     that have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing \n     juvenile delinquency and criminal street gang activity risks.\n       (7) Promising.--The term ``promising'', when used with \n     respect to a practice relating to juvenile delinquency and \n     criminal street gang activity prevention and intervention, \n     means a practice (including a service, program, activity, \n     intervention, technology, or strategy) that, based on \n     statistical analyses or a theory of change, has been \n     determined by the Administrator to have demonstrated the \n     potential to meet the requirements of an evidence-based \n     practice.\n       (8) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several \n     States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto \n     Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern \n     Mariana Islands, and any other territories or possessions of \n     the United States.\n       (9) Theory of change.--The term ``theory of change'' means \n     a program planning strategy approved by the Administrator \n     that outlines the types of interventions and outcomes \n     essential to achieving a set of program goals.\n       (10) Youth.--The term ``youth'' means--\n       (A) an individual who is 18 years of age or younger; or\n       (B) in any State in which the maximum age at which the \n     juvenile justice system of such State has jurisdiction over \n     individuals exceeds 18 years of age, an individual who is \n     such maximum age or younger.\n\n     SEC. 403. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Youth gang crime has taken a toll on a number of urban \n     communities, and senseless acts of gang-related violence have \n     imposed economic, social, and human costs.\n       (2) Drug- and alcohol-dependent youth, and youth dually \n     diagnosed with addiction and mental health disorders, are \n     more likely to become involved with the juvenile justice \n     system than youth without such risk factors, absent \n     appropriate prevention and intervention services.\n       (3) Children of color are over-represented relative to the \n     general population at every stage of the juvenile justice \n     system. African American youth are 17 percent of the United \n     States population, but represent 38 percent of youth in \n     secure placement juvenile facilities, and 58 percent of youth \n     incarcerated in adult prisons.\n       (4) Research funded by the Department of Justice indicates \n     that gang-membership is short-lived among adolescents. With \n     very few youth remaining gang-involved throughout their \n     adolescent years, ongoing opportunities for intervention \n     exist.\n       (5) Criminal justice costs have become burdensome in many \n     States and cities, requiring reductions in vital educational, \n     social, welfare, mental health, and related services.\n       (6) Direct expenditures for each of the major criminal \n     justice functions, police, corrections, and judicial \n     services, have increased steadily over the last 25 years. In \n     fiscal year 2009, Federal, State, and local governments spent \n     an estimated $258,000,000,000 for police protection, \n     corrections, and judicial and legal services, nearly a 207 \n     percent increase since 1982.\n       (7) In 2009, State governments spent $5,700,000,000 to \n     incarcerate youth. The average annual cost to incarcerate one \n     youth is $88,000.\n       (8) Coordinated efforts of stakeholders in the juvenile \n     justice system in a local community, together with other \n     organizations and community members concerned with the safety \n     and welfare of children, have a strong record of demonstrated \n     success in reducing the impact of youth and gang-related \n     crime and violence, as demonstrated in Boston, Massachusetts, \n     Chicago, Illinois, Richmond, Virginia, Los Angeles, \n     California, and other communities.\n       (9) Investment in prevention and intervention programs for \n     children and youth, including quality early childhood \n     programs, comprehensive evidence-based school, after school, \n     and summer school programs, mentoring programs, mental health \n     and treatment programs, evidence-based job training programs, \n     and alternative intervention programs, has been shown to lead \n     to decreased youth arrests, decreased delinquency, lower \n     recidivism, and greater financial savings from an \n     educational, economic, social, and criminal justice \n     perspective.\n       (10) Quality early childhood education programs have been \n     demonstrated to help children start school ready to learn and \n     to reduce delinquency and criminal street gang activity \n     risks.\n       (11) Evidence-based mentoring programs have been shown to \n     prevent youth drug abuse and violence.\n       (12) Evidence-based school-based comprehensive \n     instructional programs that pair youth with responsible adult \n     mentors have been shown to have a strong impact upon \n     delinquency prevention.\n       (13) After-school programs that connect children to caring \n     adults and that provide\n\n[[Page S2811]]\n\n     constructive activities during the peak hours of juvenile \n     delinquency and criminal street gang activity, between 3 p.m. \n     and 6 p.m., have been shown to reduce delinquency and the \n     attendant costs imposed on the juvenile and criminal justice \n     systems.\n       (14) States with higher levels of educational attainment \n     have been shown to have crime rates lower than the national \n     average. Researchers have found that a 5-percent increase in \n     male high school graduation rates would produce an annual \n     savings of almost $5,000,000,000 in crime-related expenses.\n       (15) Therapeutic programs that engage and motivate high-\n     risk youth and their families to change behaviors that often \n     result in criminal activity have been shown to significantly \n     reduce recidivism among juvenile offenders, and significantly \n     reduce the attendant costs of crime and delinquency imposed \n     upon the juvenile and criminal justice systems.\n       (16) Comprehensive programs that target kids who are \n     already serious juvenile offenders by addressing the multiple \n     factors in peer, school, neighborhood, and family \n     environments known to be related to delinquency can reduce \n     recidivism among juvenile offenders and save the public \n     significant economic costs.\n       (17) There are many alternatives to incarceration of youth \n     that have been proven to be more effective in reducing crime \n     and violence at the Federal, State, local, and tribal levels, \n     and the failure to provide for such effective alternatives is \n     a pervasive problem that leads to increased youth, and later \n     adult, crime and violence.\n       (18) Savings achieved through early intervention and \n     prevention are significant, especially when noncriminal \n     justice social, educational, mental health, and economic \n     outcomes are considered.\n       (19) The prevention of child abuse and neglect can help \n     stop a cycle of violence and save up to $5.00 for every $1.00 \n     invested in preventing such abuse and neglect.\n       (20) Targeting interventions at special youth risk groups \n     and focusing upon relatively low-cost interventions increases \n     the probability of fiscal benefit.\n       (21) Evidence-based intervention treatment facilities have \n     been shown to reduce youth delinquency and to be cost-\n     effective.\n       (22) States, including Wisconsin, Ohio, New York, Texas, \n     and Pennsylvania, have seen a reduction in juvenile \n     incarceration due to a reallocation of criminal justice funds \n     towards prevention programs.\n       (23) The rise in homicides in several cities in recent \n     years followed declines in Federal funding provided for law \n     enforcement, educational, health and mental health, social \n     services, and other support to localities for youth, their \n     families, and other community-oriented programs and \n     approaches.\n\n     SEC. 404.
