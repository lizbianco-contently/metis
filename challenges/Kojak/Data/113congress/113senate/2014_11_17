Mr. President, in that great play ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' \nTevye says, among other things, and I quote: Good news will stay, and \nbad news will refuse to leave.\n  In Washington we all too often focus on the bad news that lingers \ninstead of highlighting the many good things that are being \naccomplished. ObamaCare is a perfect example. The Affordable Care Act \nis working. Americans who have enrolled in health plans through the \nAffordable Care Act are happy with their coverage.\n  There was a very good article in newspapers all over the country \ntoday, including in the Washington Post, which I saw. In this article \nthere is a citation of a recent Gallup survey of Americans who have \ncoverage through ObamaCare, and the findings are very positive--and \nthat is a gross understatement. Seventy-four percent of ObamaCare \nenrollees rate their coverage as good or excellent. Seventy-five \npercent say they are satisfied with the cost of their plans. I will \nrepeat that. Seventy-four percent of ObamaCare enrollees rate their \ncoverage as good or excellent, and 75 percent say they are satisfied \nwith the cost of their plans. That is good news to me.\n  The Affordable Care Act is working for the American people. It is \nproviding quality, affordable health care to families all across our \ncountry.\n  The Senate has a lot of work to do before the 113th Congress comes to \na close. There are a few important priorities in this work period. We \nhave to pass an extension of tax credits for American families and \nbusinesses. We have to pass the Defense authorization bill, and the \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate is concerned about extending the \nFISA legislation, the American freedom act. It is so important that we \ndo these things, but also we have to fund our government. That has to \nbe done very soon because early next month the funding expires. We have \nmany nominations that have not been completed. Almost 200 have been \nheld up by my Republican colleagues. John Kerry, the Secretary of \nState, called me and said he himself had almost 100--well, that is \nexaggerating a little. He had 60-some; I don't remember the exact \nnumber.\n  We must keep our government funded. I have been having productive \nbipartisan conversations with Speaker Boehner, the Republican leader, \nand Appropriations chair Senator Mikulski. It is clear to me that \nRepublican leaders want to work together to keep the government funded. \nWe have heard there are going to be no government shutdowns from the \nleaders, but Members of their caucuses are really saying some very \nscary things.\n  So the question is whether the Republican leaders will be able to \nstand up to the radical forces within their own party. It is more than \njust one or two people; it is a large number of Members of the \nRepublican caucus in the Senate and, of course, the Republican caucus \nin the House. Can these Republican leaders stand up to these people who \nare intent on holding our government hostage? There has been a lot of \ntalk the past 3 or 4 days: So we have a government shutdown; so what?\n  It has become increasingly clear these last few days that a number of \nRepublicans are looking for an example to use to get their ideas--that \nare somewhat bizarre in the minds of most people--they are using a \nnumber of different things as an excuse: Executive action; the \nPresident is not doing enough on making sure the Iranians are held down \ntightly; and on and on with everything they have as an excuse to derail \nbipartisan legislation to fund the government.\n\n[[Page S6004]]\n\n  Sadly, though, we have seen this before. The government has been shut \ndown. The government's debt has been defaulted upon. So how is it \npossible that there is even talk of not funding our government again by \nanybody? But that is what they are doing.\n  Just 2 weeks ago the American people sent us a very strong message: \nWork together. In the press conferences that followed this month's \nmidterm elections, Republicans were saying all the right things about \ncompromise and bipartisanship. Yet, instead of looking for common \nground and working to compromise, some of these Republicans are more \ninterested in threats and ultimatums. Why? Because these radical \nRepublicans object to President Obama using his constitutionally \nestablished authority to do what President Ronald Reagan and both \nGeorge Bushes have done--fix as much of the system as he can to protect \nfamilies suffering under the broken immigration system. Going back to \nDwight D. Eisenhower, every President since then has used Executive \nauthority to fix America's immigration system--every President, \nRepublicans and Democrats. For the Republicans to take issue with \nPresident Obama for doing the same thing is hypocritical. Why didn't \nthey complain when the two Bush Presidents did things administratively? \nWhy?\n  I hope Republicans in Congress will object to this brinkmanship. A \nscorched-earth policy is no way to go. Instead, responsible leaders in \nthe Republican Party need to work with us to complete the business of \nfunding our government regardless of when the President acts to keep \nfamilies together.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the distinguished majority leader yield for an \nobservation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). Will the majority leader yield to \nthe Senator from Vermont for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as long as I have served in the Senate--and \nI have served the longest in this body--I have never seen a time when \nnoncontroversial nominations were being held up, whether we have had a \nRepublican or Democratic President. I would note for the majority \nleader that we have on the calendar 18 nominees for Federal judgeships \nthat passed unanimously. Every Republican and every Democrat in the \nJudiciary Committee voted for them. Many of them were recommended by \nRepublican Senators and four of them for judicial emergencies. The \noldest one has been pending since June, having gone through the \ncommittee unanimously. This is not being responsible to the American \npeople.\n  The distinguished majority leader talked about the use of Executive \norders. Concerns have been expressed by the other side about Executive \norders on immigration. I would remind everybody that this body by a 2-\nto-1 margin--Republicans and Democrats joined together last year to \npass a comprehensive immigration bill which covered everything from the \npeople on the borders to those who were already in this country. The \nRepublican leadership in the House has refused to take it up. They \ncomplain about the President 1\\1/2\\ years later--during all this time \nthat has passed between the Republican and Democratic votes here, they \nhave refused to take it up. Yet they complain that the President is \ngoing to do something.\n  I say bring it up and vote yes or vote no. Stop this ``we will vote \nmaybe.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. To the President pro tempore of the Senate, if the Speaker \nof the House of Representatives, John Boehner, brought up the bill that \npassed here in the Senate, it would pass overwhelmingly in the House. \nVirtually every Democrat would vote for it, and I suggest that probably \nhalf of the Republicans would vote for it. He won't allow a vote. What \nis this about? It is beyond my ability to comprehend how they are \nwilling to do everything they can to stop this President from doing \nwhat Presidents have done since Dwight Eisenhower.\n  I would also say this: We have gotten some judges done. That is \nbecause we changed the rules to do the outlandish thing of having a \nmajority of the Senate determine whether someone should be confirmed.\n  If we look at the Constitution of the United States, the people who \ndrafted that Constitution were very smart. We know a number of them \nwere geniuses. And they were very precise in what they wanted to have \nsupermajority votes on. On judges they didn't want supermajority votes \nbut a simple majority of this body, and that is what we did in changing \nthe rules.\n  But I say to my friend, in spite of that, we have been able to get a \nlot of judges done, we are going to wind up--by the time the Judiciary \nCommittee continues to do the good work they do, we will probably have \nover 20 judges who need to be approved this Congress. Postcloture, \nunder the rules we have, there is only 1 hour of time that can be used, \nso we can get through the judges very quickly. For sub-Cabinet officers \nit takes 8 hours, and we are normally willing to yield back our time, \nso 4 hours on every one of those.\n  We have scores--we are approaching, counting judges and all of the \nnominations, well over 150 who have been held up, people who have been \nwaiting and waiting. These are jobs that are needed in our country; \nthese are not new positions we have created.\n  So I would hope we can get past the bitterness that has been created \nin this body and get the nominations done. There is no reason a judge-\nto-be should have to wait for all this time, as the Senator from \nVermont has indicated, just to get a vote. Whatever he is doing now has \nbeen put on hold, and this is throughout the whole government.\n  So I would hope we can get a lot of these done. If not, we are going \nto have to spend a lot of time here because we cannot leave this \nCongress with all these things undone. I hope we can work together, as \nI have indicated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/17/senate-section/article/S6004-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING HOWARD GREENE, JR.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to say one thing while my friend is \non the floor.\n  When I came to the Senate, my friend from Vermont had already been \nhere a dozen years. I remember--and I know he does--a man who had been \nthe secretary for the majority and the secretary for the minority who \ncontrolled the staff of the Republicans. The Senator remembers Howard \nGreene--a guy who did not smoke a cigar, he just chewed on it all the \ntime; he chewed on his cigar. That is when the rules were not nearly as \nstrict as they are now about smoking.\n  Howard Greene was so nice to me as a new Senator. He had a lot of \nauthority. For over three decades he was a recognizable person here on \nthe Senate floor. In fact, specifically, for 28 years he held many \npositions, including as a doorkeeper, as a cloakroom assistant. He was, \nas I just indicated, both secretary for the minority and secretary for \nthe majority.\n  Howard finished his distinguished career as the Sergeant at Arms. He \nretired in 1996.\n  I offer my condolences to Howard Greene's family and loved ones \nduring this difficult time. Although it is of little consolation, I \nhope they know how grateful we are for Howard's many years of sacrifice \nto this body. He will be greatly missed, and he was very kind and \nthoughtful to me as a new Senator.\n  I say to my friend, you do remember Howard Greene?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I do.\n  Mr. REID.

GREENE, JR.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this afternoon I wish to say a word \nabout Howard Greene, whose passing we mourn today.\n  Howard was a leading figure here in the Senate for many years. I know \nMembers of both parties remember his time here with fondness, even \nthough he retired from the Senate nearly two decades ago. And I think \nthat says a lot about Howard.\n  He began his service here modestly enough as a doorkeeper right \noutside this Chamber. The year was 1968. Howard was 26, a student at \nthe University of Maryland. He originally intended to become a history \nteacher, but over time his ambitions changed, from wanting to teach \nabout history to wanting to help shape it--and what a lucky break for \nthe Senate.\n  His considerable talents were soon put to work in the Republican \ncloakroom. It was a big promotion, even if Howard had to first explain \nto his mother that working in the cloakroom didn't mean he would be \nhanging up people's coats.\n  Howard quickly gained the confidence of Senators as he rose rapidly \nthrough the ranks. His deep institutional knowledge, strong work ethic, \nhonesty, and sense of humor were appreciated by those who worked with \nhim, and his talents were essential for the many who relied upon him.\n  After the Reagan landslide of 1980, Howard put his institutional \nknowledge to work as secretary of the new Republican majority. After so \nmany years out of power, it was a challenging task, but he was up to \nit.\n  All told, Howard would serve the institution he loved for more than \n28 years, working under Republican leaders such as Howard Baker and Bob \nDole, until stepping down from his final position of Sergeant at Arms \nin 1996.\n  Senators from both parties had a lot of nice things to say about him \nback then. The late Senator from Alaska, Ted Stevens, said it could \nseem like Howard had a crystal ball when it came to counting votes and \npredicting outcomes, and he praised him for his ``careful analysis, \nknowledge of the issues, understanding of the Members, and . . . hard \nwork'' that often made his forecasts correct.\n  Senator David Pryor from Arkansas, a Democrat, noted that Howard \n``respected and served and answered to not only the Senators on . . . \n[the Republican] side of the aisle,'' but to the Members on his side as \nwell.\n  It is clear that this man from Lewes, DE, had uncommon talent and \nability. We are grateful he chose to share it with us for so many \nyears. We honor him for it today, and we send our sincerest condolences \nto his family in this difficult time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of S. Res. 579, submitted earlier today; further, that \nthe resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions \nto reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 579) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/17/senate-section/article/S6005-3", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6005-S6006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CCDBG PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today because in just a \nlittle over 2 hours we are going to take up the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant Act of 2014. Let me explain what that is.\n  The Child Care and Development Block Grant Program was created in \n1990 to provide a voucher to meet the childcare needs of families at \nrisk of having to make the decision that one or both parents couldn't \nwork because childcare had such a tremendous expense with it. We wanted \nthose parents to be able to participate in the productive part of our \neconomy and society.\n  I can honestly say this is one of the most successful programs \nCongress has ever produced. The program, as is the case with every \nbill, is required to be reauthorized after a certain period of time. It \nwas started in 1995--I might add the year I got here--and it was \nreauthorized in 1996. This was the last time this bill was ever \nreauthorized.\n  Now, let me point out that authorization and funding are two \ndifferent things. These vouchers have existed in the system but \nCongress has not reauthorized the program; therefore, we haven't \nchanged the program since 1996. I ask my colleagues to stop for a \nmoment and think about how society has changed since 1996. The world \nhas changed since 1996. Things we took for granted in 1996 we need \nproof of today. Things we didn't worry about in 1996 we worry about \ntoday. Let me suggest that childcare is no different. There is still a \nneed for some type of vouchers for families who are on the bubble, and \nI dare say that childcare has gotten incredibly expensive since 1996.\n  I rise today to congratulate this body because this afternoon, in \njust under 2 hours, we are going to pass the first reauthorization of \nthe Child Care Development Block Grant program since 1996. I will be \nreally very honest; it wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for my partner \nin this endeavor, Barbara Mikulski. Senator Mikulski has been \ntenacious. She has stood by my side, and she has told me when she \ndidn't think we should move forward, because as easy and as common \nsense as it sounds, it has been really difficult to get to this point. \nThis has been a 3-year process. So for those who criticize Congress, \nlet me assure those people, we have touched every base we can touch.\n  Several years ago, while we served as chair and ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Children and Families, Senator Mikulski and I promised \nat that time to address the shortcomings in the CCDBG Program so that \nchildren could attend childcare and their families could expect a \nhealthy setting that fostered their development.\n  Now, for years, we have heard stories about abuse and neglect in many \nchildcare settings--stories that continue to break my heart and, I \nthink, break the heart of every American. We saw numerous inspector \ngeneral reports that documented unsafe conditions where children were \nneglected and Federal tax dollars were misused.\n  Let me stop here and say this. Everything we do in this bill only \napplies to a childcare facility that accepts CCDBG money. They can be \nprivate institutions. They can be faith-based institutions. Their \nconstruction can be a combination of all of the above. If they accept \none penny of CCDBG money, they are now required to meet the quality \nstandards and safety standards we set in this bill. Now, in North \nCarolina, that covers practically every childcare facility. But in \nevery State they don't go to the lengths we do in North Carolina nor \nthat we go to in this piece of legislation. I hope my colleagues will \ngo back to the States they hail from, and they will suggest that things \nsuch as background checks for workers at a childcare facility is common \nsense. To say to a parent who is dropping off a young child, whether \nthe Federal Government subsidized with a voucher or not--that parent \nshould feel 100-percent confident that the worker there is not a \nconvicted felon, that they are not a drug addict, that they have passed \nthe minimal background check that most of us would think is common \nsense.\n\n  I might also take the opportunity to stop and say to the Presiding \nOfficer, who represents Virginia, you might think--gosh, this is a \nfinancial burden on all childcare centers. No, this is a $15 investment \nin the safety of every child who is housed in their facility.\n\n[[Page S6006]]\n\n  For a program that in many States represents almost all the funding \nused for childcare subsidies, Senator Mikulski and I knew it was an \nobligation to act to reauthorize this law so appropriate boundaries \nwere put in place. To continue to ignore these realities would have \nallowed Federal dollars to keep funding abuse, waste--taxpayers, \nparents, and children deserved our action.\n  Since then, between the two of us and our staffs, we have held four \nHELP Committee hearings. We have 236 hours of negotiations. We have \ndozens of meetings with 44 advocacy organizations supporting this \nlegislation. The Senate had 18 amendments considered and voted on in \nthis institution, the Senate, back in March when the legislation passed \nthis body of Congress 96 to 2. That was March.\n  We are here today because the House changed the bill a little bit \nwith our blessings, and this afternoon we are going to take up passage \nof the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014.\n  My hope is this is going to be a unanimous vote by the Senate.\n  Bringing the HELP Committee together, as the Presiding Officer knows, \nis very difficult because of the diverse ideology of the makeup of \nmembers on the HELP Committee.\n  It is no small feat we have gotten to this point, and we hold \ntogether the support of people who look at the world a little bit \ndifferently than I do and may geographically come from a different area \nthan I do.\n  I wish to publicly say thank you to Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member \nAlexander, Ranking Member Enzi before that, because if it wasn't for \nthe leadership on the full committee, Senator Mikulski and I would not \nhave had the opportunity to mark it up in committee, to pass it on the \nSenate floor, to work with the House, and now to have a bill back.\n  As I conclude, let me just say for the 1.7 million children served \nnationally by CCDBG and the 80,000 served in my State of North \nCarolina, safe and quality childcare will now be a priority, ensuring \nworking parents trying to better their lives and those of their \nchildren will feel safe using their Federal vouchers.\n  In short, I urge my colleagues to unanimously support this \nlegislation. We waited way too long since 1996 to make the commonsense \nchanges that provide safety and quality in the childcare that we, the \ntaxpayers, provide to those families on the bubble.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/17/senate-section/article/S6006-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6006-S6007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Only a few years ago a prominent Democrat firmly and \nunequivocally rejected the idea that the President of the United States \ncould singlehandedly enact an amnesty for millions of immigrants who \nentered the country without legal authorization. In 2011, for example, \nthis same person reminded us that ``there are laws on the books that \nCongress has passed'' and that therefore it should not be permissible \nfor the President to ``suspend deportations through executive order.'' \nThen in 2013 this same individual noted that granting a unilateral \namnesty for adults who came to the United States illegally was ``not an \noption'' because it would amount to ``ignoring the law.'' A few months \nlater this same individual was speaking at an immigration event and was \ninterrupted by a heckler who urged him to stop the deportations by \nExecutive fiat. In response, he said:\n\n       If in fact I could solve all of these problems without \n     passing laws in Congress, then I would do so. But we are also \n     a nation of laws. That is part of our tradition.\n\n  Of course, you might have guessed who that person was. It was \nPresident Barack Obama on numerous different occasions in the past few \nyears saying he did not have the authority to issue a unilateral \nExecutive order granting, in effect, a right to waive the law with \nregard to illegal immigration. I have to say that our President has a \npreternatural ability to say one thing and then do another--the \nopposite.\n  Now the President is threatening to authorize exactly the type of \naction he previously said he did not have the authority to order, and \nhe is threatening to do so even after his go-it-alone approach on \nimmigration and so many other issues was so roundly repudiated in this \nmost recent election on November 4. In other words, he is showing \ncontempt for the Constitution, for the voters, and basically anyone who \ndisagrees with him. It is the classic ``my way or the highway'' \napproach.\n  According to press reports, he will act as early as this week and he \nwill unilaterally grant work permits. Under what authority--I have no \nidea how he can legislate authority to grant work permits for people \nwho illegally entered the country, but he said, apparently, he is going \nto try. These are the kinds of maneuvers we would expect to see from \ntin-pot dictators and banana republics, not from the Commander in Chief \nand the Chief Executive of the world's greatest democracy.\n  Apparently the President now thinks that he and, I assume by \nprecedent, any future President can simply ignore the laws that he \nfinds inconvenient, that ``if Congress hasn't passed the law, that is a \ngood enough excuse for me to go it alone and do it my way,'' go around \nit, go against the will of Congress and the American people. This is a \ndangerous precedent, I hope the President recognizes. If after the next \nelection a President of the other party--my party--is elected, won't \nthis be viewed as a precedent which has been established by this \nPresident which could be used on everything from taxes, to regulation, \nto ObamaCare--you name it. But that is not how our Constitution is \nwritten. That is not what the separation of powers doctrine--which is \nan essential element of our Constitution--provides. Even the Washington \nPost--not known as being a bastion of conservative thought--has said \nthat failing to get his way in Congress does not ``grant the president \nlicense to tear up the Constitution.''\n  Unfortunately, the President has shown that he has very little \npatience with constitutional safeguards, especially when they hamper \nhis agenda or complicate his political needs. After all, this is the \nsame President who has unilaterally rewritten ObamaCare by granting \nextensions, waivers, and the like and who has unilaterally gutted \nwelfare reform and who has made blatantly unconstitutional appointments \nto the Federal bureaucracy and to the Federal judiciary, only to be \ncorrected by the courts.\n  For that matter, the President has already made a number of \nunilateral changes in U.S. immigration policy with disastrous results. \nWe have seen literally thousands of convicted criminals released from \nU.S. custody, including those with violent records. And, of course, it \nwasn't that long ago that we saw what had been called a genuine \nhumanitarian crisis unfold along the southern border in my State as \ntens of thousands of Central American children made a treacherous \njourney in order to cross illegally into the United States and take \nadvantage of a loophole in a 2008 law that we tried to correct but \ncouldn't even get a vote on it in the Senate.\n  At the height of the crisis in early June, the New York Times told \nthe story of a 13-year-old Honduran boy who was detained in Mexico \nwhile trying to reach the U.S. border, and his story was pretty typical \nof what we heard from many people. The Department of Homeland Security \nconducted interviews with many of the immigrants who came across at \nthat time. ``Like so many others across Central America,'' the Times \nreported, this boy ``said his mother believed that the Obama \nadministration had quietly changed its policy regarding unaccompanied \nminors and that if he made it across, he would have a better shot at \nstaying.''\n  In other words, the impression that we are not going to enforce our \nlaw is a magnet.\n  I have no idea how this unilateral action by the President will be \ninterpreted--granting legal status presumably to millions of people by \nthe swipe of his pen. Will that be viewed as a green light for people \nwho want to come to the United States from all around the world, \nsaying: Well, if I can just get to the United States, President Obama \nwill let me stay too.\n\n[[Page S6007]]\n\n  About 1 week later the Washington Post confirmed that the influx of \nunaccompanied Central American children is ``being driven in large part \nby the perception they will be allowed to stay under the Obama \nadministration's immigration policies.''\n  I mention these stories because they highlight the all-to-predictable \nconsequences of failing to enforce U.S. immigration law.\n  So much of law enforcement is the deterrent value--in other words, \nstopping people from breaking the law in the first instance, not just \ncatching them after they actually break it. And sending the message \n``Get here if you can, and you might too be one of the ones who win the \nlucky immigration lottery and get to stay in the United States'' is a \nhuge magnet for illegal immigration and it undermines--indeed, it guts \nthe deterrent value of enforcing the law. And for what? The President \nreportedly, unless he rethinks this misguided strategy, will provide \nsome form of temporary relief that will not even be able to be \nimplemented before he leaves office in 2 years, with uncertainty for \nthese immigrants and their families as to what is going to happen \nbeyond.\n  How he is drawing the line is beyond me. I read that apparently the \nreports that have been dribbled out in the press--and, of course, this \ntown is famous for intentional leaks to sort of issue trial balloons to \nsee how people are going to react. Well, if the trial balloons are \ncorrect, if the stories are correct, the President's order will cover \nroughly 40 percent of the people here in violation of our immigration \nlaws--40 percent. So why did he decide to stop at 40 percent and not do \n60 percent or 80 percent or 100 percent? What about the people who have \nbeen waiting patiently in line, complying with our immigration laws? To \nhave these other millions of people jump ahead of them and be given \nsome form of legal status is not fair to them, and it certainly doesn't \nencourage people's compliance with the rules or the law.\n  Then we have to look at who benefits the most. And I am not talking \nabout the immigrants; I am talking about the criminal organizations. \nThis is part of how they operate and their business model. Such \ncriminal organizations will be the biggest beneficiaries of the \nPresident's Executive order, which would make it even harder for our \nfriends in Mexico to reduce violence and uphold the rule of law. It \nwould be like a pipeline of additional money and resources into the \ncartels. And the cartels don't care whether they traffic in children, \nwhether they traffic in drugs or weapons. That is how they make money. \nThat is why they exist. That is what they do. And this ill-advised \naction by the President would do nothing but ensure that a pipeline of \nmoney will continue to flow into these criminal organizations.\n  Time magazine reported:\n\n       Cartels control most of Mexico's smuggling networks through \n     which victims are moved, while they also take money from \n     pimps and brothels operating in their territories.\n\n  Yet, again, President Obama just doesn't seem to care.\n  He also doesn't seem to care that his Executive action would harm our \nopportunity to reform our broken legal immigration system. Republicans \nand Democrats alike have ideas for how to reform our immigration \nsystem, and many of them have bipartisan support. We do know that a \ncomprehensive bill--we have tried to pass one of those for 10 years, \nand it hasn't worked, so it makes sense to me to try to break it down \ninto smaller pieces and try to build consensus for those, get them \nacross the floor of the House and the Senate and on the President's \ndesk--even on a controversial subject such as immigration. Yet the \nPresident has now appeared to decide to trample the normal legislative \nprocess and to do immigration policy by fiat.\n  What about the 60 percent who won't be covered by his Executive \norder? They don't get any relief under his Executive order. They are \ngoing to need to look to Congress to know what the rules are.\n  So in the President's desperate attempt to placate some very vocal \nactivist groups and to make up for years of hollow promises, he has \ndecided to flout the rule of law and end up making real immigration \nreform that much harder to pass.\n  I saw a Congressman from South Carolina, Trey Gowdy, who said: During \nthe first 2 years the President had 60 Democrats in the Senate and \ncontrolled the House of Representatives. If immigration reform was such \na priority for the President, why didn't he do that?\n  Well, don't just take my word for it that this will make our job much \nmore difficult.\n  The junior Senator from Maine, an Independent but a Member of the \nDemocratic caucus, said of the President's Executive amnesty: I think \nit will create a backlash in the country that could actually set the \ncause back and inflame our politics in a way that I don't think will be \nconducive to solving the problem.\n  I mentioned a moment ago that the results of this anticipated action \nare all too predictable. So I would ask the President: Why in the world \nwould you want to encourage children to make one of the most dangerous \njourneys from Central America through Mexico and be subject to the \ntender mercies of these cartels, which care nothing about them? Why on \nEarth would you want to establish yet another big incentive for people \nto enter our country illegally? And why on Earth would you want to help \ncontribute to yet another humanitarian crisis on the Texas-Mexico \nborder?\n  I would urge the President, in the strongest of terms, to respect the \nrule of law and the democratic process and to give the new Congress \nthat will convene in January a chance to do our job. I don't \nunderestimate the difficulty of dealing with our broken immigration \nsystem, but I don't think we have a choice. We do not have a choice. We \nmust. And it will not be something I will like 100 percent; it won't be \nsomething any Senator or Congressman will like 100 percent. But that \nshouldn't cause us to shrink from our duty.\n  If the President is actually interested in having his last 2 years in \noffice be more productive than simply a lameduck session, he needs to \nwork with the Congress rather than go around Congress. I urge him to \nput the Constitution ahead of his campaign promises and to consider the \nlikely human cost in Mexico and elsewhere of such a lawless policy \nchange.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, a parliamentary inquiry: What is the \npending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Madam President, in a few minutes we will be voting on \nthe child care and development block grant reauthorization bill. I am \nhere to urge my colleagues to vote for final passage.\n  This bill is authored by myself, working shoulder to shoulder with \nSenator Richard Burr of North Carolina, under our chair and ranking \nmember, Senators Harkin and Alexander.\n  On this bill we showed that we can actually work together to get \nthings done. We worked across the aisle and across the dome with our \ncounterparts in the House. Today we have an opportunity to pass a bill \nthat will actually help American families with one of the biggest \nchallenges they face--affordable childcare.\n  Everywhere I go in Maryland I hear young mothers and not-so-young \nmothers and grandmothers and actually dads saying that we need \nchildcare that is affordable, accessible, reliable, and safe. This \nChild Care and Development Block Grant Act will meet those compelling \nhuman needs. It focuses on families of modest means--parents who want \nto work or get ready for work by going to school but can't afford \nchildcare.\n  I wish to take a second to talk about the process and where we stand. \nThis is\n\n[[Page S6008]]\n\na bipartisan bill. It is the result of more than 2 years of work, three \nhearings on the HELP Committee, hundreds of meetings of stakeholders. \nThe House unanimously passed the bill, and last week the Senate voted \n96 to 1 on a cloture vote. It is time now to take the bill over the \nfinish line and vote tonight.\n  This bill began in 1990, when we created the childcare program as \npart of our first step towards welfare reform. Eligible families \nreceived vouchers to pay for childcare of their choice, whether it is a \nlarge daycare center, a small in-home daycare center or faith-based.\n  This program is important because childcare for parents is \nsignificantly expensive. Childcare is the highest household expense \nfaced by dual-income families. The average childcare for two children \nis about $15,000 a year. In some places that is tuition at a prep \nschool--$15,000 to $20,000 a year. It is expensive whether you are a \ntwo-parent household or a single-parent household. For middle-class \nfamilies it is really tough, and for those earning the minimum wage it \nis out of reach, and the costs keep increasing.\n  Last year, the cost of childcare actually grew eight times faster \nthan the average family income. It is not that childcare alone \nincreased, but of course we believe family income has been stagnant for \n8 years. So we have to do something about raising the income as well as \nraising childcare standards and the ability to provide childcare.\n  Childcare is important because it helps people. In my own State this \nbill will give parents the kind of childcare vouchers needed, helping \n1.5 million children be able to have childcare. In my own home State of \nMaryland this bill will help as many as 19,000 families get childcare. \nThis is really a pretty big deal. In Maryland, childcare costs about \n$13,000 a year.\n  I held roundtables across the State. I sat in classrooms, at \nconference tables, and meetings listening in Baltimore County and \nAllegany County. I heard from parents struggling to pay childcare in \nthis age of scrimp and save. I have heard from teachers worried about \nchildren not being prepared for a lifetime of learning. I heard from \nthe American Academy of Pediatrics that is concerned about children \nstaying healthy. I heard from the good folks at the Maryland Family \nNetwork, who are worried about quality, safety, and the certification \nof childcare.\n  I believe that many of the best ideas and recommendations come from \nthe people, so I brought those ideas to Washington and sat down across \nthe table with my colleague Senator Richard Burr to really talk about \nthese issues and how we could hammer out a bill that was affordable to \nthe taxpayer and yet reliable for parents.\n  One size doesn't fit all when it comes to our kids. What I heard over \nand over again were concerns about availability, about quality, and \nalso affordability. My bill--the Mikulski, Burr, Harkin, Alexander or \nwhatever order we can put it in--makes childcare better. It makes it \nsafer, it makes it more reliable, and it also focuses on helping \nchildren to be school-ready, to be learning-ready.\n  It requires, first of all, in terms of safety, comprehensive \nbackground checks. Only 13 States require comprehensive background \nchecks for childcare providers. We require more background checks for \nmall security guards than we do for our own children. This is \nunacceptable. Parents deserve peace of mind knowing that their children \nare safe from anyone who could possibly have a criminal record. Under \nour bill, 50 States will be required to do this.\n  It also strengthens health and safety standards. Listening to both \nconcerned parents and the American Academy of Pediatrics, we will have \nhealth and safety standards. Childcare providers will be trained in \nfirst aid and CPR, in the prevention of sudden infant death syndrome, \nand also how to respond to food allergies. This is big. Our children \ncome and some of those little guys and girls really have some \nsignificant health challenges.\n\n  It also requires inspection of facilities. Currently, many States do \nnot require inspection of all childcare facilities. The Washington Post \nrecently found that 43 children have died since 2004 in unregulated \nchildcare centers in Virginia. We have now corrected that where \nfacilities will actually be inspected to make sure they are safe. It \nalso will make sure that inspectors will be looking for anything that \npresents a danger to a child--an unsecured swimming pool, unsafe \nsleeping arrangements, and fire hazards. It will improve reliability \nand stability of care.\n  Now, we really focused on improving quality of child care. What that \nmeans is we have significant sums, which means that States have to \ninvest in training and professional development of childcare workers. \nIt also will evaluate what is working and what isn't. We developed an \nimproved quality rating system to give parents--the consumer--\ninformation to pick the right care.\n  This bill will provide vouchers to people who are at the minimum wage \nor lower. In my own State, to qualify for this type of voucher subsidy, \nit is income-based. In Maryland, for a family of two to be eligible for \nthe CCDBG, their incomes cannot exceed $24,000. A family of four cannot \nhave an income that exceeds $35,700. The children must be less than 13 \nyears old, and the children must live with parents who are working or \nenrolled in an education program that is leading to a job.\n  This is really good. But this bill--as good as it is--it is only the \nfirst step in childcare. It can't be the only step. So while we are \nlooking for how to help parents be able to work, particularly those at \nthe minimum-wage level, we have to be able to look also at our middle-\nclass families. That is why I was happy to join Senator Kirsten \nGillibrand in introducing the childcare tax deduction bill, S. 1975. \nThis bill would allow all families to deduct the cost of childcare as a \nbusiness expense. Imagine that--to actually be able to do this. So many \nwomen in the middle class also find that the cost of childcare is so \nexpensive. With this bill families can deduct up to $14,000 in child \ncare expenses from the amount of taxes they owe. We have to show that \nwe are on the side of families, that we are on the side of the middle \nclass, by offering a substantial tax deduction for childcare; and we \nhave to show that we are on the side of the people who want to be \nmiddle class, who are working harder, going to school to be able to \nmove ahead and move into that middle class, and that they have the \nchildcare bill. This legislation, the Child Care and Development Block \nGrant Act, will make a significant step forward. I urge my colleagues \nto help and support this.\n  When I worked on this bill, to me it is not about numbers and \nstatistics--19,000 or 1 million children or so on. It is about people \nin my own home State--whether it is the single mom in Baltimore County \nwho, due to some major changes, found that she was needing to work full \ntime instead of part time but was barely above the minimum wage. She \nwondered how she was going to have that job at the minimum wage but \nhave childcare that was safe. When she went to the department of social \nservices, she found a childcare subsidy that could help her be able to \nwork today, have her children in daycare today, and lay the groundwork \nfor a better job tomorrow.\n  Then there was Theresa, a single mom in Prince George's County. She \nhas four children. They were enrolled in a childcare program while she \nworked in another. She was making $23,000 a year--again, below the \nminimum wage. Thanks to the voucher program, she was able to provide \nher children with childcare, actually work in the field, and begin to \nget the kind of training that could enable her to move on up to being a \nchildcare worker.\n  It is about these people who want their child to be safe and secure. \nThey want to make sure they are going to do the best and be able to \ncontinue to work in our society, make sure their children are taken \ncare of, and also that we are able to provide this important step.\n  I hope we pass this bill tonight. I also hope that we develop a \ncomprehensive childcare approach so that we are helping those at the \nminimum wage and slightly above tonight, but we also want to be able to \nhelp the middle class.\n  Remember what our goal is. We need to focus on the day-to-day needs \nof our constituents. What does that mean in terms of national policy? \nWhat we need to look at is for those who are middle class--through \ntheir hard work, their\n\n[[Page S6009]]\n\neducation and determination, however they get to be there--that they \nhave a government and a Tax Code on their side, and for those who are \ntrying to get to the middle class, that they have an opportunity ladder \nand the self-help tools that enable them to move ahead.\n  I really hope my colleagues vote for this bill and we move it to the \nPresident's desk for signature.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a CCDBG fact sheet be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            CCDBG Fact Sheet\n\n\n S. 1086--The Child Care & Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act of 2014\n\n     The Child Care Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act of 2014\n       This bipartisan bill (S. 1086) was introduced by Senators \n     Mikulski, Burr, Harkin, and Alexander. It reauthorizes, \n     refreshes, reforms, and revitalizes the Child Care \n     Development Block Grant (CCDBG) program.\n     What the CCDBG Program Does\n       The CCDBG program was first signed into law by President \n     George H.W. Bush in 1990 to assist working families with the \n     cost of providing child care. It has not been reauthorized \n     since 1996.\n       CCDBG is the primary source of federal funding for child \n     care assistance. CCDBG is administered to states in formula \n     block grants. States use the funding to help low-income \n     families gain access to quality, affordable child care and \n     after-school programs while parents work, train for work, or \n     attend school. Assistance is administered through vouchers or \n     certificates, which can be used by parents for the provider \n     or program of their choice--whether in a family child care \n     home, with a relative or friend, or in a child care center.\n     Who the CCDBG Program Serves\n       CCDBG serves more than 1.6 million children every month.\n     Eligibility Requirements for CCDBG Assistance\n       There are certain requirements that must be met for \n     families to be eligible for CCDBG assistance:\n       Family income cannot exceed 85% of the state median (states \n     have flexibility to adopt income eligibility limits below \n     this federal maximum, and generally do)\n       Example: In MD, for a family of two to be eligible for \n     CCDBG funds, their annual income cannot exceed $24,277; a \n     family of four cannot have an income that exceeds $35,702\n       Kids must be less than 13 years old\n       Kids must live with parents who are working, enrolled in \n     school/training, or be in need of protective services\n     Amount of Subsidy\n       The CCDBG program generally requires that families \n     contribute to the cost of care on a sliding fee scale basis. \n     Federal regulations do allow states to waive child care fees \n     for families with incomes at or below poverty guidelines. HHS \n     has suggested that a family's fee should be no more than 10% \n     of its income.\n       In FYI2, the average monthly subsidy paid to a family with \n     an infant younger than 1 year was $467. The average monthly \n     subsidy paid to a family with a child between the age of 5-6 \n     years of age was $365.\n     Funding Level for the CCDBG Program\n       In the FY14 omnibus, the CCDBG program was funded at $2.36 \n     billion. This is an increase of $154 million above FY13. This \n     funding increase will ensure 22,000 additional children will \n     receive child care assistance.\n       In addition to discretionary funding, mandatory funding \n     exists for child care subsidies (authorized in Social \n     Security Act). In FY14, there were $2.9 billion in mandatory \n     funds--for a total of approximately $5.3 billion for child \n     care subsidies.\n     Cost of Child Care\n       Child care is the highest household expense faced by dual \n     income households, averaging $14,872 a year for 2 kids.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I want to speak in support of the Child \nCare and Development Block Grant Act of 2014, the bill that is before \nus. It has taken us a long time to get to this point. I cannot be more \npleased that we are on the verge of sending this legislation to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  We know--we know--that learning begins at birth and the preparation \nfor education begins even before birth. That is why I am very excited \nabout my committee's bill to reauthorize the Child Care and Development \nBlock Grant Act. This bill will lead to important reforms and \nimprovements to the early care and education of our Nation's children.\n  This bipartisan legislation is also a big win for working families. \nIt helps make it possible for over 1.5 million kids to receive quality \nchildcare every month. The last time we reauthorized the child care \nblock grant was 1996. When we did that, childcare was seen principally \nas a work support activity and only incidentally as something that \ncould have a great impact on the development of children. Today, backed \nby impressive scientific research, we know that childcare settings can \nand should be much more. In addition to providing critical work support \nfor the parents, early childhood settings are now widely recognized as \na rich early learning opportunity for all children.\n  So it is not just childcare--we are taking care and watching them so \nthey don't get in trouble--it is now childcare that is part of the \nlearning process. As I said, it begins at birth and even before birth. \nBecause much of a child's intellect and skills development begin before \nhe or she begins kindergarten, we need to give all children every \nopportunity to reach their full potential at this early stage. This \nmeans supporting access to high-quality early learning programs, \nincluding high-quality childcare. That is why reauthorizing the child \ncare development block grant with the array of reforms and improvements \nis so important.\n  This bill contains many commonsense improvements to a program that \nhasn't been reauthorized, as I said, since 1996. That is nearly a whole \ngeneration. We have improved the health and safety requirements by \nasking States to increase the amount of funding they set aside to serve \ninfants and toddlers. We require pre-service training and ongoing \nprofessional development for childcare workers. We ask that States \ninspect childcare providers at least once a year--hopefully more, but \nat least once a year.\n\n  I am particularly excited about the set-aside that we have in the \nbill to improve access to and quality of care for infants and toddlers. \nThis is something I included for several years in my appropriations \nsubcommittee bill, and I am pleased that it is now an important \ncomponent of this reauthorization. These are the kinds of commonsense, \nresearch-based activities and services that any parent would want for \ntheir child, and they deserve it. That is why I am so pleased we are \nnow on the cusp of passing this important reauthorization.\n  I should note that this legislation passed the Senate in March of \nthis year by a vote of 96 to 2, and after a few changes by the House, \nit passed that Chamber by acclamation in September. I believe we had \nthe cloture vote last week, and even then I think there was only one \nvote against it.\n  I encourage every Member of the Senate to vote in favor of final \npassage and finally get this bill to the President's desk.\n  I wish to especially thank Senators Mikulski and Burr--two members of \nour committee and the original sponsors of this legislation--for their \npersistence and commitment in getting this bill done.\n  I would also like to thank many of the staff for their years of work \non this legislation.\n  I would like to thank Brent Palmer and Jessica McNiece of Senator \nMikulski's staff; David Cleary, Peter Oppenheim, and Patrick Murray of \nSenator Alexander's staff; Chris Toppings and Celia Simms of Senator \nBurr's staff.\n  I would like to thank current and past members of my staff: Pam \nSmith, Derek Miller, Mildred Otero, and Mario Cardona. Of course, I \nalso wish to thank our HELP Committee's ranking member Senator \nAlexander for his key role in reauthorizing this vital program. And my \ndebt of gratitude to Senator Alexander extends far beyond this \nparticular bill.\n  This will likely be the last bill originating in the HELP Committee \nto see floor time in this Congress, and thus, this is the last bill \nthat will come to the Senate floor out of the committee I so proudly \nchair.\n  I wish to take this opportunity to express not only my gratitude to \nSenator Alexander but my respect and admiration for the senior Senator \nfrom Tennessee. In the new Congress in January, Senator Alexander will \nassume\n\n[[Page S6010]]\n\nthe chairmanship of this HELP Committee, and I know this important \ncommittee will be in very able hands.\n  Throughout my 30 years in the Senate, I have been blessed to share \nmany excellent working relationships with Republican colleagues, both \nwhen I served as chair or ranking member on various committees. Senator \nArlen Specter was my partner for many years on the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and \nRelated Agencies. In fact, from 1989 until the day he left the Senate, \nSenator Specter and I were either chair or ranking member of that \nimportant Appropriations subcommittee.\n  I had great relationships on the agriculture committee with Senator \nDick Lugar, Senator Thad Cochran, and Senator Saxby Chambliss. Since \n2009, as chair of the HELP Committee, I have enjoyed very productive \nrelationships, first with Senator Mike Enzi, who had been both the \nchair and then ranking member of that committee, and more recently with \nSenator Lamar Alexander, with whom I have worked on CCDBG--the Child \nCare and Development Block Grant Program that we are now authorizing.\n  In fact, I am proud to note that when this bill is signed into law by \nthe President, this will be the 21st HELP Committee bill enacted into \nlaw in this Congress. In a Congress that has been criticized, \nrightfully or wrongfully, for its lack of productivity, Senator \nAlexander and I have forged a partnership that has enabled us to chart \na different course--a course of bipartisan productiveness. To cite \nseveral examples, we worked together to pass major legislation to \nrevamp and modernize America's job training system, overhaul and \nimprove America's food safety system, improve drug safety and speed the \napproval of potentially lifesaving drugs--so 21 bills.\n  Someone said that our committee really represents probably one of the \nwidest spectrums ideologically in the Senate--both from very \nconservative to very progressive on our committee. Yet we forged these \nrelationships to get things done. Now, just because these relationships \nhave helped us to get these bills through, it doesn't mean that we \nalways agreed on everything.\n  The fact is our disagreements have been oftentimes and vigorous. \nAfter all, I am a proud progressive and Senator Alexander is a proud \nconservative, but our disagreements have never been personal and they \nwere never the last word. We have consistently sought areas of \nagreement, and more often than not, we found them. As a result, we have \nforged a remarkable record of accomplishment in the HELP Committee with \n21 bills in 2 years signed into law.\n  More importantly, we have accomplished big things for the American \npeople. Thanks to legislation passed by our committee, lives will be \nimproved and lives will be saved. Drugs will be approved faster and \nthey will be safer. Workers will have access to quality job training \nand retraining opportunities, including young people with disabilities \nwho will now have provisions to support them in school to get them \nready for competitive, integrated employment or for higher education or \nfor technical education, which they have not really had before. That is \none big part of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act that we \npassed that not too many people know about. So from now on, kids in \nschool who have an IEP--an Individualized Education Program--will now \nhave internships, summer jobs, and job coaching that will, again, raise \ntheir expectations and hope of what they can do. They will be able to \nvisit colleges and have college internships or college support systems, \nwhich they have never had before, to enable them to seek a higher \neducation or perhaps to go to community colleges. Those are a few of \nthe things we have done on our committee. Soon, with this bill, babies \nand kids across the country will have better access to safe, high \nquality, and affordable care.\n\n  It has been with great pride that I have been chair of this HELP \nCommittee. I still think it is the best committee in the Congress. I \nremember once Dan Inouye--Senator Inouye--said that I chaired the \ncommittee that helped define America. He chaired the committee that \ndefended America, but I chaired the committee that defined America. I \nwould like to think of the HELP Committee as doing that--an America \nwhere every kid has the possibility of going up that ladder or ramp of \nopportunity no matter the circumstances of his or her birth, where \nhealth care is a right and not a privilege, where everyone will have \naffordable health care coverage.\n  This committee has even helped those who have fallen off of that \nladder of opportunity because of an illness or injury to get back on it \nwith job retraining and support services. This committee has ensured \nthat every person with a disability--either through an accident or \nthrough birth or illness--can have a full and meaningful and productive \nlife. Our elderly know they are going to have the kind of support \nsystems that will enable them to also be productive in their retirement \nyears--in their golden years, as they say.\n  The Labor, Education, Health, and Pensions Committee covers a broad \narray of how we define America as a caring, compassionate, and \nproductive society. It has been a challenge, but it has also been a \ngreat honor and privilege to chair this committee.\n  As I leave, I can say we are fortunate to have someone of Senator \nAlexander's depth and breadth of experience. In fact, he has been the \nSecretary of Education, Governor of Tennessee, and President of the \nUniversity of Tennessee. He is well qualified, and I know he will do a \ngreat job in leading this committee in the future.\n  I wish to thank all of my committee members, but especially Senator \nLamar Alexander from Tennessee, and let him know on the record how much \nI valued our collaboration and how much I benefited from his counsel \nand his wisdom.\n  I urge all Senators to support this new reauthorization--the first \ntime since 1996--of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Program.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I see my distinguished friend the \nSenator from Iowa on the floor. I am here, very simply, to say that we \nare about to vote on the Child Care and Development Block Grant, a \npiece of legislation that would provide childcare to 1.5 million \nchildren so that their mothers can work or continue their education or \ntraining.\n  I have repeated on this floor several times the story of a young \nwoman in Memphis, TN, who attended LeMoyne-Owen College and received \nabout $500 a month to pay for childcare for her child so she could get \nher degree. She then graduated from LeMoyne-Owen with a business degree \nand was able to work her way up to the position of assistant manager at \na local Walmart. The block grant helped her be able to continue her \neducation and obtain a good job so that she can now pay for the \nchildcare costs of her second child on her own.\n  This bill has strong support on both sides of the aisle, but we \nRepublicans especially like it because it is a block grant to the \nStates. The grant gives States flexibility with minimal Federal rules. \nIt also encourages the use of vouchers allowing that young mother I \njust mentioned to choose among her various options for childcare.\n  It doesn't mandate from Washington, it enables from Washington. It \nrecognizes that leaders in States have very good judgment, and what \nmight work in Hawaii might not in Tennessee or Iowa. Different programs \nmay work better in different jurisdictions, and that mothers themselves \nought to be able to make the judgment of where their child receives \ncare.\n  I wish to thank Senator Harkin, who is retiring this year, and who is \nchairman of the committee that has produced this bill. He and Senator \nMikulski and Senator Burr have worked for years on this piece of \nlegislation. It received a lot of consideration in the Senate and in \nthe House. We all would like to see the Senate function better, and it \ndid function better for this bill. When we first brought this to the \nSenate floor in March, the majority leader\n\n[[Page S6011]]\n\ndidn't fill the tree or file cloture. We considered 50 amendments and \nadopted 18 of them. Fourteen of them we agreed to adopt by voice vote, \nfour of them received roll call votes, and then we passed the bill 96 \nto 2. The House made a few minor changes in it. They did it while \nconsulting with Senator Harkin and me and others who did work on the \nbill, and we have come to this point today.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation, helping 900,000 \nfamilies, 1.5 million children across the country. In Tennessee alone, \n21,000 families will be helped by this. In our society today, worksite \ndaycare is not available to every single mother or father who has a \nchild, and this helps with that.\n  I thank the Senate for its consideration of this very important bill. \nI thank the House for working with the Senate and I congratulate \nSenator Harkin. I imagine he has mentioned it, but if he hasn't, this \nwill be the 21st piece of legislation the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee has produced this year that will become law under \nhis leadership. As Senator Harkin goes back to Des Moines, IA, and \nrocks on his front porch and pursues the next chapter of his life, he \ncan say that in the Senate, which didn't always work that well in this \nCongress, his committee did, and it has benefited lots of families and \nlots of children.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the bill, and I am glad to see it \nas a good example of what I hope to see more of as we move into the new \nyear.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n\n\n   Recognizing Homeless Children and Families in the Child Care and \n                      Development Block Grant Act\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I come to the floor today to speak \nabout the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act. I'm glad to say \nthat the bill before us today contains a number of provisions intended \nto facilitate homeless families' access to quality child care. I \nappreciate the work of my colleagues, particularly Chairman Harkin, \nSenator Mikulski and Ranking Member Miller, in supporting these \nimportant new provisions.\n  Unfortunately, young children who are homeless are more likely to \nhave developmental delays, and more health and mental health problems, \nthan low-income housed children. At the same time, their mothers are \nless likely to receive childcare subsidies than are poor mothers at-\nrisk of homelessness. So I believe that this legislation will be \nimportant in helping rectify this inequity.\n  However, I want to ensure there is a common understanding of who we \nintend to include within the definition of homeless families or \nhomeless children. The most common Federal definition of homelessness \nis found in the McKinney-Vento Act's Education for Homeless Children \nand Youth Program, at 42 U.S.C. Sec. 11434A. That definition applies to \npublic schools, including local educational agency preschool programs, \nand is used in the Head Start Act, Higher Education Act, and the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, among others. The \ndefinition includes children and youth who are staying in motels, or \nwith others temporarily because they have nowhere else to go. Eighty \npercent of the homeless children and youth enrolled in public schools \nlast year were staying in these situations when they were first \nidentified.\n  Is it the chairman's intention that the definition of homeless to be \napplied to the provisions of this bill be the definition from subtitle \nVII-B of the McKinney-Vento Act, the Education for Homeless Children \nand Youth program?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator for her important \nquestion. Her understanding is correct. The definition of homeless \nchildren and youth found at 42 U.S.C. Sec. 11434A is the definition we \nintend to apply to homeless children and families where those terms are \nused in this bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank the Senator for that \nclarification, which will assist States in implementing the provisions \nof this bill by aligning definitions across Federal programs serving \nhomeless families.\n  This bill overlaps with the McKinney-Vento Act in another way which I \nwould like to clarify. This bill requires State plans to describe how \nthe State will coordinate childcare services with programs for children \nin preschool programs and other early childhood programs serving \nhomeless children and children in foster care, in order to expand \naccessibility and continuity of care and assist children enrolled in \nearly childhood programs to receive full-day services.\n  The McKinney-Vento Act's Education for Homeless Children and Youth \nprogram is the only education program specifically designed to promote \nacademic success for homeless students. The McKinney-Vento Act requires \nevery local educational agency to designate a homeless education \nliaison, whose job includes identifying homeless children and youth and \nensuring homeless children and families receive educational services \nfor they are eligible, including Head Start and preschool programs \nadministered by the local educational agency. In order for States to \nexpand accessibility and continuity of care for homeless children, it \nis critically important that McKinney-Vento liaisons are among the \nprofessionals with whom States and child care providers coordinate.\n  Is it Senator Mikulski's understanding and intention that McKinney-\nVento homeless education liaisons be included among those programs for \nchildren in preschool programs and other early childhood programs \nserving homeless children with which States should coordinate child \ncare services?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I thank the Senator for raising the \nissue of local educational agency McKinney-Vento homeless education \nliaisons. Given their central role and responsibility in identifying \nhomeless children and ensuring they receive education and early \nchildhood education services for which they are eligible, liaisons are \nimportant partners in coordinating childcare services. The Senate-\npassed version of this legislation had called for coordination with \nMcKinney-Vento homeless education liaisons. It is indeed our intention \nthat State plans include a description of how the State will coordinate \nchildcare services with McKinney-Vento homeless education liaisons.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank the Senator for clarifying the \nbill's intent that McKinney-Vento liaisons be part of States' \ncoordination of childcare services.\n  I would also like to clarify the intent behind two related bill \nprovisions. First, this bill requires State plans to include a \ncertification that there are in effect in the State requirements \napplicable to childcare providers which are designed to protect \nchildren's health and safety, including the establishment of a grace \nperiod that allows homeless children and children in foster care to \nreceive services while their families are taking any necessary actions \nto comply with immunization and other health and safety requirements. \nThis provision is similar to language found in the McKinney-Vento Act \nand the Head Start Act. It recognizes that families experiencing \nhomelessness have particular challenges in producing health records and \nother documents, due largely to their poverty and unstable living \nsituations.\n  At the same time, the bill requires States to use funds for \nactivities that improve access to childcare services, including the use \nof procedures to permit enrollment--after an initial eligibility \ndetermination--of homeless children while required documentation is \nobtained. I would ask the chairman, is it the intent of the bill \nlanguage that regardless of the procedures States use to permit \nenrollment while required documentation is obtained, States still must \nestablish a grace period that allows homeless children to receive \nservices while their families are taking any necessary actions to \ncomply with immunization and other health and safety requirements?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, again, I thank the Senator for this \nclarifying question. Under this bill, State plans must include a \ncertification that there are in effect in the State requirements that \ninclude the establishment of a grace period that allows homeless \nchildren to receive services while their families are taking any \nnecessary actions to comply with immunization and other health and \nsafety requirements. That requirement stands apart from procedures the \nState uses to permit enrollment of homeless children while other \nrequired documentation is obtained.\n\n[[Page S6012]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, Thank you for that explanation. I am \npleased to hear that homeless children will be able to receive services \nwhile their families are taking actions to comply with immunization and \nother health and safety requirements.\n  Regarding enrollment while other required documentation is obtained, \nthe bill language requires that States use procedures to ensure such \nenrollment occurs after an initial eligibility determination is made. \nYet, eligibility documentation is among the required documentation \nhomeless families must produce. However, we know that homeless families \nstruggle to produce documents, due to their poverty and mobility. Can \nSenator Mikulski, please clarify the intent of the phrase ``after an \ninitial eligibility determination?''\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, The language calls for procedures to \npermit enrollment of homeless children, after an initial eligibility \ndetermination, while required documentation is obtained. To implement \nthis language and its intent, States will need to implement procedures \nto make abbreviated initial eligibility determinations of homeless \nchildren and enroll them immediately, while required documentation, \nincluding some documentation to prove eligibility, is obtained.\n  For example, a State could adopt a procedure that a child referred by \na local educational agency McKinney-Vento homeless liaison would be \ndetermined to be initially eligible and enrolled in services \nimmediately, while required documentation is obtained. The family then \nwould have to take necessary steps to provide standard documentation to \nestablish eligibility.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank Senator Mikulski for that \nimportant clarification. The intent of the bill as she describes it \nwill greatly improve homeless children's access to childcare. I \nappreciate the Senator's dedication to this legislation, which helps \nexpand opportunity for families and enhance the quality of childcare \nfor young people across the country.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I support the Child Care and Development \nBlock Grant, CCDBG, reauthorization bill, S. 1086, which is now pending \nbefore the Senate. I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation, which \nwould send it to the President for his signature. I want to \ncongratulate my colleagues, Senator Mikulski for her leadership on this \nbill, and Senator Harkin, Senator Alexander, and Senator Burr. This \nreauthorization has truly been a bipartisan effort and illustrative of \nthe Senate HELP Committee's effectiveness this Congress, and I \ncongratulate Senator Harkin on his leadership of this committee as he \nretires from Congress next month. Through the HELP Committee's \nleadership and work with their House counterparts, this legislation \nwill serve to better support working families and children and make a \nsignificant improvement to our current childcare programs.\n  The last time we authorized this program was in 1996. I know that \nvery well because I was serving in the House of Representatives at the \ntime and had the opportunity to be the ranking member on the Human \nResources Subcommittee in the House Ways and Means Committee that was \nconsidering welfare reform and childcare, and how we could reward \nfamilies for work, and how our welfare system could become a \ntransitional program rather than a permanent program that would allow \npeople, particularly moms, to be able to get into the workforce, stay \nin the workforce and climb up the economic ladder.\n  Today, under CCDBG, there are 1.6 million children eligible for \nprogram services. CCDBG provides not only a safe environment for those \nchildren, but allows 70 percent of their parents to work and an \neducational opportunity for the child at the same time. A Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families, TANF, study showed that parents who had \ntheir children in childcare for 2 years or more were more likely to \nremain employed. CCDBG provides stable employment, help for the child, \nand a positive economic situation for the family.\n  This bi-cameral, bi-partisan CCDBG reauthorization bill before us \nmakes improvements to this successful program, as it should. It allows \nthe States to develop 13 specific health and safety standards, such as \nfirst aid and CPR, and SIDS, sudden infant death syndrome. It is \nkeeping our children safer in childcare by having safety standards that \nare developed. This legislation: requires the States to do annual \nhealth, safety, and fire inspections of nearly all childcare providers; \nexpands comprehensive background checks for those who are involved in \nchildcare; steadily increases the annual authorization of \nappropriations; phases in a doubling of the annual set-aside for \nquality initiatives to 9 percent by 2019; makes information available \nonline for parents to make informed childcare decisions; promotes more \ntransparency in the program; and provides additional State flexibility \non how they can set priorities within the childcare program. This \nprogram is a model of how federalism should operate, with the Federal \nGovernment and the States collaborating together to improve the quality \nof life for many middle-class American families.\n  This legislation will accomplish our objectives so we can get more \npeople into the workforce and provide access to early childhood \neducation to help children succeed in life. This program will allow us \nto help American families and strengthen the economic security of \nAmerica.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I suggest the absence fo a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while I was unable to vote on the \nmotion to concur in the House Amendment to S. 1086, Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant Act of 2014, I would have recorded a vote in \nopposition to this bill, just as I did when this bill was originally \nbefore the Senate in February. I have three reasons to oppose this \nbill.\n  First, the Constitution does not permit the Federal Government to \noperate this program. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution lists \nall the powers given to the Federal Government, none of which includes \nfunding for and oversight of State and local child care programs.\n  Second, this bill will increase the authorized size of the Child Care \nand Development Block Grant, CCDBG, program by over $1 billion without \neliminating or reducing a lower priority program elsewhere. At a time \nwhen our national debt is over $17 trillion, Congress continues to \nspend away the future of the next generation. This reauthorization will \nexacerbate this problem, and our children will deal with the harsh \nconsequences of our Nation's future fiscal insolvency.\n  Third, this CCDBG reauthorization does not address previously \nidentified duplication and overlap in existing Federal child care \nprograms and tax expenditures. While it does include a provision for \nthe Department of Health and Human Services to study the issue, I do \nnot believe it goes far enough. The Government Accountability Office \nhas already identified 33 programs for which child care is an eligible \nuse of funds. For example, States often transfer billions of dollars in \nfunding from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant \nprogram to use in their child care programs. Ultimately, this kind of \noverlap and duplication underscores Congress' reckless disregard for \nour future well-being.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/17/senate-section/article/S6013-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6013-S6014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session.\n  The majority leader.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding \nrule XXII, following the cloture vote on Executive Calendar No. 858, \nthe Senate consider Calendar Nos. 1050, 898, 961, and 533--these are \ncareer ambassadors, in case anyone wants to know--that there be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees prior to each vote; that upon the use or yielding back of \ntime the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on \nthe nominations in the order listed; that any rollcall votes following \nthe first in the series be 10 minutes in length; that if any nomination \nis confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions \nbe in order to the nomination; that any statements related to the \nnomination be printed in the Record; and that the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection?\n  Mr. REID. We expect these nominations to be approved by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we will vote to end Republican \nfilibusters on three district court nominations for Georgia, two of \nwhich are judicial emergency vacancies. The Senate should not need to \nwaste our time jumping through these procedural hurdles to confirm \nnominees who are strongly supported by two Republican home State \nSenators.\n  After we vote to invoke cloture and confirm these three nominees, we \nwill still have 17 judicial nominees pending on the Executive \nCalendar--11 to serve on district courts and 6 to serve on the U.S. \nCourt of Federal Claims. Another nine judicial nominees will be \nrecommended by the Judiciary Committee this Thursday. By the end of the \nweek, there will be 26 nominees reported favorably by the Judiciary \nCommittee pending before the full Senate. All but a few of these \nnominees will have been reported unanimously and several are from \nStates with at least one and sometimes two Republican home State \nSenators, including: Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Missouri, \nIllinois, and Texas. These nominees should all be confirmed before we \nrecess in December. As I mentioned last week, I hope that Senate \nRepublicans will work with Senate Democrats to ``clear the decks'' on \npending business before the end of the 113th Congress, as the incoming \nmajority leader has suggested.\n  So let us work together as we have in past lameduck sessions to get \nthese nominees confirmed and serving their communities. In 2002, after \nthe midterm elections, Senate Democrats worked to confirm all 20 of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees pending on the Executive Calendar \nall but one by voice vote. In the 2006 lameduck session, after Senate \nDemocrats won the majority in the elections, Democrats agreed to \nconfirm all 14 of President Bush's judicial nominations pending on the \nExecutive Calendar, but this package was blocked by a Republican \nSenator. In the most recent lameduck sessions, in 2010 and 2012, a \ntotal of 32 judicial nominees were confirmed. We should do the same \nnow.\n  Leslie Abrams is nominated to fill a vacancy in the U.S. District \nCourt for the Middle District of Georgia. She is currently an assistant \nU.S. attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District \nof Georgia. Prior to becoming an assistant U.S. attorney, she was in \nprivate practice at two nationally known law firms. After graduating \nfrom Yale Law School, Ms. Abrams served as a law clerk to Judge Marvin \nJ. Garbis on the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.\n  Mark Cohen is nominated to fill an emergency vacancy in the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Georgia. He has extensive \nexperience, having practiced for over 30 years in both the public and \nprivate sectors. Currently a partner at the law firm Troutman Sanders, \nMr. Cohen has also served as counsel to former Georgia Governor, Zell \nMiller, and spent part of his legal career at the Georgia office of the \nattorney general.\n  Eleanor Ross is nominated to fill an emergency vacancy in the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Georgia. She currently \nserves as a State court judge in DeKalb County, where she has presided \nover hundreds of cases dealing with both civil and criminal matters. \nPrior to becoming a judge, she served in various capacities as both a \nState and Federal prosecutor for over a decade. Throughout her legal \ncareer, she has tried over 150 cases to verdict.\n  All three of these nominees have the strong support of their \nRepublican home State Senators, Senator Chambliss and Senator Isakson. \nAll three were also reported unanimously from the Judiciary Committee 5 \nmonths ago by voice vote.\n  If confirmed, Leslie Abrams and Eleanor Ross will be the first \nAfrican-American women to ever serve as Federal judges in the State of \nGeorgia. This historic moment is long overdue.\n\n[[Page S6014]]\n\n  In the few remaining days of this Congress, I hope that the \nRepublican Senators who recommended many of the pending judicial \nnominees to the President will work within their caucus to get consent \nto confirm nominees to their own home States.\n  I hope that all Senators will vote to end the filibuster of these \nnominations today and confirm them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the Abrams nomination.\n  Mr. REID. I yield back all time on this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

He \nalso served as the 19th Commandant of the U.S. Army Sergeants Major \nAcademy, the first enlisted commandant of that academy in its history.\n  I know that SMA Chandler is looking forward to spending more time \nwith his family, including his twelve grandchildren, and I wish he and \nhis wife Jeanne the very best. On behalf of a grateful nation, I thank \nSergeant Major of the Army Chandler and his family for their many years \nof commitment, sacrifices, and service to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/17/senate-section/article/S6016-6", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING TURNER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

This year, Turner Elementary was one of only 337 schools \nacross the country and the only school from Maine to receive this \nprestigious recognition of high accomplishment by the U.S. Department \nof Education.\n  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Award honors schools that \nare either academically superior in their States or that demonstrate \nsignificant gains in student achievement. The schools singled out for \nthis national recognition are models of high educational standards and \naccountability.\n  This award recognizes the remarkable progress that Turner Elementary \nhas made over the past several years in closing student achievement \ngaps. These outstanding improvements can be attributed to the school's \nemphasis on professional development opportunities for its teachers and \nto its commitment to educating the whole child. Turner Elementary has \nstrengthened its curriculum initiatives in math, reading, and writing \nand has also benefited greatly from its talented and dedicated \nleadership team, which helps students, parents, and educators set and \nreach their goals.\n  I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has selected \nTurner Elementary School for this well-deserved honor and congratulate \nnot only the students but also the administrators, teachers, staff, and \nparents on this outstanding achievement.

By giving the student body a variety of tools \nfor early educational development, such as flexibility to pursue their \nown reading interests and observing the many facets of nature outside \nof the classroom, the staff at Sprunica Elementary School provides \nstudents with an independent and hands on learning environment. \nStudents can be challenged at their own pace.

This was the brightest \nof spotlights--the bowl game between No. 2 Penn State and No. 1 Miami \nstill remains the most viewed college football game of all time and \nConlan's performance was worthy of the stage. Despite an injured knee \nand a twisted ankle, Conlan intercepted his Heisman Trophy-winning \nopponent two times, returning one for 40 yards to set up Penn State's \ngame-winning touchdown. This National Championship victory against a \nhighly favored opponent and the accompanying defensive most valuable \nplayer award would be crowning achievements in a storied college \ncareer.\n  Mr. Conlan's origins are much more modest than that memorable night \nin the desert of Arizona. This son of a State policeman and a grocery \nstore clerk grew up in a western New York town that was too small for \neven a stoplight. The relative obscurity of Frewsburg almost hid the \nyoung Conlan's athletic prowess. Even though he was named Western New \nYork Player of the Year in 1981, Mr. Conlan only had one scholarship \noffer waiting for him when he graduated high school: Penn State.\n  In State College Mr. Conlan would evolve from a 6'3\", 185 pound, \nmild-mannered freshman to become one of the most significant \ncontributors to Penn State's cherished legacy as ``Linebacker U.'' A 4-\nyear letterman, 3-year starter, and first-team All-American, Mr. Conlan \nhelped lead a football team that would go 23-to-1 over his final 2 \nyears. In a lasting display of the reverence for Mr. Conlan in Happy \nValley, several star linebackers at his alma mater have since donned \nhis No. 31 as a tribute to his success and leadership, while he wore \nthe blue and white. This October 25 his university and fans honored Mr. \nConlan once again with a mid game salute by a sold-out crowd of 107,895 \nat Beaver Stadium.\n  After graduation from Penn State with a degree in administration of \njustice, success would follow Mr. Conlan\n\n[[Page S6018]]\n\nto the National Football League. There he would be named Defensive \nRookie of the Year and earn three trips to the Pro Bowl during a 9-year \ncareer. Today, Mr. Conlan resides in the Pittsburgh area with his wife \nCaroline and their four children: Patrick, Christopher, Mary Katherine, \nand Daniel.\n  I am privileged to have the opportunity and the venue to offer \ncongratulations to this adopted son of my State and thank him for his \nsignificant contributions to college football, the Penn State \nUniversity community, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I wish him \nall the best as he is inducted as a member of the College Football Hall \nof Fame this December. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/17/senate-section/article/S6018-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         LINCOLN, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nLincoln, NH--a town in Grafton County that is celebrating the 250th \nanniversary of its founding. I am proud to join citizens across the \nGranite State in recognizing this historic occasion.\n  Located in the heart of the White Mountains, Lincoln is renowned for \nits spectacular scenery. Several of New Hampshire's natural wonders are \nin Lincoln, including ``the basin'' at Franconia Notch State Park, \nIndian Head Profile Rock formation, and the Flume Gorge--all examples \nof the Granite State's unique natural beauty.\n  The town of Lincoln was named for Henry Fiennes Pelham-Clinton, the \n2nd Duke of Newcastle, 9th Earl of Lincoln. It was granted in 1764 by \ncolonial Governor Benning Wentworth to a group of 70 land investors \nfrom Connecticut. The grant was so large that today Lincoln remains the \nsecond largest town by area in the State.\n  Lincoln's location near the Pemigewasset River was integral to the \ndevelopment of its logging and paper industries, an important part of \nthe town's history. By the mid-19th century, Lincoln was a center for \nprocessing and shipping timber. North Country businessman James E. \nHenry purchased over 100,000 acres of timber at the turn of the century \nand constructed a pulp and paper mill to process the wood in what is \nnow the center of Lincoln. Henry also built the Lincoln House Hotel to \nhouse the increasing number of tourists eager to experience the beauty \nof the White Mountains.\n  Today, the population of Lincoln has grown to over 1,600 residents, \nand the town has become one of New Hampshire's most popular tourist \ndestinations. Visitors come from across the Nation to ski at Loon \nMountain, hike the Appalachian Trail, spot a moose, or take a ride on \nthe Kancamagus Highway--one of the State's most scenic routes. \nFamilies--including mine--also enjoy stopping by Clark's Trading Post \nto see Clark's famous trained bears perform, and riding through the \nmountains aboard the Hobo Railroad. Each September, Lincoln hosts the \nNew Hampshire Highland Games, where thousands gather to celebrate \nScottish culture and heritage.\n  On behalf of all Granite Staters, I am pleased to offer my \ncongratulations to the citizens of Lincoln on reaching this special \nmilestone, and I thank them for their many contributions to the life \nand spirit of the State of New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/17/senate-section/article/S6018-2", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MIKE JACOBS\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I wish to honor Mike Jacobs, who \nwill retire as the Johnson County judge after more than two decades of \npublic service to the citizens of Arkansas in this elected position.\n  As Johnson County judge, Mike was a constant advocate for services, \nprograms, and improvements for Johnson County residents. He worked to \nsecure funding to provide a safe source of drinking water for citizens \nin county, preserving funding for rural schools and protect rural \nfirefighters. After a tornado devastated Johnson County in 2011, Mike \nfought to ensure FEMA would allow citizens to receive Federal disaster \nassistance.\n  Mikes passion for public service extends beyond the borders of \nJohnson County. As the president of board of directors for the \nAssociation of Arkansas Counties for more than 15 years, Mike has \nshared his efforts, experiences, and examples of success with others. \nHe is a visionary for the State and the Nation as he also serves on the \nboard of directors of the National Association of Counties.\n  I congratulate Mike for his commitment to public service. We are all \ngrateful for his years of service and leadership to Arkansas. I am \ngrateful to be able to call Mike a friend. While he is stepping down as \ncounty judge, Mike will continue public service in another capacity. We \nwill be able to rely on his advice and his experience as he serves as \njustice of the peace.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Johnson County judge Mike \nJacobs on his retirement. I wish him continued success in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/17/senate-section/article/S6018-3", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING JACK CHATFIELD\n\n Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to remember Jack \nChatfield, a longtime resident of Hartford, CT, who passed away on \nSeptember 18, 2014. Although Jack was not well known outside \nConnecticut, he helped create a better history for our Nation. Born in \nBaltimore, MD, in 1942, he first came to Connecticut to attend Trinity \nCollege. Later, he returned to teach, first at the Watkinson School and \nthen at Trinity.\n  Jack Chatfield was an incomparable individual who lived a full life. \nHe interrupted his undergraduate career at Trinity in 1962 to volunteer \nwith the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, SNCC. An article \nin the New York Times detailed how southern sheriffs had beaten his \ncollege roommate Ralph Allen, and without looking back Jack went down \nto join him in rural southwest Georgia. At the time, SNCC workers faced \ngreat personal danger, both from local law enforcement and from \nvigilantes known as ``nightriders.'' Immediately after arriving, Jack \nwas wounded by shotgun blasts fired by nightriders while he was eating \ndinner in the house where he was staying. Despite this, Jack's spirit \nnever wavered, and he kept working to register African Americans to \nvote. He later said that it was during this time that he became ``a \ntrue student of American history.''\n  Jack returned to Trinity in the fall of 1963 and graduated in 1965. \nHe went on to earn his master's and doctorate from Columbia University. \nDuring this time, he turned his attention to teaching, which he found \nto be his true calling. He returned to Trinity in 1987.\n  In the classroom, Jack absolutely excelled. He had an exceptional \nability to teach history as if it were happening today. He drew his \nstudents in, immersing them in history texts that would make them think \nand question, building knowledge and skills that they would never \nforget. His love of the subject was equaled by his unwavering \ndedication to his students. Whether they were interested or not, \nbrilliant or not, Jack wanted to reach them all. He was honored for his \nability with Trinity's Hughes Teaching Prize for junior faculty in 1993 \nand its Brownell Prize for senior faculty in 2002.\n  Jack was equally concerned with how his students were faring outside \nthe classroom, and he saw part of his job as facilitating their moral \ndevelopment and understanding of life. With another colleague, he \nstarted what became known as the ``Friday Table.'' This informal \ngathering of students and faculty for Friday lunch became a tradition \nthat endured for over 15 years. Around the table, the participants \nwould talk about history and politics, life at Trinity, and other \nissues of importance. For many of the students who were fortunate \nenough to participate, this remains one of their most cherished \nmemories.\n  The world is a little bit emptier today without Jack Chatfield, but \nhis spirit and vision live on. Robert Kennedy once remarked that our \nactions could send out ripples of hope and that those ripples together \ncan make a significant difference. Everyone who knew Jack Chatfield \ncame away a little better for the experience, and each of these people \nare one of his ripples of hope. Whether consciously or unconsciously, \nthey will continue to carry on his vision, maintaining his legacy and \nhis spirit for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/17/senate-section/article/S6018-4", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6018-S6019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING JANICE HELWIG\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to pay tribute to \nJanice Helwig\n\n[[Page S6019]]\n\nfor her 20 years of faithful service to the Commission on Security and \nCooperation in Europe, Helsinki Commission. Janice joined the Helsinki \nCommission as a member of the professional staff just a few years after \nthe watershed changes in Europe in 1989, including the fall of \ncommunism, the unification of Germany, and the breakup of the Soviet \nUnion.\n  While 1989 did indeed mark a transition to peace and prosperity for \nmany countries in Central Europe--a Europe ``whole and free'' in the \nwords of President George Bush--by the time Janice joined the \nCommission staff in late 1994 it was clear that the countries of the \nregion still had many challenges ahead.\n  At the 1994 Budapest Summit, where Janice first joined the U.S. \ndelegation to the OSCE as a member of the Helsinki Commission \ncontingent, she heard Russian President Boris Yeltsin warn that \n``Europe, having not yet freed itself from the heritage of the Cold \nWar, is in danger of plunging into a cold peace.'' Unfortunately, \nRussia's effort to solidify its own sphere of influence and to block \nthe OSCE's ability to advance human rights has been a hallmark of \nMoscow's approach throughout Janice's tenure.\n  As the Helsinki Commission's policy adviser attached to the U.S. \nMission to the OSCE, Janice has worked on almost every aspect of the \nCommission's mandate. Her expertise and dedication on Central Asia has \nparticularly stood out.\n  In the aftermath of the crackdown in Turkmenistan beginning in \nNovember 2002, Janice was a tireless advocate for the victims of the \nregime. She has faithfully and continuously pressed to determine the \nfate of all those who were disappeared and been the voice of those who \nwere silenced.\n  In the wake of the Uzbekistan Government's massacre in Andijan in \n2005, she helped put a spotlight on the tragic loss of life there. She \nalso personally went to Kyrgyzstan after the outbreak of inter-ethnic \nconflict in 2010 and met with survivors. When Kazakhstani human rights \nadvocate Evgeny Zhovtis was imprisoned in Siberia after a sham process, \nJanice visited him in prison. An international organization is only a \nmeans to an end, not an end to itself. In the case of the OSCE, that \nend is the promotion of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. \nJanice has helped to ensure that the OSCE stays focused on those goals.\n  As chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I am pleased to recognize and \ncommend Janice Helwig for her commitment and service to the Helsinki \nCommission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/17/senate-section/article/S6019-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING THE USA CANOE/KAYAK TEAM\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the members of \nthe U.S. canoe/kayak team on their outstanding performance at Deep \nCreek 2014--the International Canoe Federation, ICF, Canoe Slalom World \nChampionships--held at the Adventure Sports Center International, ASCI, \nin Garrett County, MD this past September.\n  U.S. paddlers advanced to the semifinals in every event, despite \ncompeting alongside more than 400 Olympic-level athletes from 46 \ncountries. I congratulate U.S. team member and Marylander Fabien \nLefevre on winning the Gold Medal in C1M--canoe single men--and \nadvancing to the finals in K1M--kayak single men--and to his team \nmembers Michal Smolen, K1M; Casey Eichfeld, C1M; Dana Mann, K1W; and \nthe team of Casey Eichfeld and Devin McEwan, C2M, who paddled their way \ninto semifinals. I offer my congratulations to these outstanding \nathletes and my encouragement to all the members of the U.S. canoe/\nkayak team as they train and compete for a chance to represent the \nUnited States at the 2016 Olympic Games in Brazil.\n  U.S.A. canoe/kayak is a member of the U.S. Olympic Committee and the \nnational governing body for the Olympic sports of flatwater sprint and \nwhitewater slalom as well as the paralympic sport of paracanoe. Since \n2009, the team has been led by Olympic Gold Medalist, 10-time U.S. \nNational Champion, and 6-time World Cup Medalist Joe Jacobi. Joe has \nbeen a major force in energizing the team and developing the vitality \nof paddlesports in the United States. I wish him all the best as he \nsteps down from this role later this year to pursue new projects and \ninitiatives.\n  I also offer my congratulations to Garrett County commissioner Gregan \nCrawford and Maryland Office of Sports marketing executive director \nTerry Hasseltine who served as cochairs for Deep Creek 2014; Deep Creek \n2014 executive director Todd Copley; ASCI executive director Mike \nLogsdon; and the many sponsors and volunteers who worked together to \nbring this world-class event to the United States and to provide a warm \nwelcome to athletes and visitors from around the world. This was only \nthe second time this prestigious international competition has been \nheld in the United States since its inception in 1949; I am proud that \nMountain Maryland also hosted the World Championships on the Savage \nRiver in 1989.\n  I recently had the opportunity to visit with members of the U.S. team \nand students in Garrett College's Adventure Sports Institute who are \npreparing to lead the next generation of athletes and outdoor sports \nenthusiasts. I commend the region's leaders for recognizing Mountain \nMaryland's unique opportunity to support the training and development \nof leaders in this exciting industry, and I look forward to the \ncontinued growth of competitive paddle sports in my State and around \nthe country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/17/senate-section/article/S6019-2", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO NARVA ROSS\n\n Mr. PRYOR.

MULDER\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Bernard A. \nMulder, a veteran of World War II.\n  Bernard, on behalf of all Montanans and all Americans, I stand to say \nthank you for your service to this Nation.\n  It is my honor to share the story of Bernard's service in the Second \nWorld War because no story of bravery and especially not one from our \n``greatest generation'' should ever be forgotten.\n  Bernard was born in Beaumont, TX, on July 21, 1922. After growing up \nin Beaumont and Galveston, he graduated from Galveston High School in \n1939. Bernard enlisted with the Army Air Corps in San Antonio in May of \n1941.\n  He trained in Texas and Nevada, and soon after, a squadron commander \nsuggested that he put in for flight training. In December 1941, the \nsame month as Pearl Harbor, Bernard was accepted for primary flight \ntraining in Santa Maria, CA. Until then, Bernard had never even been \nnear a plane, much less flown one.\n\n[[Page S6020]]\n\n  Bernard flew training operations until heading overseas in November \n1942 to join the war effort. Bernard was stationed with the British Aid \nArmy in North Africa, where he flew supplies to Cairo and the Western \nFront, and returned the wounded to hospitals.\n  During the invasion of Sicily, Bernard dropped off the 82nd Airborne. \nHe did it once again on D-day, dropping them at Sainte Mere-Englise, \nwhich became the first town liberated on the Western Front.\n  While dropping supplies to troops in France, Bernard's plane was hit \nand he was shot. In July of 1944 Bernard was flown back to the United \nStates to recover.\n  One good thing did come out of his 9-month hospital stay: Bernard met \nthe love of his life, an Australian nurse named Margaret. Bernard and \nMargaret married in July 1945, and in January 1946 Bernard ended his \nservice in the military.\n  Through the GI bill, Bernard attended the University of Colorado and \ngraduated with a degree in mechanical engineering.\n  Bernard and Margaret then moved to Perth, Australia, in August of \n1960, where Bernard worked as a machine designer for 15 years. Margaret \nsadly passed away in 1975.\n  After returning to the United States, Bernard discovered his love of \ntravel and began to explore the American West. Bernard has lived in Las \nVegas; Guadalajara, Mexico; Arizona; and Wyoming. He's been to all 50 \nStates.\n  Bernard moved to Billings after he read that monthly bus passes for \nsenior citizens were only $3. Bernard then offered to make Christmas \nornaments for a daycare in downtown Billings, and after 6 years, the \nteachers asked him to join the Foster Grandparent Program.\n  Every morning since then, Bernard works with 4- and 5-year-olds. They \nkeep Grandpa Bernard young.\n  While Bernard was in the hospital, two of his medals were stolen from \nhis belongings. He also never received the rest of the medals he \nearned. This past September, in the presence of his friends, who claim \nhim as family, it was my honor to finally present to Bernard his Purple \nHeart, Air Medal with Two Bronze Service Stars, and Presidential Unit \nCitation Ribbon.\n  Bernard also earned the following medals: Honorable Service Lapel \nButton WWII, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with Four \nBronze Service Stars, and a World War II Victory Medal.\n  These medals are powerful symbols of true heroism, sacrifice, and \ndedication to service. These medals are presented on behalf of a \ngrateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/17/senate-section/article/S6020-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING THE ROBERT HICKS HOUSE\n\n Mr.VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to honor the home of civil \nrights hero, the late Robert ``Bob'' Hicks in Bogalusa, LA. This month, \nthe State of Louisiana is unveiling a historical land marker on the \nsite where, 50 years ago, Mr. Hicks organized armed men outside his \nhome to protect civil rights workers from Ku Klux Klan violence.\n  Mr. Hicks, a former paper mill worker, became a key civil rights \nleader during the tumultuous 1960s and 70s in his hometown of Bogalusa, \nLA. He earned the respect of others as a courageous organizer, who not \nonly stood toe-to-toe with the Ku Klux Klan, but also fought against \nthe racist political power structure and the city's discriminatory \nbusinesses. He filed a landmark civil rights lawsuit in Federal court \nagainst the city requiring the police to enforce the Civil Rights Act \nof 1964 and to protect those who protested against injustice in the \ncity. His lawsuits also resulted in orders to desegregate Bogalusa's \npublic schools and the prohibition of new public housing in segregated \nneighborhoods in the city. His lawsuit against his employer, the Crown \nZellerbach Corporation, resulted in the prohibition of unfair hiring \ntests and seniority systems at the city's major paper mill. Mr. Hicks \nbecame the first black supervisor at the paper mill, and his work \nopened doors for others, as his case became the precedent for similar \ndiscrimination cases throughout the region.\n  On the night of February 1, 1965, Mr. Hicks received a call telling \nhim the Klan was coming to bomb his home, because he was accommodating \ntwo white civil rights workers there. Mr. Hicks and his wife Valeria \nfound neighbors willing to take in their children and they reached out \nto others for protection. Soon, a group of armed men gathered to \nprotect the Hicks' home, and there was never a violent confrontation. \nLess than 3 weeks later, the leaders of a secretive, paramilitary \norganization called the Deacons for Defense and Justice visited \nBogalusa. The organization had been formed in Jonesboro, LA, in 1964 \nmainly to protect unarmed civil rights demonstrators from the Klan. \nAfter listening to the Deacons, Mr. Hicks took the lead in forming a \nBogalusa chapter, recruiting many of the men who had joined him at his \nhouse to protect his family and guests.\n  Mr. Hicks died of cancer at his home in Bogalusa on April 13, 2010, \nat the age of 81. He was one of the last surviving Deacon leaders.

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Alaska applying to the United States Congress to \n     call a convention of the states under Article V of the \n     Constitution of the United States to propose amendments to \n     the Constitution of the United States that impose fiscal \n     restraints on the federal government, limit the power and \n     jurisdiction of the federal government, and limit the terms \n     of office of federal government officials; to the Committee \n     on the Judiciary.\n\n                       House Joint Resolution 22\n\n       Whereas the founders of the Constitution of the United \n     States empowered state legislators to be guardians of liberty \n     against future abuses of power by the federal government; and\n       Whereas the federal government has created a crushing \n     national debt through improper and imprudent spending; and\n       Whereas the federal government has invaded the legitimate \n     roles of the states through the manipulative process of \n     federal mandates, most of which are unfunded; and\n       Whereas the federal government has ceased to live under a \n     proper interpretation of the Constitution of the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas it is the solemn duty of the states to protect the \n     liberty of their people, particularly for the generations to \n     come, to propose amendments to the Constitution of the United \n     States through a convention of the states under art. V to \n     place clear restraints on these and related abuses of power: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That under art. V, Constitution of the United \n     States, the Alaska State Legislature respectfully applies to \n     the United States Congress to call a convention of the states \n     for the sole purpose of proposing amendments to the \n     Constitution of the United States that impose fiscal \n     restraints on the federal government, limit the power and \n     jurisdiction of the federal government, and limit the terms \n     of office of federal government officials; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this application constitutes a continuing \n     application in accordance with art. V, Constitution of the \n     United States, until at least two-thirds of the legislatures \n     of the several states have applied for a similar convention \n     of the states; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     legislatures of the other 49 states to apply to the United \n     States Congress to call a convention of the states.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     Barack Obama, President of the United States; the Honorable \n     Joseph R.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Alaska opposing the warrantless collection of \n     telephone call data by the National Security Agency; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 22\n\n       Whereas the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States provides ``The right of the people to be secure \n     in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against \n     unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, \n     and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, \n     supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing \n     the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be \n     seized''; and\n       Whereas the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States provides ``No person shall . . . be deprived of \n     life, liberty, or property, without due process of law''; and\n       Whereas, on December 16, 2013, United States District Court \n     Judge Richard Leon ruled that the National Security Agency's \n     program, bulk collection, and querying of telephone record \n     metadata are likely unconstitutional; and\n       Whereas the legislature objects to the dragnet approach to \n     data collection allowed by the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court, a court that operates in secret and, \n     under sec. 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, issues orders that \n     perpetuate the warrantless collection of data of nearly all \n     Americans; and\n       Whereas the National Security Agency stores the date and \n     time of calls, their duration, and the participating \n     telephone numbers of the calls of nearly all Americans in a \n     centralized database, which allows National Security Agency \n     analysts to access not only those numbers, but the numbers \n     with which the numbers have been in contact, and, in turn, \n     the numbers in contact with those numbers; and\n       Whereas the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, in \n     its January 2014 report titled ``Report on the Telephone \n     Records Program Conducted under Section 215 of the USA \n     PATRIOT Act and on the Operations of the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court,'' questions the legal basis for the \n     National Security Agency's mass telephone call data \n     collection program; and\n       Whereas, when telephone call data of Americans is collected \n     by the National Security Agency, that data is not related to \n     specific investigations of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation; and\n       Whereas orders issued by the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court at the request of the federal government \n     require telephone companies to provide new calling records on \n     a daily basis, a mandate not grounded in statute; and\n       Whereas sec. 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act is designed to \n     enable the Federal Bureau of Investigation to obtain records \n     in the course of investigations, but the National Security \n     Agency's mass collection of the records is not consistent \n     with that design; and\n       Whereas the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 \n     prohibits telephone companies from sharing consumer data with \n     the government except in special circumstances, and the \n     Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board concluded that \n     the National Security Agency's telephone call data collection \n     program may violate the Act; and\n       Whereas the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board \n     found that the National Security Agency's telephone call data \n     collection program has not prevented, discovered, or \n     identified terrorist attacks, plots, or suspects that \n     threatened the security of the United States; and\n       Whereas the widespread collection of telephone call data of \n     Americans reveals highly sensitive personal information; and\n       Whereas the legislature resolutely opposes the continuation \n     of the National Security Agency's warrantless data collection \n     program; and\n       Whereas the legislature views the National Security \n     Agency's storage in a central database of the telephone call \n     metadata of all Americans as an unconstitutional practice \n     that should be immediately suspended; and\n       Whereas the history of government coercion, persecution, \n     and abuse of personal information and human life in the \n     twentieth\n\n[[Page S6022]]\n\n     century prompts the legislature to seek to protect the \n     liberty of future generations from an oppressive and \n     tyrannical federal government; and\n       Whereas the fundamental rights of Americans to speak freely \n     and associate with others are threatened and are likely being \n     diminished by the National Security Agency's mass collection \n     of telephone call data; and\n       Whereas the National Security Agency's mass collection of \n     telephone call data may intimidate or chill the freedom of \n     expression of individuals and groups that disagree with \n     certain government policies or result in extreme scrutiny of \n     those persons simply for opposing those policies; and\n       Whereas the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has \n     deviated from its purpose to authorize warrants for \n     electronic surveillance relating only to a specific person, a \n     specific place, or a specific communications account or \n     device; and\n       Whereas the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \n     operates in a secretive manner that prevents the court from \n     hearing public input regarding government requests to conduct \n     surveillance: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     federal government to end the mass telephone call data \n     collection program conducted under sec. 215 of the USA \n     PATRIOT Act, because of its lack of a statutory foundation \n     and because it raises serious constitutional concerns under \n     the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution of the \n     United States; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     federal government to eliminate all stored metadata upon \n     ending the mass telephone call data collection program; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     United States Congress to authorize the creation of a panel \n     of private sector lawyers to serve as advocates for the \n     public before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to \n     increase public knowledge and oversight; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges judges of \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to write opinions \n     in a manner that allows the government to declassify and \n     release the opinions to the public; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to work to declassify \n     past opinions and release those opinions to the public; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature requests the \n     United States Attorney General and members of the \n     intelligence and judiciary committees of the United States \n     Congress to inform the Alaska State Legislature of the \n     federal government's activities under the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act and provide the Alaska State \n     Legislature with copies of reports submitted under the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges the \n     Governor to prohibit the use of state personnel and resources \n     to assist the National Security Agency in its collection of \n     mass data on Alaskans without a specific search warrant; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature considers the \n     National Security Agency's unilateral collection of the \n     telephone call data of all Americans a violation of statute, \n     an unconstitutional program, and a troubling overreach by the \n     federal government; the Alaska State Legislature has sworn to \n     uphold both the Constitution of the United States and the \n     Constitution of the State of Alaska and will not assist the \n     federal government by facilitating programs that are \n     tyrannical in nature, that subject Americans to unreasonable \n     and unwarranted searches, and that violate the fundamental \n     principle of liberty; let this resolution serve as a notice \n     to this Administration and all future Administrations that \n     Alaskans reject surrendering their liberty in the name of an \n     unconstitutional program.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     Barack Obama, President of the United States; the Honorable \n     Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Vice-President of the United States and \n     President of the U.S. Senate; the Honorable John Boehner, \n     Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives; the Honorable \n     Harry Reid, Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate; the Honorable \n     Patrick J.

Res. 580\n\n       Whereas there are millions of unparented children in the \n     world, including 402,378 children in the foster care system \n     in the United States, approximately 102,000 of whom are \n     waiting for families to adopt them;\n       Whereas 62 percent of the children in foster care in the \n     United States are age 10 or younger;\n       Whereas the average length of time a child spends in foster \n     care is approximately 2 years;\n       Whereas for many foster children, the wait for a loving \n     family in which they are nurtured, comforted, and protected \n     seems endless;\n       Whereas in 2013, nearly 23,000 youth ``aged out'' of foster \n     care by reaching adulthood without being placed in a \n     permanent home;\n       Whereas every day, loving and nurturing families are \n     strengthened and expanded when committed and dedicated \n     individuals make an important difference in the life of a \n     child through adoption;\n       Whereas a 2007 survey conducted by the Dave Thomas \n     Foundation for Adoption demonstrated that although \n     ``Americans overwhelmingly support the concept of adoption, \n     and in particular foster care adoption . . . foster care \n     adoptions have not increased significantly over the past five \n     years'';\n       Whereas while 4 in 10 Americans have considered adoption, a \n     majority of Americans have misperceptions about the process \n     of adopting children from foster care and the children who \n     are eligible for adoption;\n       Whereas 50 percent of Americans believe that children enter \n     the foster care system because of juvenile delinquency, when \n     in reality the vast majority of children who have entered the \n     foster care system were victims of neglect, abandonment, or \n     abuse;\n       Whereas 39 percent of Americans believe that foster care \n     adoption is expensive, when in reality there is no \n     substantial cost for adopting from foster care and financial \n     support is available to adoptive parents after the adoption \n     is finalized;\n       Whereas family reunification, kinship care, and domestic \n     and inter-county adoption promote permanency and stability to \n     a far greater degree than long-term institutionalization and \n     long-term, often disrupted foster care;\n       Whereas both National Adoption Day and National Adoption \n     Month occur in the month of November;\n       Whereas National Adoption Day is a collective national \n     effort to find permanent, loving families for children in the \n     foster care system;\n\n[[Page S6025]]\n\n       Whereas since the first National Adoption Day in 2000, \n     nearly 50,000 children have joined forever families during \n     National Adoption Day;\n       Whereas in 2013, nearly 400 events were held in the United \n     States, finalizing the adoptions of approximately 4,500 \n     children from foster care; and\n       Whereas the President traditionally issues an annual \n     proclamation to declare the month of November as National \n     Adoption Month, and National Adoption Day is on November 22, \n     2014: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Adoption Day \n     and National Adoption Month;\n       (2) recognizes that every child should have a permanent and \n     loving family; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to consider \n     adoption during the month of November and all throughout the \n     year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/11/17/senate-section/article/S6025-1", "month": "11", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n          COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.
