Mr. President, last night the Senate advanced a bipartisan \nimmigration reform bill that will be good for national security and \nvery good for our economy. It will be good for American citizens as \nwell as those who aspire to one day become citizens.\n  It is truly gratifying to see the momentum behind this commonsense \nreform proposal. Eighty-four Senators voted to adopt the motion to \nproceed to this legislation--a very strong vote. By comparison, the \nSenate failed to advance an immigration reform bill just 6 years ago \nwhen only 46 Senators voted to end debate on that measure.\n  It is a sign of progress that the legislation now before the Senate \nhas not been stopped procedurally. I hope we are allowed to proceed on \nthis legislation without being blocked by some arcane Senate rule and \nthat we can finish this legislation and send it to the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I applaud the Gang of 8 for their bipartisan proposal. That is how \nthe Senate used to work. They worked hard. They have worked through \nhundreds of different proposals. After the Gang of 8 finished their \nwork, they took it before the Judiciary Committee. There were over 100 \namendments--many more than 100 amendments. They adopted 46, and some 40 \namendments were Republican amendments that were adopted. Chairman Leahy \nconducted a fair markup, and no one disputes that. So I commend the \nGang of 8 for allowing the bill to get to the Judiciary Committee, and \nI thank the Judiciary Committee for now giving us this proposal and \nbringing it to the floor, and now Democrats allowing us to proceed on \nthis legislation, as well as Republicans.\n  Our goal now is to pass the strongest legislation possible, with as \nmany votes as possible, while staying true to our principles, then \nawait what the House is going to do. The Speaker has said he wants a \nbill that will allow the Democrats to vote. That is good news because \nin the House, for the last two Congresses, there have been very few \nopportunities for the Democrats to vote on substantive legislation.\n  The Speaker has said he will only allow legislation to pass over \nthere that has a majority of the majority. That means only Republicans. \nIf they don't have enough Republican votes, they are not going to bring \nup a bill for a vote. So I am very pleased the Speaker would say that. \nIt is important we understand the procedure we have used for 230-plus \nyears in this body: We pass something here, they pass something in the \nHouse, we go to conference and work out our differences.\n  So I understand we have a long road before us and more work will be \nnecessary to get this bill across the finish line. I truly understand \nthat. I know some of my Republican colleagues will\n\n[[Page S4352]]\n\nsupport this bill if they feel confident what is in the bill adequately \naddresses the need to secure our borders. I agree the legislation \nfocused on border security a lot. I think that is important, and I am \nglad it did.\n  Reform that takes significant steps to stop illegal crossings is \nimportant, and reform that does not take significant steps to stop \nillegal crossings will fail. That is why I so admire what was done by \nthe Gang of 8 and the Judiciary Committee in regard to that issue. They \nhave done a terrific job on border security.\n  We should all also acknowledge the progress the Obama administration \nhas already made to secure our borders. Illegal border crossings are \ndown 80 percent. That is no small accomplishment. Yesterday I received \na letter from my colleagues, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nPat Leahy, and the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee Tom \nCarper, detailing the tremendous strides we have made toward a more \nsecure border.\n\n  As described by the Wall Street Journal, illegal entries nationwide \nare at a four-decade low. We have less crossings now than we had at any \ntime during the last 4 years, and the number of illegal entrants who \nsneak into the country through the southern border and successfully \nelude law enforcement--so-called ``got aways'' is what they are \ncalled--is down 86 percent. Smarter technology, physical barriers, and \ndouble the number of agents on the border have made this achievement \npossible.\n  We must ensure those who come to America seeking a better life do so \nin compliance with our laws. The measure before the Senate builds on \nthe progress we have made by allocating even more resources for border \nsecurity infrastructure, and that includes patrol bases, unmanned \nvehicles--yes, drones--helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, sensors, x-\nrays, cameras, and more. This legislation also includes additional \nfunding for the prosecution of those who are caught crossing illegally.\n  The legislation also establishes two strict but attainable statutory \nborder security goals: to prevent 90 percent of illegal entries and to \nmonitor the entire southern border, not just high-risk sectors of the \nborder. Chairman Leahy and Chairman Carper agreed in their letter that \nthis legislation will reduce illegal entries by reforming our legal \nimmigration system.\n  This legislation will make it virtually impossible for undocumented \npeople to work, so they will no longer have an incentive to enter \nillegally.\n  This is what my two colleagues said in their letter:\n\n       We need to stop focusing our attention on the symptoms and \n     start leading with the underlying root causes of illegal \n     immigration in a way that is tough, practical, and fair.\n\n  That says it all. This bill does that.\n  There is one thing this bill does not do and should not do: It does \nnot and should not make the path to citizenship contingent on attaining \nborder security goals that are impossible to measure. That would leave \nmillions who aspire to become citizens in indefinite limbo. We have to \nmove past this.\n  Six years ago we tried to do something about it and the situation \nonly got worse. This legislation is critical. If we made those goals \nimpossible, the legislation would be a failure. This would give \nopponents of citizenship in the Senate an opportunity to prevent our \nborder security goals from being met in order to block the path to \ncitizenship. I am concerned that some who oppose the very idea of \nreform see these triggers as a backdoor way to undermine the \nlegislation, and we must be very careful in recognizing that people are \ntrying to do that with this legislation now before this body. I believe \nsome Republicans with no intention of voting for the final bill--no \nintention, regardless of how it is amended--seek to offer amendments \nwith the sole purpose of derailing this vital reform.\n  I commend Senators--Democrats and Republicans--who sincerely want to \nmake this proposal stronger by enhancing its border security \nprovisions. So I look forward to hearing ideas over the next few days \non amendments--ideas to make our country safer and more secure. If that \nis the intent, we will certainly look at it, and I hope we can move \nforward as expeditiously as possible.\n  I am glad colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, are engaged in \nthis debate and are interested in offering amendments, but I hope those \namendments will be constructive in nature. We have come too far and the \ncountry needs this legislation too badly to lose sight of our purpose \nnow.\n  As Martin Luther said, ``Everything that is done in the world is done \nby hope.'' There is no better example of that than this legislation \nbecause hope is what it is all about. As Martin Luther said, \n``Everything that is done in the world is done by hope,'' and I \ncertainly believe that regarding this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/12/senate-section/article/S4352-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, Senate Democrats are not content with \nthe additional powers they have--powers greater than those enjoyed by \nany previous majority--so they intend to manufacture a crisis over \nnominations as a pretext for a further power grab. Yet the Senate is \ntreating President Obama's nominees very fairly. For example, let's \njust look at how the Senate has treated his judicial nominees.\n  Overall, the Senate has confirmed 193 lower court judges and defeated \nonly 2--defeated only 2. That is a .990 batting average--a .990 batting \naverage. After this week, the Senate will have approved 24 of the \nPresident's lifetime appointments compared to just 9--9--for President \nBush at a comparable point in his second term.\n  I will mention my party actually controlled the Senate then, so we \ncould have arguably confirmed a lot more. President Bush got 9 at this \npoint in his second term; President Obama 24.\n\n  Last Congress Obama had more district court confirmations than in any \nof the previous eight Congresses--previous eight Congresses. He also \nhad almost 50 percent more confirmations--171--than President Bush--\n119--under similar circumstances.\n  To support an unprecedented power grab, the administration and its \nallies in the Senate have resorted to truly outlandish claims about how \nthe President's judicial nominees are being treated--sort of making \nthis stuff up.\n  Washington Post Fact Checker gave the President two Pinocchios for \nextreme claims about Republican delays of his judicial nominees, noting \nthat in some ways the President's nominees are actually being moved \nalong ``better'' than Bush's.\n  The Washington Post cited CRS's conclusion that from nomination to \nconfirmation--one of the most relevant indicators, according to a \nBrookings scholar--Obama's circuit court nominations are being \nprocessed about 100 days quicker--100 days quicker--than President \nBush's: 350.6 days for Bush to 256.9 for Obama.\n  Factcheck.org:\n\n     . . . during Obama's first term, his nominees to federal \n     appeals courts actually were confirmed more quickly on \n     average than Bush's first-term nominees, measured from the \n     day of nomination to the day of the confirmation vote.\n\n  Politifact:\n\n     . . . the average wait for George W. Bush's circuit court \n     nominees was actually longer from nomination to confirmation.\n\n  So, as you can see, Mr. President, this is a manufactured crisis--one \nthat does not, in fact, exist--in order to try\n\n[[Page S4353]]\n\nto justify a power grab to fundamentally change the Senate.\n  At the beginning of each of last two Congresses, we have had this \ndiscussion at length. At the beginning of the previous Congress, here \nis what the majority leader said back in January of 2011. He said:\n\n       I agree that the proper way to change Senate rules is \n     through the procedures established in those rules, and I will \n     oppose--\n\n  ``I will oppose,'' he said. This is January of 2011--\n\n     any effort in this Congress or the next to change the \n     Senate's rules other than through the regular order.\n\n  ``I will oppose any effort in this Congress or the next''--the one we \nare in now--to change the rules of the Senate in any other way than \nthrough the regular order. The regular order is it takes 67 votes--not \neven 60 but 67 votes--to change the rules of the Senate.\n  Not being willing to keep the commitment he made in January of 2011, \nwe went around and around again at the beginning of 2013--this year--\nand the Senate this year, after considerable discussion, joined by a \nnumber of Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle, passed two \nnew rules and two new standing orders. In the wake of that action, an \nadditional commitment was made, and here was the exchange on the floor \non January 24 of this year.\n  I said:\n\n       I would confirm with the majority leader that the Senate \n     would not consider other resolutions relating to any standing \n     order or rules this Congress unless they went through the \n     regular order process?\n\n  We had just done that. We followed the regular order, and we passed \ntwo rules changes and two standing orders.\n  The majority leader said:\n\n       That is correct. Any other resolutions related to Senate \n     procedure would be subject to a regular order process, \n     including consideration by the Rules Committee.\n\n  Now, that was not a promise made based on the majority leader's view \nof good behavior. But, of course, by any objective standard, there has \nnot been any bad behavior anyway, even if that would justify breaking a \ncommitment that was not contingent.\n  Now my friend the majority leader has taken to kind of leaving the \nfloor in the hopes that somehow this would go away if only he were not \nhere. What will not go away is the unequivocal commitment made at the \nbeginning of this Congress so we would know what the rules were for the \nduration of this Congress.\n  I think colleagues on both sides of the aisle have a right to know \nwhether the commitment made by the leader of this body--the leader of \nthe majority and this body--is going to be kept. That is the only way \nwe can function. Our word is the currency of the realm in the Senate.\n  As you can see from the facts, this is a manufactured crisis. There \nis no crisis over the way the Senate has functioned. In fact, except \nfor these periodic threats by the majority leader to break the rules of \nthe Senate in order to change the rules of the Senate, we have been \noperating much better this Congress than in recent previous Congresses. \nBills have been open for amendment. We have been able to get them to \npassage. They have been bipartisan in large measure.\n  The Senate these days is not broken. It does not need to be fixed, \nparticularly if your judgment to fixing the Senate is to not keep a \ncommitment you made at the beginning of the year.\n  So I would conclude by saying that I am going to bring this up every \nmorning, and the majority leader not being here or not responding does \nnot make it go away. What my colleagues in the minority have on their \nminds is whether the commitment will be kept, and at some point the \nmajority leader is going to have to answer that question because it is \nnot going away.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/12/senate-section/article/S4353-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this past weekend President Obama met with \nPresident Xi of China in California for a summit meeting between the \ntwo leaders. It was an opportunity for a personal relationship between \nthe leader of China and the leader of the United States in order to \nimprove the trust between the two countries.\n  China is important to the United States. China, as we know, is a \npermanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations--a key \nplayer in developing international policies that are important to the \nUnited States and global security. China is very influential in the \npolicies concerning North Korea and Iran. China is a key trading \npartner of the United States. We know the amount of products that go \nback and forth between China and the United States.\n  President Obama has correctly identified Asia as a region of \nparticular interest. He has rebalanced Asian policy because of the \nimportance of Asia to the United States. We are a Pacific power, and \nAsia is critically important for regional security as well as for \nglobal security.\n  I have the opportunity of chairing the Subcommittee on East Asian and \nPacific Affairs of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In that \ncapacity, 2 weeks ago I visited China, the Republic of Korea, and \nJapan.\n  In China, I was able to observe firsthand the progress that is being \nmade in that country and to meet with key leaders of the Chinese \nGovernment. I did see much progress. I saw economic change in China as \nto how they are becoming a more open society from the point of view of \nentrepreneurship. I saw rights that have been advanced. People do have \nmore freedom than they had several decades ago.\n  I saw an opportunity where the United States and China could build a \nstronger relationship between our two countries. It starts with \nbuilding trust. There is a lot of mistrust out there. That is why I was \nparticularly pleased about the summit meeting this past weekend. We \nhave common interests. China is critically important to the United \nStates on making sure the Korean Peninsula remains a nonnuclear \npeninsula. China has tremendous impact over North Korea and does not \nwant to see North Korea continue its ambition to become a nuclear \nweapon power. They can help us in resolving that issue, hopefully in a \nway that will help us in a peaceful manner.\n  I could not help but observe when I was in Beijing that China has a \nhuge environmental challenge. The entire time I was there, I never saw \nthe Sun, and that was not because of clouds, it was because of \npollution, which is common in Beijing. It is not only a problem that \nChina needs to deal with, it is a political necessity. The people of \nChina know that their air is dirty. Here is an opportunity for the \nUnited States, working with China--the two large emitters of greenhouse \ngases--for them to come together and show international leadership by \nwhat we can do in our own countries to encourage progress but also \ninternational progress on this issue.\n  While I was in China, I had a chance to advance areas of concern. I \nwant to talk about that. Our security interests with China go toward \ntheir military, yes, but also go toward their economic conditions and \ntheir respect for human rights. I raised throughout my visit to China \nmy concern, and I think America's concern--the international concern--\nabout China recognizing universally accepted human rights. The right to \ndissent is not there in China.\n  On June 4 we celebrated another anniversary of Tiananmen Square, \nwhere the student protest turned very deadly. It is still dangerous to \ndissent in China. Civil rights lawyers can lose their right to practice \nlaw and can be physically intimidated if they are too aggressive in \nrepresenting those who disagree with government policies.\n  China has a policy to this day of detaining people, putting them in \nprison for their ``reeducation.'' That could be for up to 4 years \nwithout trial and without being questioned as to why they are being \ndetained, solely because\n\n[[Page S4354]]\n\nthey disagree with the government's policy.\n  If you are born in a community, you are registered in that community. \nThere may not be economic opportunity there for you. You might want to \nmove to a big city in order to explore additional economic \nopportunities for yourself and your family. In China that is not \npossible for the great majority of the people. They are registered in \ntheir community, they are expected to live in their community, and they \nare expected to work in that community. So you have the haves and the \nhave nots. There are many people in China who are doing very well. The \nvast majority are not.\n  Then there is the issue of religious freedom. I think we all know \nabout Tibet and the Buddhists in Tibet and how they have been harassed. \nWe know about the Uighers and the Muslim community. What really shocked \nme was talking to the Protestants who have their house churches. They \nexplained to me that if their churches get too big--maybe over 25 or 30 \nmembers--they lose their right to meet. The government is worried about \ntoo many people getting together to celebrate their religion. Well, \nthat certainly is unacceptable. It violates internationally recognized \nhuman rights standards.\n  And then they block access, full access, to the Internet. Sites such \nas the New York Times or Bloomberg are considered to be too difficult \nfor the Chinese people to accept, and the government blocks those \nsources.\n  Perhaps one of the most difficult challenges China has today is that \nit does not trust its own people to innovate and create. Instead, they \nuse cyber to try to steal our rights, our innovation, not just in \nAmerica but throughout the world. We are very concerned about the \nproper use of protecting intellectual property, and I raised that \nduring my visit to China.\n  We are also concerned about the cyber security issues, and I know \nthat was on the agenda of President Obama and President Xi. We would \nurge progress to be made on acceptable standards on the use of cyber.\n  Then there is the issue of corruption. Because so much is determined \nby where you live and your local government, corruption is widespread. \nThat needs to be changed.\n  So these are important subjects that we raised in a country that is \ncritically important to the United States, but these issues must be \ndebated.\n  When President Park was here, the President of the Republic of Korea, \nshe mentioned on the House floor to a joint session of Congress that \nshe wants a security dialog in Northeast Asia. When I met with her when \nI was in Seoul, we had a chance to talk more about it. The more she \ntalked about the security dialog, the more it reminded me of the \nHelsinki Commission, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope, which was established in 1975 as a security dialog between all \nthe counties of Europe, now Central Asia, the United States, and \nCanada.\n  That security dialog deals with all three baskets of concern. Yes, we \nare concerned about military actions. We have serious military issues \nthat we need to take up in the northeast. Maritime security issues are \nvery much of concern to all the countries of Northeast Asia. But we \nalso need to deal with economic freedom and opportunity, and we need to \ndeal with human rights.\n  This type of a dialog would allow us in the north to participate with \nthe major countries in Northeast Asia to work out and know the concerns \nof each of the countries. It would include not just China and the \nRepublic of Korea but Japan, North Korea, the United States, and \nRussia.\n  I would urge the region to either adopt a security dialog similar to \nthe Helsinki process or look at becoming a part of the Helsinki \nprocess. We do have regional forums. There is a regional forum for \nAsia. So it is a possibility that they could actually work under the \nHelsinki framework.\n  In my visits to Japan and the Republic of Korea, I know we have two \nclose allies. Japan, of course, is a treaty ally. We have U.S. troops \nboth in Korea and Japan. We are working out ways to make our troop \npresence more effective, consistent with the political realities of \nboth of those countries.\n  Both Japan and the Republic of Korea strongly support our policies in \nIran and Afghanistan and the Korean Peninsula. The relationship between \nthese two countries must improve. There are serious issues. Of course \nthe comfort woman issue during World War II is a matter of major \nconcern to the Korean population. I certainly support and understand \nthat. But it is important for those two allies of the United States to \nbecome closer allies and to move forward in areas of mutual interest. I \nurge them to do that.\n  In Japan, I had meetings on the economic issues, on the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, TPP, which clearly are areas where we can make \nadvancements. I saw an opportunity to advance U.S. interests in the \nrebalance to Asia. It is not a pivot to Asia. We used that term \noriginally. It is not. We have been active in Asia for centuries. It is \na rebalance because we recognize the importance of Asia. I think we can \ndo that by enhancing our relationship with all the countries in Asia. \nIt is an opportunity to advance U.S. security interests through \nmilitary cooperation.\n  I did talk about the military in China. I also talked, particularly \nin Japan, about more of their students coming here to the United States \nto advance good governance and economic relationships, and to have a \nresponsible environmental program.\n  The subcommittee I chair has already held two hearings on the \nrebalance to Asia, including good governance and military issues. We \nare going to hold future hearings dealing with the environmental issues \nand economic issues.\n  Clearly, working with the President, I see a major opportunity to \nadvance U.S. interests through our rebalance to Asia policies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/12/senate-section/article/S4354-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4354-S4355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING FRANK R. LAUTENBERG\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, we all lost a dear friend when Frank \nLautenberg passed away a little over a week ago. He was a friend, he \nwas a colleague, he was a mentor. In the last Congress I had the \nopportunity to sit next to him on the floor of the Senate. Our desks \nwere back there in the last row. I had a chance to sit next to him. I \ntell you--you have heard this many times--but when we had those vote-\naramas Frank kept me very much engaged. His sense of humor, his ability \nto use contemporary activities with a sense of humor kept us all going. \nWe are certainly going to miss that humor.\n  I also sat next to him on the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nHe was a fierce defender of public health and the environment. I am \ngoing to certainly miss his advocacy. He was there to protect clean \nair. He chaired that subcommittee and took on every special interest in \norder to protect our children and to protect our communities.\n  He was a fierce defender of the environment, recognizing we all have \na responsibility to pass on the environment in a better condition to \nfuture generations.\n  His story is a story about the success of America. Here we have a \nchild of an immigrant family that came to this country and started anew \nwith virtually no resources. It is very appropriate that I am talking \nabout Frank Lautenberg on a day in which the immigration reform bill is \non the floor of the Senate.\n  I know if Frank were here, he would be talking about his own family \nand his own experiences and why the passage of this immigration bill is \nso important for America's future. Yes, we are going to do the right \nthing for the values of America, but we are also going to help \nAmerica's economic future and our security in the future. He grew up in \na family of poverty. His father died when he was very young. He had no \nchoice after high school but to enter the military. But he wanted to \nenter the military because he wanted to serve his country. So he went \nand served our country in World War II. As we know, he was the last \nsurviving Member of the Senate who served in World War II. He did an \nincredible service to our country under extremely difficult \ncircumstances. He came back to the United States and this country \noffered him the GI bill opportunity for education. But for that GI bill \nFrank Lautenberg never would have had those educational opportunities. \nHe took advantage of it and went to business\n\n[[Page S4355]]\n\nschool. He used that to develop a business that was innovative and \ncreative. There was a need out there to deal with personnel costs by \nbusinesses. Frank Lautenberg developed, with his partners, a way in \nwhich that service could be provided in the most cost-effective way.\n  What did that do? That made this country more efficient, more \neffective. What that did was create a lot of jobs for this country. It \nalso made Frank Lautenberg a fairly wealthy person. That is the \nAmerican way: innovation to grow our economy, to create jobs, and to \nbenefit by your own innovation. Frank Lautenberg took advantage of that \nand succeeded in a great way.\n  But he was not satisfied with that. He wanted to give back to his \ncommunity. So he served his community. He served his community in many \nways. There is a whole host of community organizations to which he \nprovided leadership, his own personal time, in order to help people. He \ndid that. Jewish Federation--he became a national leader there to help \ncommunities all over the world. Frank Lautenberg did that as a private \ncitizen because he thought it was the right thing to do.\n  But then he decided he wanted to serve his community in a different \nway, so he ran for the Senate, got elected to the Senate, served two \ndifferent terms in the Senate. He is the only Senator who was both the \njunior and senior Senator twice from the same State. But he never \nforgot his roots. He never forgot where he came from. He has a long \nlist of accomplishments, from helping refugees come here to America, to \nhelping keep the air we breathe on airlines safe for our children. The \nlist is voluminous. We have already talked about it. He will be missed \nby all.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with Bonnie, who we all know so well, \nand his entire family. To the people of New Jersey and the people of \nthis Nation, Frank Lautenberg was an extraordinary person who made a \nlasting mark. He will be missed by all. We all know we are better \nbecause of having served with him.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/12/senate-section/article/S4355-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4355-S4356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to address two issues this morning, \nbut starting with the issue that is confronting us here on the Senate \nfloor. It is a great challenge, but it is also a great opportunity; \nthat is, immigration. The opportunity we have to come together in the \nSenate, Democrats and Republicans, is to fix a broken system and to \nhelp our economy.\n  Along the way, as we are working through the immigration bill over \nthe next days and weeks, I think we can not only get this issue on the \nright track substantively but we can also send a very strong message to \nthe American people that on major consequential issues for the American \npeople we can come together, work together, and get a good result for \nthem. I think that in and of itself is worthy of a lot of attention.\n\n\n                                 Syria\n\n  But even as we are working on immigration, of course we have to \nconcern ourselves with a whole range of other issues. One I will speak \nto briefly this morning is the issue of our policies as they relate to \nSyria. We are confronted this morning with a headline in the Washington \nPost. I will hold it up. It reads: ``Iran On Ascent As Syria Churns.'' \nThe first page of the Post. I will read the first paragraph of this \nstory:\n\n       As fighters with Lebanon's Hezbollah movement wage the \n     battles that are helping Syria's regime survive, their chief \n     sponsor, Iran, is emerging as the biggest victor in the wider \n     regional struggle for influence that the Syrian conflict has \n     become.\n\n  There is one of the reasons why I and others, for not just weeks but \nmonths now, have been urging the administration and the Congress to \ncome together on a more focused and more effective strategy as it \nrelates to Syria. We had a good bipartisan effort in the Foreign \nRelations Committee. We were able to pass out of the committee \nlegislation that dealt with Syria that would provide a whole range of \nsupports and efforts that will lead to a better result in Syria.\n  I know the White House has spent the last couple of weeks and will be \nspending even more time today to come up with a policy that makes \nsense. But I do not think we can any longer pretend this issue is not \nan issue that concerns our national security, because every day the \nIranian regime and Hezbollah plot against us. Anything that results in \nthe regime in Iran being strengthened, as the Washington Post points to \ntoday in this story, is bad for our national security.\n  We have a lot of work to do. Again, this should be bipartisan. But \nthe administration needs to focus on Syria and come to a conclusion \nabout the way forward that will be in the best interests of our \nnational security and also in the best interests of the people of Syria \nwho are fighting valiantly against the Asad regime.\n  We all agree the Asad regime should not be in power, but we can't \njust wish that. We will have to take the steps that will lead to that \nresult in a concerted fashion with allies in the region.\n  I ask unanimous consent the story entitled ``Iran on ascent as Syria \nchurns'' from the Washington Post this morning be made part of the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed, in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 12, 2013]\n\n               Iran Emerging as Victor in Syrian Conflict\n\n                              (By Liz Sly)\n\n       Beirut.--As fighters with Lebanon's Hezbollah movement wage \n     the battles that are helping Syria's regime survive, their \n     chief sponsor, Iran, is emerging as the biggest victor in the \n     wider regional struggle for influence that the Syrian \n     conflict has become.\n       With top national security aides set to meet at the White \n     House on Wednesday to reassess options in light of recent \n     setbacks for the rebels seeking Syrian President Bashar al-\n     Assad's ouster, the long-term outcome of the war remains far \n     from assured, analysts and military experts say.\n       But after the Assad regime's capture of the small but \n     strategic town of Qusair last week--a battle in which the \n     Iranian-backed Shiite militia played a pivotal role--Iran's \n     supporters and foes alike are mulling a new reality: that the \n     regional balance of power appears to be tilting in favor of \n     Tehran, with potentially profound implications for a Middle \n     East still grappling with the upheaval wrought by the Arab \n     Spring revolts.\n       ``This is an Iranian fight. It is no longer a Syrian one,'' \n     said Mustafa Alani, director of security and defense at the \n     Dubai-based Gulf Research Council. ``The issue is hegemony in \n     the region.''\n       The ramifications extend far beyond the borders of Syria, \n     whose location at the heart of the Middle East puts it \n     astride most of the region's fault lines, from the Israeli-\n     Palestinian conflict to the disputes left over from the U.S. \n     occupation of Iraq, from the perennial sectarian tensions in \n     Lebanon to Turkey's aspirations to restore its Ottoman-era \n     reach into the Arab world.\n       An Iran emboldened by the unchecked exertion of its \n     influence in Syria would also be emboldened in other arenas, \n     Alani said, including the negotiations over its nuclear \n     program, as well as its ambitions in Iraq, Lebanon and \n     beyond.\n       ``If Iran wins this conflict and the Syrian regime \n     survives, Iran's interventionist policy will become wider and \n     its credibility will be enhanced,'' he added.\n       From Iran's point of view, sustaining Assad's regime also \n     affirms Iran's control over a corridor of influence \n     stretching from Tehran through Baghdad, Damascus and Beirut \n     to Maroun al-Ras, a hilltop town on Lebanon's southern border \n     that offers a commanding view of northern Israel, according \n     to Mohammad Obaid, a Lebanese political analyst with close \n     ties to Hezbollah.\n       Iran has sought to minimize its visible involvement in \n     Syria so as not to exacerbate sectarian tensions that have \n     been inflamed by a conflict pitting an overwhelmingly Sunni \n     opposition against a regime dominated by Assad's minority \n     Shiite-affiliated sect, Obaid said.\n       Iran has provided advice, money and arms to Assad's regime, \n     but the manpower needed to bolster his forces, flagging after \n     two years of trying to contain the revolt, has come from \n     Hezbollah, which was founded in the 1980s with help from \n     Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and has become Lebanon's \n     leading military and political force.\n       ``Hezbollah is part of the Iranian strategy,'' Obaid said. \n     ``This counts as a victory for the group of Iran, Syria, Iraq \n     and Hezbollah against the group backed by the United \n     States.''\n\n[[Page S4356]]\n\n                         `Iran walked the walk'\n\n       Supporters of the Syrian opposition contrast the hesitancy \n     of the U.S. administration in offering arms to the outgunned, \n     poorly trained and deeply divided rebels with the commitment \n     that Iran has shown to its Damascus ally.\n       The U.S. goal was to pressure Assad into making concessions \n     at the negotiating table, without delivering a resounding \n     military victory to the rebels that might have brought \n     Islamists to power in Damascus, said Amr al-Azm, a history \n     professor at Shawnee State University in Ohio who is Syrian \n     and is active in the opposition. Instead, a proposed peace \n     conference in Geneva seems likely to be held on Assad's \n     terms, should it go ahead.\n       ``Politically we're screwed, and militarily we're taking a \n     pounding,'' Azm said. ``America talked the talk while Iran \n     walked the walk.''\n       This would not be the first time that Iran has \n     outmaneuvered the United States since the Iranian revolution \n     brought Shiite clerics to power in Tehran in 1979. But the \n     assertion of Shiite power in Syria rankles Sunnis across the \n     region, compounding the dangers that the Syrian conflict \n     could provoke a wider and even bloodier war than the one \n     currently underway, which is estimated to have killed at \n     least 80,000 people.\n       Escalating violence in Iraq and growing tensions in \n     Lebanon, whose conflicts are inextricably intertwined with \n     the increasingly sectarian nature of the war in Syria, \n     underscore the risk that centuries-old religious rivalries \n     between Sunnis and Shiites will be aggravated by Iran's role. \n     The leading religious authority in Saudi Arabia and al-Qaeda \n     chief Ayman al-Zawahiri have in the past week called on \n     Sunnis to volunteer to fight in Syria, marking a potentially \n     dangerous convergence that could herald an intensified influx \n     of Sunni jihadis.\n\n\n                          Saudi Arabia's role\n\n       Saudi Arabia, the leading Sunni power in the region and \n     Washington's closest Arab ally, is unlikely to tolerate an \n     ascendant Iran even if the United States chooses to remain \n     aloof, said Jamal Khashoggi, director of the al-Arab \n     television channel.\n       ``It is a serious blow in the face of Saudi Arabia, and I \n     don't think the Saudis will accept it. They will do \n     something, whether on their own or with America,'' he said. \n     ``Syria is the heart of the Arab world, and for it to be \n     officially conquered by the Iranians is unacceptable.''\n       One way in which Saudi Arabia could influence the outcome \n     is by facilitating unchecked supplies of arms to the rebels, \n     analysts say. Although the umbrella Free Syrian Army has \n     received small quantities of weaponry from Turkey, Saudi \n     Arabia and Qatar over the past year, the United States has \n     sought to control the flow, vetting the recipients and \n     restricting the caliber of the weapons provided.\n       After videos surfaced in March of Islamist groups wielding \n     antitank weapons funneled across the Jordanian border by \n     Saudi Arabia, the United States imposed a freeze on all \n     further deliveries, putting the rebels at a disadvantage just \n     as Iran, through Hezbollah, was gearing up to rejuvenate the \n     Assad regime's army with reinforcements, according to rebel \n     leaders.\n\n\n                           A symbolic battle\n\n       Military analysts caution against overestimating the impact \n     of the rebel defeat in Qusair on what is likely to be a long \n     and unpredictable war. The obscure western town abutting \n     Hezbollah-controlled territory in Lebanon almost certainly \n     offered an easier conquest than other rebel strongholds, such \n     as the city of Aleppo, where the regime is touting an \n     imminent offensive.\n       The rebels are continuing to press attacks in the northern, \n     eastern and southern peripheries of the country even as the \n     government appears to be tightening its grip on the central \n     provinces of Damascus and Homs, raising the specter that the \n     country will be partitioned into enclaves backed by rival \n     Sunni and Shiite regional powers. A suicide bombing in \n     Damascus on Tuesday highlighted the likelihood that the \n     rebels will sustain an insurgency similar to the one that \n     persists in Iraq even if they are defeated militarily.\n       The chief significance of the battle for Qusair lay in the \n     powerful symbolism of the role played by Hezbollah, which \n     eliminated any doubt that the Syrian conflict has turned into \n     a proxy war for regional influence, said Charles Lister, an \n     analyst with IHS Jane's defense consultancy in London.\n       ``External actors are becoming increasingly decisive and \n     pivotal in terms of where the conflict is going,'' he said. \n     And if the United States increased its support for the \n     rebels, Assad's allies would be likely to boost theirs, he \n     added.\n       ``The conflict has regionalized, and, unfortunately, that \n     gives it the potential to drag on longer,'' he said. ``As \n     long as one side increases its assistance, the other will see \n     the need to do so, too.''\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/12/senate-section/article/S4356-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4356-S4357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. CASEY. I move to the second part of my remarks, which is to talk \nabout two of our judicial nominees who will be coming before the Senate \ntoday. Both of these nominees will be voted on today to be members of \nthe United States District Court for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania. I wish to give Senators the benefit of a little \nbiographical background on both of them.\n  I will begin with Nitza Quinones Alejandro. Judge Quinones is \nrecognized by her colleagues as being very well prepared as a judge and \na conscientious judicial official who exhibits an outstanding judicial \ntemperament and fairness.\n  Since 1991, Nitza Quinones Alejandro has served as a trial judge for \nthe First Judicial District of the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas \nin Philadelphia, working on criminal and civil trials with all of the \ndiversity, difficulty, and challenge that comes with that. She runs a \ngood courtroom, treats lawyers and litigants fairly, and renders \nthoughtful decisions. She was first nominated for judicial appointment \nback in May of 1990 by Gov. Robert P. Casey, my father, when he was \nserving in office in Pennsylvania.\n  At the time--not quite then a judge--Judge Quinones became the first \nLatina State court judge in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania back in \nthe early 1990s.\n  Prior to her judicial appointment, Judge Quinones served as an \narbitrator for the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas from 1980 to \n1991. She also worked as a staff attorney with the Department of \nVeterans Affairs and as an attorney-advisor for the Office of Hearings \nand Appeals at the Department of Health and Human Services. She was \nalso a staff attorney with Community Legal Services in Philadelphia.\n  Judge Quinones is a founding member and has been active within the \nHispanic Bar Association of Pennsylvania for the past 20 years. She has \nactively recruited students from local law schools and hired numerous \nHispanic attorneys as full-time law clerks and serves as a mentor to \ncountless students and professionals.\n  A native of Puerto Rico, she graduated from the University of Puerto \nRico School of Business Administration cum laude in 1972 and acquired \nher juris doctor degree from the University of Puerto Rico's School of \nLaw in 1975.\n  Her commitment to public service and substantial judicial experience \nwill make her an outstanding Federal judge. It is also, I should note, \na remarkable American story that Judge Quinones brings to us today.\n  We look forward to the vote today on her confirmation. We appreciate \nthe work that has been done to bring her nomination to the floor.\n  I have enjoyed working with Senator Toomey on both Judge Quinones' \nnomination as well as the second nomination.\n  Judge Jeffrey L. Schmehl, the second nominee, as well will bring an \nextraordinary record of knowledge, experience, and public service to \nthe Federal bench. He is well regarded by lawyers and litigants who \nappear before him, as well as the people of Reading in Berks County, \nPA.\n  Since 2007 he has served as the president judge for the Berks County \nCourt of Common Pleas, where he has served as a judge since 1998.\n  Prior to joining the bench, Judge Schmehl was a partner at Rhoda \nStoudt & Bradley from 1988 to 1997, where he also worked as an \nassociate since 1986.\n  He has served as the county solicitor at the Berks County Services \nCenter from 1989 to 1997, and he owned his own law firm from 1981 to \n1986. He also served as an assistant district attorney in Berks County, \nas a prosecutor, and as an assistant public defender for the Berks \nCounty Public Defender's Office--a rare combination, both a public \ndefender and a prosecutor.\n  He received his bachelor of arts degree from Dickinson College in \n1977 and a juris doctor from the University of Toledo School of Law in \n1980. We look forward to Judge Schmehl's confirmation as well.\n  Both of these are individuals about whom we can be very proud, vote \nfor, and support with enthusiasm. It always helps when you have two \njudges who are the result of the working together of a Democratic \nSenator and a Republican Senator--in this case, Senator Toomey and \nmyself--working together to bring their nominations to this point and \nto get them confirmed on the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S4357]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe advice and consent duties of the Senate. Our Constitution gives the \nSenate the responsibility to advise the President on high-level \nexecutive positions and judgeships. The Senate is also asked to consent \non those appointments to ensure that only those who are worthy of the \npublic's trust hold positions of such great power. The confirmation \nprocess is a way to protect the American people from nominees who \nsimply aren't up to the job or to the times we are in as a country.\n  It is also an important opportunity for the Senate to exercise \noversight over the agencies and the policies of an administration and \nto do this on behalf of the American people. Let me repeat that. It is \nabout exercising oversight on behalf of the American people.\n  This is one of the most important roles we play as Senators. This is \none of the reasons our Nation's Founding Fathers intentionally made the \npace of the Senate deliberate. They wanted to make sure there was free \ndebate on important subjects so we could give appropriate consideration \nto policies, to laws, and to nominations.\n  The Father of our Constitution, James Madison, explained the Senate's \nrole was ``first to protect the people against their rulers.''\n  ``First to protect the people against their rulers'' was the point of \nthis body. That is why, over its long history, the Senate has adopted \nrules that provide strong protections for political minorities.\n  Lately some in the majority have decided the American people \nshouldn't ask so many questions and the minority shouldn't have so many \nrights. Here is a little perspective on the conversation we are having \ntoday. Over the last 6 years Majority Leader Reid has taken an \nunprecedented stand against the rights of the minority in this body. He \nhas done it through procedural tactics such as filling the amendment \ntree on bills and bypassing committees using something called rule XIV \nof the Senate rules. Those techniques may make it easier for the \nmajority leader to get what he wants, but they shut many Senators out \nof legislating, and they shut out the Americans we represent, Democrats \nas well as Republicans.\n  At the beginning of the last Congress and again at the start of this \nCongress, there was an attempt to use the so-called nuclear option and \nto use it to radically change the rules of the Senate and to strip the \nrights of the minority. Back in 2011, Majority Leader Reid made a \ncommitment not to use the nuclear option.\n  On the floor he said:\n\n       I agree that the proper way to change Senate rules is \n     through the procedures established in those rules, and I will \n     oppose any effort in this Congress or the next to change the \n     Senate rules other than through the regular order.\n\n  He said this Congress or the next Congress, so that includes the \nCongress we are in right now today.\n  It didn't stop some of the members of his caucus from trying to force \nthe nuclear option again earlier this year. I was one of a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators--eight of us--who worked together and negotiated, I \nthought, responsible changes to Senate procedures. Our goal was to \navoid the rush that would take drastic steps that would damage this \nbody and our country forever. It was a fair agreement.\n  It was also an agreement that we were told would rule out the use of \nthe nuclear option. So Republicans agreed to support two new standing \norders and two new standing rules of the Senate. Those changes were \noverwhelmingly supported by Republicans as well as Democrats in this \nbody.\n  In return, the majority leader again gave his word he would not try \nto break the rules in order to change the rules. Here is what he said a \nfew months ago on the Senate floor: ``Any other resolutions related to \nSenate procedure would be subject to a regular order process.''\n  He even added this included considerations by the Rules Committee. \nThere was no equivocating in the statement by the Democratic leader. \nThere were no ifs, ands, or buts. This was January 24 of this year. \nHere we are again, less than 5 months later, and we are having this \nsame argument.\n  Some Senate Democrats want to use the nuclear option to break the \nrules, to change the rules, and do away with the right to extended \ndebate on nominations. This would be an unprecedented power grab by the \nmajority. It would gut the advice and consent function of the Senate. \nIt would trample the rights of the minority. It would deprive millions \nof Americans of their right to have their voices heard through their \nrepresentatives here in Washington. The nuclear option would \nirreparably change this institution.\n  Republicans have raised principled objections to a select few of the \nPresident's nominees. In other cases, such as the DC Circuit Court, we \nsimply want to apply the standard the Democrats had set, that the \ncourt's workload doesn't justify the addition of three more judges.\n  The President claims his nominees have been treated unfairly. Even \nthe Washington Post's Fact Checker said the President's comments were \nuntrue. The other day the Post Fact Checker gave the President not just \none but two Pinocchios for his claims about Republican delays on his \njudicial nominees.\n  The White House and the majority leader don't want to hear it. They \nwant the Senate to rubberstamp the President's nominees. The Democrats \naren't happy with the rulings by the DC Circuit Court, and they want to \navoid any more inconvenient questions about the Obama administration. \nDemocrats claim they want to change the rules to make things move more \nquickly, but that is no excuse. Remember when the majority leader \nthreatened the same drastic step a couple of years ago? One of the \nDemocrats who stood up to oppose the current majority leader at the \ntime was former Senator Chris Dodd. In his farewell speech in this body \nin late 2010, this is what Senator Dodd had to say:\n\n       I can understand the temptation to change the rules that \n     make the Senate so unique--and, simultaneously, so \n     frustrating. But whether such a temptation is motivated by a \n     noble desire to speed up the legislative process, or by pure \n     political expedience, I believe such changes would be unwise.\n\n  This was a Democratic Senator with 30 years of service in the Senate.\n  The reality is the pace of the Senate can be deliberate. Extended \ndebate and questioning of nominees is a vital tool to help ensure the \nmen and women who run our government are up to the job and are held \naccountable.\n  Under the system some in the majority want to impose, there will be \nless opportunity for political minorities to question nominees. There \nwill be less government transparency. The faith of the American people \nin their government will get smaller and smaller.\n  I believe it would be a terrible mistake for Democrats to pursue the \nnuclear option and an irresponsible abuse of power. From the beginning \nthe American political system has functioned on majority rule but with \nstrong minority rights. Democracy is not winner-take-all. Senator Reid \ngave his word. We negotiated in good faith earlier this year. We \nreached a bipartisan agreement to avoid the nuclear option. Using the \nnuclear option on nominations now would unfairly disregard that \nagreement. If Democrats break the rules to change the rules, political \nminorities and all Americans will lose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I listened to my colleague from Wyoming. He states it \nvery well. I have come to the floor for roughly the same reason, but I \ndon't know how many times you have to say it, because I think basically \nwhat the Senator from Wyoming was saying, and what I want to say is it \nis very difficult to reach agreements in the Senate. But when you reach \nan agreement, particularly only if it involves two Senators but \nparticularly if they are leaders of the Senate, a person's word is his \nbond. That bond ought to be kept--as far as I know, always kept. At \nleast that has been my relationship with fellow Senators. You say you \nare going to do\n\n[[Page S4358]]\n\nsomething and you continue that until it is successful. So here we are, \nno Senator has not kept their word yet, but we hear this threat. So I \ncome to the floor to give my comments on it.\n\n  At the beginning of this Congress, the majority and minority leaders \nreached an agreement as to how to proceed with rules changes. An \nagreement was reached. We agreed to two rule changes: One change to the \nstanding rules and one to the standing order. Senate Republicans gave \nup certain rights and protections in those rules changes. That was the \nfirst part of the agreement. In exchange for these rules changes, the \nmajority leader gave his word to Republican Senators he would not \nutilize what is called around here and around this town the ``nuclear \noption'' and not use it during this Congress.\n  Let me review the exact wording of that agreement as it is recorded \nfor history in the Congressional Record. This year, on January 24, \n2013, the following exchange took place in the Senate. Senator \nMcConnell stated:\n\n       Finally, I would confirm with the majority leader that the \n     Senate would not consider other resolutions relating to any \n     standing order or rules in this Congress unless they went \n     through the regular order process?\n\n  The majority leader replied:\n\n       This is correct. Any other resolution related to Senate \n     procedure would be subject to a regular order process, \n     including consideration by the rules committee.\n\n  In fact, the majority leader gave his word at the beginning of the \nlast Congress as well. He stated:\n\n       The minority leader and I have discussed this issue on \n     numerous occasions. I know that there is a strong interest in \n     rules changes among many in my caucus. In fact, I would \n     support many of these changes through regular order. But I \n     agree that the proper way to change Senate rules is through \n     the procedures established in those rules and I will oppose \n     any effort in this Congress or the next to change the Senate \n     rules other than through regular order.\n\n  Let me just say when a Senator reaches an agreement and gives his \nword that he will stick to that agreement, that should mean something \naround here. As far as I am concerned, it means something all the time. \nI don't think I have been subject to entering an agreement with a \ncolleague that hasn't been kept.\n  Let me emphasize something further. There was no contingency on that \nagreement. Republicans agreed to a change in the rules, and the \nmajority leader gave his word he would not invoke the so-called nuclear \noption. That was the extent of the agreement, period. I trust the \nmajority leader will keep his word and his commitment. If he pulls back \non that commitment, it will irreparably damage the Senate.\n  Moreover, the notion there is now a crisis that demands another rules \nchange is completely manufactured. The minority leader has spoken about \nthe culture of intimidation. I am troubled it is finding its way into \nthe Senate. For the record, in regard to why there is some talk around \nthis institution of changing the rules--something to do with \nnominations and particularly judicial nominations not moving fast \nenough--I am in the middle of that as ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee. So far this year, we have confirmed 22 lower court nominees, \nwith two more scheduled for this week. That is more than double the \nnumber of judges who were confirmed at this point during the previous \nPresident's second term--President Bush.\n  With the nominations this week, we have confirmed 195 of President \nObama's nominees as lower court judges. We have defeated only two. That \nis a batting average of 99-plus percent. I don't know how much better \nwe can get unless it is expected the Senate will not raise any \nquestions about anybody appointed by any President to the judgeships of \nour country.\n  The claim we are obstructing nominees is plainly without foundation. \nI have cooperated with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in \nmoving forward on consensus nominees, and on the Senate floor there has \nbeen a consistent and steady progress on judicial nominations. Yet it \nseems as if the majority is intent on creating a false crisis in order \nto effect changes in longstanding Senate practices. They are now even \nthreatening--can you believe this--to break the rules to change the \nrules. Again, I hope the majority leader keeps his word. We have \ncertainly upheld our end of the bargain.\n  May I inquire of the Chair how many minutes are remaining for the \nminority in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans control 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Fifteen minutes more?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In regard to this whole issue about the Senate as an \ninstitution and where I said if this nuclear option holds it is going \nto destroy the Senate, I think it is very appropriate for us to \nremember the Senate is the only institution in our political branch of \ngovernment where minority views are protected. In the House of \nRepresentatives, whether it is a Republican majority or a Democratic \nmajority, as long as they stick together, they can do anything they \nwant to and they can ignore the minority. But in the Senate, where it \ntakes a supermajority of 60 to get something done, whether there is a \nRepublican or Democratic minority, that minority is protected.\n  Today, where we have 54 Democrats and 46 Republicans, nothing is \ngoing to get done unless it is done in a bipartisan consensus way, and \nthat is why it is so very important we do not destroy that aspect of \nthe uniqueness of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak, and I wish \nto continue discussing what my good friend from Iowa was talking about.\n  There is a reason for the Senate. There are times when it is hard to \nfigure out exactly what that reason is, with the lack of activity we \nhave seen in the last couple of years, but that has very little to do \nwith the rules of the Senate. It has a lot to do with the Senate not \nfollowing its regular order, its regular procedures. In fact, when we \nhave done that, whether it was the highway bill or the Federal Aviation \nAct or the farm bill, we have always produced a successful piece of \nlegislation.\n  The Senate works when we let the Senate work. The Senate works when \npeople are allowed to bring differing points of view to the Senate \nfloor. Frankly, one of the reasons to be in the Senate is to have the \nability to not only bring those ideas to the floor but to have a vote \non those ideas; to let the American people know where we stand and to \nlet the people in the States we represent know where we stand. The idea \nthe Senate is now afraid of the amendment process is a great obstacle \nto the Senate getting its work done.\n\n  Another obstacle is constantly talking about changing the Senate \nrules. The Senate rules have served the Senate well for a long time and \nserved the country well. The Senate rules are what define the Senate in \ngiving individual Senators abilities they wouldn't otherwise have. This \nis the only body like it in the world where a bare majority can't do \nwhatever it wants to do. If that is the way we want to govern the \ncountry, we have one of those bodies already. It is called the House of \nRepresentatives, where the majority absolutely rules, where the Rules \nCommittee has nine members representing the majority and four members \nrepresenting the minority.\n  I was the whip in the House for a long time--the chief vote counter \nin the House--and I can tell you that nine always beats four. It is not \njust 2 to 1, it is 2 to 1, plus 1. That is a body where the majority \nhas incredible capacity to do whatever the majority wants to do. That \nis not the way the Senate is supposed to work.\n  We started off this year trying to agree on how to move the Senate \nforward in an agreeable and effective way, and now we are right back, \nevery day now, hearing: We are going to have to think about changing \nthe rules. When we hear the majority leader talking about changing the \nrules, it usually is not a good indication we will be prepared to get \nanything done.\n  The two leaders, when we started this year, agreed on a plan to make \nsure the Senate wouldn't unilaterally change the rules; that we would \nbreak the rules to change the rules. The thing we would have to do to \nchange the rules is to break the rules, because the rules, once the \nSenate is constituted, can't be changed by just a majority of Senators. \nIt takes more than that.\n\n[[Page S4359]]\n\n  We created two new ways for the majority leader--not the minority \nleader but for the majority leader--to expedite Senate action. We gave \nnew powers to the leader. One of these rules changes passed 78 to 16. \nThe other one passed 86 to 9. These changes gave the majority ways to \nconsider nominations and legislation and going to conference. The \nminority agreed, under certain circumstances, the ability to engage in \ndebate could and would be limited.\n  But now we are back again having the same discussion. The only way \nthe majority leader would be able to get what he apparently wants would \nbe to break the rules. There are enough rules being broken, in my view, \nin Washington right now. One of the problems we face is that the \ncountry, frankly, does not trust their government. When we look across \nthe board, from the IRS to what happened in Benghazi, to what the NSA \nhas said in answering about the retaining of records, we don't need to \ndo yet another thing to convince people there is a reason they should \nnot believe what people in the government say.\n  Let's look at a few things the majority leader said on the Senate \nfloor over the last couple of years. On January of 2011--January 27, to \nbe exact--Mr. Reid said:\n\n       I agree that the proper way to change the Senate rules is \n     through the procedures established in those rules, and I will \n     oppose any effort in this Congress or the next to change the \n     Senate rules other than through the regular order.\n\n  That was January of 2011. Mr. McConnell, in January of this year, \nsaid on the Senate floor--January 24:\n\n       I would confirm with the majority leader that the Senate \n     would not consider other resolutions relating to any standing \n     order or rules in this Congress unless they went through the \n     regular order process?\n\n  That was Senator McConnell's question. In response, Senator Reid \nsaid:\n\n       That is correct. Any other resolutions related to Senate \n     procedure would be subject to a regular order process, \n     including consideration by the Rules Committee.\n\n  I am on the Rules Committee, and we are not talking about any rules \nchanges in the Rules Committee, which Senator Reid said in January of \nthis year would have to be part of looking at that.\n  Of course, a lot of the discussion is: The nominations are taking too \nlong. But these are important jobs, and there is a reason they take so \nlong. In particular, judicial nominees serve for the rest of their \nlives. They are going to serve well beyond, in most cases, the \nPresident who nominates them. So they have taken a long time for quite \na while.\n  I would think the facts are clear the Senate is treating President \nObama's judicial nominees fairly and, in some ways, even better than \nthey treated President Bush's nominees.\n  Already in this Congress, the Senate--in this Congress, the one that \nbegan in January--the Senate has approved 22 of the President's \nlifetime appointments. Twenty-two people on the Federal bench for the \nrest of their lives, that is already happening this year. At a \ncomparable point in President Bush's second term the Senate had \napproved only five of his judicial nominees.\n  In the last Congress, President Obama had 50 percent more \nconfirmations than President Bush; 171 of his nominees were confirmed. \nHis predecessor had 119 under similar circumstances, a time when the \nSenate was also dealing with 2 Supreme Court nominees who, by the way, \nalso serve for life.\n  I think in the first term of President Obama the Senate made the kind \nof progress one would expect the Senate to make on these important \njobs. In fact, President Obama has had more district court \nconfirmations than any President in the previous eight Congresses. One \nwould think that would be a pretty good record on the part of the \nSenate doing its job.\n  The Constitution says the President nominates but, it says, the \nSenate confirms. In my view, those are equally important jobs. In fact, \none could argue that the last job, the one that actually puts the judge \non the bench, is even more important than the first job.\n  Overall, the Senate has confirmed 193 lower court judges under \nPresident Obama and defeated only 2. The Washington Post cited the \nCongressional Research Service conclusion that from nomination to \nconfirmation, which is the most relevant indicator, President Obama's \ncircuit court nominees were being processed about 100 days quicker than \nthose of President Bush. President Bush's nominees took about a year, \n350 days. President Obama's take about 100 days less than that.\n  Let's look at the other side of nominations. There is a difference in \nthe executive nominations, I believe, because they are only likely to \nserve during the term of the President and not exceed that. I think \nthat creates a slightly different standard. The process on these \nnominations has been pretty extraordinary in any view. If anything, the \nObama administration has had more nominations considered quicker than \nthe Bush administration.\n  The Secretary of Energy was recently confirmed 97 to 0. The Secretary \nof the Interior was confirmed 87 to 11; the Secretary of the Treasury, \n71 to 26. Those are substantial votes done in a substantial time. The \ncommerce committee that I am on just this week voted out three \nnominations the President had made with no dissenting votes to report \nthat nomination to the floor.\n  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget was confirmed 96 \nto 0. The Secretary of State was confirmed 94 to 3, only 7 days after \nthe Secretary of State was nominated. Members of the Senate knew the \nSecretary of State pretty well. It was easy to look at that in a quick \nway, but it is pretty hard to imagine a Secretary of State who can be \nconfirmed quicker than 7 days after that person was nominated.\n  The Administrator for the Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services was \nconfirmed 91 to 7. The Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission \nwas confirmed by a voice vote. Yet in spite of all of that, we are \nbeing told by the White House and by others that somehow the Senate's \nrecord on these nominations is worthy of an unprecedented rules change, \nand that rules change would shut out the rights of the minority to \nfully review and debate, particularly, lifetime judicial nominations.\n  The very essence of the constitutional obligation of the Senate is to \nlook at these nominations and decide whether these people should go \nonto the Federal bench for the rest of their lives.\n  I am hopeful that the majority leader will keep his word to the \nSenate and to the American people and ensure that we move onto this \ndebate that should happen--didn't happen in January--and instead of \nchanging the rules, we do what we are supposed to do and do it in a way \nthat meets our obligations as a Senate and our obligations to the \nConstitution. Let's not break the rules to change the rules. Let's get \non with the important business that is before us rather than going back \nto the business we have dealt with months ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/12/senate-section/article/S4359-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I want to visit with my colleagues \nabout border security. It refers to an amendment that I have pending to \nenhance the bill's provisions on border security. I would like to take \na few minutes to discuss why I think my amendment is a good first step \nto restore the faith of the American people in government. That faith \nhas to be restored on the issue of immigration because we promised so \nmuch in the 1986 bill on border security and stopping undocumented \nworkers from coming to this country, so, consequently, for the \ninstitution of Congress and the executive branch both, because we are \nnot enforcing existing law, the credibility on immigration is at stake. \nOn this issue the American people have lost faith that, at least from \nthe immigration point of view, we are really a nation based on the rule \nof law.\n  It is no secret that we in Washington, particularly in the \ncongressional branch, have low approval ratings. A lot of people, \nespecially in recent weeks, wonder about the trust of government--you \nknow, Benghazi, IRS, AP investigations. They have also lost confidence, \nthen, in the leaders. They question our ability to protect their \nprivacy. They question our capacity to protect their security.\n  This is especially true when we talk about border security with \naverage Americans. They do not think we are doing enough. They say we \ndo not need to pass another law. They just do not understand why we \ncannot stop the flow and simply enforce the laws on the books. To them \nit is that simple.\n  It comes up in my town meetings in Iowa, but the bill before us \ncomplicates things. It takes a step backwards on an issue about which \nAmericans care deeply. It says we will legalize millions now--that \nmeans millions of undocumented workers--and we will worry about border \nsecurity down the road, in 5 or 10 years.\n  The authors of this document before us, the Group of 8, say they are \nopen to improving the bill. My amendment now before the Senate does \njust that. My amendment improves the trigger that jump-starts the \nlegalization program. It ensures that the border is secure before one \nperson gets legal status under this act.\n  The American people have shown they are very compassionate, not just \nwilling to deal with this issue of 12 million undocumented workers here \nbut in a lot of other ways so numerous and well-known we do not even \nneed to mention them. Many can come to terms with a legalization \nprogram.\n  But many would say that a legalization program should be tied to \nborder security or enforcement. That is what is very simple for the \nAmerican people: secure the borders. Let me give some examples.\n  Bloomberg recently released a poll in which they asked the following \nquestion:\n\n       Congress is debating changing immigration laws. Do you \n     support or oppose a revision of immigration policy that would \n     provide a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented \n     immigrants in the United States?\n\n  Madam President, 46 percent said they would support it.\n  The poll then went on to ask the same respondents about elements in \nthe immigration bill, and 85 percent said they favored ``strengthening \nborder security and creating a system to track foreigners entering and \nleaving the country.'' So we have 46 percent saying they support \nimmigration, but 85 percent of the same group say it is very necessary \nto strengthen border security.\n  In Iowa, a poll by the Des Moines Register found that 58 percent of \nthe respondents were OK with a path to citizenship for undocumented \nimmigrants after--and I emphasize the word ``after''--the border is \nsecure. Almost every poll shows the same results.\n  Sure, people would consider a legalization program, but it is almost \nalways tied to the condition of border security. The American people do \nnot think we are doing enough to secure the border. In a poll conducted \nby Anderson Robbins Research and Shaw & Company, 60 percent of those \npolled said the current level of security at the country's border is \nnot strict enough. Also, 69 percent of the respondents said they favor \nrequiring completion of a new border security measure first before \nmaking other changes in immigration policies.\n  Unfortunately, too many people have been led to believe this bill \nwill force the Secretary of Homeland Security to secure the border. In \nfact, it does not guarantee that before legalization. That is why we \nneed to pass my amendment on file now. It is a good first step to \nensuring that we stop the flow of undocumented workers coming to this \ncountry. We need to prove to the American people that we can do our \njob. We need to show them we are committed to security.\n  Bottom line: Nobody says the existing immigration system is as it \nshould be. People support reform, but they support reform if we have \nborder security first.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, it is good that the Nation is having this \ndebate on immigration, but I think we ought to talk about what is truly \ninvolved. For the last several months--even before our bill was \ndrafted, people were saying we cannot proceed with immigration reform \nuntil we do more to secure our borders. Now that we have a bill--a bill \nthat takes extraordinary steps to further secure an already strong \nborder--we continue to hear we must wait. We are told that the \nimmigration bill reported from the Senate Judiciary Committee last \nmonth, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration \nModernization Act, S. 744, does not do enough.\n  It is so easy to wait. Oh, let's wait until next year or the year \nafter or the year after that, because then the 100 Members of the \nSenate don't have to vote. We can be on everybody's side. That is not \nwhy we were elected. We were elected to vote yes or to vote no. Let's \nstart moving forward and stand up to vote, because when they say we \nhave to wait for more security it ignores the facts.\n  We have been pouring billions of dollars into border security for \nyears--billions. Keep this in mind: Sometimes we argue over $15, $20, \n$30 million to help educate our children and that becomes a big issue. \nWe have put billions of dollars into border security. Since the Senate \nlast considered immigration reform in 2006 and 2007, we have made \nenormous strides on border security. This bill takes even more steps to \nprevent and deter illegal immigration.\n  We can talk about philosophy and we can talk about things people have \nheard. I would like to talk about facts. It may be inconvenient to some \nof those who don't want to have immigration reform, but the facts speak \nfor themselves. The Border Patrol has doubled in the past 10 years. It \nnow has more than 21,000 agents. That is more than at any time in its \nhistory. The Obama administration has more than 21,000 Border Patrol \nagents, which is more than they have ever had under either Democratic \nor Republican administrations.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has deployed additional \ntechnology in aircraft and hundreds of miles of fencing along the \nsouthern border. The Department has built more than 650 miles of \nfencing along the southern border, including more than 350 miles of \npedestrian fencing.\n  There has been talk about illegal crossing. Here is a fact: Illegal \nborder crossing is at a near 40-year low under this administration \nbecause fewer people are trying to cross. In 2005, Border Patrol \napprehended more than 1.1 million individuals who unlawfully crossed \nthe border. In 2012, that number went down to one-third--roughly \n365,000. At the same time, deportation, as we all know, is at a record \nhigh level.\n  Here is one of the things we should talk about: People ignore the \nfact that we spend more money on enforcing immigration and customs \nlaws--$18 billion each year--than we do on all of\n\n[[Page S4361]]\n\nour other Federal law enforcement agencies put together. For those who \ncare about law enforcement, that is kind of a striking number. So we \nhave done ``enforcement first.''\n  This legislation goes even further to build on what has been a \nsuccessful record. Chairman Carper of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and I wrote a letter to our colleagues \nyesterday.\n  In fact, I ask unanimous consent that our letter be printed in the \nRecord at the end of my statement.\n  In the letter, we point out that the bill appropriates up to another \n$6.5 billion to secure the border. It authorizes another 3,500 Customs \nand Border Protection officers. It allows Governors to deploy the \nNational Guard to the southwest border region. It expands border \nsecurity and use of technology at the border. I mean, this is not a \nbill that ignores enforcement; it expands it.\n  It increases the already strict criminal penalties against those \nunlawfully crossing the border and provides additional resources for \ntheir criminal prosecution. It sets clear statutory goals: The \nprevention of 90 percent of illegal entries and persistent surveillance \nof the entire southern border. If DHS doesn't meet these goals within 5 \nyears, the bill establishes a bipartisan commission to develop further \nconcrete plans and provides an additional $2 billion to carry out those \nplans.\n  Some say: I have a better plan. Come on. The needs at the border \nchange all the time, so we built in flexibility to meet those needs.\n  The bill sets tough border security triggers. In fact, before DHS can \nregister any undocumented individuals for provisional status, it has to \nprovide Congress with two detailed plans laying out exactly how it is \ngoing to meet statutory goals: a comprehensive strategy and another \nspecific to fencing. This is one of the toughest pieces of legislation \non the security of our borders that has ever been before the Senate.\n  The Department of Homeland Security cannot issue green cards to these \nindividuals for 10 years--and even then only after four triggers are \nsatisfied: Comprehensive border security strategy is substantially \ndeployed; the fencing strategy is substantially completed; a mandatory \nelectronic employment verification system is established for all \nemployers; and an electronic exit system based on machine-readable \ntravel documents is in place at airports and seaports. Even then we \nadded more during the Judiciary Committee's markup of this bill. We \nadopted an amendment offered by Senator Grassley that expands the \nbill's 90 percent effectiveness rate to the entire southern border, not \njust high-risk sectors.\n  So those who say they want more security than what we have here--it \nis virtually impossible to have more security. I think we might ask: \nAre you saying you don't want any immigration bill? This is similar to \ndebates we have had--and I use the example of the work we did to bring \nabout peace in Northern Ireland during the Clinton administration.\n  The former majority leader of this body, Senator George Mitchell, did \na heroic effort, along with others, on both the Protestant and Catholic \nside in Northern Ireland. There were some who said we cannot have a \npeace agreement until we do not have a single act of violence. I said, \nOK. Senator Mitchell and President Clinton said, so in other words, you \nare going to let one disgruntled person on either side veto any peace \nagreement?\n  Let us not say we will have no immigration bill until not one person \ncrosses our border illegally. That is making the perfect the enemy of \nthe good, and that means we will never have it.\n  I was pleased the committee also looked at two border-related \namendments I offered with Senator Cornyn--the Leahy-Cornyn amendments. \nI mention this because there are a number of amendments offered which \nare bipartisan from Democrats and Republicans alike. One helps protect \ncross-border travel and tourism by prohibiting land border crossing \nfees. The other ensures that DHS has flexibility to spend the bill's \nfencing fund on the most effective infrastructure and technology \navailable, while still requiring that $1 billion be allocated to \nfencing. It also requires consultation with relevant stake holders and \nrespect for State and local laws when DHS implements fencing projects. \nAgain, knowing that what we do or want today may be different from what \nwe want a few years from now.\n  I might say, parenthetically, the amendment I offered with Senator \nCornyn to stop border crossing fees on either the southern border or \nnorthern border--some say we are going to turn our customs agents into \ntoll collectors. I live an hour's drive from the Canadian border. We go \nback and forth like it is another State.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer lives in a State that borders \nCanada. She knows what it is like going back and forth, and she also \nknows how important that is to the economy of her State and my State, \njust as it is to Canada. We ought to luxuriate in the fact that Canada \nis such a friendly neighbor and the relationship we have with them is \nso good. Some of us are even related to people who have Canadian \nancestry. I have been married to a woman whose parents came from \nCanada. She was born in the United States. We have been married for \nalmost 51 years. I am delighted Canadians come across our border and \nsettle in Vermont.\n\n  I am also working on another amendment for Senate consideration \nregarding the use of vehicle checkpoints in the 100-mile border zone.\n  I simply do not understand how some can argue that this bill does not \ndo enough to secure the border. We do that in this bill. We massively \nincrease the money, the agents, the technology used on the border, and \nthis is in addition to the billions--yes, billions--of dollars we \nalready spend each year to physically stop people from crossing.\n  Some of the same people who want more security are the same people \nwho say we are spending too much money in the Federal government. Well, \nshort of putting up a steel wall, it is hard to imagine what more we \ncan physically do from stopping people from crossing. As Chairman \nCarper said, if we build a 25-foot wall, I will show you somebody with \na 26-foot ladder. We know people will still come. Because--and let's be \nserious for a moment--a fence does not address the root causes of \nillegal immigration. People come here looking for jobs, and American \nbusinesses hire them because they will do the jobs nobody else will. \nYes, some come here to join their families, as the current backlogs for \nfamily-sponsored green cards would otherwise force them to wait years.\n  If we are serious about stopping illegal immigration, we have to do \nmore than build a bigger, longer, and higher fence. That won't work. We \nhave to create legal ways for people to enter the country--people who \nwant to come here for work and to join family members. Then we have to \nmake it harder for people to find work if they do not use legal \navenues, by requiring a nationwide employment verification system known \nas E-Verify--some have called this a virtual fence--and by increasing \npenalties on employers who hire undocumented workers. This bill does \nexactly that.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from New York, Senator Schumer, \ntalks about riding his bicycle around Brooklyn and seeing people who \nare probably undocumented and contractors coming up to them and saying, \nI will hire you for $15 a day, and they have to take the job. If we \nhave real teeth, as our bill does, real penalties on employers who hire \nundocumented workers, they would instead have to hire those who are \nlegal and have to pay at least minimum wage and have to put money into \nSocial Security and so on. It makes a big difference.\n  As Grover Norquist said in his testimony, our bill, if adopted, would \nimprove the finances of our Nation. But more than that, this \nlegislation provides workable, flexible, affordable, humane solutions. \nIt is tough, it is fair, and it is practical. Yet, just as in 2006 and \n2007, we are still hearing from some Senators who oppose comprehensive \nimmigration reform that we must do more to secure the border and \nenforce our laws.\n  I welcome additional ideas on how to enhance border security and \npublic safety. I want people to bring forth their amendments to be \nvoted on up or down. Our goal must be to secure the border, not seal \nit.\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will oppose efforts \nthat\n\n[[Page S4362]]\n\nimpose unrealistic, excessively costly, overly rigid, inhumane, or \nineffective border security measures, and I will oppose efforts to \nmodify the triggers in ways that could unduly delay or prevent the \nearned legalization path--such as efforts to require Congress to ratify \nthe trigger certifications. We have waited too long already. That \nincludes the amendment offered by my friend from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley, which would significantly delay even the initial registration \nprocess for the 11 million undocumented individuals in this country.\n  The bottom line is this: The pathway to citizenship must be earned, \nbut it also must be attainable.\n  Let's not forget that bringing 11 million people out of the shadows \nis not only the moral thing to do, it helps keep this country safe so \nwe know who is here and we can focus our resources on those who \nactually pose a threat.\n  I don't often quote the Wall Street Journal editorial board, but I \nwill quote them here. They said:\n\n       [Those] who claim we must ``secure the border first'' \n     ignore the progress already made, because their real goal \n     isn't border security, it is to use border security as an \n     excuse to kill immigration reform.\n\n  We need immigration reform. It is a moral issue. It speaks to the \ngreatness of our country. But it is also a national security issue and \na public safety issue. Attempts to undermine immigration reform may \ncome in the guise of promoting border security, but let us not be \nfooled. As 76 former State attorneys general recently wrote: ``Put \nsimply, practical, comprehensive reform to our Federal immigration laws \nwill make us all safer.''\n  We must fix our broken immigration system once and for all. As I have \nsaid many times on this floor, I think of my maternal grandparents \ncoming to Vermont from Italy and making Vermont a better State with the \njobs they created, and their grandson became a Senator. I think of my \nwife's parents, coming from Quebec, bringing their French language but \nalso bringing English, and my wife was born in Vermont as a result of \nthat. But I think of her extended family--her father, uncle, and \nothers--creating many jobs in Vermont and making Vermont better. Every \none of us can tell stories such as that. Let's not forget those people.\n  Let's not say that what worked for our ancestors is no longer \navailable. Let's speak as the conscience of the Nation. One hundred \nSenators can be the conscience of the Nation and sometimes are, as we \nwere on the Violence Against Women Act. It can now be so now, on the \nimmigration bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 2013.\n       Dear Colleague, As the Senate prepares to take up 5.744, \n     the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration \n     Modernization Act, as amended, we write to draw your \n     attention to the strong border security provisions in the \n     bill. As chairmen of the Judiciary Committee and the Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, we have \n     conducted extensive oversight of the Department of Homeland \n     Security and its enforcement record. The United States has \n     made significant progress on border security and immigration \n     enforcement in recent years, and this bill reinforces and \n     advances that progress in many ways.\n       The Wall Street Journal editorial board recently explained \n     just how far we have come since the last time that the Senate \n     considered comprehensive immigration reform:\n       The number of border patrol agents has grown to a small \n     army of 21,370, or triple the personnel employed as recently \n     as the Clinton Presidency. There are an additional 21,000 \n     Customs and Border Protection officers.\n       The feds have built some 300 radar and camera towers as \n     well as 650 miles of single, double and in some places triple \n     fencing. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) now has \n     the ability to detain 34,000 criminals and aliens at one \n     time. The Border Patrol deploys military-style vehicles, 276 \n     aircraft, nearly 300 marine vessels, along with state-of-the-\n     art surveillance.\n       Meanwhile, illegal entries nationwide are at four-decade \n     lows. Apprehensions of illegal entrants exceeded 1.1 million \n     in 2005 but by 2012 had fallen by two-thirds to 365,000, the \n     lowest level since 1971 with the exception of 2011, the \n     previous 40-year low.\n       Last year the Government Accountability Office (GAO) \n     examined federal data on ``estimated known illegal entries'' \n     across the Mexican border. The numbers were way down nearly \n     everywhere. In San Diego, illegal entries fell to about \n     55,000 in 2011 from more than 265,000 in 2006. In Tucson--the \n     gateway to Arizona--illegal entries fell to about 200,000 \n     from 600,000 over those years. And in El Paso illegal \n     crossings tumbled to 30,000 a year from more than 350,000.\n       Even more dramatic is GAO's analysis of illegals who escape \n     through the enforcement net, a statistic called ``got \n     aways.'' In nine major Southern border crossing areas, \n     including the main gateways of Tucson, San Diego and the Rio \n     Grande, got aways fell to an estimated 86,000 in 2011 from \n     615,000 in 2006. That's an 86% decline in foreigners who \n     successfully snuck into the country from Mexico.\n       Border Security Reality Check, Wall Street Journal (May 2, \n     2013).\n       Let there be no mistake: We have poured billions of dollars \n     into border security over the past decade. In fact, according \n     to a recent Migration Policy Institute report, we spend more \n     money on enforcing our immigration and customs laws--$18 \n     billion each year--than we do on all other federal law \n     enforcement agencies combined. The result of this \n     unprecedented investment of taxpayer money is that, as \n     Secretary Napolitano has told us, our borders are more secure \n     than they have ever been.\n       The bill, as amended, builds on these successes by \n     allocating substantial additional resources to border \n     security. As outlined in the Senate Judiciary Committee's \n     report on the bill, S. 744, as amended, appropriates up to \n     $6.5 billion to secure the border beyond current spending \n     levels; authorizes 3,500 additional Customs and Border \n     Protection officers for our ports of entry; permits the \n     deployment of the National Guard to the Southwest border \n     region; significantly expands border security infrastructure, \n     such as Border Patrol stations and forward operating bases; \n     calls for the further use of technology at the border, \n     including additional unarmed unmanned aerial vehicles; \n     provides additional resources for criminal prosecutions of \n     those unlawfully crossing the border; and authorizes \n     reimbursements to State, local and tribal governments for \n     their costs related to illegal immigration.\n       In addition to providing these new resources and \n     authorities to enhance our border security operations, the \n     bill also enhances the accountability of our border \n     officials. The bill, as amended, establishes a statutory \n     goal, known as the ``effectiveness rate,'' of preventing 90 \n     percent of illegal entries at the border, and requires DHS to \n     report to Congress whether it is achieving this rate. It also \n     instructs DHS to achieve persistent surveillance over the \n     border, so that the American public and Congress can know \n     exactly how many people are trying to cross the border \n     illegally each year. If these statutory goals are not met \n     within 5 years, the bill establishes a bipartisan Southern \n     Border Security Commission, with members appointed by the \n     President, both Houses of Congress, and the Governors of our \n     border states. This Commission will be charged with \n     developing further concrete plans to meet the statutory goals \n     in the bill, and is provided with an additional $2 billion to \n     carry out its plan. During the Senate Judiciary Committee's \n     markup of the bill, the Committee adopted additional \n     provisions to strengthen border security, such as an \n     amendment offered by Senator Grassley to expand the bill's \n     90% effectiveness rate and persistent surveillance goals to \n     cover the. entire Southern border, not just its high-risk \n     sectors.\n       The bill, as amended, also establishes tough triggers that \n     will ensure additional border security steps are taken before \n     the earned path to legalization can begin. Specifically, DHS \n     must provide to Congress a Comprehensive Southern Border \n     Security Strategy and a Southern Border Fencing Strategy that \n     lay out exactly how it will meet the statutory goals outlined \n     above before it can begin to register undocumented \n     individuals for provisional status. These Registered \n     Provisional Immigrants, in turn, will be allowed to apply for \n     green cards after 10 years--but only after:\n       1. the Secretary certifies that the Comprehensive Southern \n     Border Security Strategy is substantially deployed and \n     substantially operational;\n       2. the Secretary certifies that the Southern Border Fencing \n     Strategy is implemented and substantially completed;\n       3. DHS has implemented a mandatory employment verification \n     system to be used by all employers; and\n       4. DHS is using an electronic exit system at air and \n     seaports based on machine-readable travel documents to better \n     identify individuals who overstay their visas by tracking the \n     departures of non-citizens.\n       The bill's comprehensive approach to immigration reform \n     will also enhance border security, by reducing the incentives \n     that lead people to come here illegally. We need to stop \n     focusing our attention on the symptoms, and start dealing \n     with the underlying root causes in a way that is tough, \n     practical, and fair. The Border Security, Economic \n     Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, as amended, \n     accomplishes that goal. First, undocumented individuals will \n     find it much more difficult to work, because the bill \n     requires a nationwide electronic employment verification \n     system and enhances penalties for employers who hire \n     undocumented workers. Second, the bill, as amended, creates a \n     more rational immigration system that provides legal avenues \n     for eligible individuals to enter the country for work or to \n     join their family members. As former Homeland Security \n     Secretary Michael Chertoff wrote, ``without expanded legal \n     immigration\n\n[[Page S4363]]\n\n     to address the needs of the labor market, border security \n     will be harder and more expensive to achieve'' (Obama 's \n     Immigration Agenda, The Washington Post, Feb. 14, 2013). By \n     making it more difficult for employers to hire undocumented \n     workers, creating legal ways to enter the country for \n     immigrants coming for legitimate reasons, and allowing \n     eligible undocumented individuals to earn a path to \n     citizenship, this bill will allow the Department of Homeland \n     Security to focus its efforts on addressing threats to our \n     national security and public safety.\n       In sum, S. 744, as amended, will dramatically reduce \n     illegal immigration and improve national security. We look \n     forward to considering additional ideas to improve border \n     security further during Senate floor consideration, \n     especially those that present solutions that are effective, \n     workable, affordable, and flexible enough to allow the \n     Department of Homeland Security to deploy the right resources \n     where they are needed, without creating undue delays to \n     prevent undocumented individuals from earning a path to \n     citizenship. As we continue to build on the unprecedented \n     investments that have been made to secure our borders, we \n     must ensure that extreme or unworkable proposals do not \n     become a barrier to moving forward on comprehensive reforms \n     that are also critical to securing our borders. These reforms \n     include a path to citizenship for the undocumented in the \n     United States who work, pay taxes, learn English, pass \n     criminal background checks, pay substantial fines, and get in \n     line behind those who applied to come here legally and have \n     been waiting for years.\n       The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration \n     Modernization Act, as amended, makes important improvements \n     to our immigration system that will strengthen national \n     security and benefit our nation as a whole. We look forward \n     to working with you as the Senate considers this legislation \n     and, hopefully, improves it.\n           Sincerely,\n     Patrick Leahy,\n       Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee.\n     Tom Carper,\n       Chairman, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \n     Committee.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I see my good friend, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Vermont. I \nappreciate what he has said about this issue. This is a debate we need \nto undertake, and we are doing so. We are doing it in a way that the \nSenate in my previous experience has essentially dealt with \nlegislation. We have brought it to the floor and it has come through \nthe regular process. The committee has held extensive hearings on the \nissue. There is a national debate going on. We are hearing from our \nconstituents back at home. I am not on the committee that has \njurisdiction here, but I have been following it carefully in terms of \nwhat has been presented, the bill that has been drafted, the amendments \nthat have been offered, which ones have succeeded, and which ones \nhaven't. This is a major issue which deserves and is getting--unlike \nmost of what has happened here in the last couple of years--a thorough \ndebate, with opportunities to offer amendments, with opportunities to \nwork to find ways to address concerns about the current legislation \nbefore us. That is why I voted for the motion to proceed. This is an \nissue that needs to be discussed so that, hopefully, a system we know \nis broken--I think there is pretty much unanimous agreement on the fact \nour current immigration system is full of flaws and has not achieved \nwhat was promised when the initial legislation was passed. It needs to \nbe fixed because the status quo simply perpetuates and adds to the \nproblem we have with illegal immigration and all the impacts on our \ncountry, including the distrust of the American people. So, hopefully, \nwe are going to come forward with credible legislation this time to \naddress the real problems. So I am pleased we are having this debate.\n  We are a Nation of immigrants. It is part of our rich history. While \nall of those who have come to our shores over the decades may have \ndifferent stories and a different journey, most share a common goal. \nThey want the opportunity to live in a free society. They want to \nadvance economically. They want to pursue the American dream. They want \nto provide for their children and their children's children the \nfreedoms and the opportunities that exist in America.\n  The American dream is a reality that is available for people to \nachieve if given the opportunity to work hard. I am the son of an \nimmigrant. My mother's family came here to the United States legally in \nsearch of a better life and better opportunities not just for \nthemselves but for their children and generations to follow.\n  What my mother learned and passed down to her children is that with \nthese freedoms granted to us as American citizens come \nresponsibilities. We have the responsibility to cherish and defend our \nConstitution. We have the responsibility to be engaged citizens in our \ncommunities. We have the responsibility to vote and take part in the \nelectoral process and, we have a responsibility to come to the aid of \nour neighbors in need. We have been, and hopefully will continue to be, \na compassionate country--a country that believes all human beings are \ncreated equal and that our rights are endowed not by a king, not by a \nPresident, not by a government, but by God.\n  In America, it doesn't matter where one comes from or what one's last \nname may be. If given the opportunity and the chance, a person can \nsucceed, and that is what sets us apart from so many other countries. \nThat is what makes us a shining light, a beacon to the rest of the \nworld, and it is that light that attracts so many to our shores with \nhopes and dreams of a better future.\n  During my time as Ambassador to Germany, Colin Powell, then Secretary \nof State, made many visits. One of those visits included a stop on the \nway back from a trip to India. As we were riding from the airport to \nhis first appointment, he shared with me something that I think pretty \nmuch says it all about the world's view of America. He was talking to \nme about how we sometimes see people holding demonstrations and \nprotests against America. He said, but, you know, as I was traveling in \nthe motorcade down the main street, there was an Indian citizen there \nwith a huge sign in big, bold letters that said ``Yankee, go home.'' \nAnd in parentheses, right underneath those bold letters, it said, ``and \nplease take me with you.'' I think that little story illustrates how \nmuch of the world views America: a place they would like to get to.\n  So as we address this issue, I think it is important to understand \nthat this country is a magnet. It is a magnet for people to come and \nfulfill their dreams, to make their lives better and their children's \nlives better.\n  But if we are a country that cannot have an orderly and effective \nprocess of legal immigration, we are going to lose the support of the \nAmerican people. If individuals continue to learn that those who come \nthe right way, the legal way, have to stand in line for 10, 12, 15, 20 \nyears, hoping to win the lottery, hoping to be one of those select \npeople who are chosen, we will continue to see more and more illegal \nimmigration. That is why it is important to address this issue and to \nmake the necessary reforms.\n  As I said earlier, it is an indisputable fact that our current \nimmigration system has failed. It has failed the citizens of this \ncountry and it has failed those who have been standing in line for \nyears trying to become eligible for immigration through the legal \nprocess. Today we have 11 million undocumented individuals living in \nour country. Approximately 40 percent of those who are here illegally \narrive legally, on a legal basis for a temporary time. But once having \ncome to our shores, they have overstayed their visas, absorbed \nthemselves into our country and have not returned to their country. \nThat is an issue. That is a problem, and we need to address that. We \nneed to have a certified system in place that works--not promises, not \nwords on pieces of paper--but a system that has the credibility to \nwork, that when we grant people temporary status to come here to study, \ncome here to visit, come here to see relatives, come here for whatever \nreason on a temporary basis, we know who comes in and we know who goes \nout and we know those who stay and we take appropriate action. That is \nsimply a logical, legal way of having a system the American people can \ntrust and believe in.\n  One of the major issues here is our southern border and securing that \nborder. I had the opportunity to spend a few days on the border from \nthe Pacific Ocean in southern California and all the way across the \nArizona border. So I had a pretty good look at this.\n\n  As ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on\n\n[[Page S4364]]\n\nHomeland Security, I wanted to find out how we were spending our money, \nwhat kind of success we were having, what problems we faced, and how we \nshould better address our resources. It was instructive, and I urge my \ncolleagues to take the opportunity to do the same.\n  As a result of that, despite efforts to make that border secure, \n``secure'' is not the right word to define where we are now. So one of \nthe issues before us is: What do we do to make our borders more secure \nin a way that can convince the American people and the people we \nrepresent that this time--this time--we have in place a process which \nwill result in a secured border?\n  We went through this in 1986. Ronald Reagan proposed immigration \nreform. I voted for it. At the time, we had 3 million illegal \nimmigrants. The promise in that legislation was that we would secure \nthe border, and we would solve the problem of illegal immigration. \nObviously, we did not. Today we have 11 million and perhaps counting.\n  It is appropriate to say that the border is more secure than it was \nthen. We have, over the years, and particularly in later years with a \nsurge of illegal immigrants coming into our country, taken significant \nsteps: increased border patrol agents, introduced sophisticated \ntechnology--a whole range of things that we have invested--money, \nresources, and manpower to make that border more secure.\n  But we cannot truthfully come down here today and say the border is \nsecure. We can say: We are going to make it secure and here is how we \nare going to do it. But I think we need something that is credible \nbecause the American people will simply say: How do we know you are not \ngoing to be here 5 years from now, 10 years from now, saying: I know we \ntold you it was going to be secure and I know we still have a \nsignificant problem, but we will get it better next time. We do not \nwant to repeat that mistake. If that happens again, I think it will be \na long time before we are able to come down with a sensible reform \nproposal.\n  Clearly, there is more work to do there, and it is going to be \ndifficult for me to support a bill that does not put in place something \nthat is credible relative to our ability to strengthen our border \nsecurity.\n  We cannot ignore this problem. We cannot ignore the fact that people \ncontinue to stay in our country illegally or cross our borders \nillegally. The status quo is not working. It encourages illegal \nimmigrants to come across the border, which is why we need this debate, \nwhy we need reforms to our current broken system, and why we need to \nassure the American people we are going to work to repair this broken \nsystem.\n  It is critical for our economic growth, it is critical for securing \nour borders, and it is critical for strengthening our national \nsecurity. That is why I supported the motion to proceed to this debate \non this important issue. Immigration reform needs to take place in an \nopen, fair, and thorough debate, with the input of the American people, \nand I am certainly hearing from many of them in my State.\n  I do have to say, I have serious concerns with the current text of \nthe legislation that has come out of the Judiciary Committee, and I \nbelieve this bill needs to be improved before I could support it. I am \nparticularly concerned and focused on improving the border security \nmeasures, making sure, as I said, we do not make the same mistakes we \nmade in 1986. We must take steps now to secure it before we consider \ngranting legal status to illegal immigrants.\n  Additionally, I wish to work with my colleagues to improve the \nemployer verification program, which I think is essential to dealing \nwith the problem, and also our exit system measures, which I just \ndiscussed before about the people who come legally for a temporary stay \nbut then we do not know if they go back home.\n  I hope over the days ahead that we can live up to our reputation of \nbeing the most deliberative body in the world. People say: Why don't \nyou get more things done? There is either one of two answers to that. \nOne is, we do not bring bills to the floor and offer the opportunity to \ndebate in an open way. But the second is that this is exactly what we \nneed to do. On an issue of this importance, we clearly need this, and I \nam pleased that process is going to go forward.\n  But let's not rush to a decision. Let's do it right. Let's not stand \nand declare that every amendment, if it does not fit with what the \ncurrent bill before us addresses, then it is a poison pill that is \nsimply being offered because Members do not want anything to pass. I do \nnot fall in that category. I do not think we should have poison pills \neither. But a lot of these amendments I think go to addressing the \nproblem we face as well as the inadequacies of the bill before us. \nThere are a lot of sections in the bill that need fixing and a lot of \namendments that will be offered are genuine and aim to make the bill \nbetter. A lot of those are offered by people who would like to get \ncredible, workable, necessary immigration reform legislation passed.\n  But if the sponsors of the bill or the supporters of the current text \nof the bill are simply going to declare that every amendment is a \npoison pill and that the only intent of the Members offering the \namendment is to kill the bill, that is not constructive and that is not \nhow we should go forward.\n  So let's make sure what we do delivers on the promises we are making \nto secure our borders first, to deal with employer verification, \nimprove the existing exit system, and to provide important provisions \nto ensure we have a legal immigration system that can benefit our \ncountry and continue the great story of America.\n  I am looking forward to working with my colleagues to improve this \nlegislation. I would like to see legitimate, real, effective border \ncontrol, and a number of other features, but I would like to get our \nsystem reformed because the current system is not working.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity for all \nMembers of this body to participate in a debate and amendments and \ndiscussion of the bill that was reported out through the Judiciary \nCommittee in the regular order. If my colleagues have any doubt about \nthis so-called Group of 8, I wish to assure them we are continuing to \nlook for ways to improve the legislation. In fact, I have a couple \namendments myself that I believe would help improve the legislation and \nmake it better and stronger.\n  But the fact is this legislation is absolutely needed. It is needed \nfor a variety of reasons, most of which I will not go into at this \ntime. But right now I hope my colleagues and the American people \nunderstand--and I think they do because recent polling overwhelmingly \nsupports this legislation--I hope they understand that the status quo \nis totally unacceptable. The status quo is de facto amnesty. The status \nquo is 11 million people living in the shadows, and they are not going \nhome. Anybody who thinks we are going to round up 11 million people and \nsend them back to the country they came from--most of them from south \nof our border--obviously is unaware of the logistics that would be \nrequired.\n  So if the status quo is unacceptable, don't we all share the same \ngoal of a secure border, of addressing the issue of these 11 million \npeople who are in this country living in the shadows and, by the way, \nbeing exploited in incredible fashion because they do not have the \nrights of citizens. They did break our laws by coming here, and we are \nmaking them pay a heavy price for doing so, including a fine, including \nlearning English, including paying back taxes, including waiting 10 \nyears before they would be eligible for a green card. Most important to \nmany Americans, they get in line behind everybody who waited--who \nwaited legally either inside this country or outside it. They have to \nget in line behind them and they have to be working for those 10 years \nand they have to pay fees of $500, another $500 after 5 years, another \n$1,000 as they apply for a green card. They have to undergo a \nbackground check. Anyone who has committed crimes in this country is \ngoing to be deported. Most important, this legislation dries up the \nmagnet that pulls people into this country where they believe they can \nfind work.\n  Over 40 percent of the people who are in this country illegally never \ncrossed a single border. They came to this country on a visa and it is \nexpired. So\n\n[[Page S4365]]\n\nthat is why E-Verify, which we do not hear a lot about in this debate, \nis so important. Because under the E-Verify system--which means a \ndocument that is verifiable which identifies the individual--that \nemployer who hires someone who does not have that documentation can be \nsubject to prosecution and heavy fines and even more if they are repeat \noffenders.\n  Once the word gets out all over the world--and especially south of \nour border, where living conditions are far worse than in the United \nStates of America--then they are going to say: I am not going to come \nbecause I can't get a job once I am here.\n  Today, in the streets of Sonora, Mexico, you can buy a birth \ncertificate for about $40. So that person comes and shows it to the \nemployer and they are hired. The E-Verify system will make that \nimpossible. That is one of the key elements of this legislation.\n  I have been on the border in Arizona for the last 30 years. I have \nseen the Border Patrol grow from 4,000 to 21,000. I have seen the \nNational Guard deployed to the border. I have seen drones flying along \nthe border. I have seen fences built. We have to do more. We have to do \na lot more, and those are provisions in this bill. But to somehow say \nthere has not been significant advancements in border security defies \nthe facts on the ground.\n  The border is still not secure, despite what we might hear the \nSecretary of Homeland Security say. It is not secure. But the \nprovisions in this bill, I am confident--I can tell my colleagues from \n30 years of experience--I am confident it will make this border secure, \nas much as is humanly possible, remembering that there is an aspect of \nthis issue we do not talk about; that is, the flow of drugs. Because, \nmy friends, as long as there is a demand in this country for drugs, \ndrugs are going to find a way into this country. It is just a \nfundamental of economics. We have not had nearly the discussion \nnationally, much less in this body, about the issue of the drugs that \nflow across our border. Believe me, if there is a demand, they will \nfind a way, whether it is an ultralight, whether it is a tunnel or \nwhether it is a submarine.\n  But the fact is that we can get this border secured. The answer, my \nfriends, as is proposed in the Cornyn amendment--that we hire 10,000 \nmore Border Patrol--is not a recognition of what we truly need. What we \nneed is technology. We need to use the VADER radar that was developed \nin Iraq, where we can track people back to where they came from. We \nneed to have more drones. We need to have more sensors on the ground, \nand I have gotten from the Border Patrol--not from the Department of \nHomeland Security but from the Border Patrol--a detailed list of every \nsingle piece of equipment that they believe is necessary in all nine \nsectors of our border in order to make our border secure, and it is \ndetailed. It talks about, for example, at the Yuma and Tucson sectors: \n50 fixed towers, 73 fixed camera systems, 28 mobile surveillance \nsystems, 685 unattended ground sensors, 22 hand-held equipment devices.\n  The list goes on and on. It is detailed. I will be proposing this as \nan amendment on this bill to let my colleagues know that this is the \nrecommendation of the men and women who are on our border, who are \ntaking this issue on every single day they are at work--in fact, under \nvery difficult conditions. I note that the temperature in southern \nArizona is over 110 degrees today. It is very tough on individuals as \nthey are patrolling our border. But we need helicopters. We need VADER \nradar. We need a whole lot of things. That will be paid for with \napproximately $6 billion that we provide in this bill--over $6 billion. \nWe can purchase a lot of equipment that way. We are going to use the \nArmy. We are going to use the Army to tell us how we can best surveil \nand enforce this border because of the experience they have had \noverseas in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I say to my colleagues, I am not apologizing for this legislation we \nhave proposed and as sent through the Judiciary Committee, I am proud \nof it. I am confident we will secure this border by taking the measures \nthat will be required in this legislation.\n  I also have to say in all candor, my friends, there are amendments \nthat will be proposed that will assist and make this bill better and \nimprove it. There are also amendments that will be designed to kill it. \nI intend to do everything I can to reflect the will of the American \npeople. I will be entering into the Record poll after poll after poll \nthat shows that over 70 percent of the American people, if they are \nconfident that we are going to secure our borders and if they are \nconfident that these people will be brought out of the shadows, they \nwill have to pay a fine, back taxes, learn English, and get in line \nbehind everybody else, they support this path to citizenship after a \n10-year period of having legal status in this country.\n  Why is it important for them to have a legal status if they have not \ncommitted crimes and they qualify? My friends, today on street corners \nall over America, particularly in the Southwest, there are men and \nwomen who are standing on a street corner waiting to be picked up by \nsomeone and taken to repair their roof or to cut their grass or to do \nmenial labor. Do you know what they are getting out of that? They are \ngetting below minimum wage because they have no recourse. They have no \nrecourse as to any mistreatment they might suffer. So we want to bring \nthese people out of the shadows.\n  Yes, they broke our laws. That is why they have to pay such a big \npenalty. I doubt if there is a Member of this body who at one time or \nanother has not broken a law, but we paid a penalty for it, hopefully, \nand we moved on with our lives. These people have broken our laws, and \nthey have to pay a heavy penalty.\n  There has been pushback, frankly, from our friends in the Hispanic \ncommunity that this is too tough, this is too hard, this is too \ndemanding. I understand that. I pushed back against them. But to \nsomehow base this opposition on the fact that we cannot get our borders \nsecure--it frankly is in defiance in a belief in what the United States \nof America can do. There have been significant failures on the border. \nThere was a $787 million failure called SBI Net--I believe that was the \nname of it. That was supposed to secure our border. But I am confident \nthat we have the technology and we have the ability and we can get this \nlegislation through with confidence.\n  I see the Senator from Louisiana is waiting. I am not going to take \ntoo much longer.\n  The other key to this is workers. Frankly, I was not happy--nor were \nmy friends--that we did not raise the cap higher than we did for guest \nworkers to come into this country. But I would remind my colleagues \nthat anybody who graduates from a U.S. college with a science, \ntechnology, engineering, or math degree and has an offer of employment \nwill be eligible to have a green card to stay in this country.\n  Today, in postgraduate schools in STEM--science, technology, \nengineering and math--the majority of the students are from foreign \ncountries. If they want to stay here and work in this country and they \nhave that degree, which we all know there is a shortage of, we will let \nthem.\n  High-tech companies will be able to bring in and keep more highly \nskilled workers through H-1B. The bill would raise the cap to 110,000 a \nyear.\n  All I am saying is that one of the keys to this is if we secure our \nborders and we dry up the magnet, then we have to have a way of \nattracting the workers we need to keep our economy going. Let's be \nhonest. It is pretty tough picking lettuce down in Yuma. There are not \na lot of American workers who want to do that. That has been the \nhistory of this country. Immigrants have come to this country, they \nhave grabbed the bottom rung, and they have moved up. The bottom rung \nis pretty tough. We are going to have those people as guest workers. If \nthey want to become citizens, then they apply for a green card, et \ncetera.\n  Finally, I just want to say that the Grassley amendment would \n``prevent anyone currently illegally in the country from earning RPI \nstatus until effective control.'' Sounds good. Let me give my \ncolleagues the testimony from Michael Fisher, who is the Chief of the \nU.S. Border Patrol, who testified in February about this very issue.\n\n       First of all, 90 percent really would not make sense \n     everywhere. We put 90 percent as a goal, because there are \n     sections along the border where we have not only achieved, we \n     have been able to sustain 90 percent effectiveness.\n\n\n[[Page S4366]]\n\n\n  By the way, that is the case in the Yuma sector on our Arizona \nborder.\n\n       So it is a realistic goal, but I wouldn't necessarily and \n     just arbitrarily say 90 percent is across the board, because \n     there are other locations where there is a lot less activity \n     and there won't be a lot of activity simply because of \n     terrain features, for instance.\n\n  So where it makes sense, we want to go ahead and start parsing that \nout within these corridors and within these specific sectors. That is \nexactly one of the things my amendment does. It has specific provisions \nof hardware and capabilities that need to be installed in each section.\n  I thank my friend from Louisiana for her patience. I would like to \nagain say to my colleagues that I have seen this movie before. I have \nbeen through it before. We failed in the past. We failed for a variety \nof reasons. This is our opportunity. If we enact this comprehensive \nbill now, we will remove a very huge stain on the conscience of the \nUnited States of America.\n  We need to bring these people out of the shadows, but we must also \nassure all our citizens, especially in the southern part of my State, \nthat they will live in a secure environment. We can do that. We can \nsend a message to employers that they cannot hire someone who is in \nthis country illegally without paying a very heavy price for doing so. \nThat is what this legislation is all about.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee for the \nway he took this bill through his committee and brought it to the floor \nof the Senate. I am in favor of vigorous debate and discussion. We will \nhave plenty of time for amendments and votes on those amendments. This \nis not a perfect bill that I am proud of. There are many ways we can \nimprove it. But fundamentally we have the basics of a package that I \nbelieve is vitally needed for the good of this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. While the distinguished senior Senator from Arizona is \nstill on the floor, I would like to note that during the process of \nputting this bill together in the committee and having the votes, we \nhad a number of quiet meetings, bipartisan meetings in the President \npro tem office. It was extraordinarily helpful to have the senior \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, there because I feel very \nknowledgeable about the northern border, living an hour's drive from \nit, and we needed the Senator's expertise on the southern border. But \nmore importantly, he and I, Senator Kennedy, and President George W. \nBush worked for hours and hours, days and days, weeks and weeks, months \nand months trying to get a comprehensive immigration reform bill \nthrough once before. We now have the possibility of one.\n  He said something every one of us can echo: It is not exactly the \nbill any one of us individually might have written. But by the time we \nget done, we can have legislation that will make America better and be \ntrue to our principles and be realistic.\n  I could use a lot of other adjectives, but I want to personally thank \nthe distinguished senior Senator from Arizona.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Louisiana is about to speak. \nBefore she does, I would add that she is going to talk about an \namendment I strongly support. I mention that support because we have a \nnumber of amendments that both Republicans and Democrats will support. \nI would hope that after the other party has their noon caucus, we can \nget to the point where we start voting on some of these.\n  There are a lot of amendments that Republicans and Democrats would \nvote for together. There are some that will be opposed on one side or \nthe other. But either way, vote on them. Vote them up or vote them \ndown.\n  Now, as manager of the bill, I can start calling up amendments and \nmove to table. I do not want to do that. We have a lot of good \namendments, a lot of good ideas from both Republicans and Democrats, \nbut they cannot be in the bill until we vote on them. The distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana has one. I hope the other side will let her \namendment come up soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin.) The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the chairman and the manager of this bill for \nhis support of this particular amendment, which I hope is going to be \nnoncontroversial. It has to do with clarifying some technical parts of \nthe law dealing with adoptees and how they are able to claim \ncitizenship.\n  It does not have anything really to do with the larger pieces of this \nbill, but it is an opportunity to provide help and support to thousands \nof children, young people, and even adults who come to this country \nthrough the wonderful process of adoption, to clear up a couple of \nmatters.\n  I will talk about that in just a minute, but I want to associate \nmyself with the extraordinarily powerful comments of the Senator from \nArizona John McCain. Without his leadership and without his strong \nknowledge of the issue we are dealing with, I do not think the bill \nwould be on the floor of the Senate, and I do not think we would have a \nchance to be voting on this important piece of legislation.\n  He particularly--along with Senator Rubio and Senator Graham but \nparticularly Senator McCain--has spent his adult life on the border in \nArizona and has been in public office and has served this country so \nadmirably in so many ways and fashions and understands this issue just \nabout as well if not better than anyone on the floor.\n  I have had the pleasure of working with him over many years to secure \nthe border, as the chair of the Homeland Security Appropriations \nSubcommittee. I can attest that what he says is actually true and \nfactual. The border is not as secure as it could be, but it is \nsignificantly stronger and more secure than it was just 5 years ago, \nlet alone 10 years ago.\n  He is also correct that we can make improvements on border security. \nHopefully we will as this bill moves through, but the underlying bill \nitself takes huge steps in that direction by applying new resources to \nthe technologies that are going to help us secure the border.\n  Anyone who has been to the border--and I have traveled there to see \nwith my own eyes, at the invitation of Senator McCain, which was a \ngreet eye-opener to me. As a Senator from Louisiana, the only borders I \nam aware of are water borders. We do not have land borders like Arizona \nand California and Texas and other States, so it was the first time I \nhad seen such a thing. I was absolutely amazed and somewhat taken aback \nby how quickly a person could scale the fence, how quickly tunnels can \nbe built under the fence.\n  I do not think some of my friends who are on the Republican side who \nare really concerned--and we all are, but they talk a lot about it. I \nam not sure they do as much as they talk about it, but that is my view. \nBut they talk a lot about spending taxpayer money wisely. Putting more \nagents on the border and building a higher fence is not going to do it. \nSenator McCain is absolutely correct. What is going to do it is smart \ntechnology leveraged with the resources he has written in his bill.\n  So if we want to secure the border more, which is my intention--and \nas chair of this committee, I intend to continue leading in that way, \nboth our southern border and our northern border, as well as providing \nthe Coast Guard with the resources they need to interdict drug \nsmugglers who are coming into this country.\n  I learned the other day--I would like to share this with people who \npotentially could be listening--that the Coast Guard has intercepted \nmore illegal drugs than the entire land operation last year. They \nintercept drugs at a wholesale level before they even get to the \ncountry. This is about creating a perimeter that secures us against \nthings we don't want to come into this country--illegal workers, \nillegal drugs, or illegal human trafficking, which is also a concern to \nmany people in Louisiana and around the country.\n  It is also important to have a border that allows for trade and \ncommerce. We cannot lock ourselves away from the world. What Senator \nMcCain is saying is so true.\n  We have to be the smartest Nation on the Earth to protect our borders \nbecause we are the most open society and a model of what an open \nsociety should look like. We have to have that balance of security and \ntrade. This is important for every American.\n  I say to my colleague how proud I am of the Senator, and I would hope \nmy\n\n[[Page S4367]]\n\ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle would follow his good and \nsteady advice.\n  Yes, this bill could be improved on the floor of the Senate, but it \nshould not be undermined with rhetoric that makes no sense. I am \nhearing that from some colleagues on the other side. I would hope they \nwould have the good judgment to follow the very wise and mature \nleadership of the Senator from Arizona.\n  I want to call my colleagues' attention to an amendment Senator Coats \nand I have filed, and I am very grateful for his leadership. I know of \nno opposition to this amendment. I am hoping that after lunch the \ncaucuses can meet and we can maybe take up a few noncontroversial \namendments that seek to clarify some provisions in the law that could \nbe helpful to a few hundred and potentially even a few thousand \nAmericans who desperately need our help. It is one amendment, the \nCitizenship for Lawful Adoptees amendment, supported by Senator \nKlobuchar, Senator Coats, and me. We hope there will be many more \ncosponsors.\n  It does three simple but important things. First, a couple of years \nago I helped lead the fight--with many of my colleagues still serving \nhere--to pass the intercountry adoption act or the Child Citizenship \nAct of 2000. That was a very significant breakthrough in the adoption \ncommunity.\n  As my colleagues know, I am the chair of the adoption caucus. We have \nDemocrats and Republicans who support the idea that every child in the \nworld needs a family. We try to minimize and reduce barriers to \nchildren getting the family they need--either staying with the one to \nwhom they were born, trying to help that family or, if they are \nabandoned, neglected, or grossly abused, by finding them another \nfamily.\n  Governments do a lot of things well, but raising children isn't one \nof them. Parents raise children, and a responsible, loving adult is \nnecessary for a child's physical, emotional, and spiritual development. \nBoth our faith and the new science tell us that. It is really \nnondebatable.\n  A group of us worked on this, and we are proud of the progress we are \nmaking. One part of this amendment would make it clear that if a person \nhad been adopted and is now an adult but because of some circumstances \nnever went through the process of citizenship before this law--because \nwhen we passed the law 10 years ago, any child now adopted overseas is \nautomatically a citizen. It is as if the child was born to an American. \nThat is what happens if you are overseas and you give birth to a \nchild--the child is automatically American. You don't need to go \nthrough the immigration process to bring your child to the United \nStates. We made it the same for adopted children because that truly is \nwhat adoption is like. It is like having your own biological child.\n  So we made a great step forward, and we said that at the time for \nanybody under 18. Well, what has happened is, before 2000, for people \nolder than 18--and they might be adults now; they are clearly in their \nthirties, forties, or fifties. They were adopted as infants or young \nchildren, but their paperwork never went through. Some of these \nindividuals are being deported.\n  It would be like deporting a child who came from Korea at 6 months. \nThey have never spoken a word of Korean and have never been to Korea. \nIf they were adopted from Korea, they shouldn't be deported to Korea. \nIf they have committed some misdemeanor or even a felony, they should \nbe penalized under the laws of the United States. They could be put in \njail for life. For criminal activity, they should be treated like any \nother American. Deportation is not and should not be an option for this \nvery small group. This amendment makes that clear.\n  It also clarifies a residency requirement. The Child Citizenship Act \nwas passed with overwhelming support from Republicans and Democrats. \nDon Nickles, as I recall, the Senator from Oklahoma, was the lead \nsponsor on this bill. He was a very strong supporter of many of the \nthings of which I was speaking. He is no longer here, but his work \nlives on.\n  The Child Citizenship Act also requires that Americans living abroad \nfor military, diplomatic, and other reasons do not receive automatic \ncitizenship upon entering the United States. When we wrote this bill, \nwe intended for that to be the case, but because we put the word \n``reside'' instead of ``permanently physically present,'' we have to \nclarify that. With that minor change, it will basically say that if you \nare a diplomat living overseas and you adopt a child through a lawful, \nlegal adoption process, this act applies to you.\n  The third thing it will do is what we call the one-parent fix. There \nare many countries--and we hope Russia one day will again open. We hope \nGuatemala will one day get its 112 cases that we are still waiting for \nmoved through very quickly.\n  Some of the countries are requiring--and rightly so--that parents \ncome to the country to adopt the child physically and then bring the \nchild to the United States. In the past things could be done through \nagents or through adoption agencies, et cetera. I am perfectly fine \nwith that. Many adoption advocates are. Parents should travel to the \ncountry.\n  My sister did an intercountry adoption with Russia, so I am fairly \nfamiliar with our family's experience, which was quite a joy--an added \nexpense but a joy to travel to the orphanage. And some Members of \nCongress have adopted children and gone through that process.\n  The problem is that our agencies are saying--which is not according \nto the law, I believe--that if both parents don't travel, that adoption \nis not automatic. That was never the intention of our law. We are \nsimply saying that if one parent travels and it is a legal adoption, \nthat law still applies. It doesn't have to be both.\n  There are three minor changes to this bill which have helped so many \nchildren come to the United States, and they have been such a joy to \ntheir parents. It is a help to the world in providing homes and loving \nsupport for kids who need it. It takes another barrier, another \nheadache, and another heartache away from them for us to encourage \nadoption of all orphaned children and unparented children in the world \nwho need families.\n  I see the leader of the bill on the other side, the Senator from \nUtah. I would hope he could also be a cosponsor, if he would, and take \na look at this amendment and give his support. I know there are many \npeople in Utah, Minnesota, Louisiana, and Indiana whom this could \npotentially help. It is not going to touch millions, but it will touch \nthousands of people who I think could benefit.\n  I will have several other amendments that I think can tighten the \nunderlying bill, particularly for E-Verify, which Senator McCain spoke \nabout. I wanted to get this hopefully small, uncontroversial amendment \nout of the way to help this small group and then turn my attention to \nsome other things that are very important in the other underlying parts \nof the bill.\n  I ask that whenever this amendment may be considered, the Senator \nfrom Utah would ask me personally, through the Chair, if he would \nconsider putting this amendment on the short list to be reconciled \npotentially today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, this week we continue a very important \ndiscussion about how to fix our broken immigration system.\n  One of the most important concerns we have is that the border is \nsimply not secure. Despite the fact that this assertion is almost \nuniversally held on both the left and on the right, the bill we are \ndebating has very little, if anything, to make the border more secure \nor at least to guarantee that it will become more secure as a result of \nits passage. Instead, the bill offers more of what the American people \nare used to from Washington--plans, promises, commissions, studies, and \nspending lots and lots of money but requires almost no action on border \nsecurity.\n  Many on my side of the aisle have placed heavy emphasis on \nstrengthening the border security provisions to ensure that certain \ngoals are met before granting permanent legal status to illegal \nimmigrants. The reason for this is not merely academic; it is based in \ncommon sense. Failing to secure the border is the quickest way to \nrepeat the mistakes we have made in the past. It means we will be back \nhere in another 20 years dealing with a much\n\n[[Page S4368]]\n\nlarger and far less manageable problem. That is what we are trying to \nprevent today and why we need to make sure this bill secures the \nborder.\n  The problem with this bill isn't just the weak border security \nmeasures. Even if we can come to some satisfactory conclusion on the \nsecurity issues, this bill still would fail to reform many of the \nchallenges we face and it makes most of them worse. If all we do is fix \nthe border security portion, this bill is still considerably weak in \nfour major areas and would still be unworthy of support without major \nchanges.\n  First, there is no congressional oversight of how the executive \nbranch implements these reforms. By passing this bill, Congress would \nturn over almost all authority to the executive branch to secure or not \nsecure the border, verify or not verify workplace enforcement, and \ncertify or not certify visa reforms.\n  Of course, the administration will begin the legalization of 11 \nmillion illegal immigrants with no input from Congress as soon as \npossible regardless of how much progress has been made on border \nsecurity, fencing provisions, and on the other priorities outlined in \nthe bill.\n  Congress is the branch of government that is most accountable to the \nAmerican people. If the people don't believe the border is secure or \nthat our visa system actually works or that the country's economic \nneeds are being met, it is Congress that should be held accountable. It \nis also Congress that can most readily be held accountable through \nregular elections that occur every 2 years in both Houses, with each \nSenator being held accountable every 6 years. Therefore, Congress must \nplay a predominant role in approving, overseeing, and verifying these \nreforms, as well as ensuring that these reforms are being implemented \ncorrectly and achieving desired results. This bill, however, leaves \nCongress and the American people dangerously out of the loop.\n  Second, the bill surrenders control of immigration law to the \nSecretary of Homeland Security, as well as to a handful of other \nunelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in Washington. This is a problem \nthat permeates the Federal Government in general. For example, last \nyear Congress passed and the President signed into law 1,519 pages of \nlegislation. Meanwhile, the Federal Government published 82,349 pages \nof new and updated rules and regulations in the Federal Register. That \nis more than 82,000 pages of rules that never came before Congress, \nnever had a chance to be amended, and never received a vote in this \nbody.\n  This bill will make that problem worse by granting similarly broad \ndiscretion to the Secretary of Homeland Security to create the rules \nand regulations that will determine how the bill is to be implemented \nas well as authorize the Secretary in hundreds and hundreds of \ninstances to simply ignore immigration law as it is enacted by \nCongress. While I can certainly see why Members of Congress might not \nwant to take responsibility for the consequences of this bill, that is \nnot how our Republic is supposed to function.\n  Third, this bill is inherently unfair to the countless thousands of \npeople who have tried to navigate our current broken immigration \nsystem. Let me cite just one example. I received a letter just a few \nmonths ago from a constituent in Utah, from a person who immigrated to \nthis country lawfully, a person who was teaching school at American \nFork, UT, and here on a nonimmigrant visa. As she explained, she spent \nyears of her life and thousands of dollars making sure that she came to \nthe country legally. But she understands that her visa will expire in a \nfew years, in 2017. She anticipates that she will be unable to get a \nrenewal on that same visa and that she will effectively be deported at \nthat point--voluntarily, but her visa term will expire and she \nanticipates she will have to go back to her home country. She explained \nto me it is very difficult for her to accept the fact that she has been \nhere a few years teaching lawfully, developing friendships, developing \nher career, and because she did it legally she will have to go home. \nMeanwhile, those who have broken the law by their illegal presence in \nthe United States will not only be allowed to stay where they are, not \nonly be allowed to live where they now live, not only be allowed to \nwork where they now work, but they will be put on a path toward \neventual citizenship at the same time she and many others like her will \nhave to go back to their home country.\n\n  This policy seems to be rewarding those who have broken our laws \nwhile, in relative terms, punishing those who have attempted to abide \nby our laws in good faith. So this bill must be fair to those who have \ntried to come to the country the right way.\n  As my colleague from Iowa Senator Grassley explained in painstaking \ndetail yesterday, the claims of those who say there will be stiff \npenalties for those who have broken the law have proven to be almost \nentirely false. There is no requirement to learn English or to pay all \nback taxes. And it is quite possible many noncitizens will be eligible \nfor our country's generous benefits, or at least a number of them.\n  That brings me to the final concern that must be addressed before \nanyone should support this bill: the cost. One study conducted by the \nHeritage Foundation says the Gang of 8 bill could cost the taxpayers \nmore than $6 trillion. Some on the right and on the left have \ncriticized that study, and I welcome the debate surrounding that \ncriticism. But the proponents of this bill have so far refused to do \ntheir own corresponding cost analysis. If they believe the Heritage \nFoundation is wrong, that is fine, but they should tell us how much \nthey think it is going to cost the taxpayers. So far we have heard \nnothing. So far we don't have a corresponding study replacing the \nHeritage Foundation study that responds to the same points.\n  There are reports some Democrats have asked the Congressional Budget \nOffice to evaluate the bill, but the report won't be published until \nnext week. That is unfortunate. If they are concerned about the cost, \nand if they want it to be part of the debate, this should have been \ndone a long time ago. These are major portions of the bill that need to \nbe addressed, major aspects of the bill I think we need the full \nopportunity to debate, discuss, and consider. Even if we are able to \ncome to a deal that makes the security portions incrementally better, \nas long as it still lacks congressional oversight, grants excessive \nauthority to the executive branch, unfairly penalizes those who are \ntrying to follow the law, and costs taxpayers trillions of dollars, we \nshould reject this reform unless major changes have been made.\n  Some have suggested by pointing out the flaws of the bill we are \nletting the perfect be the enemy of the good. That vastly understates \nthe problems in this bill. Far from good, this bill repeats the \nmistakes of the past. It makes our immigration system worse than the \none we have today and will only lead to bigger and less manageable \nproblems in the future. I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  There is one more point I wish to make as we continue this debate. I \nrealize this issue is very personal to some. Moments ago, I recounted a \nstory from a constituent who takes this issue to heart. It has affected \nher family, her employment, and almost every aspect of her life. I \nunderstand when Congress is taking on tough challenges sometimes \nemotions get heated. That is understandable. But let us not forget we \nare all on the side of immigration reform. I don't know a single Member \nof this body or the other body of Congress, anyone on the left or on \nthe right, who is not on the side of immigration reform. Perhaps such a \nperson exists, but if that is the case, I have not met him or her.\n  As I said last week, and as I have said on countless occasions--in \ninterviews, op-ed pieces, newsletters, and online--I stand here today \nin support of real and comprehensive immigration reform. And I stand \nhere today as someone who supports legal immigration into our country. \nI understand, as all of my colleagues do, that immigration is necessary \nto our country's prosperity and to its ultimate success.\n  There are those who unfairly suggest that I and my fellow Senators \nwho oppose this bill are somehow ``anti-immigrant'' or ``anti-\nimmigration.'' Unfortunately, those are the voices that are diminishing \nthe prospects of getting real immigration reform done this year. I am \nwell aware if this bill does not pass the Senate we will have an \nimmigration problem that very next day. That is why I have been \nencouraging\n\n[[Page S4369]]\n\nMembers of Congress to support a step-by-step approach to immigration \nreform. Let's not hold hostage the things we can't get done today \nbecause we are unable to iron out every contentious issue.\n  There are more than 40 individual pieces of immigration-related \nlegislation that have been introduced in this Congress alone, half of \nwhich I have sponsored, cosponsored, or that I could support. Indeed, \nthe only reason immigration reform is controversial, in my opinion, is \nbecause the Senate refuses to take it step by step.\n  First, let's secure the border. Let's set up a workable entry-exit \nsystem and create a reliable employment verification system that \nprotects immigrants, citizens, and businesses. Then let's fix our legal \nimmigration system to make sure we are letting in the immigrants our \neconomy needs in numbers that make sense for our country.\n  We don't need another 1,000-page bill full of unintended \nconsequences. We need, and the American people deserve, real reform.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, a few months ago I met two sisters from \nmy home State. They are Mari and Adriana Barrera. These two sisters \nwere brought here by their parents when Mari was 7 and Adriana was 3 \nyears old. They were raised by a single mother who spoke no English \nafter their father left the family behind.\n  Growing up, their mother, who worked at a local hotel, did whatever \nshe could to support her family, but Mari and Adriana often had to \ndepend on themselves. Unlike other children her age, Mari told me she \ngrew up the moment her father left. She told me about how she scheduled \nall of her family's doctors' appointments and how she translated legal \ndocuments, and how, at the age of 13, she started working as a hostess \nat a local restaurant, and not for money, as most teenagers want for \ntheir own indulgences, but to support her family.\n  Mari also told me when she was about to enter high school Adriana had \nto have life-threatening surgery, and a dream was born within herself. \nAs her sister's life hung in the balance, Mari realized she wanted to \nbecome a pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon. She wanted to help others \nthe way she watched doctors help her sister that day, and she decided \nshe would commit herself to getting the education and work toward that \ndream.\n  When I talked to Mari that day a few months ago it was just after she \nhad been forced to drop out of the University of Washington because she \ncould no longer afford it. Living in Seattle, she told me about how she \nhad been unable to find a job to support her studies. Why? Because she \nlacks a Social Security number. Mari's dream, it turns out--the same as \nfor many like her--has been put on hold. It has been put on hold \nbecause our immigration system remains broken. All those dreams have \nbeen put on hold because for far too long Congress has failed to act. \nThey have been put on hold because, despite the fact that young women \nsuch as the Barrera sisters want to contribute to our Nation, our \ncurrent system won't let them.\n  It is not only stories such as those of the Barrera sisters that \npoint to a system badly in need of reform, I see it everywhere in my \nState. I see it in rural parts of my State, in cities such as Yakima \nand Moses Lake, where farmers can't get the seasonal agricultural \nworkers they need to support one of our State's largest industries. I \nsee it in big cities such as Seattle and Vancouver and Spokane, where \nhigh-tech businesses struggle to hire the world's best and brightest. I \nsee it in neighborhoods throughout my State where families have been \nripped apart by a system that forces them to choose between legal \nimmigration and long-term separation from the people they love. I see \nit along our northern border in Washington State where the need to \nsecure a long, porous border must be balanced with smart enforcement \npolicies that don't use intimidation and fear as a weapon. And I see it \nin my State's LGBT community--a community that badly lacks fairness and \nequality under today's broken system.\n  But these aren't problems that cannot be fixed. Although previous \nreform efforts have fallen short, this Senate is not incapable of this \ntask, especially now. And that is because today--due to the changing \ndemographics of our Nation, because of the growing political voice of a \nnew generation of Americans, and because of the energy, determination, \nand hard work of immigration advocates in my home State and across the \nNation--we are at a historic moment of opportunity. For the first time \nin the history of this debate there is broad bipartisan agreement this \nsystem must be fixed and that a bipartisan solution is within reach.\n  No one in this country needs to be reminded it is a rarity here when \nSenators from different parties and from very different States come \ntogether to agree on common solutions to a big issue. So it is truly \nremarkable that over the course of the past year the bipartisan so-\ncalled Gang of 8 has worked to craft this bill that is now before the \nSenate. The bill we are considering is focused on four bipartisan \npillars that have drawn consensus support from Members of Congress and \nthe American people.\n  First of all, this bill includes a path to citizenship, so that with \na lot of hard work many of the immigrants living in this country who \nare dreaming of citizenship can achieve that goal over time.\n  Second, the bill provides employers certainty in a system that has \noften left them without any answers.\n  Third, this bill will help continue the progress we have made in \nsecuring our borders by focusing on the most serious security threats \nand by utilizing new technology.\n  Finally, this bill helps to reform our legal immigration system so it \nmeets the needs of our families and our Nation going forward.\n  These are all important steps. But this bill is only the beginning of \na full, fair, and open public debate over reforming immigration in this \ncountry. And while it will be tempting to get caught up in the \nspecifics of one amendment or policy in this debate, we can't forget \nabout the larger questions this bill addresses, because at its heart \nthis is a bill that touches nearly every aspect of American life, from \nour economy to our security, from our classrooms to our workplaces. It \nis about what type of country we want to be, what we stand for, and \nwhat type of future we all want to build.\n  These are the questions I have actually posed in meetings with \nadvocates and businesses and leaders in meetings all over my State, \nboth in recent weeks and going back many years. Those conversations \nhave stirred a lot of passion, brought new facts to light, and helped \nme bring the voices of countless advocates to this debate today. They \nhave also helped me to arrive at the core issues I believe are \nessential to repairing our broken immigration system--the issues I will \nfight for as we debate in the weeks to come.\n  Sitting and talking about the aspiring Americans this bill will \naffect has made clear that protecting families must be a central \npriority in comprehensive immigration reform. Immigration reform isn't \njust about a person's status, it is about sons and daughters and \nmothers and fathers and families who want to live full, productive \nlives together in this country. We know when workers have their \nfamilies nearby they are more likely to be satisfied with their job, \nthey are healthier, they work harder, and they contribute to our \neconomy.\n  We know families are the building block of strong communities. Yet \nunder today's broken system, family-based immigration has been pitted \nagainst employment-based immigration, and far too often immigrant \nfamilies are being forced to choose between the country they love and \nthe ones they love. I firmly believe it is in our long-term national \ninterest to change this approach. For immigration reform to best meet \nour national ideals we have to keep our focus on keeping our families \ntogether, reducing these backlogs, giving women immigrants access to \ngreen cards, and reuniting immigrants with their families.\n  Immigration reform must also include a pathway to citizenship for the \n11 million undocumented immigrants residing in this country. Many of \nour undocumented immigrants have lived in this country for more than a \ndecade. They are our neighbors, our friends, our colleagues. They go to \nchurch with us, they pay their taxes, and they follow our laws.\n\n[[Page S4370]]\n\n  But our current system creates a permanent underclass of people that \nare caught between the law and earning a living. While citizenship has \nto be earned, it is simply not feasible to deport this entire \npopulation or expect them to return to their nation of citizenship. We \ncertainly can't make this pathway contingent on enforcement measures \nthat are unachieveable or unrealistic. I believe the bill before us \nlays the foundation for a pathway to citizenship that will bring \naspiring Americans out from the shadows.\n  Immigration reform must also meet the needs of our changing economy. \nThis need is perhaps best on display in my home State where the \ndiversity of our economy creates diverse immigration needs. Washington \nis home to some of our Nation's largest high-tech, aerospace, and \ncomposite manufacturing firms. These are businesses that demand a \nrobust employment-based visa system that attracts the best and \nbrightest from across the world. However, just across the Cascade \nmountains lie miles and miles of fertile farmlands and orchards that \ndemand a flexible and pragmatic agricultural worker program. I plan to \nsupport changes that help meet both of those needs while also working \nto invest in job opportunities for American workers through the STEM \ninvestments that are provided in this bill.\n  We also need a smart and humane system of securing our Nation's \nborders, including my State's many land border crossings. But we must \nbalance the necessity of securing our borders and enforcing our laws \nwith the importance of treating everyone with dignity and respect, and \nthat includes ensuring access to due process in our immigration \nhearings, restrictions on the use of unnecessary restraints on pregnant \nwomen, the use of less costly alternatives to detention whenever \npossible, and humane conditions and strict oversight and reporting \nrequirements at our detention centers.\n  Our strategy for enforcement and border security should focus on \nkeeping Americans safe, fighting violent crime, reducing smuggling, and \nstopping terrorists. We should always be doing it in a way that upholds \nour commitment to civil liberties and the rights of every American.\n  Finally, I strongly support efforts to craft a system that will unite \nfamilies by extending immigration sponsorship privileges for married \nbinational LGBT couples. I was very proud of my home State of \nWashington when it voted last year for marriage equality. However, my \nheart breaks because each time a binational LGBT married Washingtonian \nis split apart because their marriage is not recognized by the Federal \nGovernment, it is just not right.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act has long barred equal immigration \nsponsorship privileges for married binational LGBT couples. While I am \nhopeful the Supreme Court will strike down the Defense of Marriage Act, \nI believe we should also move decisively to include these provisions in \nthis bill.\n  These are certainly not the only priorities I will be fighting for in \nthe coming days. In fact, I am hoping to offer some amendments that \nwill help open new doors to education for our DREAMers and that will \nexpand investment in our STEM education. But I also know we will see \namendments that will attempt to weaken and defeat this bill altogether, \nbecause as we saw in the exhaustive and inclusive committee process, \nthere are those who are simply bent on standing in the way of a bill \nthat Americans want and our economy needs--those who will say or do \nanything to defeat this bill.\n  But I am confident this is a new day for immigration reform. I am \nconfident of that because more Americans than ever before see the \nbenefits of a modern immigration system that is coupled with the \ninvestments that help our families succeed. They see we are stronger \nwhen immigrant workers are contributing to our economy, when employers \nhave the resources they need to grow, and when a path to citizenship is \navailable to those who are already here.\n  Too often in this debate it is difficult for some people to \nunderstand that the millions of undocumented families in our country \nare already an important part of our communities. Immigrants work hard. \nThey send their children to schools throughout this country. They pay \ntheir taxes, and they help weave the fabric of our society. In all but \nname they are Americans.\n  When John F. Kennedy was serving in this Chamber, he wrote a book \nabout the fact that America is a nation of immigrants. In it, he wrote:\n\n       Immigration policy should be generous; it should be fair; \n     it should be flexible. With such a policy we can turn to the \n     world, and to our own past, with clean hands and a clear \n     conscience.\n\n  Today, those words continue to ring true. It is not only the world we \nhave to turn to. This effort is about living up to our own ideals. It \nis about, as then-Senator Kennedy said, living up to our own past.\n  Our history has long been that of a beacon of hope for people \nthroughout the world, from those who arrived at Ellis Island to start a \nnew life decades ago to the DREAMers who want to contribute to the \ncountry they love today.\n  As we once again take on this very difficult task of reforming our \nimmigration policy, let's make sure our actions reflect our security, \nour economy, and our future. But let's also never forget the past and \nthe fact that our Nation has long offered generations of immigrants the \nchance to achieve their dreams.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n               Unanimous Consent Request--H. Con. Res. 25\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 33, H. Con. Res. 25; that \nthe amendment which is--and has been--at the desk, the text of S. Con. \nRes. 8, the budget resolution passed by the Senate on March 23, be \ninserted in lieu thereof; that H. Con. Res. 25, as amended, be agreed \nto; the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable; that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference \nwith the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses; and the \nChair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate; \nthat following the authorization, two motions to instruct conferees be \nin order from each side: a motion to instruct relative to the debt \nlimit and a motion to instruct relative to taxes-revenue; that there be \n2 hours of debate equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees prior to the votes in relation to the motions; and, further, \nthat no amendments be in order to either of the motions prior to the \nvotes, all of the above occurring with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would like \nto explain briefly the overall situation.\n  We are not objecting to budget. We are not objecting to conference. \nWe just want the debt limit left out. It is a separate issue that \nwarrants its own debate. It is a simple request: no backroom deals on \nthe debt limit.\n  I would like to focus on one particular argument we have heard from \nthe other side. Critics argue that conference committees are \ntransparent and that they don't involve backroom deals. If this were \never the case, today it is not.\n  The purpose of conference committees is to reconcile differences in \nsimilar bills passed by the House and by the Senate. It is not the only \nway, but it is one way.\n  In theory, conference committees are an open, accountable, and \ntrustworthy means of resolving bicameral differences. But in recent \nyears, the conference process--such as so much else in this town and in \nthis Chamber--has become corrupted.\n  Today, conference committees are just another mechanism to exclude \nthe American people from the legislative process. Secret closed doors, \nthey usually don't even begin until the deal is already completed, as a \npractical matter.\n  Speaker Boehner himself said recently: We don't typically go to \nconference until such time that they are well on their way.\n  A recent example was the conference last year on the highway bill. \nThe Senate passed its bill in March. The House passed its version in \nApril. On May 8, the conference committee met for about 2\\1/2\\ hours on \nC-SPAN, but no amendments, no substantive legislating. Members mostly \ngave just opening statements, but that was just the first meeting, \nafter all--plenty of time to get to the real work.\n\n[[Page S4371]]\n\n  But then at the end of it all, the Chair of the conference thanked \neveryone for coming and then said something peculiar: We will be back \nhere, if necessary. Maybe we can do this out of this room, but we may \nbe able to agree and get signatures on a conference report. But, if \nnecessary, we will be back here in 20-some days.\n  A strange thing that the conference--which hadn't done anything yet--\nwould only meet again, if necessary. How else could they do their work \nif they didn't meet again?\n  But then, without meeting again, the conference filed its 670-page \nreport in the early morning hours of Thursday, June 28. As if by magic, \nwithout any debate or amendments or votes or public meetings, all the \ndifferences simply got ironed out. What is more, the highway bill \nsuddenly included major provisions that had nothing to do with \nhighways. Out of thin air the conference committee had added to the \nhighway bill the flood insurance program and the student loan program. \nWe might call it the miraculous deception.\n  So Thursday morning they presented to Congress their massive bill--\nintentionally waiting until only hours before the entire highway \nprogram was set to expire. It was a classic cliff deal: negotiated in \nsecret, immune from amendment, including unrelated provisions air-\ndropped into the bill, presented as a take-it-or-leave-it proposition \nup against a manufactured deadline crisis.\n  Faced with this situation, the House and Senate passed the report \nwithout reading it and patted each other on the back for their \nbipartisanship.\n  This, unfortunately, is how Washington too often works, and it is why \nthe American people hold Washington in such low esteem. People don't \ntrust the government because they know the government doesn't trust \nthem.\n  If my colleagues truly want a backroom deal on the budget, we will \ngive them their chance to have it. We just ask that they leave the debt \nceiling out of it.\n  But make no mistake, my colleagues and I are not objecting because we \ndon't understand how Washington works, as some have suggested. We are \nobjecting because we know exactly how Washington works in this regard, \nand we mean to change it.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Virginia modify his \nrequest so it not be in order for the Senate to consider a conference \nreport that includes reconciliation instructions to raise the debt \nlimit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as modified?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, given that no Member of this body made an \namendment to request such a provision and offered it for vote either \nduring the Budget Committee deliberation or on the floor of this body \nwhen we were debating the budget, I consider the request basically an \neffort to modify the budget after the vote is done.\n  Therefore, I reject the request, and I would ask an opportunity to \ncomment additionally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator object to the request as \nmodified?\n  Mr. KAINE. I object to the request as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, in that case, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I would like to comment on my colleague's \ncharacterization that Members of this body want a backroom deal. \nBecause in that characterization, my colleague neglected to make clear \nto certainly people in this gallery what happens when there is a \nconference report.\n  Since March 23, we have been trying to take a budget passed by this \nbody, in accord with the Budget Act of 1974, into a conference with the \nHouse budget that was passed the same week. That is the way, in a \nbicameral legislature, we resolve differences between the two Houses: \nto put the two different positions in a conference committee, and we \nask people to sit down and debate and listen and dialog and hopefully \nfind a compromise.\n  There is no guarantee in any conference that a compromise will be \nfound. All we are asking is that Members of this body, instead of \nexercising a prerogative to block debate and compromise, allow a \nconference to go forward so we can talk and listen and see whether we \ncan find compromise for the good of the Nation.\n  The Senator has indicated they are blocking that because they want to \nstop backroom deals. The Senator has neglected to explain what happens \nwhen there is a conference. When there is a conference, if there is a \ndeal, if there is an agreement to find good for the common good of the \nNation between a Republican House majority and a Democratic Senate \nmajority, then the conference report gets submitted back to the bodies, \nwe have debate in this Chamber where every Senator--just as they did \nduring the budget--can stand and explain whether they are for it or \nagainst it, and then every Senator has the ability to vote yes or no to \nthe conference report.\n  If the Senator would like to see a conference and see if it works and \nif he doesn't like it vote against the budget or the budget compromise, \nhe is able to do it. If any Senator allows a conference committee to go \nforward and when it comes back believes it represents some kind of a \nbackroom deal, at that point they can say that on the floor. But to \nrestrict a budget from even going to conference so we can find \ncompromise before you know whether compromise will be found, before you \nknow what the compromise might be, and to call it a back-room deal when \nyou are blocking anybody from even entering the room and trying to find \ncompromise I think is an unfair characterization of the procedures of \nthis body.\n\n  I have stated before on the floor as I have made the motion--this is \nthe 13th motion we have made since March 23 to begin a budget \nconference so we can find compromise--when our Framers established a \nbicameral legislature they knew what they were doing, but they gave us \na challenge and the challenge was this: In a bicameral legislature that \nrequires passage in both Houses, if the governmental organism is to be \nalive, then compromise is the blood of the organism because passage in \none House is not enough. There has to be passage in both Houses for the \nvast majority of items, including a budget.\n  Blocking a process of compromise from beginning is taking the blood \nout of the living organism of this Congress and of this government. \nEfforts to block compromise harm this institution. They are harming the \ninstitution every day in the minds of the American public, be they \nDemocratic, Republican, Independent, wherever they live.\n  I have made the motion. The motion has been objected to. I can assure \nfolks this motion will continue to be made because we passed a budget \nin this body under regular order. We need to get into a compromise--\ninto a conference with the House so we can do what is expected of us: \nlisten, dialog, exercise efforts to find compromise. Without \ncompromise, there is no Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, to respond to my distinguished colleague \nand friend from Virginia, in the first place it is important for us to \nremember, yes, we are a bicameral Congress. Yes, in order to pass \nlegislation you have to have something pass in the House and pass in \nthe Senate and then be signed into law by the President. But the fact \nis there are a number of ways to accomplish this.\n  Yes, it is certainly true that one way we reconcile competing \nversions of legislation passed in the House and Senate respectively is \nthrough conference committee. It is not the only way, it is one way.\n  It is also true that under Article I, Section 5, Clause 2 of the \nConstitution, each body of Congress has the power to write its own \nrules for its own operation. The way the rules of the Senate are \nwritten it is such that in our current posture, in order to get to a \nconference committee it requires unanimous consent. That means all of \nus have to agree it is a good idea to take that particular route. But \nwe don't have to take that route. There are\n\n[[Page S4372]]\n\nother ways that, under the rules of the Senate, would allow us to \naddress differences in the House-passed budget and Senate-passed budget \nwithout going to conference.\n  We could, for example, take up the House-passed budget right now. We \ncould debate that and discuss that. That is a way of addressing this \nthat does not require us to go to conference. But going to conference \nright now under the rules of the Senate as they apply to this set of \nfacts does require unanimous consent.\n  There are a handful of us who are not willing to grant that consent \nif in fact the possibility remains that they will use that as a back-\nroom effort to raise the debt limit, a back-room effort that would not \nrequire utilization of the Senate's traditional rules, including the \n60-vote threshold that often applies.\n  You are asking us to agree with something with which we fundamentally \ndisagree. My friend from Virginia has also made the argument that it is \nsomehow unreasonable of us to make this objection because of the fact \nthat none of these amendments were brought up in connection with the \nbudget. I actually think the argument goes exactly the opposite way. \nBecause the debt limit was not part of the deliberations in this body \non the budget, and because the debt limit was not part of the \ndeliberations or the final text in the other body in connection with \nthe budget, there is no need for the conference committee to address \nthe debt limit. There certainly is no need to circumvent the otherwise \napplicable rules of the Senate that would govern this in this posture \nin this context.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with \nmy colleague, the junior Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. I ask my colleague from Texas--who has on occasion expressed \nsimilar concerns to those I have just expressed with this kind of \nposture--so I ask my friend from Texas, is it in fact his interest, his \nobjective to be obstructionist? Is he trying to obstruct here and in \nfact being unreasonable in raising these objections?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank my friend and note that a number of Senators have \nraised this objection and we have focused on one thing and one thing \nonly, which is whether the Senate can raise the debt ceiling with just \n50 votes or instead whether the Senate can do so with 60 votes. That is \nthe issue.\n  We are perfectly prepared to go to conference on the budget, right \nnow, today. That is a red herring. That is not what this procedural \nfight is about. Every time this motion has been asked by the majority, \nthe minority has risen to protect the rights of the minority because \nordinarily to raise the debt ceiling it would take 60 votes, and if it \ntakes 60 votes, what that means is that the 54 Democrats are not able \nto do so on a straight party-line vote, freezing out Republicans.\n  Right now the Democrats have stated they believe the debt ceiling \nshould be raised with no preconditions, no negotiations, no structural \nchanges to our out-of-control spending that is bankrupting our country.\n  What the minority Senators have said is that, at a minimum, if we are \ngoing to raise the debt ceiling it should be subject to a 60-vote \nthreshold so that we have a conversation about fixing the deep fiscal \nand economic challenges in this country. It is indeed the majority \nthat--I will give credit for candor--does not wish to say no, we will \ntake the debt ceiling off the table. Because it is, I believe, the \nDemocrats' intention if this budget process goes to conference \ncommittee to use reconciliation as a backdoor procedural trick to raise \nthe debt ceiling on 50 votes. I think that would be a travesty. But I \nthink much of this debate is clouded in smoke and mirrors. Much of this \ndebate is clouded in obfuscation. This is a simple question: Should the \ndebt ceiling be able to be raised with only 50 votes or should it \nrequire 60 votes, which will necessitate some compromise, some \ndiscussion?\n  On that question I am quite confident the American people are with my \nfriend from Utah, are with the Members of the minority who believe that \nif the debt of this country is going to go higher and higher and \nhigher, we need leadership in this body to fix the problem rather than \nsimply putting more and more debt on our kids and grandkids.\n  Mr. LEE. If I might ask, Madam President, of my friend from Texas, \nwhy wouldn't one want the usual rules of the Senate to apply? That is, \nwhy would one want to block or prevent the 60-vote threshold from \napplying with a debt ceiling increase, just as the 60-vote threshold \napplies to much of the most important, contentious, closely watched \nlegislation that moves through this body?\n  Mr. CRUZ. The 60-vote threshold, as my friend from Utah knows well, \nwas designed to protect this institution that has been called the \nworld's greatest deliberative body and to ensure that the minority has \na role in the discussions. On this issue I think that is critically \nimportant. There are few if any issues we will address that are more \nimportant than the question of the unsustainable debt that is \nthreatening the future of our kids and grandkids.\n  The natural reason why the majority would want to get around the 60-\nvote threshold is because without a 60-vote threshold the majority does \nnot need to listen to this side of the house. President Obama has been \nvery explicit. The President has said he wants the debt ceiling raised \nwith no negotiations, no discussions, no conditions, ``no nothin' '' to \nfix the problem.\n  In the last 4\\1/2\\ years our national debt has gone from $10 trillion \nto nearly $17 trillion. What we are doing is fundamentally \nirresponsible and the majority wishes to be able to keep doing it \nwithout making any prudent decisions to stop the out-of-control \nspending, stop the out-of-control debt, fix the problem. The only way \nthey can do it is to use a procedural trick to shut down the minority.\n  I do not believe that is consistent with our obligations to the \nconstituents who elected us, and I don't believe it is consistent with \nthe responsibility of all 100 Senators to take seriously the obligation \nof protecting the fiscal and economic strength of this Nation for the \nnext generations.\n  Mr. LEE. The Senator from Texas is a seasoned constitutional scholar, \na graduate of Princeton University and of Harvard Law School. He went \non to clerk for Judge Michael Ludick on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Fourth Circuit, now general counsel to Boeing. He later clerked for \nlate Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Having argued a total of nine cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, \nthe Senator from Texas is a seasoned litigator in addition to being a \nscholar of the Constitution. So I ask my colleague a couple of \nquestions related to that.\n  It has occurred to me sometimes as a lawyer myself that there are \nsometimes some similarities between being a Senator and being a lawyer. \nThey are not perfect, but we are retained for a limited period of time, \nin 6-year increments generally, to represent a group of people. It is \nour job to do what we can to act in the absence of those people. In my \ncase there are 3 million people from my State, the State of Utah. They \ncannot all fit inside this Chamber so I am one of the people who is \nelected to represent them in their absence.\n  I ask my colleague from Texas, No. 1, how do the people of Texas feel \nabout the idea of raising the debt limit yet again? In particular, how \ndo they feel about the idea of raising the debt limit yet again without \nany kind of permanent structural reform put in place as condition \nprecedent to that action? And finally, how do the people of Texas feel \nas their elected representative, representing those people here in this \nbody, you surrender one of your biggest bargaining chips, you abandon \none of the tools that allows you to make sure we do not the raise the \ndebt limit too casually, too cavalierly, without putting in place the \nadequate precautions?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the junior Senator from Utah for his overly \ngenerous comments and kind characterizations. I think the analogy he \ndrew is quite apt, that any lawyer, in representing a client, has an \nobligation to zealously represent that client; that he owes a fiduciary \nduty to that client.\n  I suggest all 100 of us owe that same fiduciary duty to the men and \nwomen in our States who entrusted us with the obligation of coming here \nand fighting for them. Because the 3 million citizens of Utah could not \nall be on\n\n[[Page S4373]]\n\nthe floor of the Senate fighting, the junior Senator from Utah steps in \ntheir shoes to fight on their behalf. I feel confident that the \ncitizens of Utah, like the citizens from Texas, would be horrified at \nthe notion that this body would continue raising the debt ceiling over \nand over again without even trying to fix the underlying problem.\n  This Senate floor has a long and storied history. There have been \ngreat men and women, great leaders of this country who have walked on \nthis floor. Yet each generation, going back for centuries, has managed \nto avoid saddling the next generation with crushing debts. I am \nreminded of the very distinguished late father of the Senator from \nUtah, Rex Lee, who was the Solicitor General of the United States, who \nwas widely considered one of the finest Supreme Court advocates to have \never lived. He was an individual who took the obligation of zealously \nrepresenting his client deeply and near and dear to his heart.\n  Your father's generation, my father's generation, did not leave us \nwith crushing debts, did not leave us with debts from which we could \nnever escape. What has happened in the last 4\\1/2\\ years is \nqualitatively different, qualitatively different from what has happened \nin the last 2\\1/2\\ centuries in this country. No other generation has \nsaid to their kids, their grandkids, and to their grandkids' grandkids, \nwe are going to rack up so much debt that you are never going to be \nable to escape.\n  My wife and I are blessed. We have two little girls at home, 5 and 2. \nThe idea that Caroline and Catherine are going to spend their adult \ndays working to pay the taxes to pay off the debt we are spending \nrecklessly right now I think is profoundly immoral, is profoundly \nirresponsible. I cannot tell you how many thousands of Texans, men and \nwomen across the State, have said the exact same thing: Stop \nbankrupting the country. Stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids. That \nis the fiduciary duty we have to fight for, to defend--to stand for the \n300 million Americans for whom this body, Congress, has been racking up \na massive credit card debt that threatens to imperil the security of \nthis country and the future generations in America.\n  Mr. LEE. Is my colleague suggesting that we stop altogether the \npractice of issuing U.S. treasuries to finance the operations of \ngovernment or is he suggesting that we go without a budget or that we \nsimply halt the issuance of Treasury instruments altogether or is my \ncolleague suggesting something more long term?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Of course we shouldn't halt the issuance of treasuries, and \nof course we shouldn't forswear any and all debt. The Constitution \nprovides that the Federal Government can incur debt, and there has been \na long history of incurring debt, particularly to meet extraordinary \ncircumstances. In wartime we have had a history of incurring debt and \nthen paying that down.\n  What is important to emphasize is that there is a qualitative \ndifference in what has happened in the last 4\\1/2\\ years. We have \nalways had some degree of debt in this country, but one of the \nchallenges is that at times $1 million, $1 billion, and $1 trillion can \nseem like the same number. They all end in ``illions,'' they all sound \nbig, and yet the difference of $10 trillion, where the national debt \nwas 5 years ago, and just shy of $17 trillion, where we are now, is \nfundamental; it is structural. Our national debt exceeds the size of \nour entire economy.\n  The nations of Europe are collapsing because their elected officials \nwere not able to be responsible. They spent money they did not have, \nand they built up so much debt they could not repay. Eventually, there \ncomes a point where every decision to address the debt is an ugly one. \nThere comes a point where the debt hole is so deep--as some of the \nnations in Europe are discovering--that the answers are either drastic \ncuts to spending or massive tax increases or massively inflating the \ncurrency. Every one of those outcomes is ugly, which is one of the \nreasons we have seen rioting in the streets of Europe.\n  Thankfully the United States is not yet in as deep a hole as some of \nthe nations of Europe, and that is why we need leadership now to stop \nthe out-of-control spending by addressing the deep structural problems. \nIf we keep spending money we don't have--if any of us ran our families, \nour households, our businesses the way the Federal Government is run, \nwe would be bankrupt. We would be sleeping under a bridge.\n  What it takes, I believe, is responsible leadership, and I hope \nbipartisan responsible leadership. We need Republicans and Democrats to \ncome together to say: Let's live within our means. That is not a \nterribly conservative principle. That is a principle that has been \ncommon sense in this country for centuries, and it is one, sadly, we \nhave gotten away from in the last 4\\1/2\\ years.\n  Mr. LEE. We are talking about a procedural strategy. We are not even \ntalking about an outcome here. We are talking about the full \nutilization of the procedural rights of each and every Member of this \nbody. We have been asked to give our consent and to effectively vote \nfor a procedure that people on both sides of the Capitol have now \nadmitted could and may well be utilized as a mechanism for raising the \ndebt limit in a way that circumvents the 60-vote threshold of the \nSenate. It seems to me that is troubling, and if we analogize that yet \nagain to other circumstances where we have to represent someone else, \nthat can be troubling.\n  Let's suppose the Senator from Texas is representing a client in \ncourt--let's say in the U.S. Supreme Court. For example, when the \nSenator is in the position of the petitioner, he has the right, as the \npetitioner--meaning the person filing the petition for a writ of \ncertiorari--to seek review by the Supreme Court of the United States, \nand let's say review is granted.\n  After review is granted, a briefing schedule kicks in and the \npetitioner has the opportunity to file the first brief. That is the \nSenator's prerogative as the petitioner. The other side then has about \na month to file its brief, and then the Senator gets something the \nother side doesn't get to file--the Senator gets a reply brief.\n  Procedurally, under the rules of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates, that is the Senator's client's right. Once the Senator has a \ncase in front of the Supreme Court and in the middle of the briefing \nschedule, what would the Senator from Texas say to a client if you came \nto them and said: My opposing counsel has asked me to waive my right to \nfile a reply brief even though it is my right to do that? The client \nhas asked me to do it. What would the client think if the Senator \nactually said: I am not going to file a reply brief even though \nprocedurally I have every right to do that?\n  Mr. CRUZ. My friend from Utah asks a terrific question. It is a \nquestion of procedural rules--whether in a courtroom or in the Senate--\ndesigned to protect substantive rights. Ultimately, the 60-vote \nthreshold is designed to protect the substantive rights not of the \nSenators--we are not here in our own stead. We are instead representing \nthe constituents who sent us here.\n  What the majority is asking us to do by asking for unanimous consent \nto allow this to go to conference and to set it up for them to raise \nthe debt ceiling with 50 votes--the majority is asking for the 46 \nRepublicans on this side of the aisle to give away our right to speak. \nThey are asking us to say we will cede to the majority the ability to \ndo whatever it wishes on the debt ceiling. In giving away our right to \nspeak, what we are giving away is not anything that belongs to us, it \nis the right of 26 million Texans to have their voice heard.\n  For us to agree with the majority and say, yes, we will hand over the \nability to make this decision on the debt ceiling without ever again \nconsulting this side of the aisle would be very much like the situation \nthe Senator from Utah asked about. I don't know how the Senator from \nUtah would answer a constituent in Utah who said: Senator Lee, why did \nyou give away my voice? Why did you simply hand to the Democrats the \nability to decide how much debt the United States should have, to raise \nit? And why did you essentially give away my seat at the table?\n  It is not the seat of the Senator from Utah; it is not my seat. It is \nthe seat of the millions of constituents in Utah, Texas, and each of \nour home States that sent us here. The idea that we would willingly \ngive up their right to speak is inconsistent with the obligation we owe \nthe men and women of Utah and the men and women of Texas.\n\n[[Page S4374]]\n\n  Mr. LEE. I would suspect that in most circumstances a lawyer giving \nup that procedural right would be committing malpractice. Perhaps a \nlawyer in that circumstance could say to the client: I am going to do \nthis because opposing counsel has asked it of me, and I want to get \nalong with her. I want to make sure I maximize our chances of settling \nthis litigation perhaps before the litigation has been completely \nresolved. If that were the argument opposing counsel was making to me, \nI suspect I would tell the client: If that is the case and our \nobjective is to try to settle the litigation rather than wait until \nthe Court resolves it, then by doing that and giving up that procedural \nright to file the reply brief, I would be forfeiting a lot of \nbargaining power that I would otherwise have.\n\n  And so too here we would be forfeiting a tremendous amount of \nbargaining power relative to the budget discussions, relative to the \ndebt limit discussion, a discussion that needs to take place in full \nsunlight and not under cover of darkness. It needs to take place in the \ntwo Chambers and not in some back-room deal. That is what we are \ntalking about. That is why these procedural rights are so important.\n  People can disagree with the rules of the Senate, and a lot of people \ndo. People can want to change the rules of the Senate, and there are \nsome who do--some even in this body. But the fact is the rules are what \nthey are. We have the power to make those rules under article 1, \nsection 5 of the Constitution, and we have the power to change those \nrules under article 1, section 5 of the Constitution. But those rules \nbeing what they are, those rules being in place as they are today, and \nthose rules having the application they do as of this very moment, \npeople cannot ask someone such as me or my friend from Texas to give \nour consent to something we think is fundamentally wrong and that we \nthink will substantially diminish the bargaining power we have in \nundertaking that policy approach we think is most necessary today.\n  One of the questions I have been asked by some of our friends on the \nother side of the aisle, and a few of our friends who are even on the \nsame side of the aisle as myself and the Senator from Texas, is: You \nare a Republican, I am a Republican, so why can't you guys trust that \nthe Republicans who control the House of Representatives will \nadequately secure your interests? Why don't you therefore feel \ncomfortable effectively forfeiting your right to a 60-vote threshold on \nthe debt ceiling debate?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I think that is a reasonable question to ask. There are a \nnumber of points that are relevant. No. 1, there is a considerable \nhistory of the debt ceiling being raised through reconciliation, and, \nindeed, it has been done in 1986, 1990, 1993, and in 1997. So the \ndanger that we are acting to prevent is not a hypothetical danger, it \nis a danger that has proven accurate.\n  Those who say we will simply trust the House--the House Members were \nelected to represent their constituents, and each of the 435 Members of \nthe House has an obligation to exercise their best judgment to \nrepresent their constituents. Whatever they choose to do--and I would \nnote a number of Members of House leadership have publicly on the \nrecord suggested they might well be amenable to raising the debt \nceiling through reconciliation. So given their public statements, the \nscenario we are raising is a possibility that the House leadership has \nsuggested may well be on the table.\n  But more fundamentally, regardless of what the House chooses to do, \nthe Senator from Utah has an obligation to the 3 million citizens of \nUtah to represent their views. I don't think it would be responsible \nfor him to give up his very eloquent voice or for me to give up my \nvoice or for any of us to give up the voice of the citizens we are \nrepresenting.\n  I am reminded of meeting an individual at a gathering of Republican \nwomen back in Texas about a month ago, and this individual was a \nveteran who had fought in World War II. He was there, introduced to \neveryone, and received a standing ovation. A story was told about how \nhe had been grievously injured in World War II. As a result of that \ninjury, he was in a hospital and two doctors were debating about where \nto amputate his leg. They were debating whether to amputate the leg \nabove the knee or below the knee.\n  This soldier was unconscious, and he awakened in the middle of this \nconversation between the two doctors about where to amputate his leg. \nThis soldier began to participate in that debate. And, unsurprisingly, \nhe had a very strong view that he would very much prefer they not \namputate the leg. He expressed that view vociferously to the doctors \nwho were having that debate. As he expressed his view, he ended up \nprevailing in that argument and they chose not to amputate his leg \nbelow or above the knee.\n  To this day he walks with a limp. He doesn't walk as well as he might \nif he had not been injured, but he was able to save that leg because he \nhad a voice in that debate, because he spoke up and his interest \nconcerning his leg was acutely different from the two doctors who were \ndebating it without his voice. I think he had every right to \nparticipate in that debate because it affected him, it affected his \nfuture, and it affected his life. And just so, I think the 3 million \ncitizens of Utah have every right to participate in this debate and not \nsimply to be told to trust the other body of Congress. They have an \nindependent obligation. My friend the Senator from Utah has an \nobligation to his constituents to make sure their voice is part of this \ndebate.\n  Mr. LEE. Indeed, we each have an obligation to utilize our own voice \nand to make our own judgments with regard to the best course of action \nto take in any debate and in any discussion.\n  The problems in this country are significant. There is not one of us \nin this body who wishes to minimize them. There is not one of us in \nthis body who is not concerned about these problems. Each of us might \ntake, advocate, or firmly believe in a different course of action, but \nit is precisely because of the diversity of opinion in this Nation that \nthis Nation is great. It is precisely because of the viewpoint and \ndiversity we have in this body that this body has been called the \nworld's greatest deliberative legislative body. We need to make sure \nthat that remains.\n  In order for that to be the case, it is appropriate that Members of \nthe Senate who have a good-faith, genuine disagreement with an issue as \nto which a unanimous consent has been made come forward and they \nobject.\n  On that basis, I object. I will continue to object as long as it \nremains necessary to ensure that the debate we have surrounding the \ndebt limit occurs under the regular order of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Sexual Assault in the Military\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, this afternoon the Senate Armed \nServices Committee--in fact, in less than an hour--will convene and we \nwill begin working on historic changes, unprecedented changes to the \nUniform Code of Military Justice in response to the serious and \nsignificant problem of sexual assault in our military.\n  I come to the floor before we convene to explain why I am supporting \nsignificant changes as to how we handle sexual assaults in the military \nbut also why I am not supporting completely removing the role senior \nmilitary commanders play in ordering these kinds of trials to go \nforward.\n  The discussion of this issue takes me back many years when I began \nprosecuting rape and sodomy cases as a young assistant DA in the \nprosecutor's office in Kansas City. For years, I handled dozens and \ndozens of these cases in the courtroom, both as an assistant prosecutor \nand as the elected prosecutor. I have had the opportunity, the \nblessing, the challenge, and the scarring that comes from holding \nvictims' hands, crying with victims, feeling their pain, the permanency \nof the injuries they have suffered as a result of these unspeakable \ncrimes. I would\n\n[[Page S4375]]\n\nchallenge anyone in the Senate to come to this issue with more \nexperience or more understanding of the unique challenges this crime \nrepresents in the never-ending quest for true justice.\n  In my years of experience and the time I have spent with military \nprosecutors, victims, and civilian prosecutors, I have become convinced \nthat the approach the Armed Services Committee will take today is the \nright approach to get these predators put in prison.\n  I believe the provision that I expect will receive a bipartisan \nmajority of the votes in the Armed Services Committee will better \nempower victims and lead to more reporting. The reason it will empower \nvictims and lead to more reporting is because these changes will lead \nto more and effective prosecutions.\n  Ultimately, no woman wants to come forward and talk about this crime, \nand certainly no man who has been victimized in the military wants to \ncome forward and talk about this crime. It is personal. It is private. \nIt is painful. So it does not matter whether the perpetrator is a \nmember of the military or a civilian; these are difficult cases to \nbring forward because of the intensely personal nature of the pain \ninvolved.\n  But I believe these reforms will hold the chain of command more \naccountable and force them to be part of the solution, and it will \nprevent the unintended consequences of dismantling a system of military \njustice that has long been a centerpiece of discipline in our military.\n  Make no mistake about it, the changes we are making are aggressive, \nhistoric, victim-oriented, and unforgiving to the predators.\n  Commanders under these reforms will not have the ability to dismiss a \nconviction of a jury. That is the first and most important reform that \nis occurring. Never again will a commander who has not heard the \ntestimony be able to say ``never mind'' to that victim. Most \nimportantly--and this is very important because the reporting on this \nissue has not been accurate--most importantly, under these reforms, if \nthe lawyers, the prosecutors, say the case should go forward, and the \ncommander disagrees and says no, that will go straight up, not to a man \nin uniform, but to the Secretary of the branch of the military where \nthe crime occurred. So no longer will you have the uniforms making the \nultimate decision.\n  I would argue we are taking in many ways the convening authority out \nof the equation because we are allowing that lawyer, if the commander \ndisagrees with them, that prosecutor, if the commander disagrees with \nthem, to go straight up to the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of \nthe Navy, the Secretary of the Air Force for the ultimate decision by a \ncivilian, not by a member of the military.\n  If the commander decides not to order the court-martial, not to order \nthe trial, the final decision will go to the civilian Secretary. The \nultimate authority is with the civilian.\n  This is even a greater level of scrutiny than in the reforms proposed \nby Senator Gillibrand because you have another level. We heard of cases \nwhere the prosecutors did not want to go forward and the command did. \nThere are instances where prosecutors in the civilian world will not \nfile these cases and the military prosecutors will. I am sure there \nwill be cases where military prosecutors will not want to go forward.\n  So the good news is there is someone above the prosecutors who is a \ncivilian who can, in fact, pass judgment also. We know that many cases \nare not filed in the civilian courts when they are ``he said, she \nsaid'' consent defenses in rape cases. I have painfully explained that \ndecision to victims when the evidence simply was not going to meet the \nburden.\n  But in the military, we have to make sure that it is not just a line \nprosecutor who has the ultimate authority. We need that civilian \nSecretary at the top of this decisionmaking power. We need that \nultimate authority, especially in the culture of our military.\n  The other thing our reform does that Senator Gillibrand's proposal \ndoes not do--and I think this is key--it creates a crime of \nretaliation. So if this victim comes back to the unit and retaliation \noccurs, the people who are committing the retaliation are now subject \nto the Uniform Code of Military Justice and they can be prosecuted for \nthe crime of retaliation.\n  I think this is a very important, direct approach. Because, \nultimately, that is what most victims who do not come forward say they \nare afraid of: their loss of privacy and retaliation and the impact on \ntheir career.\n  The bill also makes many other reforms, giving victims better access \nto legal counsel, improving the skill of personnel working with victims \nin the sexual assault response system, making sure victims have a voice \nin the clemency proceedings, and many others.\n  Ultimately, at the end of the day, if a victim is sexually assaulted, \nand they come back to their unit, is it more likely the unit will \nretaliate against them and make their life miserable if outside lawyers \nhave said the case should go forward or if the commander has said the \ncase should go forward? We do not have evidence that this is a problem \nright now, that commanders are refusing to file these cases. Just the \nopposite. We heard testimony in committee that they are demanding \nprosecutions in some instances where the lawyers have said no.\n\n  I believe these reforms will do a better job of getting predators \nbehind bars and ultimately creating a more supportive environment for \nvictims to come forward.\n  We are not done with this, even after we pass these reforms in \ncommittee today, and even after we pass this Defense authorization bill \nand it goes to the President. But I think we have the best chance of \nmaking real progress with a strong bipartisan reform that will get at \nthe heart of the matter, which these reforms do.\n  I believe we will continue to monitor this, and as we go forward, if \nmore changes are necessary, I will be the first in line to work for \nthem. But do not let anyone say the reforms we are doing today are not \nwhat is right for the victims of sexual assault or for the proposition \nthat anybody, any coward who besmirches our fine military by committing \nthese crimes--that they should not belong in prison. They belong in \nprison, and that is what these reforms are intended to help happen.\n  I thank the Chair and I assume I should yield the floor for my \ncolleague from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I wish to say, through the Chair, thank \nyou to the Senator from Missouri for her advocacy on behalf of our \nservice men and women. And I think she should have made no assumption \nabout yielding the floor to me, but I am happy to take it, if the \nSenator is done.\n  Madam President, I come to the floor today, as I did yesterday, to \ntalk about this incredible opportunity we have before us with this \nbipartisan immigration bill that we are considering now in the Senate, \nin regular order in the Senate. I hope we have a process on the floor, \nnow that we are here, that mirrors the one the Judiciary Committee had: \nan open process where people can offer amendments they care about, one \nthat has a spirited debate on a variety of important issues, so the \nAmerican people can have the benefit of a fully transparent and \ndeliberative process over these important issues.\n  In the Judiciary Committee process alone, over 300 amendments were \nfiled, and 200 were considered, and over 140 of them were actually \nadopted by the committee. That is the way this place ought to work. I \nthink it will strengthen this bipartisan bill to continue to take other \npeople's ideas.\n  What we did not do in the Judiciary Committee, and what I hope we \nwill not do on the Senate floor, is accept amendments that will disrupt \na very carefully negotiated balance in the so-called Gang of 8 or Group \nof 8--four Democrats and four Republicans--who worked hard together to \ntry to get to a place that could actually work.\n  Today there has been a lot of talk, and over the past few days, about \nthe border security issues, the border in particular, and preventing \nfuture waves of immigration. I did not come down here to negotiate any \nparticular amendments or to litigate any particular amendments. I did \nwant to get a little bit of context of where we arrived in the Group of \n8 on this issue.\n  The bill, as written, makes very serious investments, takes major \nsteps to\n\n[[Page S4376]]\n\nsecure our borders. I have to say the work was informed most \nprincipally by two border Senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, both \nRepublicans representing the great State of Arizona. As they have \npointed out and as we have pointed out, we actually, contrary to some \nof the rhetoric around this place, have made a lot of progress over the \nlast decade. It is not perfect, but we have moved in the right \ndirection.\n  As you can see from this chart, in 2012 alone our expenditure on \nborder security and immigration enforcement--this is before this bill \nwe are talking about now that makes more investments in border \nsecurity--our investment exceeded $17.7 billion. That is what the \nAmerican people spent on border security, which is 23 percent higher--\njust on border security. That is 23 percent higher than the $14 billion \nwe spend on all of the other Federal law enforcement agencies combined.\n  I think it will surprise the American people to know that. This is \nwhat we spent on border security. Here is the Border Patrol. Here is \nICE. Together that is $17 billion, a little more than that. That is \nmore than we spent on the FBI, the DEA, the Secret Service, the U.S. \nMarshal's Service, the ATF--all of those law enforcement agencies. All \nof them combined in 2012, before we pass the law that is in front of \nus, that is what we spent protecting the border.\n  To hear some people around here talk about it, one would think none \nof that money made a difference. One would think none of the increased \nborder agents have made a difference. Well, as of January 2013, the \nU.S. Border Patrol had 21,370 agents in total, 18,000 of whom are on \nthe southwest border. From 1980 that represents a ninefold increase. It \nis nine times the number of agents we had. We had roughly 2,000 in \n1980; today we have roughly 21,000. That might be a reason border \ncrossings are down as much as they are.\n  In fact, we are at about net zero this year in terms of people coming \nacross our southern border and leaving. Now, there are still areas on \nthe borders where we need to do more, like in Arizona's Tucson sector. \nSenators McCain and Flake were kind enough to take some of us down to \nthe border to see what was really happening, to understand the \ntopography down there, the difficulty of building a fence from one end \nof our border to the other. There are places where fences have been \nincredibly effective, like in San Diego. There are other places we are \ngoing to need other technology to be able to secure our borders in an \nefficient and thoughtful manner.\n  I hope others who have concerns in this area will meet with these \nborder Senators and listen to what they have to stay about how we can \nimprove the situation on the southern border. What our bill calls for, \nin addition to the increases in resources, is that within 6 months of \nthe bill's passage, the Secretary of Homeland Security is required to \ndevelop and submit to Congress a comprehensive border strategy and \nfencing strategy.\n  We appropriate in this bill $4.5 billion in addition to this money \nyou saw up here, $4.5 billion for these strategies. The goal of this \nplan is to achieve persistent surveillance and a 90-percent \neffectiveness rate at certain high-traffic border areas. These are \nplaces on the border where lots of people try to get into the United \nStates. I can tell the Presiding Officer, I have seen it with my own \neyes. When Senator McCain took us down there, we actually saw someone \ncome across the border. We saw somebody climb the fence while we were \nstanding right there. I have a photograph of it on my cell phone. That \nperson was apprehended within about 30 seconds of getting across the \nborder.\n  It shows it is an issue we need to continue to manage, but it is good \nnews that we have seen the improvement we have. I think these goals \nwill be met. I am convinced by the conversations I have had with \nHomeland Security and with others that the objectives we have laid out \nto create this 90-percent effectiveness rate in the high-traffic areas \nis achievable; that it is achievable with the technologies we propose.\n  If there are changes that can be made during this discussion to \nimprove that, I am all for them. But if the goals are not met, people \nwill say: Well, you say it is going to happen. What if it does not \nhappen?\n  Here is what happens: In 5 years, if it has not happened, a southern \nborder security commission will be established to make further \nrecommendations about how it is we can secure the border, with \nrepresentation from the border States themselves. We appropriate \nanother $2 billion in this bill for the commission's recommendations, \nif, in fact, we ever have to get to a commission, which I hope we will \nnot, and I expect that we will not.\n  I have heard people say one of the big problems with this bill is it \nis just like 1986 all over. I was not here in 1986, so I cannot take \nthe credit or the blame for what happened in 1986. But it is a serious \ncritique and a reasonable critique of that bill; that it did not do \nanything to stop the future flow of immigrants and illegal immigration \nin this country. That is a very fair critique.\n  It is not a fair critique of our bill because our bill deals with the \nborder security I talked about, as well as internal security measures \nin the United States of America that were completely absent in the 1986 \neffort. This bill includes a universal E-Verify system. We crack down \non employers who hire undocumented workers. That alone will reduce \ndramatically the incentive of people to cross the border illegally. If \nthey know all across America that small businesses can run a biometric \ncard or other ID through a database that tells them whether people are \nhere lawfully or not, and in an instant know whether they are here \nlawfully instead of engaging in this game that has been played for \ndecades in-country where people with false security cards are able to \ncome in and get a job and then a year or 18 months later, the employer \nfinds out the Social Security is no longer available, that is going to \ndramatically disincentivize people from crossing the border.\n\n  The small business owners I know are very happy with this because \nthey are tired of being the immigration police. They are tired of \nfeeling like they went the extra mile to figure out whether someone was \nhere lawfully, they relied on a Social Security card that looked \nperfectly valid, with a valid Social Security number, only to find out \n18 months later they hired somebody who was undocumented. They are so \nweary, which is why they are expecting the Congress to finally do its \njob and fix this broken immigration system.\n  The comparison to 1986 is unfair in many ways. Mark Everson, who is a \nformer Deputy Commissioner at the Immigration and Naturalization \nService who oversaw the implementation of the 1986 law, wrote today in \nthe Washington Post:\n\n       In contrast, the legislation before the Senate today takes \n     a comprehensive approach. . . . Demand for unauthorized \n     workers can be dampened, but only through adequate attention \n     to the workplace and interior enforcement. If anything, I \n     would accelerate the rollout of the E-Verify system, while \n     helping to secure our borders faster.\n\n  I hope we can accelerate the E-Verify system. The reason is I have \nheard from employers who say: You know what. We are playing by the \nrules. We are making sure we do not hire undocumented people for our \nconstruction business, but there are other people down the road who \nwill pay lower wages to people who are here unlawfully. That is an \nunfair disadvantage for us.\n  I agree with that. I think the question about how fast we can \nimplement E-Verify needs to be balanced against the inconvenience we \npose to businesses as they get up to speed on the new system. But that \nis certainly something we can talk about.\n  Finally, we have among many other broken parts of this system a \nbroken entry-exit visa system in the United States. I think it would \nshock the American people--it surprised me--to learn that of the 11 \nmillion people who are here, 40 percent of them are people who entered \nthe country lawfully. They entered the country on a visa, but they \noverstayed their visa.\n  We have to have the ability in this great country of ours, in this \n21st century, to somehow detect when people are coming in on a visa, \nbut we have not bothered to figure out when people are leaving, which \ndoes not make a lot of sense given the fact that the technology is \navailable.\n  This bill finally includes a mandatory and operational biographic \nentry-and-exit system to track those coming to the United States and \nthose living in the United States of America, and,\n\n[[Page S4377]]\n\nmiraculously, finally, we are going to actually know who is coming in \nand out of the country.\n  As we begin to phase in a biometric system, it will build upon the \nother efforts being taken to track visitors in a way that is cost \neffective. We are going to become more secure. We will finally know who \nis in this country and who should be asked to leave the United States \nof America.\n  So, in my view, border security is not a reason to obstruct this \nbill. As I said earlier, we are open to changes, but we already have \nvery strong border measures in this bill. I do not want that to be \noverlooked. I think when people hear that we need to spend billions and \nbillions and billions of dollars more, they should know that we are \nalready spending billions of dollars down there. Some of it has been \neffective; some of it has not been effective. I would say let's do what \nis effective, let's not do what is ineffective, and let's not overspend \nat a time when we have the budget issues that we are facing.\n  In conclusion, as the USA Today editorial board has written:\n\n       Unlike 1986's political sleight of hand--\n\n  There is not a lot of love lost for the 1986 bill, as you can tell.\n\n       Unlike 1986's political sleight of hand, this year's \n     legislation is a tough, credible plan for preventing a new \n     surge of illegal immigration. A quest for unattainable \n     perfection should not be allowed to undo the good that it \n     would achieve.\n\n  I wish I could say this was a place that did not let the perfect be \nthe enemy of the good. We seldom ever get to the good. But in this \ncase, I think we have gotten to a place that is very good. We should \nmove forward together as we have to this point in a bipartisan way to \ncraft a thoughtful solution to a broken system that continues to be a \ndrag on the economy of the State of Colorado and the economy of the \nUnited States of America.\n  This law, if we pass it, will once again reaffirm what makes the \nUnited States so special: One, that we subscribe to the rule of law. \nThere are a lot of countries in the world where that is not true. It is \none of the principal reasons that people want to come to the United \nStates: because it is a place where you can live up to your talent, \nbecause nobody can take it from you, because we subscribe to the rule \nof law. People want to come from all over the world--it is a great \ncompliment to our country--to build their businesses here and to help \nus grow our economy.\n  It will reaffirm as well the very important notion that we are a \nnation of immigrants, generation to generation going back to the \nfounding of this great country of ours. That is who we are. If we get \nthis bill passed, if we get this bill passed in the House, I think we \nwill have done something very important for this generation of \nAmericans and also for the people who are coming after.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to strongly \nurge consideration and passage of the first of several amendments I \nwill be presenting on this so-called comprehensive immigration reform \nbill.\n  It is amendment No. 1228 and is about the US-Visit system, the entry-\nexit system that is supposed to be in place. It has been mandated by \nCongress many times to guard against visa overstays, which is a serious \nnational security problem.\n  Why is this important? There is one simple way to underscore it to \nanswer that question, and that is to remind us that the 9/11 \nterrorists, every single one of them, were visa overstays. They were \ndangerous people who came into our country on valid visas, overstayed \ntheir visas, plotted against us, and ultimately caused horrendous death \nand destruction on 9/11.\n  What do we do about that situation? We need a system of tracking \nvisas of the people who come into the country, tracking when they \nshould be leaving the country, and looking to see if they have exited \nthe country. We need a system which has biometric data associated with \nit which can track those entrances and those exits.\n  This sort of system is technologically possible. It is definitely \npossible to fund and put in place. It is primarily a question of \npolitical will.\n  Unfortunately, even after Congress mandated this multiple times to no \neffect, even after 9/11 and other terrorist attacks, we haven't \nmustered the political will to demand to put this is in place. If 9/11 \nwasn't enough, the 9/11 Commission--which we appointed, we put into law \nand asked them to look at the horrible attack of 9/11 and give us \nrecommendations--made this one of their top recommendations. Their \nspecific recommendation was that ``the Department of Homeland Security, \nproperly supported by Congress, should complete as quickly as possible \na biometric entry-exit screening system.''\n\n  Again, Congress had talked about this years before, starting in 1996. \nCongress passed that mandate, and Congress repeated that mandate many \ndifferent times over 17 years, with six additional votes. The 9/11 \nCommission said the tragedy of 9/11 was, in part, due to our not having \nthat system and, Congress, the administration, you need to get this \ndone. Still that important piece of border security is not in place.\n  This Vitter amendment No. 1228 is very simple. It will prohibit the \nimplementation of any program granting temporary legal status in this \nbill or adjusting the legal status of anyone who is presently in our \ncountry unlawfully until this US-VISIT system has been fully \nimplemented--full implementation. So no change in anybody's legal \nstatus happens until we finally, after decades, implement this US-VISIT \nsystem; until we finally, after years, heed the recommendation of the \n9/11 Commission; until we finally, decades after 9/11, say this will \nnever happen again.\n  Also, under my amendment, both Houses of Congress must pass a joint \nresolution of approval stating, yes, this is fully in place. Because, \nquite frankly, there isn't sufficient trust of just the administration \nsaying so, some certification from any administration--not just this \none but any administration. It has to happen and Congress has to say, \nyes, that is in place, and then that change in legal status can go \nforward.\n  We talk a lot about border security, and, of course, usually we focus \non the southern border, for obvious reasons. That is where the numbers \nare. That is where the greatest flow is. But when it comes to national \nsecurity, this is a vital component of enforcement. This is a vital \ncomponent of border security, and so we need to get this right. We need \nto remember 9/11. We need to heed the recommendation of the 9/11 \nCommission. It has been since 1996 when Congress mandated this, and we \nneed to make it stick. The only way to make it stick, in the context of \nthis bill, is to demand it is done, it is completed, verified, \nincluding by Congress, before any change in legal status happens.\n  In closing, I also wish to express strong concern and opposition to \nLeahy amendment No. 1183, which is currently on the floor and up for \nconsideration. That amendment would grant exceptional priority and \nexceptional favor to particular O and P visa applications, which are \ngenerally for renowned professors, researchers, doctors, Oscar winners, \nentertainers, and performers. It would specifically waive a fee \nassociated with this visa.\n  I think that is problematic because we depend on all of these fees to \nfund this system and this enforcement system which we are trying to \nimprove. I find it ironic we would waive this fee for that class of \nindividuals, who are absolutely the most well-heeled and the most \ncapable of paying it. We would give that class of individuals special \nstatus and a waiver of a relatively modest fee and, in the process, \nhurt the funding for the entire enforcement system.\n  I think that is misguided when we are trying to build up enforcement, \nwhen we are trying to get this done and pay for all that enforcement. I \nthink it is misguided to waive this fee for exactly the sort of visa \napplicants who are most in a position to pay it.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4378]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, one of the things I have found \nintriguing, and was glad to hear, was the bill sponsors of S. 744--the \ncomprehensive immigration bill--indicated they had a plan that would \nmove us to a more merit-based system of immigration. They made that \npromise.\n  It is something I advocated in 2007. I had the opportunity to meet \nwith the chairman of the Canadian system while in Canada and we talked \nabout their merit-based system. It is a very significant system, a \nmajor change in how they handle immigration in Canada. He was very \npleased with it. Fundamentally, they sought to admit people into Canada \nwho would have the best chance of being successful in Canada. They \ncan't admit everybody into Canada. No other country I know of has no \nlimit on the number of people who enter. But they wanted to say who \ncould be the most successful, who would do the best, and who should \nflourish in Canada, so they gave points for people with more education, \npeople who already spoke English, people who had the job skills Canada \nneeds, younger people, and matters such as that. It was designed to \nserve the Canadian national interest. It has been in place for a number \nof years now, it actually works, and they are very happy with it.\n  So when I heard this might be a part of the immigration reform bill, \nI was pleased. It is important to emphasize, first, that merit-based \nimmigration is separate from the doubling of the guest workers who come \nin under the bill. Because guest workers come in under other \ncategories. I am referring now to immigrants--people who come to the \ncountry with plans to stay permanently. The merit-based system, as I \nunderstood it, was to focus on that group and rightly so. The merit-\nbased provisions don't include the temporary workers. They have their \nown category.\n  But when I actually review the bill, it is clear this promise of a \nmerit-based system is not met. The promise is not met to any \nsignificant degree. It is another example of the promoters of the \nlegislation overpromoting and selling something that is popular, but \nwhen one reads the bill, it is not there. So I wish to talk about the \nlegislation and go through it on this particular subject.\n  The bill is 1,000 pages and deals with quite a lot of issues and each \none of them are very important. The merit-based system has had almost \nno discussion in the process so far and it needs to be discussed. It is \nthe reason, I believe, we would be better off to have brought up pieces \nof legislation that deal with the characteristics of the people we \nwould like to have enter the country in the future, to deal with border \nsecurity, to deal with the visa system, to deal with workplace \nenforcement, and to deal with internal enforcement, individually and \nseparately.\n  But, no, we have this monumental 1,000-page bill, with all kinds of \nthings in it. The sponsors say: We have taken care of this problem. We \nhave taken care of border security. We have taken care of the visa \nsystem, and, by the way, we have a great plan. The system is going to \nbe merit based now.\n  The proponents of the legislation have said the bill decreases annual \nfamily-based immigration by reducing the cap on family-based visa \nsystems. These are immigrants who come to the country based on \nrelationships with people here. They say: We will reduce that from \n226,000 to 161,000. However, the bill actually increases overall \nfamily-based immigration by allowing an unlimited number of visas each \nyear for children and spouses of green card holders. It grows the \nnumber further by allowing the visas that would have gone to them under \nthe old system to be used by other family-based visa applicants.\n  The bill also does not change current law, which allows an unlimited \nnumber of family-based visas for parents of U.S. citizens each year. \nOne of the largest and fastest growing chain migration categories is \nparents. According to the Department of Homeland Security yearbook \nstatistics in 2012, 124,210 parents adjusted their status to legal \npermanent resident through this category.\n  Canada does the opposite. Canada says it benefits more if they have \nyoung people come. They have a full working life, they pay into the \npension plans, and that is fine. That works well. But they give less \npoints for older people for the very same reason.\n  This is a big increase we are seeing there. And the number of merit-\nbased visas pales in comparison to the family-based visas under the \nbill. So the total number of merit-based visas in this category is much \nsmaller than the family-based visas in this legislation.\n  For example, the new merits section allows for up to 250,000 a year. \nThese are people who would apply and claim they have certain merit \nqualities that justify being ranked higher on the list. That is almost \nexactly the number of petitions that the U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services currently receives every year in just sibling and \nmarried sons and daughters family-based visa category. So the 250,000--\nthe maximum number under the merit system--is almost exactly the same \nas the number of brothers and sisters and married sons and daughters in \nthe family-based category.\n  According to the liberal group the Center for American Progress, the \nannual flow of family-based immigrants will be over 800,000--three \ntimes higher than the number of merit-based visas offered each year.\n  The Migration Policy Institute notes this:\n\n       The Senate bill would lift numerical limits and increase \n     the number of permanent visas issued on the basis of nuclear \n     family ties.\n\n  The Migration Policy Institute effectively and correctly notes this:\n\n       The Senate bill would dramatically expand options for low- \n     and middle-skilled foreign workers to fill year-round longer \n     term jobs and ultimately qualify for permanent residence.\n\n  So this is a serious matter. Does the bill move to a merit-based \nsystem or does it dramatically expand immigration of low- and middle-\nskilled foreign workers to fill long-term jobs and move to qualify for \npermanent residence? I think there is no doubt about it. The Migration \nPolicy Institute is correct in that analysis. It would be so good if we \nhad moved a lot further in the merit-based system, but the bill just \ndoesn't.\n  The bill's proponents also suggest that the bill reduces chain \nmigration by eliminating siblings--brothers and sisters--and married \nchildren categories from the family-based visa system. However, the \nbill awards points in the new merit-based system to siblings and \nmarried children, allowing the same chain migrants to receive merit-\nbased visas ahead of many highly skilled and educated merit-based visa \napplicants. So what I am saying is that the merit-based system gives \npoints, but it also gives points if you have family here--a lot of \npoints.\n  Proponents of the bill argue that the merit-based system will ensure \nthat more highly skilled and educated aliens will receive visas because \nthe point system favors education, employment, and English proficiency. \nHowever, points are also allocated for nonmerit-based factors, such as \nfamily ties, civic involvement, and by virtue of being an alien from a \ncountry from which few aliens have emigrated. That is sort of like the \nformer diversity visa. The merit-based visa system favors chain \nmigrants over highly skilled and educated applicants by allocating more \npoints to nonmerit-based factors.\n  Let's look at it. For example, an alien who wants to apply to the \nUnited States who has a college degree, a 4-year bachelor's degree, is \ngiven 5 points because they have more education. However, an alien who \nwants to come to the United States can also receive 5 points for simply \nbeing a national of a country from which few aliens have been admitted. \nAlso, an alien who is a sibling of a citizen of the United States would \nreceive the same amount of points as an alien with a master's degree--\n10 points--and 5 more points than an alien with a college degree. So \nthis brother or sister would also receive more points than an alien \nwith 3 years of experience in an occupation requiring extensive \npreparation, such as a surgeon.\n  So what I am saying is that through a backdoor way they claim they \nhave a merit system, but, again, vast advantages are given based on \nfamily connections. So we could have two people from Honduras apply to \ncome to the\n\n[[Page S4379]]\n\nUnited States. One was valedictorian of his high school class, has a 4-\nyear college degree, speaks English, and is anxious to come to America \nand go to work, and the other one dropped out of high school, doesn't \nspeak English, and doesn't even have a high school degree. Well, if \nthat one had a brother in the United States, he would be accepted \nbefore the more educated student graduate. I think that is wrong.\n  In tier 2, a brother or sister of a citizen would receive the same \namount of points as an alien lawfully present and employed in the \nUnited States in an occupation that requires medium preparation, which \ncan include air traffic controllers, commercial pilots, and registered \nnurses.\n  But this is only a fraction of the chain family-based migration that \nwill occur over the next 10 years under this legislation because the 11 \nmillion illegal immigrants who are given green cards and even \ncitizenship will be able to bring in their families as well over time, \nand they can be approved on an expedited basis.\n  For example, there are an estimated 2.5 million who would benefit \nunder the DREAM Act provisions of the legislation. If they came here as \nchildren, they get accelerated process; they will be eligible for \ncitizenship in 5 years. Again, that 2.5 million will be able to bring \ntheir parents also. DREAM Act beneficiaries will also be able to bring \nin an unlimited number--without any count--of parents, spouses, and \nchildren, and those spouses, children, and parents will get permanent \nlegal status in an additional 5 years and will be eligible for \ncitizenship in 10.\n  An estimated 800,000 illegal agricultural workers today would become \nlegal permanent residents, green card holders, in 5 years and will then \nbe eligible to bring in an unlimited number of spouses and children. An \nestimated 8 million additional illegal immigrants who are here today \nwould be given legal status, including recent arrivals from as late as \nDecember of 2011. Millions of visa overstay persons will receive legal \nstatus and work authorizations.\n  These 8 million will be able to bring in their relatives as soon as \n10 years from now, and those relatives, over time, will be able to \nbring in spouses, children, and parents. None of those will come in on \na merit-based system. They are not depending on their education. They \nare not depending on their health. They will just be able to come under \nthe rules that will be set forth in this bill.\n  There are an estimated 4.5 million aliens awaiting employment and \nfamily-based visas under current cap limitations. We have 4.5 million \nwho have applied to come, but there are limits on how many people can \ncome per year under the current law. But large parts of those caps and \nlimits will be completely eliminated under the legislation. So an \nestimated 4.5 million who are waiting now outside of America for their \ntime to come will be cleared over a period of years, not subject to the \nfamily-based annual cap, thus freeing room for more family-based \nmigration that would be subject to an annual cap.\n  Over the next decade the bill would legalize well over 30 million \napplicants. Colleagues, we need to understand that. Under current law, \nour processes call for the legalization of 1 million people a year. We \nare the most generous Nation in the world, but you have to know that if \nthis bill passes, we will be giving permanent legal status to 30 \nmillion people in the next 10 years. Over 2.5 million of those people \nwould be through the new merit-based system. So out of 30 million, only \n2.5 million would be admitted under the merit-based system, and even \namong those 2.5 million, many will be admitted because they get extra \npoints for being family members.\n  But there is a larger issue as well. Median income has declined in \nAmerica since Congress last considered immigration reform. Income in \nAmerica for working Americans has been declining. I hate to say it, but \nit is true. I have seen recent statistics. From 1999 to today we have \nseen an 8-percent reduction in real take-home pay of working Americans. \nSome say that for the last 30 years we have had a basic erosion of the \nsalary base of working Americans. That is very serious. Yet this bill \nroughly triples the annual flow of legal immigrants--largely low-\nskilled legal immigrants, not high-skilled college graduates--and \ndoubles the flow of temporary guest workers, which is an entirely \nseparate group from the one I have been talking about.\n  Do my colleagues have any concerns about how this will impact the \nfalling incomes of our middle-class American citizens? Has any thought \nbeen given to that? Has anybody considered that if we bring in more \npeople than the economy can absorb, this will create unemployment, \nplace people on welfare and dependency, deny men and women the ability \nto produce an income sufficient to take care of their families, make \nthem dependent on the State because we simply don't have enough jobs? \nWell, we don't have enough jobs now. That is an absolute fact. We had \nan increase in unemployment this last month. We had a decline of 8,000 \njobs in manufacturing. The bulk of the increases in jobs was in service \nindustries, such as restaurants and bars, and part-time workers.\n  We have a serious problem, and our colleagues need to be asking \nthemselves, can I justify this kind of huge increase in immigration \nwhen we can't find jobs for current Americans? And what about the \nmillions living in poverty today and chronically unemployed? What about \nthe nearly one in two African American teenagers who are unemployed \ntoday? They need to get started in the workforce, but if they have to \ncompete against somebody who came here under a work visa program who is \n30 years of age who would be glad to work for minimum wage or lower, \nthey don't have a chance to get started.\n  Can one of the sponsors explain to me the economic justification for \nadding four times more guest workers than proposed in the bill in 2007 \nat a time when more than 4.6 million more Americans are out of work \ntoday than in 2007? Can one of the sponsors answer this basic question: \nHow will this legislation protect struggling American workers? How will \nit help them? Oh, it may help some meatpacker or some large \nagribusiness. They may get a gain from it. But will it help the \nmillions of middle-class working Americans who need jobs, need pay \nraises, need to be able to have health care and retirement benefits? I \nam worried about that. We need to talk about that. Some people are \ntalking about it on the outside, but it is almost not discussed within \nthis Chamber.\n  Will the flowing of this many new workers raise wages or reduce \nwages? Will it make it harder for a husband or a wife, a son or a \ndaughter, a grandchild or a granddaughter to get a job at a decent \nwage? Wages have been going down, unemployment is up--the lowest \npercentage of people in the workforce in America today since the 1970s. \nHow can we justify this? Somebody needs to talk about it.\n  We have people who are optimistic. They think we will just bring in \nmillions of people and somehow jobs will accrue, but it doesn't appear \nto be so.\n  To whom do we owe our loyalty? To some business that would like to \nhave more labor? Or to the American people who fight our wars, obey our \nlaws, raise their children and pay their taxes to this country--when \nthey are working and can pay taxes? To whom is our loyalty owed? We \nneed to ask those questions.\n  I appreciate the fact that the Gang of 8 has stated they believe in a \nmerit-based kind of program that would bring in more people and convert \nour system from low-skilled immigration to a higher skilled \nimmigration. Unfortunately, it makes far too little advancement in that \nregard. We cannot accept such a meager alteration in our system. Canada \nwent much further toward a merit-based system than we did, and that is \nwhat we need to do.\n  There are a lot of statistics out there that show that an immigrant \nwho comes to America with 2 years of college or more, speaking English, \ndoes very well in our country. They tend to flourish, tend to do well \nfinancially. They tend to pay more in taxes than they take out. But for \nthose who are less skilled, the opposite is true. It is obvious the \nNation should seek to advance its national interest by welcoming more \npeople who have the ability to be successful and flourish in our great \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise to continue this debate on one of \nthe great issues of our time, immigration, the bill that is before us. \nI thank the ranking member Mr. Grassley for allowing me to jump ahead \nof him in the\n\n[[Page S4380]]\n\nschedule. I have a markup in the Armed Services Committee, and I need \nto get back.\n  Let me say that in the next few weeks the Senate will have an \nopportunity to discuss, clearly and resolutely, America's broken \nimmigration system. Part of that means seeking policy solutions that \nwill not only make our country stronger for decades to come but make \nour country safer going forward. Partisan politics should not derail \nthe pursuit of an honest and good-faith approach to solving national \nproblems, problems such as our broken immigration system. Americans are \nright to demand better from their elected representatives, and there is \nmerit in allowing this legislation to proceed in an open and \ntransparent manner.\n  In doing so, we rightfully recognize that there is widespread and \nbipartisan consensus for lasting immigration reform. That consensus \nexists in this Chamber and it exists across the country. For that \nreason yesterday I voted in favor of cloture on this bill and in favor \nof the motion to proceed. So here we are, about to consider, I hope, \namendments that would improve the bill.\n  We cannot ignore the reality that there are 11 million undocumented \nimmigrants in America today. We cannot dismiss the economic \nimplications of a failed immigration system. Disagreements are part of \nthe legislative process, and we will have disagreements over the next \nseveral weeks on this issue. I do not expect our work on this issue to \nbe seamless, I do not expect it to be easy, but robust debate has \nalways been central to the Senate's function and purpose. We would do \nwell to uphold that proud tradition now. Lasting and effective \nimmigration reform requires a willingness to work on issues \ncollaboratively and constructively--and in a bipartisan manner. An \nissue of this magnitude that touches on so many aspects of our society \nand economy cannot be done on a solely partisan basis. We must have a \nwide, large, bipartisan majority for anything that moves out of this \nbody and down to the House.\n  I am a long-time supporter of reinforcing our borders, of increasing \nthe number of Border Patrol agents and using surveillance technology to \nprevent illegal immigrants from crossing into our country. I support \npolicies that come with enforcement and accountability, where those who \nhave broken the law face consequences for their wrongdoing. I believe \nmeasures to strengthen employment verification are important to making \nsure American jobs are held by American citizens and by those who live \nand work in our country legally.\n  In my view the immigration bill, prepared by a bipartisan Group of 8 \nand supported by the Judiciary Committee, is a start but it is lacking \nin many ways, and I cannot support it in its current form. More should \nbe done to ensure, first and foremost, that our borders are secure. \nWithout this fundamental first step, true reform remains elusive and \nthe problem of illegal immigration will persist.\n  As we proceed with this bill, I look forward to amendments that would \nimplement a stronger border security strategy, interior security \nprotections, and processes for honest employers to assess employee work \nrights. A responsible way forward must recognize past failures, and we \nhave certainly seen that--past failures, for example, to secure the \nborder and unfulfilled promises for better enforcement. We need to \nrecognize those failures of the past. A comprehensive plan must include \nmechanisms to track those who unlawfully overstay their visas just as \nit seeks to remedy gaps in border security.\n  Over the course of the past few weeks, Mississippians have contacted \nmy office and spoken to me directly regarding their concerns about \nwhether the bill will offer amnesty; whether it will offer Federal \nbenefits to illegal immigrants. Let me be clear that I will oppose \nlegislation if it grants legal status without penalties or if it issues \nwelfare benefits to individuals who have broken the law to live and \nwork in this country. These individuals should not go to the front of \nthe line, ahead of those who have patiently waited to become Americans.\n  We are a country of immigrants. Throughout American history people of \nall nations have recognized the promise of opportunity and freedom in \nthe United States. Legal immigration has sustained and advanced our \ncommunities in a positive way. Whether our immigration system is going \nforward in a way that benefits our society depends on how we act in the \ncoming weeks. I hope we can do so thoughtfully and meaningfully as we \nseek solutions to a flawed system.\n  This bill in its current form does not contain the reforms we need. \nEfforts to amend it should be seen as an opportunity to get a \nbipartisan consensus of Senators to a ``yes'' vote. They should not be \nseen as poison pills or as efforts to hurt the process. This bill \nserves as a vehicle for continued discussion about the future of U.S. \nimmigration policy. We should welcome this debate, and I do welcome \nthis debate. We should confront the challenges of our day in a way that \nis deliberative and principled.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suppose when some of us raise a lot of \nquestions about this legislation and point out shortcomings in it that \nsome question our sincerity. When we say we need a piece of \nlegislation, we might be questioned by a lot of people who are \nlistening. That may also sound like we question the sincerity of the \nGroup of 8 when we raise questions about this bill that they worked \nhard to put together. I don't question their sincerity, and I do \nbelieve that legislation must pass the Senate.\n  There are those of us who have said for such a long time that the \nsystem we have is not satisfactory, we cannot maintain the status quo, \nand we have to be working for a product. All of us in the Senate are \nworking toward a product. There is a difference of what that product \nshould be in the final analysis.\n  I continue to come to the floor to raise some questions about, not \nthe intent of the authors, but what I think is the practical effect of \nthe legislation by these authors. I come to the floor today to respond \nto what my friend, the senior Senator from Arizona, said earlier today \non this legislation. He is one of those hard-working Senators who have \nworked hard, hours I am sure I cannot comprehend, to put together this \npiece of legislation.\n  Today that Senator argued that poll after poll shows Americans \nsupport a legalization process if--and that is a very important \n``if''--people pay back taxes, pay a fine, and get at the end of the \nline, and if we secure the border. I pointed out before that the \nproblem with the legislation before us, as well intended, is that \npeople do not really have to pay back taxes, or a fine, or go to the \nend of the line, and secure the border. So these polls are being \nmisused if the practical effect of the language in the bill makes it \npossible that those things may never happen, even though it is well \nintended that they ought to happen. Nobody disagrees they ought to \nhappen.\n  I will probably be somewhat repetitive, but I want to remind my \ncolleagues, as I take a few minutes to discuss this, how the authors \nhave tried to sell this particular immigration bill and what I see as \nfalse advertising. You see, the American people are being sold a \nproduct. In fact that is what politics is, it is a sale of ideas. A \npolitical party does not have any reason to exist if it does not have \ngood ideas. Then the idea is to get in a position to put those ideas \ninto effect.\n  This product is being sold, and I wish it comes out the way they say \nit does, but I have some questions about that. The American people are \nbeing asked to accept a legalization program. In exchange, they would \nbe assured that the laws were going to be enforced. Normally, consumers \nare able to read the labels of things they are about to purchase. They \nhave to read 1,175 pages to really know what is truly in this bill. \nEven a quick read of the bill would have many shaking their heads in \nconfusion.\n  This bill is full of delegations of authority to the Secretary, \npossibilities for waivers, things of that nature--that really would be \nwell down the road after the President signs legislation that you are \nreally going to know how it is being carried out.\n  We have all heard the phrase ``the devil is in the details.'' At \nfirst the proposal the bipartisan group put forward\n\n[[Page S4381]]\n\nsounded reasonable, but we need to examine the fine print and take a \ncloser look at what the bill really does. As I noted yesterday, I \nthought the framework held hope, but I realize the assurances the Group \nof 8 made did not really translate when the language of the bill \nemerged.\n  They professed that the border would be secured and that people would \n``earn'' their legal status. However, the bill as drafted is \nlegalization first and enforcement later, if at all. So I would like to \ndive into these details and give a little reality check to those who \nexpect this bill to do exactly what the authors promise.\n  I have on this chart four points that I would like to make and \nstatements that have been made about this legislation.\n  No. 1, they say ``people will have to pay a penalty'' to obtain legal \nstatus. The reality is the bill lays out the application procedures, \nand on page 972 a penalty is imposed on those who apply for registered \nprovisional immigration status. Those are the words in the bill for \nlegalization. We refer to that as RPI. It says those who apply must pay \n$1,000 to the Department of Homeland Security.\n  What is the certainty of getting that $1,000? For instance, it waives \nthe penalty for anyone under the age of 21. Yet, on the next page, it \nallows the applicant to pay the penalty in installments. The bill says:\n\n       The Secretary shall establish a process for collecting \n     payments . . . that permit the penalty to be paid in periodic \n     installments that shall be completed before the alien may be \n     granted an extension of status.\n\n  In effect, this says the applicants have 6 years to pay the penalty. \nSix years is how long it takes to get RPI status, and at the end of 6 \nyears, they have to extend it.\n  In addition to the penalty, applicants would pay a processing fee. \nThat level is set by the Secretary. So here we have two instances of \nexcessive delegation of authority to the Secretary. The bill says the \nSecretary has a discretion to waive the processing fee for any \n``classes of individuals'' she chooses and may limit the maximum fee \npaid by a family.\n  The bill doesn't require everyone to pay a penalty. It doesn't \nrequire anyone to pay it when they apply for legal status. In fact, \nthey may never have to pay a penalty.\n  No. 2, they say ``people have to pay back taxes.'' Who is going to \nargue with the fact that people have to pay back taxes to receive legal \nstatus? The reality: Members of the Group of 8 stated over and over \nagain their bill would require undocumented individuals to pay back \ntaxes prior to being granted legal status. However, the bill before us \nfails to make good on that promise. Proponents of the bill point to a \nprovision of the bill that prohibits people from filing for legal \nstatus ``unless the applicant has satisfied any applicable federal tax \nliability.'' Doesn't that sound right? Absolutely it sounds right. As \nalways, the devil is in the details.\n  There are two important weaknesses with how the bill defines \n``applicable federal tax liability.'' The first one is: The bill limits \nthe definition to exclude employment taxes, such as for Social Security \nand Medicare. For a lot of people, that may be the only taxes they pay, \nbut they don't have to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes.\n  Second, the bill does not require the payment of all back taxes \nlegally owed. What it requires is the payment of taxes previously \nassessed by the Internal Revenue Service. Well, there are a lot of \nproblems with the IRS assessing somebody for taxes if they have been in \nthe underground, as an example. In order to assess taxes, it is quite \nobvious the IRS must first have information on which to base its \nassessment.\n  Our tax system is largely a voluntary system, relying on everybody to \nself-report their income on their tax return. But it also relies on \ncertain third-party reporting, such as wage reporting by employers. \nThat is why we get a W-2 form at the end of every year, so we and the \nIRS know exactly what we owe and what we paid and so they can figure \nout what more we might owe or how much we might get back.\n  If someone has been working unlawfully in this country and working \noff the books, it is likely that neither an individual return nor a \nthird-party return will even exist; thus, no assessment will exist and \nno taxes will be paid. Similarly, it is very unlikely any assessment \nwill exist for those who have worked under a false Social Security \nnumber and have never filed a tax return. A legal obligation exists to \npay taxes on all income from whatever source derived, and nothing in \nthis bill provides a requirement or a mechanism to accomplish this \nprior to granting legal status.\n  One of the Group of 8 members in January said:\n\n       Shouldn't citizens have to pay back taxes? We can trace \n     their employment back. It doesn't take a genius.\n\n  While it may be a well-intended statement, it obviously meets the \ntest of common sense, but I showed how difficult it is to make that \nhappen. The other side of the aisle, for instance, is going to argue \nthat establishing a requirement for back taxes owed rather than taxes \nassessed is unworkable and costly. They will also claim imposing \nadditional tax barriers on this population could prevent undocumented \nworkers and their families from coming forward in the first place.\n  But the sales pitch has been clear: To get legal status, one has to \npay their back taxes. So let me provide a reality check. This bill \ndoesn't make good on the promises made.\n  Let's go to the third item on the chart. ``People will have to learn \nEnglish.'' The reality: The bill, as drafted, is supposed to ensure \nthat new Americans speak a common language. Learning English is a way \nfor new residents to assimilate. This is an issue that is very \nimportant to Americans. Immigrants before us made a concerted effort to \nlearn English. The proponents are claiming their bill fulfills this \nwish.\n  However, the bill does not require people here unlawfully to learn \nEnglish before receiving legal status or even a green card. Under \nsection 2101, a person with RPI status who applies for a green card \nonly has to pursue a course of study to achieve an understanding of \nEnglish and knowledge and understanding of civics.\n\n  If the people who gain legal status ever apply for citizenship--and \nsome doubt this will happen to a majority of the undocumented \npopulation--they would also have to pass an English proficiency exam, \nas required under current law. So, yes, after 13 years, one would have \nto pass an exam, but the bill does very little to ensure that those who \ncome out of the shadows will cherish or use the English language. The \nreality is English is not as much of a priority for the proponents of \nthis bill as they claim it is.\n  The fourth thing on the chart: They say ``people won't get public \nbenefits'' if they choose to apply for legal status.\n  The reality: Americans are very compassionate and generous people. \nMany people can understand providing some legal status to people here \nillegally, but one major sticking point for those who question the \nlegalization program is the fact that lawbreakers could become eligible \nfor public benefits and taxpayer subsidies.\n  The authors of the bill understood this. In an attempt to show that \nthose who receive RPI status would not receive taxpayer benefits, they \nincluded a provision that prohibited the population from receiving \ncertain benefits. There are two major problems with this point in the \nbill.\n  First, those who receive RPI status will be immediately eligible for \nState and local welfare benefits. For instance, many States offer cash, \nmedical, and food assistance through State-only programs to ``lawfully \npresent'' individuals.\n  Second, the bill contains a welfare waiver loophole that could allow \nthose with RPI status to receive Federal welfare dollars. The Obama \nadministration has pushed the envelope by waiving the welfare laws. If \nthis loophole is not closed, they could waive existing law and allow \nfunds provided under the welfare block grant known as Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families to be provided to noncitizens.\n  Senator Hatch had an amendment during committee markup that would \nprohibit the U.S. Department of HHS from waiving various requirements \nand the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program. His amendment \nwould also prohibit any Federal agency from waiving restrictions on \neligibility of immigrants for future public benefits. But the reality \ncheck for the\n\n[[Page S4382]]\n\nAmerican people is there are loopholes and the potential for public \nbenefits to go to those who are legalized under the bill.\n  Again, the devil is in the details, and I hope this reality check \nwill encourage proponents of this bill to fix these problems before the \nbill is passed by the Senate. The American people deserve truth in \nadvertising.\n  I want to speak about the provision that deals with the commission. \nAside from the claims I just gave on the promises to pay taxes, et \ncetera, one of the authors of the immigration bill before us stated \nearly on that if the Department of Homeland Security has not reached \n100 percent awareness and 90 percent apprehension at the southern \nborder within 5 years, the Secretary would lose control of the \nresponsibility and it will be turned over to the border governors to \nget the job done.\n  The fact is the border governors and the commission they serve with \nare not going to have any power, and that is the point I am going to \nmake. There was a lot of talk about how the Secretary would be pushed \nto fulfill the congressional mandate to secure the border. I pointed \nout yesterday how this Secretary said: We don't need to secure the \nborder. It is already secured. But at the end of the day, as far as \nthis bill is concerned, the legislative text doesn't match up with the \nrhetoric.\n  The border commission created is not made up primarily of border \ngovernors, doesn't have any real power, and the Secretary is not held \naccountable for not getting the job done. Again, it is false \nadvertising.\n  The bill states that effective control--and those words ``effective \ncontrol'' are the legal language in the bill--of the border is the \nability to achieve and maintain ``persistent surveillance and an \neffectiveness rate of 90 percent or higher.'' It defines the \neffectiveness rate as ``the percentage calculated by dividing the \nnumber of apprehensions and turn backs in the sector during a fiscal \nyear by the total number of illegal entries in the sector during such \nfiscal year.''\n  First, the bill only states that effective control requires \n``persistent surveillance.'' It does not require 100 percent awareness.\n  Second, there is nothing in the bill that turns over the issue of \nborder security to border governors if the Department here in \nWashington, DC, is unable to secure the border. The bill provides for a \ncommission to be created if the Secretary of Homeland Security tells \nCongress she has not achieved effective control in all border sections \nduring any fiscal year within 5 years. The southern border security \ncommission is then created with the primary responsibility to make \nrecommendations to the Secretary. There will be 10 members of the \ncommission. While border States have a seat at the table, only 4 of the \n10 members need to be southern border Governors or appointed by them. \nThe members are allowed travel expenses and administrative support. \nThey have to have some knowledge and experience in border security.\n\n  The commission is required to submit a report to the President, the \nSecretary, and the Congress with specific recommendations for achieving \nand maintaining the border security goals established in the bill. The \nmembers have 6 months to come up with a plan to achieve what the \nSecretary failed to do in 5 years.\n  The bill does not grant the commission any grand or impressive \nauthorities. The bill simply states that the commission shall make \nrecommendations. Nothing in the bill requires that the recommendations \nbe acted upon or implemented by the administration.\n  The bill provides $2 billion to the Secretary to carry out the \nrecommendations made by the commission. But, again, there is nothing in \nthis bill requiring the Secretary to take any further action on those \nrecommendations. Why not then give the commission actual authority to \nenforce border security? Then, if we don't do that, why create the \ncommission at all?\n  In recent years, we in Congress have become accustomed to outsourcing \nour work. We have a responsibility to legislate. The executive branch \nhas a responsibility to enact. These are basic tenets of government.\n  The commission called for in this bill is kind of irrelevant. This \nadministration and any future administration must get the job done, no \noutsourcing the job to some commission, no excuses. This is so \nimportant because we quote these polls, and I refer to the polls the \nsenior Senator from Arizona referenced before he made his remarks. They \nare all based upon certain propositions. They are well intended, but \nthey do not provide the certainty they are going to be carried out, and \nlegalization is based on that--the same for the polls that say people \nwant the borders secure.\n  So this commission ought to have some power if the Secretary isn't \ngoing to act. But already the Secretary has the responsibility to see \nthat the border is secure. She has testified it is secure, more secure \nthan it has ever been, but I think the facts are that it has not been \nand we need to do better. For us to sell this bill to the American \npeople, it must be based upon the proposition that the border be \nsecured first and then legalization.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, there is very little disagreement about \nthe fact that America's immigration system is broken and in need of \nreform. For far too long, our immigration system has punished those who \ncome to this country to pursue the American dream and play by the rules \nwhile rewarding those who do not respect our laws. As a result, our \nNation is suffering. That is why it is important for this body to have \nan open and transparent amendment process as we move forward on this \nimmigration reform legislation and try to fix what is broken with our \nimmigration system.\n  No State feels the impact of this broken immigration system more than \nmy home State of Nevada. Nevada is a top destination for travelers all \nover the world, and it is an international hub through which tens of \nmillions of people pass each year. Our State benefits from the cultural \ndiversity of Filipino, Cuban, Chinese, and Armenian communities, just \nto name a few, and we are couched between two States that border the \ncountry of Mexico.\n  Las Vegas is known for McCarran International Airport, which sees \ntens of millions of international tourists each year and is merely a \nshort drive away from Los Angeles, San Diego, and Phoenix. Nevada's \nunique location leaves it highly vulnerable to our flawed immigration \nsystem and open to the exact same problems faced by other southwestern \nborder States such as Arizona, Texas, California, and New Mexico.\n  Despite the fact that Nevada is, in many respects, a border State \nthat copes with the exact same immigration problems facing a State such \nas California, this bill in its current form excludes Nevada from the \nlist of States that are eligible to join the southern border security \ncommission. So my amendment No. 1227 would include Nevada with other \nsouthwestern border States whose Governors would comprise the southern \nborder security commission.\n  This amendment ensures the commission created in the underlying bill \nis fully representative of issues affecting southern border and \nSouthwestern States. Although Nevada does not touch the southern \nborder, its current demographics and State issues are reflective of \nother southern border States, and Nevada should have a voice on this \ncommission.\n  The problems of our immigration system are not simply geographic \nproblems of latitude and longitude. They impact my home State in \nprofound ways. I encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense \namendment.\n  As I have said, this immigration reform legislation is important, and \nwe have an opportunity to provide much needed solutions to the problems \nwith our immigration system. But we must also ensure the bill does not \nmake matters worse by creating more confusion and placing heavier \nburdens on the economy and on the American people.\n  My home State of Nevada continues to lead the Nation in high \nunemployment, bankruptcies, and foreclosures. It is absolutely critical \nthat this immigration bill does not hinder Nevada's already struggling \neconomy.\n  That is why I filed two amendments, amendment No. 1234 and amendment \nNo. 1235, which will help to safeguard\n\n[[Page S4383]]\n\nNevada's recovering tourism industry in a way that meets our Nation's \nborder security needs.\n  The bill before us mandates the implementation of an entry-exit \nsystem that will include a biometric data system for all ports of \nentry, including the 10 highest volume airports. The implementation of \nsuch a system is long overdue in order to comply with current law, but \nwe can take steps to make sure it does not negatively impact \ninternational travel.\n  While I firmly believe we need to process our visitors both in and \nout of this country safely and securely, it is also essential that this \nmandatory exit system not cause increased travel delays for \ninternational passengers at high-volume airports such as McCarran \nInternational Airport in Las Vegas. So I filed an amendment that will \nrequire DHS to submit a report to the Homeland Security and Government \nReform Committee within 60 days of the enactment of the underlying bill \ndetailing how DHS intends to implement this biometric exit system.\n  Requiring DHS to outline its implementation plan will provide the \nnecessary guidance and clarity to airports that will first be required \nto comply with the system as well as ensuring they provide the \nnecessary staffing at these airports in an effort to minimize the \nimpact on the flow of travelers. Additionally, my amendment No. 1235 \nwill require DHS to create a wait-time reduction goal and increase, as \ndeemed necessary by the Department, the number of Customs and Border \nProtection officers so airports with high volumes of international \ntravelers can process them in a timely manner.\n  Under this amendment, DHS will be required to develop a viable plan \nto reduce wait times by 50 percent at airports with the highest volumes \nof international travelers. Wait times for international visitors at \nMcCarran International Airport in Las Vegas are already significantly \nhigh, largely due to a lack of Customs and Border Protection officers. \nThis amendment will help to alleviate these wait times and to reduce \nthe congestion that is discouraging travel and ultimately hurting our \neconomy.\n  The underlying bill is far from perfect, but as GEN George Patton \nfamously said, ``A good plan executed today is better than a perfect \nplan executed next week.'' The amendments I am filing today will \nincrease government transparency and help to make sure this bill does \nnot add more confusion to the immigration process, which would only \nmake the problems with our immigration system worse.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in that effort by supporting these \namendments.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, let me start by complimenting the Senator \nfrom Nevada on his concerns with regard to staffing at our ports of \nentry, airports, and seaports. We have similar challenges, even at our \nland ports in Texas where legitimate commerce and tourism is taking \nplace but which is being inhibited because of hardship or inconvenience \non travelers because of a lack of staffing and infrastructure at those \nports of entry.\n  I have come to the floor to talk about an amendment I intend to \noffer, which I have discussed over the last couple of days, which uses \nmany of the same standards the underlying Gang of 8 bill does. Let me \nexplain.\n  Of course, the Gang of 8 represents the Republicans and Democrats who \ncame up with the original framework that then was adopted, by and \nlarge, by the Judiciary Committee, which is the base bill we are \ntalking about today. But both the Gang of 8 bill and the results \namendment which I will introduce call for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to achieve 100 percent situational awareness of the southern \nborder in 10 years. Both the Gang of 8 bill and the RESULTS amendment \nthat I will offer call for the Department of Homeland Security to \nachieve full operational control of the border, which is defined as a \n90-percent apprehension rate of illegal traffic. Both the Gang of 8 \nbill and the RESULTS amendment which I will offer call for a nationwide \nE-Verify system or a system of employer verification so we don't have \nour employers, small and large alike, having to be the police. We can \ngive them a system that will be easily implemented--cards swiped and \nthe like--which will allow them to determine and satisfy themselves \nthat the worker who presents himself or herself for work is legally \nqualified to work in the United States.\n  Both the Gang of 8 bill--the underlying bill--and the RESULTS \namendment which I will offer call for a biometric entry-exit system at \nAmerica's largest airports. In other words, rather than a poison pill--\nif my amendment is a poison pill as some have suggested--then the Gang \nof 8 bill itself is a poison pill. But neither is true.\n  The most important difference between my amendment and the Gang of 8 \nbill is that my amendment has real border security triggers in place \nwhile the Gang of 8 bill has no effective trigger that will guarantee \nimplementation of border security standards that reach the gang's own \nstandards of 100 percent situational awareness and a 90-percent \napprehension rate.\n  The Gang of 8 bill endorses many of the same border security \nstandards that my amendment does, but it also authorizes a permanent \nlegalization program for illegal immigrants regardless of whether the \nUnited States-Mexico border is ever secured. In other words, it is \nanother promise Congress is making to the American people, but the \nAmerican people have no way of knowing whether that promise will ever \nbe kept.\n  As further indication that truly what I am trying to do in my \namendment is consistent with what the Gang of 8 has proposed, here is a \nquote from the majority whip, Senator Durbin from Illinois, in January \nof 2013. He said their bipartisan framework for comprehensive \nimmigration reform--in that bill--a pathway to citizenship needs to be \n``contingent upon securing the border.''\n  But yesterday, as reported in the National Journal on June 11, \nSenator Durbin said the gang has ``de-linked the pathway to citizenship \nand border enforcement.''\n  What my amendment does is restore this contingency which, if the \ngang's own standards are met--and I believe they will be--will allow \npeople to transition from RPI status--registered provisional immigrant \nstatus--to legal permanent residency if they comply with the other \nrequirements of the law.\n  My amendment would delay permanent legal status until after we have \nthat 100-percent situational awareness along the border and full \noperational control and nationwide E-Verify and a national biometric \nentry-exit system at all airports and seaports where Customs and Border \nProtection are currently deployed.\n  Some have said my amendment and the standards in my amendment are \nunattainable or some say it is just too expensive. Let me answer both \nof those criticisms. If the standards the Gang of 8 has set itself for \nsituational awareness and operational security are unattainable, then \nwhy did they embrace those standards in their own bill? Again, the only \ndifference between my amendment and their initial proposal is that my \namendment creates a trigger or a contingency requiring that standard to \nbe met before immigrants who qualify for registered provisional \nimmigrant status can transition into a legal permanent residency \nstatus.\n  It has also been claimed by some of our colleagues, who interestingly \nwere speaking without having actually seen language in the bill, that \nsomehow the cost of my amendment is just too high. The fact is this \nbill appropriates $8.3 billion to pay into a trust fund that is created \nby the underlying legislation. On page 872 of the bill, it is called \nthe comprehensive immigration reform trust fund. The initial funding is \n$8.3 billion.\n\n  If my colleagues will simply read the legislation in my proposal, my \namendment, the funding for my amendment comes from that same trust fund \nand does not appropriate any other additional funds. So I am satisfied \nby merely reallocating those funds in a way that I believe will help \nthe Department of Homeland Security, help Congress, help the U.S. \nGovernment make sure we keep our promises to the American people.\n  Well, you do not need to take my word for it. The Washington Post \nrecently asked a number of immigration experts whether the goals set \nout in the Gang of 8 bill and in my amendment are, in fact, attainable. \nOne of them, Asa Hutchinson--a name that is\n\n[[Page S4384]]\n\nfamiliar to many of us because he has served as a Member of Congress, a \nmember of the Drug Enforcement Administration, and as Under Secretary \nfor Border and Transportation Security at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity--told the Washington Post that the border security \nrequirements in my amendment are both ``reasonable and attainable.'' In \nfact, Hutchinson said my amendment ``only requires security measures \nthat are attainable in the near future.''\n  Another expert, Cato Institute scholar Alex Nowrasteh, who is a \nstrong supporter of the underlying Gang of 8 bill, said my amendment is \n``very much in the vein of the rest of the bill.'' He also affirmed \nthat it would be, indeed, possible for the Federal Government to attain \nthat 90 percent apprehension rate along the southern border.\n  As for the biometric entry-exit system and the E-Verify requirements, \nif a nationwide biometric entry-exit system at our airports and \nseaports is unrealistic, then somebody should have told President \nClinton in 1996 when he signed such a requirement into law.\n  That is really the problem that my amendment is designed to solve. It \nhas been the law of the land that Congress and the Federal Government \nimplement a biometric entry-exit system for people entering our country \nand leaving our country since 1996, but do you know what. It has never \nbeen done.\n  After the tragedy of 9/11 where 3,000 Americans lost their lives on \nthat terrible day, the 9/11 Commission itself undertook a comprehensive \nstudy of how to stop such a terrible tragedy from occurring again. What \nthey recommended, again, is a biometric entry-exit system. But while \nthe biometric entry system is in place--it is just fingerprints on a \nfingerprint reader; pretty quick, easy technology, relatively cheap--\nthere has been no implementation at the airports and seaports of an \nexit system, which would tell us when people have entered legally but \nthen have illegally overstayed their visa, which is 40 percent of \nillegal immigration.\n  I would just close on this: On the E-Verify component--this, of \ncourse, is the employment verification system--if that is unrealistic, \nthan somebody should have told our friends on the Gang of 8 because the \nE-Verify language in their bill is identical with my amendment.\n  But here is the bottom line and the reality: Without a border \nsecurity trigger, immigration reform will be dead on arrival in the \nHouse of Representatives. My amendment provides such a trigger. The \nGang of 8 bill does not. That does not mean my amendment is a full-\nscale alternative to the Gang of 8 bill. But it does mean my amendment \nis essential to moving this legislation forward and to getting an \noutcome that ultimately will end up on the President's desk.\n  I believe we should try to do our best to improve this underlying \nbill. My amendment is in that spirit because I do believe that the \nstatus quo is simply unacceptable, as I believe almost virtually all of \nour colleagues do. If we do not guarantee results on border security, \nparticularly at a time when skepticism about Washington is at an all-\ntime high, we guarantee the failure of bipartisan immigration reform, \nand that would be a tragedy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, thank you, and I thank my colleague from \nTexas for his specifics there, and I know he is trying to make the bill \na better bill. I have to say, as I understand it, this is the very same \namendment that was defeated in committee. It was defeated by a \nbipartisan vote of 12 to 6. It was defeated for two reasons.\n  Let me take a step back. The two reasons are, one, its cost goes \nthrough the roof, and there is no way to pay for it in the Cornyn \namendment. It is estimated it could be, in the original amendment, as \nmuch as $25 billion. Now, maybe the number of border agents was \nreduced. I do not know if my colleague has done that, but that is a \nhuge expense, and an unnecessary expense because our bill, the proposal \nthat is before us, does a huge amount on border security for much lower \ncost. Mr. President, $25 billion is a lot of money.\n  Second, we do have triggers in our bill, but they are achievable and \nspecific because this bill is a careful compromise. We want to do two \nthings. We want to have border security, absolutely. I have always said \na watch word of this bill is that the American people will be fair and \nhave a commonsense approach to both future legal immigration and the 11 \nmillion who are living here in the shadows provided, and only provided, \nwe prevent future waves of illegal immigration.\n  We do that in three ways. One is the E-Verify system. We both agree \nthat should be in place before there is a path to citizenship. One is \nfixing up exit-entry. The way my colleague has fixed up exit-entry, it \ncould take 20 or 25 years before it is in place. We cannot, should not, \nand will not tell those who have waited in the shadows for so long that \nthey should wait for 25 years. Those are the estimates. We can do this \non the ports and in the air, but we need a better system, which we have \nworked on, for land entry.\n  Finally, at the border itself, we have put a large amount of money in \nthere. We have been guided by Senators McCain and Flake--because the \nArizona border has more people passing through it than any other--as to \nwhat we should do.\n  We emphasized the ability to put in new technologies--drones that can \ntrack everybody who crosses the border and track them on land. We do it \nfor a lot less money. But, unfortunately, one of the triggers that my \ncolleague, my good friend from Texas, has put in place would make a \npath to citizenship--even if all the other metrics were put in place--\niffy, possibly yes, possibly no. That is unacceptable. We need to do \nboth.\n  Should there be a new person who comes into office, should there be a \ndifferent Senate, a different House, under the proposal of my colleague \nfrom Texas, not one single person could achieve citizenship, even if we \nhad improved the border in many different ways.\n  So I would say to my colleagues, we certainly want to improve the \nborder, but we cannot improve that border and put in place triggers \nthat are not specific and achievable. We can measure whether there are \n20 drones at the border. We can measure whether we have X miles of \nfence. But if we say, then, that it has to be at this certain rate \nevery year, we are taking away that path to citizenship, through no \nfault of those who have tried to implement tougher border security.\n  So I say to my colleague, we cannot accept his amendment, plain and \nsimple. We welcome proposals on border security. I know there are many \non the other side. I have spoken to four or five who are working on \nthose proposals, but the very same amendment, the very same proposal \nthat was defeated in committee by a bipartisan vote of 12 to 6 is not \ngoing to revitalize an immigration bill, which has plenty of life \nalready. It is not going to strengthen a bill. It could indeed kill it.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. So I would urge that we go back to the drawing boards. \nIf the Senator from Texas has a different proposal, obviously, I would \nlook at it. This one is, unfortunately, one that we have tried, \nrejected, and will not lead to either comprehensive immigration reform \nin the broader sense or a path to citizenship in the most immediate \nsense.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to allow a colloquy between the \ntwo Senators--questions or otherwise--but I have a consent request that \nSenator Grassley and I have been waiting to do for some time. So when \nwe complete our work, I would hope the two Senators would engage in \nwhatever conversation they want. I have also been told that perhaps \nSenator Leahy, the manager of this bill, may want to say something.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \namendments be in order to be called up before the Senate: Thune No. \n1197, Vitter No. 1228, Landrieu No. 1222, and Tester No. 1198; that the \ntime until 4:30 p.m. be equally divided between the two managers or \ntheir designees for debate on these amendments and the Grassley \namendment No. 1195; that at 4:30 p.m.\n\n[[Page S4385]]\n\nthe Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Grassley amendment; that \nupon disposition of the Grassley amendment, the Senate proceed to vote \non the four amendments in this agreement in the order listed; that \nthere be no second-degree amendments in order prior to the votes; that \nall five amendments be subject to a 60-affirmative vote threshold; that \nthere be 2 minutes equally divided in between the votes, and all after \nthe first vote be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to this request?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I object.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding----\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. My friend has a consent request I understand he wants \nto propose.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the pending Grassley \namendment be set aside and the following amendments be in order to be \ncalled up: Thune No. 1197, Vitter No. 1228, Landrieu No. 1222, and \nTester No. 1198; that the time until 4 p.m. be equally divided between \nthe managers or their designees for debate in relation to the pending \nGrassley amendment No. 1195 and the pending Leahy amendment No. 1183; \nfurther, I ask that at 4 p.m. the Senate proceed to vote in relation to \nthe Grassley amendment; that upon disposition of the Grassley \namendment, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Leahy \namendment; that there be no second-degree amendments in order prior to \nthe votes; that there be 2 minutes equally divided in between the \nvotes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am somewhat \nsurprised at this request. How many times have we heard the Republican \nleader say on this floor and publicly that the new reality in the \nSenate is 60? So I just thought I was following the direction of the \nRepublican leader. This is what he said. That is why we are having 60 \nvotes on virtually everything. And with this bill--with this bill--no \none can in any way suggest this bill is not important and these \namendments are not important.\n  So I care a great deal about my friend, the ranking member of this \ncommittee, but I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to both requests.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nevada yield to me?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Will the Senator yield to me?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, it is amazing to me that the majority has touted \nthis immigration bill process as one that is open and regular order. \nBut right out of the box, right now, just on the third day, they want \nto subject our amendments to a filibuster-like 60-vote threshold. So I \nhave to ask, who is obstructing now?\n  There is no reason, particularly in this first week at the beginning \nof the process, to be blocking our amendments with a 60-vote margin as \nrequired when you suppose there is a filibuster.\n  Let's at least start out with regular order; otherwise, it really \nlooks as if the fix is in and the bill is rigged to pass basically as \nit is.\n  Bottom line: You should have seen how the 18 members of the Judiciary \nCommittee operated for 5 or 6 days over a 2-week period of time. \nEverything was open. Everything was transparent. There was complete \ncooperation between the majority and the minority. There is no reason \nwe cannot do that out here in the Senate right now, particularly at the \nbeginning. This is a very provocative act.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, a provocative act? If my friend is so \ninterested in regular order, why have we waited 3 months to go to \nconference on the budget? On the budget. That is regular order. Now, \nsuddenly, when it works to their advantage, I guess, they want to do \naway with the McConnell rule. What is the McConnell rule? Sixty votes \non everything.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield on that point, I \nwas privileged in my capacity as President pro tempore to speak to the \ngraduating class of pages, the group of pages who graduated just ahead \nof the distinguished group we have here now. There had been discussion \nabout immigration coming up. Then the distinguished Republican leader \nspoke and went on at great length to the pages about how these \nimportant issues must have 60 votes on everything, must have 60 votes \non amendments and so forth. I am sure the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky would confirm that is what he said. There were 100-and-some-\nodd people in the room who heard him say it. And here we have offered--\nthe distinguished majority leader has offered to have three Republican \nvotes and two votes by Democratic Senators, all under exactly the same \nrule, the rule Senator McConnell proposed.\n  We have talked and given great speeches that we have all given time \nand time again both in the committee and on the floor. I would like to \nhave votes on something so we can finish this because, frankly, given \nmy choice of spending the Fourth of July week in Washington--salubrious \nas the weather is--or being in Vermont for the Fourth of July, I would \nmuch rather be in Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I still have the floor. I am sorry we have \nhad this disagreement, but I would say to everybody that there are \nother ways of having simple-majority votes. If there is an objection to \nthis, we will have to go to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would note that Senator Grassley just offered in a \nfew minutes to commence voting on two amendments in the normal way we \nproceed. I think that was a very reasonable request. We have to be \ncareful. These amendments represent important changes to a historic \npiece of legislation. We cannot just throw up a bunch of amendments \nhere at the beginning, when people have not had time to digest them. So \nI think that as we proceed, we are going to need to be sure that it is \nnot some situation where people are bringing up an amendment and it has \nto be voted on an hour or so later. People have not had time to fully \ndigest it. I think the offer by Senator Grassley is very reasonable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, while the Senator from New York is still \nhere, I would like to respond briefly and in a nonconfrontational way. \nBut I would hope that on something as important as this, we are all \noperating from the same facts and not based on erroneous information or \nerroneous assumptions.\n  First of all, my understanding is the Congressional Budget Office has \nnot scored the underlying bill. As I said earlier, on page 872 of this \nbill, a comprehensive immigration reform trust fund is created, and \n$8.3 billion is transferred into that trust fund. My amendment uses the \nsame money the underlying bill does to fund the requirements of my \namendment.\n  This notion that somehow having a biometric entry-exit system costs \n$25 billion is completely detached from any factual information I am \naware of. My staff informs me, based on our best estimate, that a \nbiometric entry-exit system at airports and at seaports would cost \nroughly $80 million a year. We are more than happy to share that \ninformation with our colleagues and have them take a look at it.\n  Further, I know there has been an assumption that somehow there has \nbeen a figure of 10,000 new Border Patrol agents mandated in my \namendment. That is an incorrect reading of it. The underlying bill \ncalls for 3,500. We plus that up, we do, by not only Border Patrol but \nalso customs and border agents to help facilitate the flow of legal \ncommerce across Arizona, Texas borders, and elsewhere, which creates \nabout 6 million jobs in America.\n  So I do not mind us having a disagreement about policy. We are used \nto that. That is fine. I think some of these claims about extravagant \nexpenses are not borne out by the facts. We would actually rely upon \nthe same money that the trust fund created by the underlying bill does.\n  I would yield to my friend from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would ask my friend from Texas, if you are adding \nadditional either Border Patrol or Customs agents in addition to what \nis already in the underlying bill, where does your money come from? We \nare talking about personnel costs that are incredibly expensive. So I \nwould ask him\n\n[[Page S4386]]\n\nwhere the money comes from if there is not additional cost. He would \nhave to take it from someplace else.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If I can respond to my friend, it comes from the same \ntrust fund the underlying bill uses. It reallocates the money and does \nput some more money toward personnel. One of the problems is that there \nis so much that technology can do. I am exited about the prospects of \ntechnology when it comes to 100-percent situational awareness and \nallowing the Border Patrol to do a good job. But you have to have \nborder patrol who show up and detain people when they come across \nillegally. My State has the longest border with Mexico--1,200 miles. \nArizona has its own challenges. We have our challenges as well. So we \ndo need more personnel.\n  But the part that I would think is sort of baked into the underlying \nbill is that we also need to separate the legal commerce and tourism \nthat is beneficial to both sides of the border. That is part of why the \nCustoms agents who are included in my amendment are also there as well, \nthe theory being--I think it is a good one--if you identify legitimate \ncommerce and beneficial tourism and separate that from the bad guys, \nthen law enforcement can focus more on the bad guys. That is what my \namendment attempts to do. It is no additional money.\n  Mr. McCAIN. You are adding personnel into your version of the bill. \nThe money has to come from somewhere. Where is it coming from? You are \nsaying it is ``reallocated.'' From where is it reallocated?\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. It comes in the same trust fund that is created on page \n872 of the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. There is a finite amount of money that is authorized. If \nthe Senator takes money from one and adds money one place, it has to \ncome from someplace else. That is simply first grade mathematics. I \nthink it is incredible that the Senator should stand there and say: \nYeah, we are adding these thousands of personnel, but there is no \nadditional cost. That is not possible.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If I can explain to the Senator from Arizona, this is the \ntrust fund created by the underlying bill on page 872.\n  Mr. McCAIN. With a finite amount of money in it.\n  Mr. CORNYN. It is $8.3 billion. They allocate some of that money for \nthe purposes set out in the underlying bill. My amendment reallocates \nsome of that same trust fund for other purposes, including additional \npersonnel. There is no additional money. This is an appropriation made \nin the underlying bill. So I think it is a misunderstanding of what my \namendment is.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. How many extra personnel does he ask for in his \namendment?\n  Mr. CORNYN. The underlying bill calls for 3,500. We ask for a plus-up \nof another 6,500.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is quite arguable that the entire \ntrust fund is used up by those 6,500. That would mean no drones. That \nwould mean no helicopters. That would mean none of the other things. It \nmay mean no fencing that we add to the border. So my colleague from \nArizona is exactly correct.\n  The cost here--my good friend from his side of the aisle, Senator \nGraham, estimated this morning that the total cost would be $18 \nbillion. I think if you add a type of land-based exit-entry, it goes up \nanother $7, $8 billion. We do not have that kind of money.\n  So I would suggest to my colleague that if he wants to add 10,000 \nBorder Patrol--which most experts have told us will not do close to as \ngood a job as the drones and the helicopters and the more mobile \nassets. And the reason is very simple. He knows as well as I do. He \nknows the border better than I do. We do not have roads on most of the \nborder. What is Border Patrol going to do? There are no roads. They are \nimpassable. A drone flying 10,000 feet above can see every person who \ncrosses the border, track them inland, and if they go to a gathering \npoint 25 miles inland, they pick them up there.\n  So the bottom line is that not only is the cost of this amendment \nprobably exceeding the trust fund by itself, but it will take a highly \nefficient way of preventing people from crossing the border and replace \nit with an inefficient way that no experts I have talked to--again, \nmaybe my colleague has--no expert I have talked to says the best way to \ncontrol people from crossing the border illegally--which I desperately \nwant to do--works better with a huge amount of personnel, unallocated. \nWe do not even know--if I ask my colleague where they are going to be \nassigned, which sector, where they are going to work, I bet there is no \nanswer to that.\n  The bottom line is very simple. We have carefully thought this \nthrough. We think we have maximized the effectiveness for about one-\nthird of the money our colleague is talking about. It is only one of \nmany reasons this amendment was defeated by a bipartisan group, a \nmajority in committee.\n  So let's move on. Let's move on. Let's look at how we can make the \nborder more secure. I am open to that. But this amendment, as I said, \nfor a variety of reasons is a nonstarter.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, what is this--the third day this bill has \nbeen on the floor? There has been no scoring of the bill by the \nCongressional Budget Office, so no one knows what the official \nscorekeeper of the Congress has to say about this bill. But I would say \nthat my amendment does not appropriate any additional money other than \nthe money in the bill. Indeed, this leaves it up to the Department of \nHomeland Security within 120 days to render a plan, and then under the \nunderlying bill, you can transition after 10 years from RPI status--\nregistered provisional immigrant--to legal permanent resident by \nsubstantial completion of a plan we do not know anything about.\n  I mean, I do not think we are the experts in how exactly this should \nbe done. I would hope that technology, which I think is fantastic--what \nanswers that may provide to us 10 years hence in terms of how to \naccomplish the goals. But to suggest that somehow this legislation, \nwhich I have complimented on numerous occasions that it represents a \nsubstantial step in the right direction--to say that we cannot touch \nit, we cannot change it because eight Senators got together and decided \nwhat it should be, is preposterous. That is exactly what we are \nsupposed to do. We ought to have a regular process to debate it and \nvote on it. But we should not be sort of suggesting ``been there, done \nthat; you had your shot in committee'' and then not allow this process \nto move forward.\n  I do not think we are all that far apart if we will stick to the \nfacts and stick to the text of the bill. But we should not make things \nup, particularly on the order of $25 billion. I do not know where that \ncame from. I know there was a suggestion that my amendment called for \n10,000 new Border Patrol agents. That is not in the bill. So let's \nstick to the facts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would just say this: No, 1, this amendment--we are \nonly on the third day of the bill. I have said over and over that I \nwelcome suggestions on how to improve the bill. No one says the bill by \nthe Gang of 8 is exactly right. In fact, as Senator Leahy well knows--\nour chairman of the Judiciary Committee--we accepted a large number of \namendments, many of which came from the other side, in committee. We \nwill do the same thing here. But this particular amendment is not 3 \ndays old.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield? Is it not true that whether or \nnot it has been scored by CBO, the legislation calls for the \nexpenditure of certain amounts of money--in other words, about $6.2 \nbillion, I believe? So if it calls for the expenditure of a certain \namount of money and it designates what that money is for, and if you \nare going to add thousands of Border Patrol agents onto it, then it \nseems logical that is going to cost more money.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It is hard to refute the logic of my friend from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I finish my question? Is it not true that we have \nsaid: Look, we welcome any suggestion to improve the bill.\n  I would say respectfully to my friend from Texas it is not true that \nthis is written in golden tablets. In fact, the Senator from Ohio, who \nis coming here, is going to have some suggestions for improvements on \nthe exit-entry visa, which I think will make the bill much better.\n\n[[Page S4387]]\n\n  Isn't it true that somehow to allege that we said there could be no \nchanges is patently false?\n  Third, isn't it true this amendment would break the agreement that \nwas a hard-fought agreement? We are willing to compromise and make \nagreements in certain areas but not to a bill that billions and \nbillions of dollars are added to, especially in the area of personnel, \nwhen we have gone from 4,000 members of the Border Patrol several years \nago to 21,000. We are adding National Guard to the border.\n  Personnel is not the challenge, whether it be the Texas border or the \nArizona border, what the challenge is, is to use the technology that is \nexisting so we can surveil and intercept. That is what this bill is all \nabout; is that true?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for those questions, and they are \nall pretty obvious.\n  No. 1, we have costed this out. CBO will judge whether we are \ncorrect. We have made the bill revenue neutral. In fact, we have a \nslight surplus. The huge cost of 6,500 border agents without any \nallocation where they would go--do you know what. If this were another \nbill, my colleague from Texas and all of his colleagues would say we \nare wasting billions of dollars with no plan. He is exactly right on \nthat point.\n  On the second point, I have said, until I am blue in the face, \nsometimes from some criticism from some of the people who are my allies \nout there, that I am willing to look at changes in this bill. It is so \nunfair and patently false to say any one of the Group of 8 said we \ncan't change the bill. We welcome changes to improve it. What happened \nin committee proves that.\n  The third point, I would say to my colleague, the way the Senator \nfrom Texas constructs the trigger, there will be no one who will ever \nachieve a path to citizenship because he leaves out turnbacks. If we \ndon't have turnbacks--the 90 percent causes us trouble even with the \nway it was done in other areas, with other suggestions. If we leave out \nturnbacks, people who are turned back or caught, and we say go home, we \nwill never get to 90 percent.\n  To say the proposal of the Senator from Texas allows a path to \ncitizenship--it makes it virtually impossible. Therefore, again, I \nwould say I wish to improve border security. I am open to suggestions. \nI wish to improve this bill in every area. I know my colleague from \nArizona, my colleague from Colorado, my colleague from Illinois, the \nrest of us welcome that, and we have shown it time and time again.\n  This amendment, I don't think, advances moving the bill forward. It \ndoesn't work on border security because of its expense, its lack of \nspecificity, and it is taking away the very technology we need. It \ndoesn't create a path to citizenship in any way. It doesn't allow one.\n  Finally, its cost is through the roof. Whatever CBO says, 6,500 new \nborder agents is a multibillion-dollar proposition, unpaid for. I know \nmy colleagues on the other side rue the day when we vote for unpaid-for \nobligations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. There has been some discussion about whether this might be \na closed thing, and the eight Senators came together on this and did a \ntremendous job. There were four Democrats and four Republicans putting \nit together. They were saying it was closed. Isn't it true that when \nthe bill came to the Judiciary Committee, isn't it true there were 301 \namendments filed in the committee?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is exactly the right number, as I recall.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Isn't it true that 136 of those amendments were then \nadopted?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. My count is exactly the same.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Forty-nine of those amendments were proposed by \nRepublicans; is that not correct?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. We are so proud of that fact, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Isn't it possible to say that of the eight Senators we \nhave talked about, four of them, two Democrats and two Republicans, \nserve on the Judiciary Committee? They were helpful in voting for most \nof these changes that were changes to the original; is that not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I agree. That is the right count. There were four of us \nthere, and we did just as the chairman said.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York controls the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. To finish putting my question to the Senator from New \nYork, I wish to make sure, because I thought I heard some comment that \nthis was a closed process, and I appreciate that the Senator from New \nYork agreed it was anything but.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I be recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Ohio is working on E-Verify. I think he \nhas come up with some very good ideas on how we can improve a vital \npart of the bill; that is, verification of someone who applies for a \njob. That is the magnet that draws people across the border.\n  Again, we look forward to those kinds of improvements and many other \nsuggestions that have been made.\n  How you can manufacture 3,500 new personnel and say it doesn't add to \nthe cost and it will be reallocated, I want to know where it has been \nreallocated from.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague, and I agree with the sentiments.\n  I reiterate one final point. The Cornyn amendment, as proposed, asks \nfor a 90-percent success rate in terms of effectiveness on the border, \nbut it eliminates the turnback part of it.\n  That would mean now that it would be virtually impossible to get to \nthat 90 percent 1 year from now, 5 years from now, 10 years from now, \nbecause one of the most effective things we do on the border is turn \npeople back. We don't catch them after they cross the border. They get \nup to the border, we find them when they get to the border and say go \nhome.\n  It fails on both counts. It has been debated. It has been studied.\n  I would plead with my colleagues who want more border security: Let's \nmove on.\n  The Senator from Utah has amendments on taxes and on benefits. The \nSenator from Ohio has amendments on E-Verify. Many of my colleagues \nhave amendments on many other issues. We are open to debate and \ndiscussion on the core principles that the eight of us agreed to. That \nis an agreement among the eight of us, and the rest of you can disagree \nwith that--we think most of you will agree with those core principles. \nSo be it. Aside from the basic core of the bill, we welcome changes, \nsuggestions, and improvements. We look forward to a healthy debate.\n  To bring up an amendment that has been rejected and basically turns \nthings on its head, because there will be no path to citizenship for \nanybody, and because you are just sort of, if you will, with all due \nrespect, throwing money at a problem without specificity as to where \nthe money goes, that doesn't move the debate forward.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I hope the Senator from New York understands what the \nChief of the Border Patrol said on this issue of 90 percent \neffectiveness. We are going to hear this over and over.\n  In a hearing on February 26, 2013, at a House Homeland Security \nCommittee hearing, the Chief of the Border Patrol--not the Secretary of \nHomeland Security--said:\n\n       First of all, 90 percent wouldn't really make sense \n     everywhere. . . . We put 90 percent as a goal because there \n     are sections along the border where we have not only \n     achieved, we've been able to sustain 90 percent \n     effectiveness. So it's a realistic goal but I wouldn't \n     necessarily and just arbitrarily say 90 percent is across the \n     board because there are other locations where there is a lot \n     less activity and there won't be a lot of activity because of \n     terrain features, for instance.\n       So where it makes sense we want to go ahead and start \n     parsing that out within those corridors and within those \n     specific sectors.\n\n  That is why we think that what we came up with in this legislation is \neffective control, 100 percent surveillance, and the use of technology, \nwhich\n\n[[Page S4388]]\n\nI am confident will give us a border that all Americans can be happy \nwith. No border is ever going to be sealed. Anybody who stands in this \nbody and says if you want to hire 10,000, 20,000 or 50,000 more Border \nPatrol agents, you still aren't going to secure the border completely.\n  We can have effective control of that border, we can have 100 percent \nsurveillance, and we can get the border to the point where American \npeople can have confidence in it while we move forward with the rest of \nthe legislation.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague.\n  Reclaiming the floor for a brief minute, I know my colleague from \nUtah has been offered time to speak on his proposal, so I don't want to \ntake too much more time.\n  I wish to say once again that we welcome suggestions. The Senator \nfrom Arizona is right. We carefully looked at the border. This wasn't \nfly-by-night. Every one of us, certainly not only myself, wants to see \nthat border as secure as possible.\n  It so happens that 6,500 more Border Patrol agents, if you asked the \nexperts, they wouldn't know what to do with them. Large sections of the \nborder have no roads, have no way to station Border Patrol agents \nthere; whereas, helicopters, drones, and mobile forces work.\n  It was my colleague from Arizona who actually taught me that on a \ntrip to the border. He used his military expertise to help us figure \nout the most effective way to seal the border effectively.\n  When I hear of the amendment from my colleague from Texas, I don't \nget what the logic is behind it, frankly. I certainly don't get the \nlogic on his trigger.\n  It is fair if we want to make sure the border is secure, but if we \nuse triggers--as some might, and I am not saying that my colleague from \nTexas intended that--but if triggers become a way to avoid a path to \ncitizenship--without saying directly I want to avoid a path to \ncitizenship because I don't want to vote for it--that is not going to \nwork and we will not move forward.\n  This Nation desperately needs us to move forward as Democrats and \nRepublicans together. Let's continue the bipartisan spirit we have had. \nLet us move forward together to make this bill better, make our country \nproud of us, and keep America the leading power economically and every \nother way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. May I ask unanimous consent to ask that the Senator from \nOhio, without losing my right to the floor, if he has something he \nwanted to do--I didn't mean to jump in front of him, but I was told I \ncould appear here at 4 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. The ranking member of the Finance Committee, member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, I was told I could speak even before that, but \nthen the majority leader came out to the floor to do some important \nbusiness, and I was put back. I have about 5 or 10 minutes in which I \nwould like to talk about E-Verify, as indicated earlier, and border \nsecurity.\n  I would defer to my colleague as long as my other colleagues would \nallow me to speak after that.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my friend from Ohio. I am happy to proceed. I \nappreciate that.\n  I would ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Ohio may speak \nand give his remarks immediately following mine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to take some time today to talk \nabout immigration before us, its flaws, and what needs to be done to \nfix it.\n  I first wish to note that I voted in favor of reporting this \nlegislation out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I worked in good \nfaith with my colleagues to secure the inclusion of provisions \naddressing things such as high-skilled immigration and a new \nagricultural visa program. Indeed, throughout the Judiciary Committee \nprocess, I was a willing negotiator on many important issues \nsurrounding this bill. In general, I am in favor of immigration reform, \nand I wish to see this bill succeed.\n  I also wish to commend my colleagues for their work on this \nlegislation so far. Up to now, I think that process has been fair. It \nhas been transparent, and, I believe, bipartisan. I hope that will \ncontinue now that the bill is on the floor.\n  It is important we continue to work on a bipartisan basis because the \nbill is far from perfect. One can't look at it without knowing that. In \nmy view, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed before \nthis legislation is ready for final passage.\n  During the Judiciary Committee's consideration of S. 744, I \nintroduced four amendments on issues that fall under the jurisdiction \nof the Senate Finance Committee. At that time I stated that my \ncontinued support for the bill is contingent on whether those issues \nwere addressed before final passage. Today I will file similar \namendments here on the floor, with the hope I can work with my \ncolleagues to address these concerns.\n\n  I want to say upfront that, despite what will likely be several \nclaims to the contrary, these are not poison pill amendments. I have no \ndesire to weaken the bill or to threaten its prospects for final \npassage. Indeed, I think my four amendments will make it easier to pass \nthe bill with strong bipartisan support, not only here but in the \nHouse.\n  Senator Rubio, a member of the Gang of 8, is a cosponsor on these \namendments. I appreciate his willingness to work with me on these \nimportant issues. He has been the one singular person, in my opinion, \nwho has had an open mind and has been willing to work on these issues \nwith both sides. He deserves a lot of credit for this bill, but he \nknows it is not perfect, he knows it is not there yet. I know he wants \nto do the right thing. I can only hope other proponents of this \nlegislation will be willing to do the same.\n  Each of my amendments is designed to ensure illegal immigrants \napplying for a change in status are not awarded special privileges and \nbenefits under the law. I don't want to punish these immigrants, I \nsimply want to make sure they are treated no better or worse than U.S. \ncitizens and resident aliens with respect to Federal benefits and \ntaxes.\n  Let me take a few minutes to describe each of my amendments.\n  My first amendment is designed to ensure compliance with Federal \nwelfare and public benefits law. As we all know, last July, during the \nheight of the Presidential campaign, the Department of Health and Human \nServices issued an information memo to States allowing them to waive \nFederal welfare work requirements. We now know that HHS attorneys have \nconcluded the HHS Secretary has the authority to waive almost any \nprohibitions on Federal welfare spending that exist under current law--\ncertainly a false interpretation.\n  Under a longstanding provision of Federal welfare law, noncitizens \nare banned from receiving cash welfare assistance for their first 5 \nyears in this country. Under S. 744, that 5-year ban is extended to \nregistered provisional immigrants, or RPIs, and blue card holders. \nHowever, under current interpretations of the law by HHS, the \nDepartment could choose at any time to ignore this restriction and \noffer welfare benefits to these groups of noncitizens. My amendment \nwould simply clarify the law to make clear the Obama administration \ndoes not have the authority to allow States to waive these longstanding \nrestrictions and ensures welfare benefits are not offered to \nnoncitizens as a result of this bill.\n  As I stated, this is not punitive. This is not designed to punish any \nillegal immigrant seeking a change in status. It is, instead, designed \nto preserve the balance that exists under current welfare law.\n  Some critics of the underlying bill have claimed it will allow \nillegal immigrants to receive welfare benefits, and when you couple the \nbill with HHS's recently claimed waiver authority, these critics \nactually have a point. My amendment would protect the bill from this \ntype of criticism. That is a step in the right direction. I think it \nwill bring people onto the bill.\n  Let me make one thing clear: No one who is currently eligible to \nreceive welfare benefits will be denied them as a result of this \namendment. Instead,\n\n[[Page S4389]]\n\nthis amendment does something we should have done long ago, which is to \nassert the prerogatives of the Congress in the face of executive \noverreach. There is no question that with its information memo \npermitting States to waive Federal welfare work requirements the Obama \nadministration overstepped its statutory authority. We now know \nofficials in the administration were working through ways to circumvent \nkey features of welfare reform for years, including how and on whom \nFederal welfare dollars can be spent. So we know they believe they can \nallow States to spend Federal welfare dollars on noncitizens, and I \ndon't think it is far-fetched to conclude that at some point they will \nallow States to spend Federal welfare dollars on noncitizens.\n  Congress needs to act to prevent this and future administrations from \nengaging in this type of overreach. That is the purpose of my \namendment.\n  My second amendment would apply a 5-year waiting period for \nimmigrants to become eligible for tax credits and cost-sharing \nsubsidies under the Affordable Care Act--or the so-called Affordable \nCare Act. Under current Federal law, most lawful permanent residents or \ngreen card holders must wait 5 years before they are eligible for most \nmeans-tested benefits, including Medicaid and TANF--the Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families. However, the bill does not apply this 5-\nyear waiting period to the premium credits and subsidies offered under \nthe Affordable Care Act.\n  True enough, the bill does not allow RPIs and blue card holders to \naccess these benefits. But once they become lawful permanent residents, \nthey can access them immediately. This is a serious oversight that \nessentially creates a carve-out for the Affordable Care Act and a huge \nexpense to this government. My amendment would correct this oversight \nand put the Affordable Care Act subsidies in the same class as other \nFederal benefits.\n  This is only fair. After all, even those who were U.S. citizens at \nthe time the health law was passed have had to wait nearly 5 years for \nthe law to go into effect so they could access these credits and \nsubsidies. Those who would, under this bill, be placed on a path to \ncitizenship should be required to do the same.\n  The amendment also prevents nonimmigrants who are not on any path to \ncitizenship from accessing these benefits. My gosh, anybody in this \nbody should want that. Under the bill, a ban on Affordable Care Act \nbenefits is applied only to RPIs and blue card holders but not to \nnonimmigrants. My amendment would extend the ban to nonimmigrants.\n  Let me repeat that. Under the bill, a ban on Affordable Care Act \nbenefits is applied to only RPIs and blue card holders but not to \nnonimmigrants. My amendment would extend the ban to nonimmigrants.\n  Once again, my goal with this amendment is not to punish any \nimmigrant applicants or deny them benefits they might be entitled to \nunder the law. I simply want to ensure we are not creating a new class \nof people with special access to Federal benefits. We can prevent that \nby imposing the same waiting period on Affordable Care Act subsidies we \nplace on other federally means-tested benefits.\n  My third amendment would help to preserve the Social Security system. \nUnder current law, for a worker to be eligible for Social Security \nbenefits they must be classified as ``fully insured'' or ``permanently \ninsured.'' To be become insured, a worker accrues quarters of coverage \nduring the years they work in the United States. S. 744 is unclear as \nto whether it would allow an illegal immigrant who obtains a change in \nstatus to claim years of unauthorized employment to determine their \neligibility for Social Security benefits.\n  Indeed, this bill is entirely silent on this matter. Once again, this \nis a glaring oversight in the legislation that needs to be rectified in \norder to preserve the integrity of the Social Security system. My \namendment makes it clear no periods of unauthorized employment can be \ncounted in an employee's quarters of coverage and, thus, they cannot be \nused to determine eligibility for Social Security.\n  This is not a matter that can be simply overlooked. If someone was \nnot authorized to work in this country but made the calculated decision \nto work anyway, using a made-up or stolen Social Security number or if \nsomeone overstayed their visa and worked anyway, they should not have \nbeen working and paying into the Social Security system. Consequently, \nthey are ineligible for benefits until they become citizens.\n  Once again, there is nothing punitive involved with this amendment. \nIt only ensures we do not reward past unlawful activities. Once they \nare lawful, under this bill, they can participate but not for past \nunlawful activities. That is like rewarding people for doing wrong and \ndisobeying our laws and ignoring the obligations that come with living \nin the United States of America. And it is a punch in the face to every \nlaw-abiding citizen who has been making these payments. The amendment \nprovides the fairest and most workable path forward.\n  My fourth and final amendment is the one that has garnered the most \nattention, as it should, in some ways. I think all three of these \namendments have been very important and will be very important in this \ndebate, and I am certainly hoping my colleagues on the other side will \nrecognize that and help to pass them. But this fourth amendment would \nmodify provisions in the bill relating to back taxes to include all \nincome and employment taxes owed by immigrant applicants.\n  For the past few months, proponents of this legislation, including \nmembers of the so-called Gang of 8, have been claiming that, as a \ncondition of being put on a path to citizenship, illegal immigrants \nwill be required to pay back taxes. This claim was repeated in the \nHalls of Congress, on Sunday morning talk shows, and in casual \nconversation. This was a promise made as a chief response to arguments \nthe bill would provide amnesty for illegal immigrants. However, under \nthe current draft of the legislation, this promise goes largely \nunfulfilled.\n  The bill currently states illegal immigrants cannot apply for a \nchange in status unless they have ``satisfied any applicable Federal \ntax liability.'' While that is all well and good, under this standard \nimmigrant applicants will not be required to pay any portion of their \nback taxes owed to any part of their U.S. residency unless the IRS has \nalready made a tax assessment. This will only occur in the very rare \ncase where the IRS has already audited an immigrant applicant and found \na tax deficiency. Put simply, very few people will be required to pay \nback taxes under this provision.\n  My amendment would require RPI applicants to demonstrate they either \nhave no obligation to pay back taxes or to actually pay the back taxes \nthey lawfully owe. It also requires them to remain current on their tax \nobligations once they obtain the change in status.\n  Once again, this is only fair. Some may claim it is punitive, but \nthat is absurd. Is it punitive to ask immigrant applicants to live up \nto the same standards and requirements imposed on citizens and legal \nresidents? No.\n  When a citizen decides to leave the United States and renounce their \ncitizenship, they often face taxes on income earned in the United \nStates and on any gains from appreciated assets. Is it punitive to \napply a similar standard for those seeking U.S. citizenship? Think \nabout that: When a U.S. citizen decides to leave the United States and \nrenounce their citizenship, they often face taxes on income earned in \nthe United States and on any gains from appreciated assets. That is not \npunitive. The answer, of course, is that it is not punitive.\n  My amendment would not punish any immigrant applicants. It would \nsimply ensure they pay no more and no less than U.S. citizens and \nresident aliens in the same economic position.\n  In addition to claims that requiring the payment of back taxes is \npunitive, some have already claimed it would be impossible to enforce \nbecause the applicants won't be able to determine what they owe in back \ntaxes. This too is extremely misguided. The IRS is well experienced at \nestimating the tax liabilities for people who, for whatever reason, \nlack the records that normally support a tax return. They do it for \nU.S. citizens. Why can't we do it for people who now want to be on a \npath for citizenship but who haven't played by the rules? It just makes \nsense. Using bank records, credit card statements, housing records, and \nother evidence of an individual's lifestyle, the\n\n[[Page S4390]]\n\nIRS is able to construct returns and estimate tax liabilities for \nnonfilers who are U.S. citizens and resident aliens. The same process \ncan be used for immigrants looking to certify they no longer owe any \nFederal taxes. That is not a tough thing to do. It is something they do \nevery day at the IRS.\n  It may very well be that a number of these people didn't make enough \nmoney to pay any taxes anyway. But they should at least have to be \nhonest about where they stand, and they should at least have to do what \nregular citizens in this country have to do. We are not asking anything \nmore or less than that.\n  In the end, the only way proponents of this bill can escape the label \nof amnesty is to ensure immigrant applicants fulfill all their legal \nobligations and they are not accorded any special treatment. We are \ntalking about amnesty here. This is the way to get rid of amnesty and \nto pass this bill. You simply cannot do that without requiring they pay \nany taxes they still owe for income they earned during their U.S. \nresidency.\n  I think the authors of the bill know this because, once again, they \nhave been claiming the bill requires the payment of back taxes for \nmonths now. My amendment would simply fulfill the promise they have \nalready been making. Let's get it right. Let's not play games.\n  What is more, if we put this amendment into effect, we would be \nreducing the tax gap. As you know, the tax gap is the difference \nbetween what is actually paid to the IRS and what taxpayers owe under \nthe law. The most recent tax gap estimate we have is from 2006, when \nthe tax gap was approximately $385 billion for a single year. A number \nof my colleagues on both sides of the floor talk a lot about closing \nthe tax gap. My amendment would take significant steps toward doing \njust that.\n  As I said at the outset, my amendments are not designed to punish \nimmigrants who come forward out of the shadows, and they are not \ndesigned to poison the well for immigration reform. My aim throughout \nthis process has been to improve the bill.\n  I believe we are engaged in an important effort, but we have to do \nthings the right way. I made that effort during the markup of this \nbill. I didn't bring these four amendments up because they were Finance \nCommittee amendments and probably would have been ruled out of order in \nthe Judiciary Committee, and I agreed with my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle to defer until the floor. Now, all of a sudden, I am \nfinding there are roadblocks being put up on these very simple \namendments.\n  Too often over the past few years the Senate majority has opted to \nignore opportunities for bipartisan cooperation on issues of great \nimportance. When the Senate first took up immigration reform, \nproponents of the bill said they were hoping to get at least 70 votes \nin the Senate. I said at the time that was an important goal, that we \nneeded to get at least that many votes to send the right message to the \nHouse of Representatives. However, this week there are indications from \nthe Democratic leadership that they are willing to set these goals \naside if they just get 60 votes. Well, guess where that is going to go \nwith the House. If we get 70 votes, that puts pressure on everybody \ninvolved in this matter. And I think we can get 70 votes.\n  According to news reports out just today, two members of the majority \nleadership have indicated that they don't want to make too many \nconcessions to conservatives in order to get Republicans on board. \nInstead, they just want to focus on getting to 60 votes. Needless to \nsay, I think that would be a serious mistake. I think there are a lot \nof people on this side who would like to vote for a final bill, but \nthey are going to need amendments like these that are basically simple, \nnonpunitive amendments that make sense, that basically show we are not \nfor amnesty.\n  Immigration reform is too big to be done by just one party, and it \ncan't be done with the support of just a small handful of Republicans. \nAs courageous as those Republicans have been, as far as I am concerned, \nit is going to take Members of both parties to put together something \nthat can not only pass but also something that will work once it \nbecomes law.\n  We do have an opportunity to come together here on something that \nwill make a real difference for a lot of people; something that, if \ndone correctly, can do a lot of good. I hope we don't waste this \nopportunity in favor of yet another political exercise.\n  Once again, I want to support this legislation, but I am not going to \nif we don't do commonsense things like this, and I am laying down the \ngauntlet. I want immigration reform to succeed. These amendments will \nhelp it to succeed not only here but in the House of Representatives as \nwell. But unless we address these four issues I have outlined today--\nand there are others, but these are the ones I have decided to bend my \nplow over--unless we address these four issues, I believe the bill is \ndesigned to fail, if not here in the Senate then in the House of \nRepresentatives. And it will deserve to fail, as far as I am concerned.\n  Most importantly, if we don't address these issues, the bill will not \nbe able to be implemented in a fair and equitable way, and I think the \nAmerican people would be justly outraged.\n  I know there are some who don't really care about these important \nissues. I just urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support \nmy amendments--I think it is critical that these amendments pass--or \nwork with me to find ways that I can please both sides. But I believe \nthey are pretty straightforward amendments.\n  I was promised by leaders in the Gang of 8 that they would work with \nme, that they would help me get these things done. I consider those \npromises to be very important. Yet I have had some indication over the \nlast few days that maybe they are not going to work with me. I don't \nthink anybody has acted in better good faith than I have. As I have \nsaid, I would like to support the bill.\n  And make no mistake about it, I don't want people stiffing me on \nthings that I consider to be important without even talking, without \neven working with me to resolve any problems they may have. I am not \nthe kind of guy who takes that lightly. I think there is too much \npartisanship around here anyway.\n  Frankly, if you could pass this bill with these amendments, I think \nit would go a long way to showing not just four Republicans on our side \nwho are courageous, as I think are the four Democrats in the Gang of 8. \nBut they are not the only ones who should support this bill if it is \ndone right.\n  If this is going to be a political exercise, count me out. If this is \nan exercise to really try to resolve the amnesty issues, if it is an \nexercise to really try to resolve these critical issues, I can be \ncounted in. Maybe I don't mean that much in this debate, but if you \nlook at some of the major sections in this bill, I have worked them \nout, and I will help work out this bill not only with colleagues on \nthis side but with colleagues on the other side of Capitol Hill. But I \ndon't want to be stiffed at this time, and I am not the kind of guy who \ntakes stiffing lightly.\n  I see some real politics at work here rather than the kind of fair \nworking together that we have to have and that we have to start working \ntoward if we want to really accomplish things that need to be \naccomplished during these next 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I would like to join in the debate on \nimmigration reform, and I think my colleague from Utah who just spoke \nmakes a couple good points--one on the substance of the legislation and \nthe need for us to be concerned about what the eligibility is, \nparticularly as it relates to Federal benefits, to go to a legal \nstatus, but second about the process. I do hope the process can be an \nopen one.\n  Not all of us are in the Gang of 8. Not all of us are on the \nJudiciary Committee. A number of us have what we think are improvements \nto this legislation to make sure that it does work and hope that there \nwill be an openness to that over the next couple of weeks as we take up \nthis legislation. It is my hope that, working constructively in a \nbipartisan fashion, we can address some of what I see as shortcomings \nin this legislation.\n\n[[Page S4391]]\n\n  I do believe our current immigration system is broken. I think it is \nfar too easy for people to cross our borders illegally and too easy for \nfolks to find work without authorization. I think it is also too \ndifficult for those who seek to come here in accordance with the law. \nSo both the legal and the illegal part of our immigration system need \nfixing. It can't keep up with the demand for legal immigration or stem \nthe tide of illegal immigration. So I think reform is essential.\n  As it stands now, however, I am concerned that the legislation will \nnot provide the country with a lasting workable solution. Like a lot of \nmy colleagues we just heard from today--Senator Cornyn talked about \nthis, Senator Hatch talked about it, and others have talked about it \ntoday on the floor--I remain concerned about a few things. One is the \neligibility for Federal benefits. Senator Hatch talked about that. But \nfor me, a lot of it comes down to meaningful enforcement of our laws, \nincluding on the border, which is very important, also entry-exit, as \nSenator McCain talked about, but significantly workplace enforcement. \nThis is one area in particular that I believe must be addressed in \norder for us to have a successful implementation of the bill. \nParticularly, I would like to focus my comments today on what is called \nemployment verification, or the E-Verify system.\n  When we talk about strong enforcement measures, we hear a lot of talk \nabout the border, and we heard a lot of discussion about it earlier \ntoday, and that is important. It is important to have a secure border \nfor a lot of reasons, including the movement of guns, drugs, certainly \nterrorism, as well as immigration. But I don't believe that border \nsecurity alone will address the problem. Why? Because so many people \nenter here legally but then overstay their visas. It is estimated that \n40 percent of those who are here illegally are here because they \noverstayed their visas. So we are not going to solve that problem at \nthe border.\n  Second, I believe that no matter how many miles of fence we build or \nhow many Border Patrol agents we put side by side along the border, as \nlong as there are people wanting to come here for economic reasons--and \nI believe economic incentives are the primary reason people come to \nthis great country--I think it is going to be very difficult to stop \nillegal immigration just at the border. We have to deal with the jobs \nmagnet, which is why people are coming here.\n  This, by the way, has been a discussion over the years going back to \nthe 1980s. The 1986 act talked about the jobs magnet and the need for \nus to have an effective--at that point it was called the employer \nsanctions system. It was never put in place. That is one reason the \n1986 act did not work. It has been in the debate for decades, and yet \nwe haven't fixed it yet.\n  My belief is that the underlying bill still needs to be improved in \nthis regard. Our current employer verification system has simply failed \nto address some of the very fundamental problems of having unauthorized \nworkers. So effective employment verification is essential to the \nsuccessful completion of this legislative process and to having a \nsuccessful comprehensive immigration reform bill that prevents future \nillegal immigration.\n  Simply put, whatever reform we may adopt in this Congress will fail \nin the long run, in my view, if we don't eliminate the enticement to \ncome to our country to work. I believe we must have a strong and \nworkable E-Verify system that can help solve this basic problem.\n  Ideally, E-Verify would enable all employers to be able to, first, \nverify accurately and efficiently the identity of new employees and, \nsecond, ensure their work eligibility. By ensuring that only authorized \njob seekers get hired, we can begin to remove the jobs magnet that, \nfrankly, as I said earlier, undermined the 1986 reform effort and left \nus in the situation we face today where we have over 10 million people \nworking and living in the shadows here in this country.\n  Ultimately, I believe the E-Verify system contemplated by this \nlegislation falls short but could be improved. While no verification \nsystem is perfect, the bill we are now considering mandates nationwide \nE-Verify implementation while doing little to address the fundamental \nflaws we have seen in E-Verify. There is a recent study that estimates \nthat E-Verify has an error rate for unauthorized workers of 54 percent. \nThat means half of the folks who are not authorized to work who go \nthrough E-Verify are able to be qualified anyway. In other words, the \nE-Verify system is not working to detect more than half of the \nunauthorized workers.\n  In implementing the mandatory E-Verify system, we have to do more to \nstrengthen the protections against the fraudulent use of identifiers--\nparticularly the Social Security cards and Social Security numbers in \nthe employment authorization process--and we need to improve \nindividuals' data privacy protections in that process. The proposal \nbefore us attempts to address some of these problems through what is \ncalled a photo-matching tool. This tool is designed to allow employers \nto compare a digital photograph from the E-Verify system with the photo \non a new hire's passport, immigration document, or driver's license.\n  Unfortunately, the verification system doesn't have access to photos \nfor more than 60 percent of U.S. residents who do not have a U.S. \npassport or an immigration document, making the photo-matching \nineffective. The current legislation therefore relies on the States to \ngive the Department of Homeland Security access to driver's license \nrecords on a voluntary basis. There is no assurance that all or even \nmost States will choose to participate in this. Past experience with \nwhat is called the REAL ID Act would indicate that fewer than half of \nthe States would comply. Some say only 13 States would comply, some say \n18 States would comply. The fact is, fewer than half of the States are \ncomplying with REAL ID, which would mean that on a voluntary basis it \nis unlikely we are going get those driver's licenses or get those \nphotos to be able to have photo-match work effectively for the 60 \npercent or fewer residents who don't have a passport or immigration \ndocument.\n  So I think more can be done to make this bill work better, and I am \ncommitted to trying to do that through legislation, amendments, and \nworking with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  American citizenship is precious, and there are millions around the \nworld who dream of attaining it. Our Nation deserves an immigration \nsystem that works. We can get there but only if we demand reform that \nrecognizes the mistakes of the past--including the lack of promised \nenforcement from the 1986 law--and take steps to remedy those mistakes.\n  I am committed to addressing the deficiencies in the present \nlegislation, and I will work on the Senate floor to help strengthen \nborder security, deal with the eligibility issues Senator Hatch talked \nabout, and eliminate this magnet of illegal employment. In particular, \nI am committed to helping ensure that E-Verify is implemented in a \nmanner that does curtail the employment of unauthorized workers, \nprotects privacy, and minimizes the burdens on employers, particularly \nsmall businesses. I sincerely hope we can get there.\n  I am confident that if this process is indeed open, as was discussed \nearlier, if it is an open process where amendments are able to be \naccepted, where people of good faith on both sides of the aisle are \ntrying to get to a solution for a broken immigration system--broken \nboth in terms of legal immigration and illegal immigration--we can in \nthe end pass good legislation out of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor several times \nto discuss border security. Border security is so essential to people \napproving the legislation that we pass because most every poll shows \nwhen people want an immigration bill, it is premised on the assumption \nthat we are going to have a secured border.\n  I talked yesterday about my amendment, and that amendment tends to be \npending. I tried to improve upon the\n\n[[Page S4392]]\n\nGroup of 8 legislation on border security. I will take a few minutes \nright now--not very long--to discuss why I think my amendment is a good \nfirst step at restoring the faith of the American people--in this \nlegislation, but in turn in our government.\n  I would like to mention why it is so important, not just for public \nconfidence--because that is what I have spoken about in the past--but \nfor national security and the defense of the homeland. Being a U.S. \nBorder Patrol agent is a very dangerous job. A former agent said in an \ninterview in the El Paso Times:\n\n       I was attacked one time by a group of seven men with rocks \n     and I was pretty severely injured. Being assaulted is not \n     really that uncommon. Whether it is rocks being thrown at you \n     or a hand-to-hand combat situation or being shot at, it is \n     not particularly uncommon.\n\n  We need a bill that will protect our Border Patrol agents who put \ntheir lives on the line every day and do their job of patrolling the \nborder. They face threats and violence, and many, such as Brian Terry, \nhave been killed because of gang violence or drug cartels. Not only do \nour Border Patrol agents face danger, but ranchers face daily \nencounters of drug smugglers and illegal border crossers.\n  Robert Krentz from Arizona, a rancher, was killed in 2010. His family \nexpressed frustration with the Federal Government, stating:\n\n       The disregard of our repeated pleas and warnings of \n     impending violence towards our community fell on deaf ears, \n     shrouded in political correctness. As a result, we have paid \n     the ultimate price for their negligence in credibly securing \n     our borderlands.\n\n  No one can fault someone for wanting to improve their lot in life. \nHusbands and wives trek across the border to make a better life for \nthem and for their families. People yearn to be free and to make life \nfull of liberty and happiness. But people who cross the border \nillegally risk their own lives. They spend days walking through desert. \nThey fall prey to smugglers and become victims of rape and abuse. \nSecuring the border is one of the most humane things we can do to \nprotect the lives of those who will venture into the United States, not \ncaring about our laws but for the sole purpose of improving their \nlives. That is the goal of America, a better life for all of us who \nwere born here as well as those who immigrate here.\n  It is dangerous crossing the border illegally for those people. We \ncan give them legal avenues to enter this country to live, work, and \nraise a family. If we do not deter illegal border crossings, people's \nlives will remain at risk as they are at this very hour.\n  Nonetheless, proponents of legalization hold to the belief that the \nvast majority of people who cross our border are people seeking \nemployment. Most times that is true; however, not everyone who crosses \nthe southern border is a resident of Mexico who seeks to be reunited \nwith family and do the jobs Americans will not do. The number of \nindividuals from noncontiguous countries, otherwise known as ``other \nthan Mexicans,'' should be a concern.\n  As of April 2, 2013, the ``other than Mexican'' numbers on the \nsouthwest border were up 67 percent from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal \nyear 2013. We know some of the ``other than Mexicans'' include \nterrorists who enter the United States via the southern border. \nSecretary Napolitano has testified before Congress to that very fact.\n  We also know a majority of ``other than Mexicans'' fails to appear \nfor their immigration proceedings and simply disappears, lost here in \nthis great country, the United States. Increasing bonds for these \nnationals would deter absconders, assist ICE and custom border police \nin covering detention and removal costs or, at a minimum, provide a \ndisincentive to cross. Unfortunately, an amendment during the Judiciary \nCommittee markup to raise the bonds for ``other than Mexicans'' failed.\n  Many commonsense amendments were defeated during the committee \nprocess and many amendments to beef up the border will be considered in \nthe days ahead.\n  As I have said before, the bill before us only requires the Secretary \nof Homeland Security submit a plan to Congress before millions of \npeople are legalized. There is little regard for the need to better \nsecure our border. In other words, when a plan is presented, make sure \nthe plan works. Some of them say we have done enough. The Secretary \nsays the border is more secure than ever before. They say border \nsecurity shouldn't stand in the way of legalization.\n  My amendment is a good first step to stopping the flow of illegal \nimmigration. It sends a clear signal that we are serious about getting \nthe job done. For the Secretary to simply submit a plan to Congress is \nonly worth the paper upon which it is printed. We need to take action \nand we need to make it a priority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today for the 35th time to \nagain bring the message to my colleagues that it is time to wake up to \nthe threat of climate change. There is simply too much credible \nevidence that climate change is occurring, and there is too much at \nrisk for us to continue sleepwalking.\n  Our oceans face unprecedented challenges from climate change and \ncarbon pollution. Oceans have absorbed more than 550 billion tons of \nour carbon pollution. As a result, they have become 30 percent more \nacidic. That is a measurement, not a theory.\n  Ocean temperatures are also changing dramatically, again driven by \ncarbon pollution. Sea surface temperatures in 2012, from the Gulf of \nMaine down to Cape Hatteras, were the highest recorded in 150 years. \nThat is another measurement. Fish stocks are shifting northward with \nsome disappearing from U.S. waters as they move farther offshore. \nFishermen who have come here to talk to Senator Reed and myself have \nnoted anomalies, and ``things are not making sense out there'' is the \nway they have described it.\n  In my home State of Rhode Island, the Ocean State, we put our lives \nand hearts into our relationship with the ocean. The day-to-day life on \nthe coast is a proud and rewarding tradition, but it is one that is now \nthreatened by climate change.\n  The waters of Narragansett Bay are getting warmer--4 degrees \nFahrenheit warmer in the winter since the 1960s. Long-term data from \nthe tide gauges in Newport, RI, show an increase in the average sea \nlevel of nearly 10 inches since 1930, and the rate of increase is \naccelerating. Sea level rise is contributing to erosion and allows \nstorm surges and waves to wash farther and farther inland. Last year \nHurricane Sandy really sped up that erosion, driving down beaches and \ndunes and tearing up coastal homes and roads.\n  The ecosystem damage, erosion, and storms are just part of the price \nRhode Islanders pay for unchecked greenhouse gas pollution. We are not \nalone. Every region of the United States is facing similar costs.\n  Economists are working to calculate the costs of carbon pollution by \nadding up those damages of climate change. It is called ``the social \ncost of carbon'' because it is the cost of pollution the big polluters \noffload onto the rest of society. When consumers and taxpayers are \nforced to shoulder those costs, that is a market failure, and it is \nflat out unfair.\n  The Obama administration recently revised its estimates of the social \ncost of carbon. The new calculation does a better job at capturing the \nmost recent projections for sea level rise and agricultural \nproductivity. This is a good step toward recognizing the magnitude of \nthe harms of climate change, and I hope it is an indication that the \nPresident is going to do more to address this problem.\n  Economists and administration officials are not the only ones looking \nat the cost of carbon pollution. Among those weighing the evidence that \nour climate is changing are the cold-eyed professionals of the property \ncasualty insurance industry--insurers and the reinsurers. Their \nindustry depends on getting this right. Politics has no place in their \ncalculations. This is how they make their living.\n\n[[Page S4393]]\n\n  The insurance sector has created a complete data set for natural \ncatastrophes worldwide from 1980 up to 2011, and here is what they see: \nThe annual number of natural disasters is going steadily up. The top \nthree colors of each of these bars show the number of events that are \nrelated to weather. On the bottom, this set in red shows the events \nthat are not related to weather. Volcanoes, earthquakes, and so forth, \nare not climate related.\n  While the overall number of catastrophes is increasing, we can see \nthe number of these nonclimate catastrophes is constant. It is the \nclimate-driven catastrophes that are increasing.\n  Here is the chart without those nonclimate catastrophes. These are \nthe catastrophes that are related to climate-driven weather. Insurers \nand reinsurers are looking more closely at the increase in weather-\nrelated catastrophes and are now starting to include climate-change \ncosts in their risk models.\n  Pricing carbon properly is necessary. Representative Henry Waxman, \nRepresentative Earl Blumenauer, Senator Brian Schatz, and I have \nreleased a discussion draft of legislation to make the big carbon \npolluters pay a fee to cover the costs of dumping their waste carbon \ninto our atmosphere and oceans--a cost they now push off onto the rest \nof us--and return all of that revenue to the American people.\n  At present the political conditions in Congress are stacked against \nus. The big polluters and their allies hold sway and Congress refuses \nto wake up. While Congress sleepwalks through history, States such as \nmy home State of Rhode Island are acting to mitigate and adapt for \nclimate change.\n\n  This week I welcomed dozens of Rhode Islanders to Washington for our \nannual Rhode Island Energy and Environmental Leaders Day. This event \nbrings together Rhode Island renewable energy and sustainable \ndevelopment businesses, community development nonprofits, State and \nlocal officials, environmentalists, experts, and academics, to share \nideas with national leaders and Federal agencies on promoting green \nenergy, improving resiliency, and combating climate change.\n  We were joined by my terrific Rhode Island delegation, Jack Reed, Jim \nLangevin, and David Cicilline. The highlight of the event was hearing \nfrom Vice President Al Gore, who is a world leader on environmental \nprotection and alternative energy. Vice President Gore declared that \n``We are on the cusp of a fantastic revolution'' in green energy. ``But \nthere is still ferocious resistance,'' he warned, from ``legacy \nindustries that have built up wealth and power in a previous age''--\nthat is what stops Congress. That is what keeps us sleepwalking, and \nthat is why we don't wake up.\n  We were also joined by Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, who asserted \nthe Obama administration's dedication to doubling renewable generation \nby the end of this decade.\n  Congressman Henry Waxman, the ranking member on the House Energy and \nCommerce Committee and my fellow cochair of our Bicameral Task Force on \nClimate Change, also came to address the group, as did our colleague \nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. New Englanders, of course, \nknow Senator Warren as a tireless advocate for everyday Americans, who \nis unafraid to challenge powerful special interests, and my friend \nHenry Waxman has carved out a unique role for himself as one of the \nleading legislators in the House of Representatives on this and a great \nnumber of other public health issues. I am so proud to be working with \nRepresentative Waxman.\n  The innovation that is taking place in my Ocean State was on full \ndisplay at the Rhode Island Energy and Environmental Leaders Day. We \nare a leader in the development of offshore wind energy. This month the \nFederal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management announced the first-ever \nauction for renewable energy leases off the coast of Rhode Island and \nMassachusetts.\n  Our State's Special Area Management Plan, or SAMP, has balanced \nenvironmental, commercial, and military marine interests through a \nfirst-of-its-kind marine spatial planning process. This cooperation has \nprotected rich fishing grounds and sped up wind energy development.\n  Rhode Island is part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, \nnicknamed ``Reggie,'' along with eight other northeastern States, \nincluding the State of the Presiding Officer, I believe. Our region \ncaps carbon emissions and sells permits to powerplants to emit \ngreenhouse gases, creating economic incentives for both States and \nutilities to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy \ndevelopment.\n  Rhode Island's Climate Change Commission identifies risks to \nimportant State infrastructure and reports on the effects of \ncatastrophic events such as Hurricane Sandy and the 2010 flood.\n  In places such as North Kingstown, RI, the city planners have taken \nthe best elevation data available, and they have modeled various levels \nof sea level rise and storm surge. By combining these models with maps \nshowing roads, emergency routes, water treatment plants, and estuaries, \nthe town can better plan its infrastructure and its conservation \nprojects.\n  The Rhode Island Department of Health is using a $250,000 grant from \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help the State \nprepare for and address health effects associated with climate change.\n  Most of all, Rhode Islanders are calling for action, especially young \nRhode Islanders. When I spoke at a climate change rally on the National \nMall earlier this year, busloads of Rhode Islanders had driven down to \nshow support for action on climate change. Right now students at Brown \nUniversity and the Rhode Island School of Design are pushing their \ngreat universities to divest their endowments of coal holdings.\n  I am proud of the effort we are making in Rhode Island, and I know a \nlot of States are working just as hard. But I say to my colleagues: Our \nhome States are hampered in these efforts by inaction in Congress. Even \nthe Government Accountability Office, known as Congress's watchdog, has \npointed out repeatedly that the Federal Government should be a better \npartner to States that are trying to adapt to and plan for climate \nchange.\n  Sadly, Congress seems determined to be the last holdout against good \nsense. Some in this body choose to ignore the science and put special \ninterests before national interests. They stifle policies that would be \neconomically inconvenient to their special interests. The obstruction \nmay be well funded by the polluters and their allies, but the majority \nof the American people understand that climate change is a problem, and \nthey want their leaders to take action.\n  Many in Washington do recognize the need for climate action and ocean \nstewardship. President Obama declared this June to be National Oceans \nMonth, saying:\n\n       All of us have a stake in keeping the oceans, coasts, and \n     Great Lakes clean and productive--which is why we must manage \n     them wisely not just in our time, but for generations to \n     come. Rising to meet that test means addressing threats like \n     overfishing, pollution, and climate change.\n\n  Last week, the National Marine Sanctuary Foundation hosted the 12th \nCapitol Hill Ocean Week, bringing marine professionals, government \nofficials, and ocean advocates to Washington to discuss strategies for \nkeeping our oceans and coasts healthy.\n  Also, last week, Secretary of State John Kerry hosted a roundtable \ndiscussion about the challenges of and opportunities for ocean \nsustainability under climate change.\n  Responsible people are calling for action, such as Rhode Island's \nenergy and environmental leaders, the insurance and reinsurance sector, \nand virtually every major reputable scientific organization, such as \nNASA, whose scientists sent a buggy the size of an SUV to Mars and are \ndriving it around right now on the surface of Mars. They may know \nsomething when they can do that. Major U.S. corporations are calling \nfor action, including Apple and Ford and Nike and Coca-Cola and \norganizations such as the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Heather \nZichal, President Obama's Deputy Assistant for Energy and Climate \nChange, made it clear to the crowd at Rhode Island Energy and \nEnvironmental Leaders Day:\n\n       Congress has not yet delivered a common-sense, market-based \n     solution. . . . [I]f Congress will not act, then [the \n     President] will.\n\n  It is time to wake up and to meet the challenge of our time. There is \na lot at stake for every State and there is a lot at stake for every \ngeneration. It is time to wake up and to take action.\n\n[[Page S4394]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come to the floor because I have been \nlistening to some of the discussions of my colleagues about the \nimmigration reform bill that is before the Senate.\n  As I have said before, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but \nthey are not entitled to their own facts. I have heard references, time \nand time again, to 1986, the last time immigration reform legislation \nwas passed. This is not 1986. Selective memory loss seems to be at work \nin the Senate today, so I wish to respond to some of these claims made \nby my colleagues.\n  On one hand, critics of the immigration bill keep harking back to the \nImmigration Control Act of 1986, commonly known as IRCA, arguing we \nhaven't learned the lessons of 1986. On the other hand, they insist on \ntheir slogan of securing the border first, before a legalization \nprocess can begin. But if there are lessons to be learned from 1986, \nthere are just as many to be learned from the last 10 years in which \n``enforcement first'' has been the mantra of Congress's immigration \npolicy, with disastrous results.\n  First, with respect to 1986, the overriding lesson learned from that \nbill was that if we don't deal with the reasons people come to the \nUnited States, we don't solve the problem. A promise to end illegal \nimmigration ultimately could not be fulfilled because the 1986 law did \nnot address the question of future immigration flows.\n  The Migration Policy Institute and the Immigration Policy Center have \nidentified one cause of future illegal immigration after IRCA to be not \nlegalization--not legalization--but the failure of legislation to \naddress future flows of immigration. S. 744, the bill we are debating, \nhowever, does not follow in the failed footsteps of the 1986 act and \naddresses future flow in real and meaningful ways.\n  But we have learned other lessons in the intervening years, most \nnotably that the enforcement-first policy does not serve our country \nwell. Despite an extraordinary allocation of resources and personnel, \nthe flow of illegal immigrants has steadfastly been affected more by \nthe economy than by enforcement efforts. As deportations have gone up, \nthe tragic impact on families and children has been well documented and \nthe impact on the economy continues to grow.\n  So if one of the pull factors is the opportunity to earn money to \nsend back to families, S. 744 undermines that opportunity by mandating \na universal--a universal--employment verification system and provides \nfor a reasonable implementation schedule. What that basically means is \nthat virtually every employer in America is going to have to make sure \nthat regardless of who a person is, when they come forth and seek to be \nemployed by an employer that has a job available, they are going to go \nthrough the system and verify whether the person has the legal status \nto be able to work in the United States. That undermines that factor of \ndrawing people to this country for employment opportunities much more \nthan anything else about interdiction.\n  If anything, the growing outrage over a broken immigration system \nhelped to change the political dynamic last year. It was a rejection of \nboth the enforcement-only strategy and the idea that we must secure the \nborder first.\n  Finally, the Migration Policy Institute explained that the 1986 \nlimited legalization program left many people in the shadows, which led \nto substantial backlogs in family-based immigration categories. Illegal \nimmigration did not decrease dramatically until after the passage of \nenforcement-only bills starting in 1996 that trapped many in an \nundocumented status despite their family or employment ties. So our \nlegislation learns from the mistakes of the past and creates a balanced \n21st century immigration system.\n  Despite what many have said, our legislation, in moving forward with \nlegalization, does not abandon border security but, rather, addresses \nit in tandem with the significant problems that face our immigration \nsystem. We can, for example, reap enormous benefits from legalizing the \nundocumented, both in terms of their economic and social \ncontributions--making sure they fully pay taxes and are law abiding in \nevery other respect--and in terms of creating a more secure and \naccountable system, as we will know who is in the United States and who \ncan lawfully work here, but we can't do it if we have to wait years--\nyears--under some of the amendments our colleagues are offering to \nbegin the process of transitioning undocumented people into a legal \nstatus.\n  I have heard a lot about national security. I would prefer to know \nwho is in the United States. Let them come forth, register with the \ngovernment, go through a criminal background check, and those who can't \npass that background check--maybe they don't think their background is \ngoing to come up--get deported. Then I know who is here to do harm to \nAmerica versus who is here to pursue the American dream. But my \ncolleagues would continue through their amendments to keep these people \nin the shadows--millions--and, therefore, I don't know how we promote \nnational security if we don't know who is here and for what purposes. \nSo we reap enormous benefits, both in terms of economic benefits as \nwell as security, by bringing those people out of the shadows and into \nthe light--registering with the government, going through a criminal \nbackground check, paying taxes, learning English, and earning their way \nto make their situation right in the United States.\n\n  Certain impossible border security standards must be seen for what \nthey are, which, in my view, is a cynical attempt to deny a pathway to \nlegalization. My colleagues can flower it all they want, they can cover \nit up all they want, they can put all the lipstick on it they want, but \nit is still what it is. It is a cynical attempt to ultimately undermine \na pathway to legalization. The standards some of my colleagues are \ntrying to propose have not been met by the Federal Government in \nvirtually any other responsibility the government has. Pretty amazing. \nTying the two together, as so many have tried to do, is simply \ninstitutionalizing the status quo.\n  What does the status quo do? The status quo allows millions to be in \nthis country without knowing what their purpose is here. The status quo \nallows families to be divided. The status quo allows U.S. citizens and \npermanent residents--legal permanent residents of the United States--to \nbe unlawfully detained in immigration raids, treated as second-class \ncitizens of this country because of the happenstance of where they \nlive, who they are, what they look like. Who among us is willing to be \na second-class citizen in America?\n  The status quo permits an underclass to be exploited and creates \ndownward pressures on the wages of all Americans, and that exploitation \ntakes place. The status quo doesn't allow for the challenges, even in a \ntough job economy, to be fulfilled so our economy can grow. I listen to \nall different sectors of our economy, including the agricultural \nsector. I listen to the seafood industry. I listen to the hospitality \nindustry. I listen to the restaurant industry. I listen to the high-\ntech industry. They all clamor for individuals to do these critical \njobs that very often support the high-paying jobs above them but are \nessential in order to be able to produce that product or deliver that \nservice. Yet we would have the status quo be preserved because that is, \nin essence, what the amendments being offered include, which are \nunattainable standards that my colleagues know simply cannot be met. \nThey are not about border security but about undermining the pathway to \nlegalization.\n  So let's look at what this bill does do, however, about border \nsecurity, among many other provisions. It includes $6.5 billion in \naddition to the greatest amount of resources, including money, border \npatrol, customs enforcement, physical impediments on the border, aerial \nsurveillance that already exists. It adds $6.5 billion to bolster our \nborder security efforts, and that is in addition to the annual \nappropriations for border security.\n  Effective border controls? Yes. As a matter of fact, these provisions \nof the Gang of 8 were largely drafted by the Senators who came from \nborder States and who had a real sense and a real conversation with \nthose who secure the border every day about what is needed.\n  It requires all employers to verify their workers are authorized to \nwork in this country, which cuts off the job magnet--another effective \ncontrol, perhaps the most effective control. It has\n\n[[Page S4395]]\n\na whole entry-exit system that is far more advanced than that which \nexists today, and before any legalization can begin--before any \nlegalization can begin--the Secretary of Homeland Security is \ndesignated to come up with a plan for how to deploy $4.5 billion of \nthose resources on infrastructure, technology, fencing, and personnel \nsuch as the Border Patrol, so it will be able to catch 9 out of every \n10 undocumented immigrants who might attempt to cross the border. So \nthere is more border control.\n  Only after this plan has been presented to the Congress and the E-\nVerify system--which is that employment check--is ready for nationwide \nimplementation and the deployment of the resources has commenced, may \nthe legalization program begin to adjust undocumented individuals to \nthat provisional status. Before anyone in that provisional status can \never be granted a green card, which basically means permanent \nresidency, all of the resources in the plan must be deployed on the \nground and be working.\n  That is not enough for some of my colleagues because they create \nstandards for which we, in essence, could never, ever have even a \nprovisional status in the country.\n  Some Senators have also claimed our bill allows immigrants to receive \nwelfare and other public benefits. That is just simply not true. S. \n744, the bill before us, bars individuals granted even provisional \nstatus and blue card status--which are agriculture workers and V \nnonimmigrant visas--they will not be eligible for the following Federal \nmeans-tested public benefit programs for the duration of their \nprovisional status: nonemergency Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program, otherwise known as SNAP or food stamps, Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families, TANF, and Supplementary Security Income.\n  In fact, when most of these individuals adjust to LPR/green card \nstatus, they will be forced to wait at least 5 additional years before \nbecoming eligible for these programs, and all the while they are paying \ntaxes, which is a prerequisite. As a result, an individual with RPI \nstatus, who is otherwise eligible for public benefits, would not be \nable to enroll in programs such as Medicaid and SNAP for 15 years.\n  Now, during the duration of their provisional status, individuals \nwill not be eligible for the Affordable Care Act's premium tax credits \nand cost-sharing reductions that help make health insurance affordable \nfor low- and middle-income working families. They will not be eligible \nfor that. Individuals granted RPI--the provisional status--blue card or \nV nonimmigrant visa status will be able to purchase private health \ninsurance at full cost--at full cost--without subsidies, without tax \ncredits through the insurance marketplaces created under the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  We want to give them the opportunity out of their own pocket and with \nfull cost to be able to do so if they can because that means we lessen \nthe burden on our health care system, particularly in an emergency room \nsetting, which is what happens right now.\n  This does not give tax credits, it does not give subsidies, but it \ndoes say to the individual: If you have the wherewithal, go buy \ninsurance and protect yourself.\n  This bill denies benefits to legalized immigrants. It is a tough bill \nand, frankly, for many of us, some of these provisions, because we say \nto someone: Come forth, register, pay fines, pay fees, pay your taxes, \nand, by the way, for a decade or more, even though you are paying taxes \nlike anybody else, you have absolutely no right to anything--that is \nvirtually what we are saying. So I wanted to clarify the record so the \nAmerican people understand the truth about this bill. It is a tough and \nfair compromise that respects the American taxpayer.\n  Finally, I would like to clarify the record about taxes and the \neconomic benefits of this bill. This bill increases the gross domestic \nproduct of the United States by a cumulative $832 billion over 10 \nyears--$832 billion over 10 years--and that is only by virtue of \nlooking at the legalization aspect. If we look at the totality of all \nthe elements of the bill, it exceeds $1 trillion. It increases the \nwages of all Americans by $470 billion, and it creates an average of \n121,000 new jobs each year for the next 10 years. That is an additional \n1.2 million jobs over the next decade.\n  The Senate bill says individuals who do not pay their taxes cannot--\ncannot--renew their legal status or obtain green cards. Legalizing \nimmigrants can be required to pay assessed taxes going back as for as \n10 years before legalization.\n  This requirement is tougher than the back tax requirements in the \n2006 and 2007 bipartisan Senate immigration bills, which only required \nlegalizing workers to pay back taxes when they obtained their green \ncards. Under this bill, workers are held responsible for back taxes at \nthree points: when first transitioning to legal status, when renewing \ntheir status, and when obtaining a green card. On top of the back tax \nrequirement, legalizing workers will have to pay significant penalties \nand fees at registration and renewal and when obtaining their green \ncards.\n  Everyone who works, regardless of their immigration status, is liable \nfor the payment of taxes. ``Assessed liability'' simply means \nlegalizing workers will be held responsible for all of the back taxes \nthe IRS says they owe--all the back taxes the IRS says they owe--going \nback as far as 10 years before legalization.\n  The back tax requirement is written in the way that is most \nstraightforward for the IRS to implement and enforce, saving resources \nand making sure that individuals with past-due liability can actually \nbe blocked from adjusting their status.\n  It provides an efficient way for the Department of Homeland Security \nto confirm that individuals have satisfied their tax liabilities. It is \nmuch easier for the Department of Homeland Security to work with IRS to \nconfirm that individuals have paid all their assessed liabilities \ninstead of sifting through tens of millions of tax returns, which would \nnot reflect taxes that may have been assessed by the IRS.\n  I look at the Congressional Budget Office. We will await their score, \nbut they and other experts in the past have found that undocumented \nworkers will pay billions of dollars more in taxes--more in taxes--once \nthey come out of the shadows and work legally.\n  I had thought, with poll after poll after poll where Democrats and \nRepublicans and Independents said they wanted to see this broken \nimmigration system fixed, where, in fact, we had a national election \nlast November for the Presidency, for the Congress, in which this \ndebate raged on quite a bit--and ultimately a new demographic in the \ncountry showed, in those election results, as they marched to the \npolls, that they were looking at how this Congress would deal with the \nquestion of reforming our broken immigration system--that, in fact, we \nwould have a different day in the Senate, that instead of voices that \nare seeking to undermine the very essence of reform--that includes \nborder security, that includes a pathway to legalization, that includes \nprovisions in our economy that are incredibly important both to grow \nand not suppress the wages of Americans, that improves the protections \nto make sure American workers have the first shot at getting any job \nthat exists in America first and foremost, that looks at the future in \nterms of flows and says: This is how we are going to deal with this to \nensure that our economic vitality grows by virtue of who we allow in \nthis country but that still preserves a very core value, an American \nvalue, a value I often hear my colleagues talk about, which is about \nfamily values and the family unit--well, that still preserves the very \nessence of that value, even as it reduces it somewhat, and at the same \ntime preserves our history as a nation of immigrants, the greatest \nexperiment in the history of mankind, which has made us the greatest \ncountry on the face of the Earth--that we would hear a different \napproach by some of our colleagues.\n  But I have heard the same tired refrain, and it may sound good, but \nwhen you read what the amendments are all about, you understand what \nthey are really trying to do. I believe those efforts will be rejected. \nLegitimate efforts to improve this bill, as it was improved in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, in which 136 amendments were offered and \npassed--many of them were Republican amendments, many of them were \nbipartisan amendments that were\n\n[[Page S4396]]\n\npassed, and they, in fact, refined, improved, and made more specific \nelements of the bill that were great additions--those opportunities \nexist here as well.\n  But what we cannot allow is to nullify the hopes and dreams and \naspirations of millions of people in our country who are waiting for \nthis moment. We cannot nullify the opportunity to really move toward \nsecuring our country in a way far beyond the status quo. We cannot lose \nthe opportunity to grow our economy, get more taxpayers into our \nsystem, and strengthen our overall revenue sources. That is what this \nbill is all about. That is why I believe at the end of the day it will \nprevail and receive the votes necessary to move forward and be sent to \nthe House so we can finally get this broken immigration system fixed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand Senator Vitter, the Senator \nfrom Louisiana was on the floor earlier discussing the amendment \nSenator Hatch and I have proposed, Amendment No. 1183. I have read the \nremarks the Senator from Louisiana made, and I wish he had read our \namendment more carefully. His remarks seem to be describing a different \namendment than the one Senator Hatch and I have proposed.\n  Our amendment is very simple. Under current law, foreign performing \nartists who come to the United States must get either an ``O'' or ``P'' \nvisa. The Immigration Statute requires that U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services, USCIS process these visas in 14 days. This \nstatutory requirement is a reflection of the time sensitivity involved \nwith scheduling these artists for engagements in the United States, and \npermitting them to meet their obligations, which of course benefit the \nAmerican organizations that hire them. Our amendment, which is limited \nto non-profit organizations, provides that if the 14-day statutory \nrequirement for processing is not met, then the foreign artist's \npetition would automatically be given expedited processing, and the \nassociated additional fee is waived. But let me be clear, the visiting \nartist is already paying a fee of several hundred dollars for the \npetition. All our amendment would do is provide the petitioner with \nfree expedited processing if the deadline were not met by the agency.\n  Senator Vitter expressed concern that providing expedited processing \nin a case where the immigration agency does not adhere to its statutory \ndeadline would take funding away from the enforcement of immigration \nlaw. Surely Senator Vitter knows that U.S. Citizenship and Immigrations \nServices is a fully fee-funded agency, and has no enforcement \nresponsibilities. When Congress reorganized the former Immigration and \nNaturalization Service and created the Department of Homeland Security, \nthe visa adjudication and immigration enforcement functions were \nseparated. So let me be clear--the waiver of an expedited processing \nfee has absolutely no effect on the funding that goes to immigration \nenforcement. Moreover, as I discussed this morning, the bill we debate \nprovides $6.5 billion to border security and enforcement. Our amendment \nis not some giveaway to, as Senator Vitter described, ``well-heeled'' \nindividuals. Rather, it is an incentive for USCIS to process these \npetitions in a timely way as they are required under the law.\n  But the most important distinction that the Senator from Louisiana \nfailed to explain to the Senate was that our amendment applies only to \nnon-profit organizations. Organizations like the Greater New Orleans \nYouth Orchestra, the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra, Louisiana State \nUniversity Opera, and the New Orleans Ballet Association. I suspect \nthat these are not the ``well-heeled'' individuals the Senator from \nLouisiana is describing. In fact, I would ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a list of 83 Louisiana Arts Organizations and \nsupporters of the amendment Senator Hatch and I have offered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana called our amendment misguided. Again, I \nwish he had read the amendment more carefully. I suspect the dozens of \nnon-profit performing arts organizations across Louisiana that are \nenriching their communities with performances from international \nmusicians and dancers would not think it is misguided to help them \ncontinue their important work. With such an incredibly rich musical \nhistory and tradition, I suspect the people of Louisiana, like \nAmericans across the country, place a very high value on the performing \narts.\n  So with that clarification, I hope I have addressed the concern of \nthe Senator from Louisiana and that he will reconsider his opposition.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Performikng Arts Alliance\n\n                  Members and Supporters in Louisiana\n\n\n                         Organization and City\n\n       Acadiana Center for the Arts, Lafayette; Acadiana Symphony \n     Orchestra, Lafayette; Alligator Mike Promotions LLC, New \n     Orleans; Ark-La-Tex Youth Symphony Orchestra, Shreveport; \n     ArteFuturo Productions, New Orleans; Arts Council of Greater \n     Baton Rouge, Baton Rouge; ArtSpot Productions, New Orleans; \n     Ashe Cultural Center/Efforts of Grace, Inc., New Orleans; \n     Atlantic Brass Quintet, Baton Rouge; Backbeat Foundation \n     Inc., New Orleans; Baton Rouge Symphony, Baton Rouge; BREC \n     Independence Park Theatre, Baton Rouge; Cindy Scott, New \n     Orleans; Columbia Theatre for the Performing Arts, Hammond; \n     Contemporary Arts Center, New Orleans; Coughlin-Saunders \n     Performing Arts Center, Alexandria; Cripple Creek Theatre \n     Company, NEW ORLEANS; CubaNOLA Arts Collective, New Orleans; \n     Dillard, New Orleans; Downsville High School, Downsville; \n     DUKES of Dixieland, The, New Orleans.\n       Festival International de Louisiane, Lafayete; FMBC--\n     Liturgical/Spiritual Dance Ministry, New Orleans; Goat in the \n     Road Productions, NEW ORLEANS; Graduate Program in Arts \n     Administration--UNO, New Orleans; Grand Opera House of the \n     South, Crowley; Greater New Orleans Youth Orchestras, New \n     Orleans; HMS Architects, New Orleans; Hot 8 Brass Band, New \n     Orleans; Houma Terrebonne Civic Center Development \n     Corporation, Houma; Independence Park Theatre, Baton Rouge; \n     Isidore Newman School, New Orleans; Jefferson Performing Arts \n     Society, Metairie; Junebug Producitons, New Orleans; Kors \n     Entertainment, Baton Rouge; Lake Charles Symphony Orchestra, \n     Lake Charles; Little Theater Shreveport, Shreveport; Louis \n     Armstrong Society Jazz Band, The, New Orleans; Louisiana \n     Alliance for Dance, Baton Rouge; Louisiana Division of the \n     Arts, Baton Rouge; Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra, New \n     Orleans.\n       Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge; Louisiana State \n     University Opera, Baton Rouge; Louisiana State University \n     Student Union Theater, Baton Rouge; Louisiana Youth \n     Orchestra, Baton Rouge; Loyola University, New Orleans; \n     Maculele Cultural Project, Inc., New Orleans; Manship \n     Theatre, Baton Rouge; Mondo Bizarro, NEW ORLEANS; Monroe \n     Symphony Orchestra, Monroe; Moving Forward Gulf Coast, \n     SLIDELL; Musaica Chamber Music Ensemble, Metairie; Musicians \n     for Music, New Orleans; National Performance Network, New \n     Orleans; NEW NOISE, NEW ORLEANS; New Orleans Ballet \n     Association, New Orleans; New Orleans Center for Creative \n     Arts Institute, New Orleans; New Orleans Friends of Music, \n     New Orleans; New Orleans Opera, New Orleans; New Orleans \n     Shakespeare Festival at Tulane, New Orleans; Night Light \n     Collective, NEW ORLEANS; North Star Theatre, Mandeville; \n     Opera Louisiane, Baton Rouge.\n       Oportunidades Nola, New Orleans; PearlDamour, NEW ORLEANS; \n     Performing Arts Society of Acadiana, Lafayette; Playmakers of \n     Baton Rouge, Baton Rouge; Rapides Symphony Orchestra, \n     Alexandria; Salvadore Liberto Music, River Ridge; Shreveport \n     Opera, Shreveport; Shreveport Symphony Orchestra, Shreveport; \n     Southern Rep, New Orleans; Strand Theatre of Shreveport, \n     Shreveport; Swine Palace Productions, Baton Rouge; Terrance \n     Simien & The Zydeco Experience, Lafayette; Terrance Simien & \n     The Zydeco Experience, Lafayette; The Shakespeare Festival, \n     New Orleans; Tsunami Dance, new orleans; Tutti Dynamics, New \n     Orleans; University of Louisiana, Lafayette; University of \n     Louisiana--Monroe, Monroe; VIEUX CARRE ARTISTS, New Orleans.\n\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I wish to start tonight by saluting our Gang of 8. I \nwon't call them by name; you know their names, but four Democrats and \nfour Republicans. I wish to thank them for their tireless efforts to \nbring this bipartisan legislation to the floor.\n  I also wish to commend Senator Leahy and the Judiciary Committee that \nhe leads for their efforts to bring the committee together and for \nbringing to the floor what I think most of us agree is very important \nlegislation.\n  Delaware celebrated the 375th anniversary of the arrival of the first\n\n[[Page S4397]]\n\nSwedes and Finns who came to America and came right through what is now \nWilmington, DE. South of that spot, about 5 miles to the south, William \nPenn first came to America as well.\n  Those immigrants came to our country all those years ago for a lot of \nthe same reasons people come here today. They came to live what we now \ncall the American dream, the remarkable idea that regardless of our \nbackground or station in life, people can still come to this country, \nwork hard, build a better life for themselves and for their families. \nToday, some 400 years later after those first immigrants settled in my \nown State, we are blessed to live in a thriving and prosperous Nation \nin no small part because of millions of immigrants who came together to \nbuild this Nation. We can all be proud of that history.\n  As a Nation of immigrants, we in Congress have a special \nresponsibility to ensure our immigration system is effective and it \nreflects our values. Those values were what inspired brave, hard-\nworking, and committed people to take great chances to come to this \nNation. They are often seeking to escape violence, to lift themselves \nout of poverty, or to simply live a better life.\n  These immigrants renew and enrich our communities. They enhance our \neconomy, but we cannot and should not open our doors indiscriminately \nto everybody who wants to come here. we need an immigration system that \nis practical, is effective and, in the end, is fair--fair to us, fair \nto the people who want to be here, and fair to the people who have been \nin line to become citizens in this country sometime down the road.\n  Today, however, our immigration system is, by most standards, broken. \nIt is not effective in bringing in the talent we need and maintaining a \nstrong and vibrant economy. Our immigration system does not give \nemployers the assurances that someone they want to hire is actually \nhere legally and eligible to do some work. That system does not always \nfocus our security efforts on the real risks and on those who come here \nwith the intent to do us harm.\n  Finally, our immigration system does not address in a pragmatic or \nfair way the fate of 11 million undocumented people living in our \ncountry right now, many of whom came here as children and, like us, \nknow no home other than America.\n  With that said, how do we modernize our immigration laws in a way \nthat is fair, practicable, and makes our Nation more secure, physically \nand also economically? I have always said the key to immigration reform \nis border security.\n  You will recall the last major comprehensive effort this body made to \nreform our broken immigration system about 6 years ago fell apart \nbecause a number of my colleagues here claimed, with some \njustification, that our borders were not secure enough. Many of my \ncolleagues claim, justly or not, that the border is still too porous, \nand we would be having the same debate 20 years later because of border \ncontrol, the lack of it.\n  People ask themselves are our borders secure enough to ensure we \ndon't end up having this same debate 20 or 30 years down the line. The \nanswer, for many of my colleagues and for a lot of Americans was, no, \nthey are not. That was then; this is now.\n  Six years later, a number of people will still argue our borders are \nnot secure enough to even try to move forward with these reforms. I \ndisagree. When I hear our colleagues ask are our borders more secure, I \nam often reminded of a friend who says, when you ask him how he is \ndoing: Compared to what?\n  Some say our borders won't be secure until we stop every single \nperson who tries to get across illegally. I think it is clear this is \nnot a realistic goal or expectation.\n  Let's go back a little bit in time. Take, for example, the border \nbetween East Germany and West Germany, most famously the Berlin Wall. \nThis was perhaps the most secure border our world has ever seen, with \nroughly 100 miles of concrete, electrified razor wire, and a 100-yard-\nwide kill zone guarded by some 30,000 soldiers. Still people made it \nsafely across this highly secured border every year. In fact, a recent \nreport by the Council of Foreign Relations concluded that East Germany \nonly stopped about 95 percent of those who tried to cross the border \nand enter West Germany. Even a ruthless regime willing to kill its \ncitizens couldn't stop desperate people in search of a better life. I \ndon't think any reasonable person believes we should try to replicate \nthe East German border strategy.\n  What is the right comparison? I suggest the right comparison is what \nour borders looked like in 2007. Are our borders more secure today than \nthey were then? Are they a lot more secure or just a little bit? I \nthink they are a lot more secure.\n  How do I know? I have the privilege of chairing the Senate Committee \non Homeland Security and Government Affairs. We held a number of \nhearings this year on border security. Even more importantly I have had \nthe opportunity to visit our borders with Mexico and actually up in \nCanada, along with Senator John McCain, Congressman Michael McCaul of \nTexas, Secretary Janet Napolitano, all kinds of local officials, \nsheriffs, police, mayors, and other folks. About 3 years ago, I visited \nthe California border and earlier this year Arizona and Texas and up in \nMichigan. My goal was to get a firsthand look at what is working, what \nis not, and what more we ought to do to secure the border further--and \nwe can.\n\n  Based on what I have seen, there is overwhelming success, though, \nthat our borders are more secure than they have been--probably have \never been--and certainly more secure than they were in 2007. I saw \nparts of our border that were overrun with undocumented immigrants as \nrecently as 2006, when the Border Patrol agents I met with told me they \nused to arrest more than 1,000 people every single day trying to get \ninto this country illegally. Think about that, 1,000 people a day. \nToday those same agents told me they have a busy day if they arrest as \nmany as 50 people. Is 50 too many? Yes, it is, but it is not 1,000 \npeople a day.\n  In fact, arrests at the border have reached their lowest levels since \nthe early 1970s. With our putting massive investments in personnel and \ntechnology along the border, we are arresting significantly fewer \npeople, and it is not because we are not on the lookout or trying to \nget those who are coming here.\n  I have a slide of our southern border, from the Pacific to the Gulf \nof Mexico; from California into Arizona, to parts of New Mexico and \nTexas, all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. So four States are divided \ninto about nine different quadrants. We have some interesting numbers. \nIf we look at 1992, the number of people who were arrested was about \n565,000 just south of San Diego. In 2000, in the El Centro area of \nCalifornia, we had about 238,000. Initially, the numbers here in the \nWest were huge. In the Navy, I used to be stationed in San Diego. These \nnumbers were huge. It has sort of drifted this way. I used to go across \nthe border south of San Diego into Mexico, but it is remarkably secure. \nThe challenge now lies way over here and other places as well, but \nreally it lies over here. We have not just Mexicans trying to get \nacross. Maybe the majority of people trying to get across in South \nTexas today are from Central American countries--Guatemala, Honduras, \nand El Salvador.\n  In 2005, a year or two before we debated the last immigration reform \nproposal, Border Patrol was arresting, in this Yuma section right here, \n138,000 people. Today, the number is 6,500. Think about that, from \n138,000 down to 6,500.\n  Let's look at the Tucson sector. In the year 2000, we were arresting \nover 600,000, today about 120,000. In the El Paso sector in 1993 we \nwere arresting close to 300,000; now it is right around 10,000, and it \nis not because we are not trying. It is not because we don't have a lot \nmore people there, a lot better technology. It is just that the number \nof folks coming across has just significantly diminished.\n  Over here in Texas though, in 1997, there were about one-quarter \nmillion coming across and getting arrested and today still about \n97,000. So there is still a good number--too high a number trying to \nget across--and we are arresting a number of those.\n  But the change in these numbers--the dramatic reductions from 1997 to \ntoday--is not an accident. This precipitous drop in arrests is the \ndirect result\n\n[[Page S4398]]\n\nof the unprecedented investments we have made in securing our borders \nover the past decade.\n  You don't have to take my word for it. Here is what several of our \nborder officials and residents who are true experts have to say about \nthe progress we have made in securing our borders. I will just quote a \nfew. I talked to a whole lot more. Some of my colleagues have been down \nthere and talked to a bunch of local officials in those States too. \nHere is what the mayor of San Antonio said earlier this year before the \nHouse Judiciary Committee. Mayor Julian Castro of San Antonio said:\n\n       In Texas, we know firsthand that this administration has \n     put more boots on the ground along the border than at any \n     other time in our history, which has led to unprecedented \n     success in removing dangerous individuals with criminal \n     records.\n\n  The mayor of Nogales, AZ, one of the places we visited earlier this \nyear with Secretary Napolitano, said:\n\n       We used to have street chases all the time. . . . Now all \n     those things are gone, something you don't even hear about.\n\n  That was about 2 or 3 months ago.\n  A woman named Veronica Escobar, a county judge in El Paso, said this \nnear the end of 2011:\n\n       Those of us who actually live along the border know \n     otherwise. El Paso, the largest city along the United States-\n     Mexico border, is also one of the country's safest cities and \n     the heart of a vibrant bi-national community.\n\n  So the truth is we spend more on border security each year--about $18 \nbillion--according to a recent Migration Policy Institute report--about \n$18 billion a year--than we spend on the rest of Federal law \nenforcement activities combined. Think about that for a moment. We \nspend more on border enforcement, border security, than we spend on the \nFBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, and the U.S. Marshals combined--\ncombined.\n  Since 2000, the Border Patrol alone has more than doubled in size. \nIts funding has almost quadrupled. We have built 650 miles more of \nfencing along the border. That is roughly one-third of our Mexican \nborder. To better secure parts of our border where a fence might not be \nas effective, we deployed a number of what I like to call force \nmultipliers, and I will talk about some of those later on.\n  When I am talking about technology that will help the Border Patrol \ndo their job more effectively, in some parts of the border it might be \nradar, it might be drones, in others it might be cameras, towers or \nhand-held systems. For example, in the past couple of years, we have \ndeployed roughly 350 land-based towers, vehicle-based towers with \nadvanced cameras and radar. We fly more than 270 aircraft and \nhelicopters to monitor a 2,000-mile border, and we are also using \ndrones and the lighter-than-air assets--blimps.\n\n  But you don't have to take my word for it. I think a picture is worth \na thousand words, and I have a couple of pictures here of some slides I \nwish to show to take a look at what the border looked like 7 years ago, \nin 2006, and what it looks like today.\n  This is one of my favorite pictures. It is a picture of a ranch. I \nbelieve this is a ranch in Arizona. Look at this. It looks almost like \na junkyard, almost like a place where people come to drop their trash, \nand that is what happened, because every day hundreds of people would \ncome through here, through this ranch, to cross the border, and this is \nwhat they left behind. Here is the same place today.\n  This is not because the folks trying to get into our country have \nsomehow gotten an environmental conscience and they do not litter as \nmuch. That is not what is going on here. They are not coming through as \nmuch. So if you ever hear: Is our border more secure? Does it make a \ndifference? I would say go to that ranch and take a look. We have spent \na lot of money on infrastructure.\n  This is Douglas, AZ. We were there, along the southern border of \nArizona, and this is a before shot. This is the same landscape and what \nwe see today. Actually, it looks like we have a couple of fences, a \nroad in between, and all kinds of detectors. This is what it looked \nlike before. So we have made huge investments for miles and miles and \nmiles.\n  We have something from the Yuma sector in Arizona. The Yuma sector \nwas out of control. Border-wise, I think we had the most illegal border \ncrossings than at any stretch of the border in 2006. Starting in 2006, \nthey built more than 100 miles of fencing, just in this one sector \nalone--in the Yuma sector--where it made a lot of sense. There is an \naccess road so the Border Patrol agents can get where they need to go \nquickly. We have deployed a bunch of cameras as well. Today, Yuma is \nthe most controlled part of our border, as I reported those numbers \nearlier. There is a dramatic reduction in the numbers of folks coming \nthrough.\n  This is another place in Arizona, in Nogales. We met with a bunch of \nlocal officials there as well. This is a lovely piece of landscape \nright here. This may not be as lovely, but what is different here is an \naccess road. We can't put a Border Patrol agent every 100 feet along \nthe border, but what we can do is get them where they need to go more \nquickly. One of the ways to do that is with access roads, and this is \none of those near Nogales, AZ.\n  This is another shot. This is Deming, NM. What it shows is what the \narea looked like in 2007 along the border. It doesn't look too hard to \nget across, and it wasn't. This is what it looks like today: lighting, \nthe walls, ways for the Border Patrol to move quickly if they need to. \nIt is just a different place today, and the numbers will demonstrate \nthat has made a difference.\n  Here we are in Del Rio, TX. There is a lot of water here. In 2008, \nthere was literally no infrastructure whatsoever in Del Rio, TX. That \nwas about 2008, and this is a couple of years later. You could \nliterally walk across the border and you didn't know it. You didn't \nknow if you were in the United States or Mexico. Today you know it, and \nwe built significant fencing and all those all-important access roads \nand now have a far more secure border.\n  This is a place called Marfa, TX. This is a border in the western \npart of Texas, actually near Big Bend National Park. In 2006, the \nborder was wide open. This is lovely, isn't it? There were some people, \nparticularly some of the locals, who were opposed to fencing. The \nreason why is because this now looks like this. But the problem with \nthis is people were able to literally walk across, wade across, in \nsubstantial numbers. They do not do that anymore. We gave up some \nscenic beauty, but at the same time we have a whole lot of security we \nnever had before.\n  Here is Harlingen, TX. We were there a month or two ago. This is the \neastern part of Texas, closer to the Gulf of Mexico, but we see a part \nof the border that as recently as 4 years ago, right here, you could \nliterally walk across it and you wouldn't know it. You could walk right \nacross, and a lot of people walked right across it. This is what it \nlooks like now, with fencing and access roads. They don't walk across \nit without them knowing it and, frankly, oftentimes without us knowing \nit.\n  This is one of my favorite pictures. This is a fence, and this is a \nfence, in this case, that at least stopped this vehicle. A friend of \nmine likes to say let me build a 20-foot fence and someone will come \nalong and build a 21-foot ladder. Someone tried to be very clever and \nfind a way to get this vehicle over this fence. I don't know if that is \na Jeep, but they tried to get it across and they didn't quite make it. \nSo people trying to get across are pretty ingenious, and they will try \nto build that 21-foot ladder or in this case a different type of \nladder. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. In this case it \nworked to stop them.\n  I also wish to show some of the force multipliers that are helping to \nenhance security efforts at our borders and ports of entry. These are \npictures of just a small sample of the massive improvements we have \nmade along the southern border from California to Texas. It shows what \nany fairminded person who has been to the border in recent years can \ntell us; that is, the investments we have made are actually paying off. \nI hope so. As much money as we have spent, I would hate to think we \nspent it without getting any kind of result.\n  One of the investments we have made are the drones. We don't have a \nhuge number, but I think we have four of them in Arizona, a couple in \nTexas, and I think they have a couple up along the northern border, \nmaybe North Dakota, and a couple over in Florida. But we will talk a \nlittle more about these.\n\n[[Page S4399]]\n\n  Let me just say, if you put up a drone and you put a VADER system on \nit, they can fly at high altitudes, they can fly day or night, they can \nsee in the rain, they can see in the dark, they can see when the Sun is \nshining. They are an incredibly effective asset when they fly. We will \ntalk later about the problem that they don't always fly. They do not \nfly when the wind is more than 15 knots. We have four of these in \nArizona, with only one that has a VADER system. Of the four we have, \nonly about two of them are flying most of the time. They only fly 5 \ndays a week. So one of the keys, if we are going to use the drones, \nlet's make sure we have VADER on all of them and let's make sure they \nare able to fly more than 5 days a week, more than 16 hours a day, and \nlet's properly resource these aircraft.\n  Old technology. The drone is pretty new. This is old technology. \nBlimps and dirigibles have been around forever. Some of you may recall \nseeing a video of blimps such as this from Kabul, Afghanistan. I talked \non the phone this week with a fellow who is now Ambassador to Mexico. \nHis name is Tony Wayne. He used to be the No. 2 guy in our Embassy in \nAfghanistan.\n  I asked him: How do we use blimps in Kabul? We use them in Kabul very \neffectively. He said: The great thing about blimps is you can put them \nup in bad weather, when it is windy. You can't fly more than 15 knots, \nbut these stay up and don't run out of gas. You can have more \nsurveillance systems with pods on these than you can on a lot of the \nother aircraft we are flying. We use them with great effect in Kabul, \nKandahar, Afghanistan, and other places, and we ought to be able to do \nbetter with them on the border with Mexico. They can be a great force \nmultiplier as well.\n  This is a little plane called a Cessna C-206, and it has enough room \nto carry two people. I think we have about 17 of them. We saw one in \nArizona, and we saw a bunch more in Texas. It is really not cutting-\nedge technology; it is just cost-effective. You can put these planes \nout for a while, and they don't use much gas. They are a good platform \nfor surveillance.\n  Unfortunately, out of the 16 or 17 that we have, only 1 of them has a \nsurveillance system that enables us to look down and find out what is \ngoing on on the ground. It is sort of like sending out an airplane \ndoing maritime surveillance when occasionally we do search and rescue \nmissions over the vast ocean with binoculars, looking for somebody in a \nlittle skiff or in a life preserver. It is like looking for a needle in \nthe haystack. When we fly these planes, we ought to have them fully \nresourced with modern surveillance equipment and people operating them.\n  We have boats, and we have helicopters. We have boats that go fast \nalong the Rio Grande River. We need boats that go fast. We need the \nsame thing off the coast of California. Fortunately, we have them.\n  We don't have enough helicopters. We talked to some folks in East \nTexas. They basically are flying three different kinds of helicopters--\none is fairly modern, and a couple others are not. The only one the \nBorder Patrol is really interested in is the one that is fairly modern. \nIt is reliable, has good surveillance equipment.\n  What we were told by some people is this: If you are going to send us \nthe older, less reliable helicopters without the technology, don't send \nthem. What we need to have is more of the successful helicopters, the \nones in demand, where it will actually be a real force multiplier.\n  I thought this was an interesting slide. This is with night vision \ngoggles. We also have the ability to use the VADERS, the systems we put \nin our drones. In the C-206s we fly, our ground-mounted cameras are \nalong the border. This is nighttime, but this is what we can see today, \nand it is pretty easy to pick people up. If we are going to ever be \nable to figure out how many are getting across, not getting across, we \nneed this; we don't need this. Fortunately we have this, and it is a \nforce multiplier. We need to make sure we use it well.\n  This shows a different series. Some are cameras, some are radar, but \nthey are ground-based. In this case they have an operator. Again, this \nis one that is mounted on a truck bed. It can be moved around. Some are \nmore permanent. Here is one that is more permanent. You have the Border \nPatrol here right at the fence and the ability to look north, south, \neast, and west.\n  These are just a couple examples of force multipliers. We have all \nthese men and women on the border. We have basically doubled the border \npatrol. How do we make them more effective without just adding more and \nmore bodies between the ports of entry? We can do it with this kind of \ntechnology. We can do it effectively, and I think we can do it in a \ncost-effective way. That is what we ought to do.\n  The bill we are going to be debating over the next couple of weeks \nsets aside an additional $6.5 billion for border security on top of the \n$18 billion we already spend today, every year. The $6.5 billion in the \nbill will be used to add another 3,500 officers--not between the ports \nof entry, these big ports. We are not talking about water ports. We are \ntalking about land-based ports of entry where a lot of commerce--cars, \ntrucks, pedestrians--is getting in, and big commerce is going through \nthose ports of entry as well.\n  But the legislation wisely could use some of that extra $6.5 billion \nto hire another 3,500 officers to work in our ports of entry, to build \nnew infrastructure at the ports of entry and make them better, to \nsecure new surveillance systems, and for the aerial support for the \nBorder Patrol.\n  For the first time in our Nation's history, we have set a statutory \ngoal for the Border Patrol in this legislation to arrest or turn back \nto Mexico some 90 percent of all those trying to get across illegally. \nSo if we have 100 people trying to get in on a given day at a \nparticular spot, the idea is to know how many are actually trying to \nget in and how many are either detained or actually turned back. The \nidea is to make sure we are going to have at least a 90-percent success \nrate. It is a tough law, and it ensures accountability.\n  Do you remember what I said about Germany? In Germany, with all the \nhundreds of miles of concrete and 30,000 soldiers, their effective rate \nwas 95 percent. We are talking about something very close to that--90 \npercent--without doing the kinds of stuff they did in East Germany.\n  Lastly, the bill that is before us calls for achieving persistent \nsurveillance over the entire border so we can know with a high degree \nof certainty how many people are trying to cross it illegally. Given \nthe length of our borders and how rugged and how varied it is, this \ngoal will be a challenge--and a costly one--to achieve, but it is not \nimpossible.\n  As I learned from my trips to the border, there is simply no one-\nsize-fits-all solution for securing our border. It really depends on \nthe terrain, which varies widely along the border region. That is why \nwe need to systemically identify the best technology to allow us to use \nour frontline agents--the Border Patrol--more effectively and give them \nthe tools they tell us they need to be successful.\n  One specific thing I have seen on my trips along the border with the \nC-206--and just think about it. You have an airplane. You put it up to \nfly for 3 or 4 hours, and you can send it out with one person looking \nthrough binoculars or a surveillance system with lights out. That works \nin the day or the night, rain or not, and it gives us great images and \na great capability.\n  We also need to make sure the Department of Homeland Security has the \nflexibility to deploy resources when and where it makes sense. For \nexample, as we talked earlier about the blimps that are tethered, they \nhave proven to be enormously successful in northern Afghanistan. And \nfor anybody who doubts that, I urge you to give our Ambassador to \nMexico a call, who was our No. 2 guy in Afghanistan the last time I was \nthere a couple of years ago. As I said earlier, the blimps are old in \nterms of the technology, but they can handle a lot of surveillance \nstuff and equipment, and they do great work. In some places, they will \nmake a lot of sense; in other cases, maybe not so much.\n  But the Department of Homeland Security needs to be able to swiftly \nput in place innovative tools like blimps when factors on the ground \nchange or when they see the need for a new approach to securing certain \nportions of our border. I don't think we ought to be hamstringing them \nwith mandates\n\n[[Page S4400]]\n\nthat make them less effective in carrying out their missions, including \nrequiring additional fences in areas where the fencing doesn't make \nmuch sense. In a lot of places, it does. There are 600 miles or so \nwhere it does, and there are more places that it does. But there are \nalso some places where it makes more sense to resource a drone, to have \nland-based radar and cameras, where it makes more sense to fly the \n206s, to have helicopters with the right kind of surveillance equipment \non them and be able to move people along.\n\n  I want to mention some other cost-effective technology. We saw some \nreally interesting hand-held devices that allow the border agents to \nsee in the dark. I also saw something at one of the ports of entry. It \nwas actually about the size of my Blackberry. I remember standing at \nthe ports of entry where they have literally thousands of cars and \ntrucks and vehicles and pedestrians coming across a day. But before the \ntruck or vehicle ever got to the border, the officer had a device that \nwould tell her the truck that was coming through, the history of the \ntruck that was coming through, the driver who was in the truck and the \nhistory of that driver coming through, what should be in the truck, and \nwhat was the cargo in the truck in recent months. This was up in \nDetroit too. But one of the officers there said this is a game changer.\n  As I mentioned earlier, this bill we are debating appropriates about \n$6.5 billion to continue to build on the progress we have made and \nachieve the ambitious goals it sets for the Department. That is good \nnews. My goal is to make sure that much of this funding is devoted to \nthese force multipliers to help our boots on the ground work smarter \nand be more effective. I don't think we need to micromanage the \nprocess.\n  We have been joined by the majority leader. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend yielding.\n  Mr. President, I read into the Record in some detail today a letter \nthat he wrote with Senator Leahy talking about what has gone on in \nrecent years with border security. Our country is very fortunate to \nhave this good man leading our Homeland Security Committee.\n  There are some Senators I don't know as much about as I do about this \nman, but we have been together since 1982. He had a sabbatical for 8 \nyears to run the State of Delaware as Governor, but other than that, we \nhave been locked in arms, moving forward.\n  I appreciate very much his yielding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/12/senate-section/article/S4400-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today for the sad occasion of \npaying tribute to a brave and honorable police officer from my home \nState of Kentucky who has fallen in the line of duty. Officer Jason \nEllis, a seven-year veteran of the Bardstown Police Department, was \ntragically killed on May 25. He was 33 years old.\n  Officer Ellis worked as a field-training officer and a canine \nofficer; with his police dog, Figo, he fought illegal drug use in \nBardstown. Bardstown Police Chief Rick McCubbin described Officer Ellis \nas one of Bardstown's top officers and credited him with making a \nserious dent in the town's drug problem. Chief McCubbin also said these \nwords: ``[He] paid the ultimate sacrifice doing what he loved: being a \npolice officer.''\n  Jason Ellis, a native of Cincinnati, OH, attended the University of \nthe Cumberlands in Williamsburg, KY, where he was a star baseball \nplayer. He set records for all time career hits, doubles, home runs, \nand career games played, the last of which is still a record at the \nschool. He played minor league baseball in the Cincinnati Reds system.\n  Even as a star on the diamond, however, coaches and teammates \nremember Jason Ellis talking about becoming a law enforcement officer. \nHis wife, Amy, says: ``He was always a go-getter. . . He was dedicated \nto his job and he wanted to clean the streets up. And that was the way \nto get the drugs off the streets.''\n  On May 30, Officer Ellis was laid to rest at Highview Cemetery in \nNelson County. Fellow law enforcement officers from across the \nCommonwealth as well as Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Illinois came to pay \ntheir respects, and hundreds of police cruisers made up the funeral \nprocession. Over a thousand people filled the church sanctuary, with \nmore standing along the aisles, to show their gratitude for Officer \nEllis's service and sacrifice.\n  It is incredibly moving to see the broad outpouring of support from \nKentuckians and the law enforcement community for Officer Ellis, which \nI pray was of some comfort to Officer Ellis's family at such a \ndifficult time. Officer Ellis leaves behind his wife Amy and two sons, \nHunter and Parker.\n  It can't be stated enough, Mr. President, how deep our admiration and \nrespect is for every man and woman who wears a police uniform and makes \na solemn vow to defend the lives of others, even at the cost of their \nown. Police officers provide stability and justice in our civil \nsociety. I know my colleagues in the U.S. Senate join me in extending \nthe deepest sympathies to the family of Officer Jason Ellis and the \nmembers of the Bardstown Police Department. We are very sorry for their \nloss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/12/senate-section/article/S4400-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING PETE VONACHEN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a generous, \ngenuine Illinoisan we lost this week.\n  Those of us who have watched and listened to Chicago Cubs' games for \nsome time can easily recall Harry Caray. His booming voice was \ninstantly recognizable as the voice of the Cubs--and fans fondly \nremember his celebrations of their triumphs and his deeply felt sorrow \nat more than a few of their disappointments.\n  Some of us may even recall his bright voice welcoming one of his \nclosest friends to the broadcasting booth with the words: ``and here \ntoday, from Peoria, Pete Vonachen!''\n  I am sad to say that Pete Vonachen passed away--peacefully--this \nweek. Pete was an enthusiastic, colorful, and memorable person. He \nloved Peoria, baseball, and the Cubs. You could tell that he bled Cubs \nblue--especially, as one friend explained, in 2005. That was the year \nthat the White Sox won the World Series.\n  After running a successful restaurant and making his name in the \nPeoria business community, he bought the local minor league team and \nstruck an affiliation with his favorite Chicago team. The Peoria Chiefs \nsoon had the highest attendance of any team in the Midwest League. A \ndecade later, they renamed the ballpark they called home to Pete \nVonachen Stadium. They even put a statue of him just inside the main \ngate of their new stadium.\n  That statue was surrounded with flowers and baseballs placed by fans \nMonday night as the Chiefs took the field against the Quad Cities River \nBandits. And, after a moment of silence to honor his memory, the Chiefs \nwon. The Cubs held a moment of silence for him as well at Wrigley Field \nMonday.\n  Pete Vonachen will be missed by his family, his many friends and \nthose who loved him in Peoria, and the entire Illinois baseball \ncommunity.\n  We will remember Pete and his tremendous line, ``Have a great day, \nand keep swingin'.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/12/senate-section/article/S4400-4", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4400-S4401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AMIR HEKMATI\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in Flint, MI, a family anxiously awaits \nword of when their son and brother will return to them. For more than \n600 days, Amir Hekmati has been imprisoned in Iran, accused of spying \nfor the United States. His capture, detention, trial and sentencing \nhave brought great anxiety to his loved ones here in the United States.\n  Amir, who spent much of his childhood in Michigan and whose family \nstill lives there, was visiting relatives in Iran in August of 2011 \nwhen he was arrested by Iranian police. In January of 2012, an Iranian \ntrial court sentenced him to death. But on March 5, 2012, Iran's \nSupreme Court overturned that sentence, ruled Amir's trial had been \nflawed and ordered a new trial.\n\n[[Page S4401]]\n\n  That was more than a year ago, and yet Amir's family still has little \nclue as to his fate. Amir has been held for much of his captivity in \nsolitary confinement. He has not been granted access to his Iranian \nattorney and has been allowed only limited contact with family. \nSwitzerland, which oversees U.S. interests in Iran, has not been \ngranted consular access to him.\n  There is no evidence that Amir was engaged in any espionage activity \nwhile visiting his family in Iran. There is every reason to believe--\nincluding the ruling of the Iranian Supreme Court--that the information \nused against Amir in his original trial was deeply flawed. A videotaped \n``confession'' broadcast on Iranian television was obviously edited. \nIranian officials have yet to make clear what charges, if any, Amir \nfaces, or when he might be re-tried on those charges, even though more \nthan a year has passed since his original sentence was overturned. \nHumanitarian and human rights groups including Amnesty International \nhave called for Amir's release. So have a number of U.S.-based Islamic \norganizations, including Islamic Circle of North America, Islamic \nSociety of North America, Muslim Public Affairs, Council, Council on \nAmerican-Islamic Relations of Michigan, the Council of Islamic \nOrganizations of Michigan, Islamic House of Wisdom, the Muslim Center \nof Detroit and the Michigan Muslim Community Council.\n  Recently, Amir's family has received some limited communication with \nhim. He has been able to send them letters, and an uncle in Iran has \nbeen given permission to visit Amir in prison. This limited contact has \nbeen welcome, but has only increased the family's desire to secure \nAmir's return. This desire is all the stronger because Amir's father, a \ncollege professor in Flint, has been diagnosed with terminal cancer. \nAli Hekmati faces his illness wondering if he will ever again be able \nto see his son.

Mr. President, I wish to speak to my amendment No. 1079 to \nthe farm bill. This amendment--with Republican and Democratic support--\nwould simply increase the authorization for the Local and Regional \nProcurement Program from $40 million per year to $60 million per year.\n  It would increase the flexibility for aid providers to use locally \nand regionally purchased food, which is an important element of U.S. \nfood assistance. There is no score because we are simply increasing the \nauthorization for this discretionary program.\n  The Local and Regional Procurement Program is based on a pilot \nprogram authorized in the 2008 farm bill to test projects that could \nhelp get food aid to hungry populations faster and more efficiently by \nsourcing food in the communities and regions closest to those in need.\n  USDA and Cornell University have studied the pilot program and found \nit has been able to provide aid quickly and efficiently while also \nsupporting development of food markets in low-income countries. This \namendment would simply increase the authorized funding level so we can \ninvest additional resources in this successful program.\n  My amendment is supported by 20 groups, including American Jewish \nWorld Service, Bread for the World, CARE, Catholic Relief Services, \nChurch World Service, Columban Center for Advocacy and Outreach, \nEvangelical Lutheran Church in America, Institute for Agriculture and \nTrade Policy, InterAction, Lutheran World Relief, Mennonite Central \nCommittee U.S. Washington Office, Mercy Corps, Modernizing Foreign \nAssistance Network--MFAN--ONE, Oxfam America, Partners in Health, Save \nthe Children, United Church of Christ Justice and Witness Ministries, \nUnited Methodist Church-General Board of Church and Society, and World \nFood Program USA.\n  I wish to thank the cosponsors of this amendment--Republicans and \nDemocrats--for supporting this effort, including Senators Johanns, \nDurbin, Isakson, and Leahy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/12/senate-section/article/S4401-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4401-S4402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND REFORM\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about two \npieces of legislation that I have introduced. They are the Educational \nAccountability and State Flexibility Act and the Early Intervention for \nGraduation Success Act. I intend to speak with my colleagues about \nthese bills in the coming days and weeks, but I would like to take a \nmoment now to provide an overview of my thoughts.\n  We have all heard from our constituents--teachers, principals, \nsuperintendents, school board members, and parents--about the No Child \nLeft Behind Act. Clearly, the law has some good things. Americans \ndeserve accountability for how their Federal tax dollars are spent, \neven when they are spent in their local schools. Parents want to know \ntheir local schools can help prepare their children for the future. But \nNo Child Left Behind went too far. My bill, the Educational \nAccountability and State Flexibility Act, seeks to maintain reasonable \naccountability to taxpayers and parents while providing greater \nflexibility to States and schools to meet our children's needs and \nlocal communities' individual circumstances.\n  As we know, the Senate HELP Committee has again begun to address the \nneed to reform No Child Left Behind. A markup of the Strengthening \nAmerica's Schools Act began yesterday, Tuesday, June 11, 2013. I am \nhopeful the committee can come together to reduce, not expand, the \nFederal government's role in our local schools. I know several of my \ncolleagues share that hope, including Senator Alexander, who offered a \nsubstitute amendment to reduce the Federal mandates in the \nStrengthening America's Schools Act. I voted for that amendment and \nothers like it. Since the Alexander amendment and several similar \namendments failed, I hope my colleagues will review my Educational \nAccountability and School Flexibility Act. It is intended to offer some \nideas for continuing the conversation.\n  My bill would amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--also \nknown as No Child Left Behind--to do the following: No. 1: Eliminate \nadequate yearly progress--AYP; No. 2: Allow States to stick with an \napproved waiver plan if that is their choice; No. 3: Require States, \nnot the Federal government, to determine each school's level of success \nin helping kids succeed based on broad, flexible parameters, publish \nthe results, reward what schools are doing right, and help the schools \nthat need help; No. 4: Require States to diagnose why a school is not \nimproving to help fix what is wrong in a way that will work for that \nschool and community--not implement a school turnaround model mandated \nby the Federal government; No. 6: Prohibit the Secretary from \nprioritizing or mandating any school turnaround strategy; No. 7: \nProhibit the Secretary of Education from approving or disapproving a \nState's decisions about standards, tests, and accountability while \nmaking sure the public can access experts' opinions on the plans; No. \n8: Eliminate the Federal ``highly qualified teacher'' requirements and \nlet States decide what makes teachers highly effective; No. 9: Continue \nto ask the low-performing schools to tutor students who are not \nsucceeding in schools; No. 10: Continue to allow public school choice \nas long as a higher performing public school is available and kids \nwould not have to ride long hours on dangerous roads to get there; and \nNo. 11: Respect the voice and expertise of our Nation's indigenous \nfirst peoples regarding what helps Native children succeed in school.\n  I have also reintroduced my Early Intervention for Graduation Success \nAct with a few changes from last Congress. I hope my colleagues will \ntake some time to review this legislation.\n  This legislation would, if enacted, amend the current school dropout \nprevention provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It \nwould focus attention on identifying and\n\n[[Page S4402]]\n\nhelping students who are at risk to not graduate from high school as \nearly as prekindergarten and through elementary and middle school.\n  Some may ask, Why are you concentrating on toddlers and elementary \nschool children when you are trying to solve the high school dropout \ncrisis facing our Nation? Why not focus attention and our Nation's \nscarce resources on high school students, or even middle school \nstudents?\n  The reason is simple. Early on is when children's troubles in school \nbegin, and an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. High school \nand middle school students do not just wake up one day and say, I think \nI will drop out of school today. Twenty-five years of research tells us \nthat dropping out is a long process of frustration, alienation, and \neven boredom--it is not a sudden decision. We know that students with \ndisabilities, minority and poor children, and students whose home lives \nare, in all sorts of ways, difficult have lower graduation rates than \ntheir peers. The challenges children face today are all too prevalent, \nand we know the factors that make it harder for them to succeed in \nschool. We know this.\n  It only makes sense, then, that we rework the program intended to \nhelp schools increase their graduation rates so that it actually helps \nschools help children when we can make the most difference. We need to \nact before these children have fought for years just to stay afloat, \nand before they are too tired, frustrated, alienated, and angry to \nfight anymore.\n  But I have also heard from some who asked that my legislation include \na stronger focus on secondary schools, knowing that today we have \nmiddle and high schools that are struggling to keep their students in \nschool and on a path to success. So I have done that.\n  I have also heard from my State. They shared concerns with me that \nthe cost to create a database combining data from multiple State \nagencies that have information that will inform schools as to students' \nrisk factors for dropping out--participation in public assistance \nprograms, being homeless or a foster child, having an incarcerated \nparent, etc.--would be too high. So, knowing that it still makes sense \nto help our educators better identify students who are at risk, I have \namended my bill to just ask the State to help schools access this \ninformation while following FERPA and HIPAA rules for privacy of that \ndata.\n  We all want our schools to be successful. We all want our children to \nbe successful. I am hopeful my colleagues will take a good look at both \nof these bills, and that they will help to move the conversation \nforward about how we can help reach our goals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/12/senate-section/article/S4402-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL STEVEN R. RUDDER\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I rise to honor a true patriot \nand native son of Canton, CT. After more than 3 years of service as the \nlegislative assistant to the Commandant of the Marine Corps, Brig. Gen. \nSteven R. Rudder is deservedly moving up to assume the responsibilities \nof commanding general, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. On this occasion, I \nwish to recognize General Rudder's noble service and dedication to \nfostering the warm relationship between the U.S. Marine Corps and the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Commissioned in June of 1984, General Rudder is well-known and \nrespected as a true leader and warrior. In addition to serving as a \nweapons and tactics instructor, he has distinguished himself in combat \nand effectively commanded HML/A-167 and Marine Air Group 26.\n  Over the last 3 years, General Rudder has been instrumental in \nfacilitating the oversight responsibilities of the Senate. Known for \nhis comprehensive knowledge of legislative issues and the operational \nrequirements of the Marine Corps, he ensured that the Senate Armed \nServices Committee was armed with timely information on Operation \nEnduring Freedom and other forward-deployed Marine forces, as well as \nnumerous Marine Corps programs to include the Joint Strike Fighter, the \nAmphibious Combat Vehicle, and the MV-22 Osprey. Moreover, General \nRudder worked to recognize the contributions of the Montford Point \nMarines--the first African Americans who entered into service with the \nMarine Corps during World War II--with a Congressional Gold Medal.\n  In 2011 I had the unique privilege of being the guest of honor at the \nU.S. Marine Corps Sunset Parade, hosted by General Rudder. It was a \nglorious display of military precision and a truly enjoyable and moving \nevent. I join many past and present members of Congress in my gratitude \nand appreciation for General Rudder's outstanding leadership. I invite \nmy Senate colleagues to wish him well, along with his wife Holly, as he \ntransfers to Okinawa, Japan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/12/senate-section/article/S4402-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4402-S4403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       ALASKA AIR NATIONAL GUARD\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have the honor today to \nrecognize five great Americans who valiantly risked their lives \nmultiple times in the service of their country. CPT Christopher Keen, \nMSgt. Sergeant Chad Moore, TSgt. Christopher Harding, SSgt. William \nCenna, and SSgt. Sergeant Nickolas Watson are members of the Air \nNational Guard from the State of Alaska who serve with the 212th Rescue \nSquadron from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska. I'd like to tell \nyou about some of the heroic actions taken by these men in the summer \nof 2012, when they were deployed to Afghanistan.\n  Captain Keen, Master Sergeant Moore, Tech Sergeant Harding, Staff \nSergeant Cenna, and Staff Sergeant Watson are assigned to an Air \nNational Guard unit that specializes in dangerous medical evacuation \nmissions. Pararescue Jumpers, or PJs, train to be inserted into the \nmost hazardous and precarious situations to save lives. They learn to \noperate in the extreme cold and harsh terrain. As a matter of fact, \nStaff Sergeant Cenna was part of a five-member team to summit Denali \nabout a month ago on May 9, 2013. PJs train on some of the most cutting \nedge equipment and master complicated medical procedures. If that is \nnot enough, they prepare to do this job in the face of an enemy that, \nwhen they are plunged into the heart of a battle, can appear from any \ndirection.\n  In order to fully understand the valorous actions of these five men \nin 2012, I must begin the story in April 2011. Staff Sergeant Cenna, \nwho you will hear about again, was part of a rescue team tasked to \nrecover two U.S. Army pilots downed in the Tagab Valley, Afghanistan. \nAfter dropping Sergeant Cenna and his teammate at the crash site, \nmembers of the aircrew were injured by enemy fire and forced to leave \nthe team without overhead coverage. On the ground, insurgents began \nvoicing their intent to take individuals hostage and Sergeant Cenna \nbegan taking enemy fire. A six-hour firefight ensued, and Sergeant \nCenna maintained complete situational awareness while relaying critical \ninformation to attack helicopters above. Risking his life repeatedly, \nSergeant Cenna's actions directly contributed to eliminating the threat \nand most importantly, enabled the recovery of the downed American \npilot, a killed in action infantryman, and another critically wounded \nsoldier from enemy territory. For his gallantry and devotion to duty on \nApril 23, 2011, Staff Sergeant Cenna was awarded the Silver Star.\n  Just over a year later, on July 29, 2012, Staff Sergeant Cenna was \nagain deployed to Afghanistan. He, along with Tech Sergeant Harding and \nStaff Sergeant Watson, were conducting a mission to evacuate two Danish \nsoldiers near Gereshk, Afghanistan. The Danes had been critically \nwounded and were pinned down in an active firefight. The three-man \npararescue team infiltrated at an unplanned insertion point \napproximately 100 meters from the soldiers. Without hesitation, the PJs \nmaneuvered through a field with possible improvised explosive devices \nand enemy machine gun fire. The team then forded a flowing canal and \nclimbed a 12-foot embankment to reach the wounded Danish soldiers. \nAfter applying lifesaving medical interventions and evacuating them to \nthe transport vehicle, the team was notified of two more critically \nwounded soldiers at the incident site. Exposing themselves to extreme \ndanger again, the team extracted those wounded troopers as well. In all \nthat day, Tech Sergeant Harding, Staff Sergeant Cenna, and Staff \nSergeant Watson saved four lives. Just a\n\n[[Page S4403]]\n\nyear after earning the Silver Star, Staff Sergeant Cenna joined Tech \nSergeant Harding and Staff Sergeant Watson displaying sheer courage \nunder fire and unadulterated, unselfish dedication to their duty, their \ncountry and their brothers in arms.\n  The very next month, on August 8 and 9, 2012, Captain Keen, Master \nSergeant Moore and Staff Sergeant Cenna were operating in support of \nMarines in Alpha Company, 2d Reconnaissance Battalion, near Urmuz, \nAfghanistan. The operation was called Lion's Den. It was during this \noperation that Sergeant Cenna earned his second Bronze Star with Valor. \nCaptain Keen led the insertion and extraction of the Marines into \nunexplored enemy tunnel networks, while combating small arms fire, \nheavy machine gun engagements, mortar attacks and improvised explosive \ndevices. While conducting their primary mission, Captain Keen's \ndismounted patrol was engaged by the enemy, isolating one member of his \npatrol. After observing the enemy firing position was in close \nproximity to women and children, he maneuvered 75 meters to another \nposition, preventing civilian causalities while simultaneously \neliminating threats. Sergeant Moore was also performing his duties of \nlowering and recovering Marines into tunnel systems in order to destroy \nenemy lethal aide. While moving to an objective through a known \nconcentration of improvised explosive devices, a supporting tank struck \nsuch a device. Without regard for his own safety, Sergeant Moore \nmaneuvered with his team's vehicle to rescue the tank crew. He treated \nthe tank crew, and soon after his own vehicle was struck by an \nimprovised explosive device and began receiving enemy mortar fire. \nDespite the dire situation, Sergeant Moore maintained security and \nsafeguarded the disabled tank crew, enabling the success of the \noperation.\n  For their actions in the summer of 2012, all five of these men have \nbeen awarded the Bronze Star with Valor. I wish to thank these great \nmen for their selfless service and dedication to our nation. They are \nall my heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/12/senate-section/article/S4403-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. PIERMARIA ODDONE\n\n Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I stand today to honor Dr. Piermaria \nOddone as he retires after 8 years of exemplary leadership as director \nof the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, also known as Fermilab.\n  As America's premier particle physics laboratory, Fermilab is a point \nof pride for Illinois. For over 45 years it has supported thousands of \nscientists across the country whose research is a priceless \ncontribution to the world's understanding of matter, energy, space, and \ntime. With the appointment of Pier Oddone as director in 2005, Fermilab \nwas placed under the leadership of a visionary who ensured that the \nUnited States would remain a producer of groundbreaking research in \nparticle physics.\n  Under the direction of Dr. Oddone, Fermilab entered a period of \nunparalleled scientific progress. The laboratory launched a new era of \nresearch in high-intensity particle beams, and experimentation on muons \nand neutrinos. It advanced our understanding of dark matter and led the \nPierre Auger Observatory project to study ultra-high-energy cosmic \nrays. Fermilab, in partnership with the State of Illinois, constructed \nthe Illinois Accelerator Research Center. It concluded a 28-year run \nfor the Tevatron collider that discovered the quark. It contributed \ninvaluable resources to the groundbreaking discovery of the Higgs \nboson. Most importantly, however, Fermilab has provided state-of-the-\nart facilities for over 4,000 researchers each year so that they can \ncontinue their work for the advancement of science and society.\n  Dr. Oddone's contributions to the scientific community outside of his \nleadership at Fermilab are no less impressive. Born in Peru, he \nreceived his Ph.D. in physics from Princeton before joining the \nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He quickly rose to become the \nlaboratory's deputy director and was responsible for the scientific \ndevelopment that contributed to many of the lab's successes. As an \nelected member of the National Academy of Sciences in both the United \nStates and Peru, Dr. Oddone has received numerous awards for his work, \nincluding fellowships from the American Physical Society and American \nAcademy of Arts and Sciences. He is a recipient of the Panofsky Award \nfor his invention of the Asymmetric B-Factory particle collider, and is \nknown for his role in the SLAC BaBar collaboration that helped to \ndiscover matter-antimatter asymmetry in B mesons.\n  As my friend Dr. Piermaria Oddone retires from Fermilab, I ask that \nyou join me in honoring an individual who embodies the spirit of \ndiscovery through a shining example of scientific excellence. Thank you \nfor your leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/12/senate-section/article/S4403-2", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/12/senate-section/article/S4403-3", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/12/senate-section/article/S4403-4", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:56 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 251.

A bill to prohibit unauthorized third-party charges on \nwireline telephone bills, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fair \nTelephone Billing Act of 2013. This legislation would protect millions \nof American consumers and businesses from unauthorized charges on their \nwireline telephone bills.\n  In 2011, the Senate Commerce Committee, which I chair, completed a \nyear-long investigation into unauthorized third-party charges on \ntelephone bills, a practice commonly referred to as ``cramming.'' The \ninvestigation confirmed that third-party billing through wireline \ntelephone bills had likely cost American consumers and businesses \nbillions of dollars in unauthorized charges.\n  This legislation will put an end to cramming on wireline bills once \nand for all.\n  Unauthorized third-party charges on telephone bills have plagued \nconsumers for years. Cramming first emerged in the 1990s. Following the \nbreakup of AT and the detariffing of ``billing and collection \nservices'' by the Federal Communications Commission, telephone \ncompanies opened their billing and collection systems to third-party \ncompanies offering a variety of services, some of which were completely \nunrelated to telephone services.\n  For the first time, telephone numbers worked like credit card \nnumbers. Consumers could purchase services with their telephone numbers \nand the charges for these services would later appear on their \ntelephone bills.\n  There has been much debate over the extent to which telephone \ncompanies were required to allow third parties to place charges on \ncustomers' phone bills, but the last of any Federal obligations ended \nin 2007. Since that time, with the exception of a few state \nrequirements, telephone companies have been free to allow, or not \nallow, whatever companies they choose to place third-party charges on \ntheir customers' telephone bills. The telephone companies chose to \nallow all sorts of companies to place charges for all sorts of \nservices.\n  Throughout the 1990s, state and federal law enforcement saw a \ndramatic increase in complaints about unauthorized charges on telephone \nbills. In response, the Federal Communications Commission and the \ntelephone industry created voluntary guidelines to combat cramming.\n  Throughout this same period, Congress also convened hearings on the \nissue, and each time, the telephone industry used these voluntary \nguidelines to argue that congressional action on cramming was not \nneeded. Several bills were introduced, but none were adopted. Now we \nfind ourselves, over a decade later, still discussing cramming. We \ncannot make the same mistake again.\n  In 2010, I opened the Committee's investigation into cramming to \nbetter understand the scope of the cramming problem. The investigation \nshowed that over the past decade, cramming caused extensive financial \nharm to all types of wireline telephone customers, from residences and \nsmall businesses, to government agencies and large companies. All the \nwhile, the largest telephone companies were making large profits, \nlikely generating over $1 billion in revenue by placing third-party \ncharges on their customers' telephone bills.\n  It was shocking to learn that many third-party vendors that were \nplacing charges on telephone bills were illegitimate and appeared to \nhave been created solely to exploit a broken system. Consumers reported \nbeing charged $10 to $30 a month for so-called ``services'' that they \nnever authorized. These included weekly e-mail messages with \n``celebrity gossip'' and ``fashion tips,'' and others completely \nunrelated to wireline telephone services--such as ``online photo \nstorage'' and ``electronic facsimile.'' In some of the most egregious \nexamples, unauthorized charges had been added to the bills for \ntelephone lines dedicated to fire alarms, security systems, bank \nvaults, elevators, and 911 services.\n  The Committee investigation also determined that many of the services \nbeing charged to consumers' telephone bills seemed to serve no \nlegitimate purpose, frequently did not function properly, and were \noften available elsewhere for free.\n  The investigation involved a review of thousands of consumer \ncomplaints and interviews with more than 500 individuals and business \nowners whose\n\n[[Page S4408]]\n\ntelephone bills included charges from third parties. Not one of these \nindividuals or entities believed they had authorized the charges.\n  Further, many of these consumers complained that when they found \nunauthorized charges on their telephone bills, they were unable to get \nthe money refunded, either from the carrier or from the third-party \nvendor. That is unacceptable.\n  In response to the Committee's investigation, the three largest \nwireline telephone companies--AT, Verizon, and CenturyLink--took \npositive steps to eliminate cramming on wireline telephone bills, \nincluding a decision to stop allowing the placement of most third-party \ncharges on wireline telephone bills.\n  The Fair Telephone Billing Act will ensure that all wireline \ntelephone companies and providers of interconnected VoIP services are \nrequired to take the same steps so that cramming on telephone bills \nnever happens again.\n  In short, the bill would prohibit any local exchange carrier or \nprovider of interconnected VoIP services from placing any third-party \ncharge on a customer's bill, unless the charge is for a telephone-\nrelated service or a ``bundled'' service that is jointly marketed or \nsold with a company's telephone service.\n  Under the bill, a telephone company that places prohibited charges on \na customer's bill is responsible for refunding to the customer any \ncharge for services the customer did not authorize.\n  The bill also includes a narrow exception for two categories of \nthird-party billing services: telephone-related services, such as \ncollect calls; and ``bundled'' services, such as satellite television \nservices offered together with phone service. This bill recognizes that \nsuch legitimate types of billing offer substantial benefit to \nconsumers.\n  In recent years, increasing numbers of consumers have transitioned \nfrom traditional wireline telephone service to interconnected VoIP \nservices and more are expected. Since consumers likely do not see a \ndistinction between traditional wireline service and interconnected \nVoIP services, I believe these services need to be included. It is \nimportant to ensure that all telephone customers are offered the same \nprotections from unauthorized charges.\n  It also has become clear that cramming now extends to wireless bills. \nWhen I introduced a similar bill last year, I included provisions that \nwould have directed the Federal Communications Commission to create \nrules to prevent cramming on wireless telephone bills. Since that time, \nthe Senate Commerce Committee has been examining cramming on wireless \nbills, and I believe this issue demands additional attention. I do not \nwant to see in a few years that cramming has simply migrated from \nwireline to wireless. It is important that we examine the extent to \nwhich third-party wireless billing practices raise any issues distinct \nfrom third-party wireline billing practices, so we can best determine \nappropriate policies for protecting against consumer abuses in this \ncontext.\n  Cramming has likely already cost consumers and businesses billions. \nThe Fair Telephone Billing Act would stop practices that Congress, \nregulators, and consumers agree are nothing more than a cover for \nfraud.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1144\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Telephone Billing Act \n     of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) For years, telephone users have complained that their \n     wireline telephone bills included unauthorized third-party \n     charges.\n       (2) This problem, commonly referred to as ``cramming,'' \n     first appeared in the 1990s, after wireline telephone \n     companies opened their billing platforms to an array of \n     third-party vendors offering a variety of services.\n       (3) Since the 1990s, the Federal Communications Commission, \n     the Federal Trade Commission, and State attorneys general \n     have brought multiple enforcement actions against dozens of \n     individuals and companies for engaging in cramming.\n       (4) An investigation by the Committee on Commerce, Science, \n     and Transportation of the Senate confirmed that cramming is a \n     problem of massive proportions and has affected millions of \n     telephone users, costing them billions of dollars in \n     unauthorized third-party charges over the past decade.\n       (5) The Committee showed that third-party billing through \n     wireline telephone numbers has largely failed to become a \n     reliable method of payment that consumers and businesses can \n     use to conduct legitimate commerce.\n       (6) Telephone companies regularly placed third-party \n     charges on their customers' telephone bills without their \n     customers' authorization.\n       (7) Many companies engaged in third-party billing were \n     illegitimate and created solely to exploit the weaknesses in \n     the third-party billing platforms established by telephone \n     companies.\n       (8) In the last decade, millions of business and \n     residential consumers have transitioned from wireline \n     telephone service to interconnected VoIP service.\n       (9) Users of interconnected VoIP service often use the \n     service as the primary telephone line for their residences \n     and businesses.\n       (10) Millions more business and residential consumers are \n     expected to migrate to interconnected VoIP service in the \n     coming years as the evolution of the nation's traditional \n     voice communications networks to IP-based networks continues.\n       (11) Users of interconnected VoIP service that have \n     telephone numbers through the service should be protected \n     from the same vulnerabilities that affected third-party \n     billing through wireline telephone numbers.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to help build \na stronger health care workforce; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator Blunt \nin the introduction of the Building a Health Care Workforce for the \nFuture Act.\n  According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, by 2020, \nthere will be a shortage of 91,000 physicians. Approximately half of \nthe shortage, 45,000, will be in primary care.\n  Individuals and families living in underserved areas, urban and \nrural, will continue to be those most disadvantaged by this shortage. \nAccording to the Pew Research Center, roughly 10,000 baby boomers will \nbecome eligible for Medicare every day through 2030. The most recent \nestimates from the Congressional Budget Office predict that 27 million \nindividuals will gain access to health insurance by 2017 as a result of \nthe Affordable Care Act. With an aging population and increasing number \nof individuals with health insurance, the gap between patients and \nproviders is expected to widen. The Affordable Care Act took steps to \naddress this shortage, but we can do more.\n  The Building a Health Care Workforce for the Future Act would \nauthorize programs that would grow the overall number of health care \nproviders, as well as encourage providers to pursue careers in \ngeographic and practice areas of highest need.\n  Building on the success of the National Health Service Corp, NHSC, \nScholarship and Loan Repayment Programs, and State Loan Repayment \nProgram, this legislation would establish a state scholarship program. \nLike the NHSC State Loan Repayment Program, States would be able to \nreceive a dollar-for-dollar match to support individuals that commit to \npracticing in the State in which the scholarship was issued after \ncompleting their education and training. At least 50 percent of the \nfunding would be required to support individuals committed to pursuing \ncareers in primary care. The States would have the flexibility to use \nthe remaining 50 percent to support scholarships to educate students in \nother documented health care professional shortages in the state that \nare approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  The Building a Health Care Workforce for the Future Act would also \nauthorize grants to medical schools to develop primary care mentors on \nfaculty and in the community. According to the Association of American \nMedical Colleges, graduating medical students consistently state that \nrole models are one of the most important factors affecting the career \npath they choose. Building a network of primary care mentors in the \nclassroom and in a variety of practice settings will help guide more \nmedical students into careers in primary care.\n  The legislation would couple these mentorship grants with an \ninitiative to improve the education and training offered by medical \nschools in competencies most critical to primary care, including \npatient-centered medical homes, primary and behavioral health \nintegration, and team-based care.\n  It would also direct the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to study and \nmake recommendations about ways to limit the administrative burden on \nproviders in documenting cognitive services delivered to patients. \nPrimary care providers treat patients in need of these services almost \nexclusively, and as such, spend a significant percentage of their day \ndocumenting. That is not the case for providers who perform procedures, \nlike surgeries. This IOM study would help uncover ways to simplify \ndocumentation requirements, particularly for delivering cognitive \nservices, in order to eliminate one of the potential factors that may \ndiscourage medical students from pursuing careers in primary care.\n  I am pleased that providers across the spectrum of care recognize \nthat this bipartisan legislation is part of the solution to addressing \nthe looming health care workforce shortage and have lent their support, \nincluding: the Alliance of Specialty Medicine, the American Association \nof College of Osteopathic Medicine, the American College of Physicians, \nthe American Osteopathic Association, the Association of Academic \nHealth Centers, the Association of American Medical Colleges, and the \nSociety of General Internal Medicine.\n  I look forward to working with these and other stakeholders as well \nas Senator Blunt and our colleagues to pass the Building a Health Care \nWorkforce for the Future Act in order to help ensure patients have \naccess to the health care they need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/12/senate-section/article/S4409-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4409-S4410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 168--DESIGNATING JUNE 2013 AS ``NATIONAL APHASIA \n   AWARENESS MONTH'' AND SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF \n                                APHASIA\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota (for himself and Mr. Kirk) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 168\n\n       Whereas aphasia is a communication impairment caused by \n     brain damage that typically results from a stroke;\n       Whereas aphasia can also occur with other neurological \n     disorders, such as a brain tumor;\n       Whereas many people with aphasia also have weakness or \n     paralysis in the right leg and right arm, usually due to \n     damage to the left hemisphere of the brain, which controls \n     language and movement on the right side of the body;\n       Whereas the effects of aphasia may include a loss of, or \n     reduction in, the ability to speak, comprehend, read, and \n     write, but the intelligence of a person with aphasia remains \n     intact;\n       Whereas, according to the National Institute of \n     Neurological Disorders and Stroke (referred to in this \n     preamble as the ``NINDS''), strokes are the third-leading \n     cause of death in the United States, ranking behind heart \n     disease and cancer;\n       Whereas strokes are a leading cause of serious, long-term \n     disability in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that there are approximately \n     5,000,000 stroke survivors in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that people in the United \n     States suffer approximately 750,000 strokes per year, with \n     about \\1/3\\ of the strokes resulting in aphasia;\n       Whereas, according to the NINDS, aphasia affects at least \n     1,000,000 people in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that more than 200,000 people \n     in the United States acquire aphasia each year;\n       Whereas the people of the United States should strive to \n     learn more about aphasia and to promote research, \n     rehabilitation, and support services for people with aphasia \n     and aphasia caregivers throughout the United States; and\n       Whereas people with aphasia and their caregivers envision a \n     world that recognizes the ``silent'' disability of aphasia \n     and provides opportunity and fulfillment for people affected \n     by aphasia: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 2013 as ``National Aphasia Awareness \n     Month'';\n       (2) supports efforts to increase awareness of aphasia;\n       (3) recognizes that strokes, a primary cause of aphasia, \n     are the third-largest cause of death and disability in the \n     United States;\n       (4) acknowledges that aphasia deserves more attention and \n     study to find new solutions for people experiencing aphasia \n     and their caregivers;\n\n[[Page S4410]]\n\n       (5) supports efforts to make the voices of people with \n     aphasia heard, because people with aphasia are often unable \n     to communicate with others; and\n       (6) encourages all people in the United States to observe \n     National Aphasia Awareness Month with appropriate events and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/12/senate-section/article/S4410-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 169--DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF JUNE 2013 AS ``NATIONAL \n            POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP (for herself, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Tester, \nMr. Blumenthal, Mr. Begich, Ms. Hirono, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Johanns, Mr. \nFranken, Mr. Donnelly, Mr. Moran, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Sanders, Mr. \nHeller, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Hoeven, and Mr. Brown) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to.:\n\n                              S.

STATEMENT OF CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Every sovereign nation has an unconditional right and \n     duty to secure its territory and people, which right depends \n     on control of its international borders. The sovereign people \n     and several states of the United States have delegated these \n     sovereign functions to the Federal Government (United States \n     Constitution, article I, section 8, clause 4). The liberty \n     and prosperity of the people depends on the execution of this \n     duty.\n       (2) The passage of this Act recognizes that the Federal \n     Government must secure the sovereignty of the United States \n     of America and establish a coherent and just system for \n     integrating those who seek to join American society.\n       (3) The United States has failed to control its Southern \n     border. The porousness of that border has contributed to the \n     proliferation of the narcotics trade and its attendant \n     violent crime. The trafficking and smuggling of persons \n     across the border is an ongoing human rights scandal.\n       (4) We have always welcomed immigrants to the United States \n     and will continue to do so, but in order to qualify for the \n     honor and privilege of eventual citizenship, our laws must be \n     followed. The world depends on America to be strong \n     economically, militarily, and ethically. The establishment of \n     a stable, just, and efficient immigration system only \n     supports those goals. As a Nation, we have the right and \n     responsibility to make our borders safe, to establish clear \n     and just rules for seeking citizenship, to control the flow \n     of legal immigration, and to eliminate illegal immigration, \n     which in some cases has become a threat to our national \n     security.\n       (5) Throughout our long history, many lawful immigrants \n     have assimilated into American society and contributed to our \n     strength and prosperity. Our immigration policy strives to \n     welcome those who share the values of the United States \n     Constitution and seek to contribute to our nation's \n     greatness.

Mr. President, picking up where I left off, I don't think \nwe, Congress, need to micromanage this process. We don't need \ncongressional enforcement officers, so to speak. Rather, we need to \nspell out the goals, the priorities for border and port security which \nthis bill does. We need to give the Department of Homeland Security the \ntools, skills, resources, and flexibility it needs to get this job \ndone, which this bill also does. Then we need to let DHS do its job \nwhile at the same time continuing to provide responsible and robust \noversight, not just here from Washington but along the border itself.\n  That is why now in my Committee on Homeland Security that is what my \ncolleagues and I will want to do to be sure this bill is implemented \nstrongly and effectively.\n  Still, as strong as our border defenses have become and despite how \nmuch stronger this bill will make them, we cannot defend our Nation \nentirely at the border. One of our witnesses earlier this year noted \nthat we often look to our borders to solve problems that originate \nelsewhere. In other words, we are so preoccupied with the symptoms we \nare missing the underlying causes which can make finding a solution all \nthe more difficult. We have to address the root causes that are drawing \npeople to our country illegally in order to fully secure our borders \nand ensure we are not embroiled in the same debate 20 years from now. I \nam pleased to say this bipartisan legislation addresses the root causes \nin a way that I believe is tough, is practical, and is fair.\n  My friend and former Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity Jane Holl Lute recently told me we have to strike the right \nbalance between enforcing security policies at our borders and ports of \nentry, to keep bad actors out while facilitating and while encouraging \ncommerce between the United States and our neighbors to the north and \nsouth, two of our biggest trading partners. This bill provides, as I \nsaid earlier, for 3,500 additional officers to work the our ports of \nentry--not ports along the water, actually land-based ports where a lot \nof traffic moves through, a lot of commerce moves through, and 3,500 \nadditional officers actually will make a big difference. We need them.\n  We also need to modernize our ports so these additional officers have \nthe resources and tools they need to process legitimate travelers and \ntrade while focusing on bad actors.\n  Here are some of the examples of what we have done to upgrade our \nports of entry. I am not going to use all of these, but we will use a \ncouple of\n\n[[Page S4433]]\n\nthem. This is a before. This is a shot, probably about 6 years before. \nWe had limited, I think, very limited percentage of traveler queries. \nWe had limited technology and we had minimal signage.\n  This is today. We have nearly 100 percent traveler queries on land \nborders, the expansive use of RFID-enabled documents and increased \nefficiency by 25 percent. We have new READY lanes to encourage our use \nof RFID documents as well.\n  Here, it is hard--this is like signage, simple, a lot of printed \nstuff. Here we have gone electronic. We can just stop.\n  When trucks are coming, when vehicles are coming, we have the ability \nto read the license plates before they ever get to the officers. We \nhave the ability, if people are coming across, to use devices that read \ntheir passports and give us some idea who actually is coming up to the \nofficer, Customs and Border Patrol officer. We use gamma rays. We are \nable to look inside trucks. We have detection, the ability to detect \nradiation on any vehicles that are coming through. It is a massive \nchange. We don't just do it because we want to secure the vehicles and \nmake sure what is supposed to be in them is actually in them and not \nsome contraband or drugs or whatever, but we want to be able to \nexpedite the movement of these vehicles.\n  We want them to have a better throughput because there are huge \neconomic consequences for us and for Mexico. We want to strengthen our \nborders. One of the reasons why we are making these investments is it \nis a tool to make them more secure, to keep bad people and bad stuff \nout, and do a better job of facilitating trade. It is smart business. \nIt is a smart way to do business with the help of this legislation.\n\n  I think that is all we are going to look at in terms of these ports \nof entry. I could move along. I think properly balancing commerce and \nsecurity is critical because facilitating trade with our neighbors to \nthe south and also to the north not only strengthens our own economy \nbut also strengthens the economies throughout North, South, and Central \nAmerica.\n  Why do we care? We want their economies to be stronger so they don't \nwant to come up here and live with us, come here illegally and try to \nbe a part of this country, although we appreciate their desire to do \nthat. We want to make sure their countries are strong economically too.\n  For most who live in the United States illegally, though, what draws \nthem to our country and enables them to stay here without legal status, \nas we know, is jobs. We need, obviously, a system that makes it easier \nfor employers to do the right thing and to verify who is eligible to \nwork. Too often today that is not the case. We also need to hold \nemployers who normally break the law hiring undocumented workers \naccountable for doing that.\n  I believe, again, the legislation that is before us comes close to \nachieving those goals. It requires all employers to use a strong \nelectronic verification system, starting with large employers down to \nsmall employers over time, but a strong verification system, designed \nto give employers quick assurance that the new employees are eligible \nto work, that they are considering hiring. For many workers these will \ninclude photo tools that let the employer verify the person applying \nfor the job is indeed the person who applied for the worker eligibility \ndocument. The law increases fines for knowingly hiring undocumented \nworkers and increases them by more than tenfold and includes a \nsignificant criminal penalty for those who systematically abuse our \nworkplace laws. These new penalties, including jail sentences of up to \n10 years, will provide a strong deterrent to unscrupulous employers who \nseek to exploit undocumented workers for their own gain.\n  We also need to convince those who want to come here for a better \nlife that the way to do that is through legal rather than illegal \nimmigration. While we crack down on the bad actors who try to hire \nundocumented workers, we also need to make sure that employers who are \nplaying by the rules have ample access to the talent they need to keep \nour economy growing--and encourage people from other nations to come \nhere legally when we do not have the talent here in this country able \nand willing to do some of the work that needs to be done. This \nlegislation does help by modernizing our outdated visa system to supply \nsufficient workers when needed, particularly in critical areas such as \nhigh-skilled and agricultural employment. These approved legal pathways \nfor workers and their families will shrink the flow of undocumented \nmigrants and help our border forces to concentrate on the most serious \nthreats at the border.\n  Ultimately, I believe the most effective force multiplier, as much as \nI like the idea of these drones, fully resourced with the VADER systems \non them, as much as I like the idea of the C-2006 aircraft with the \nright kind of surveillance, and as much as I like having the blimps \nwith all the technology they can carry, as much as I want to have \nhelicopters to move our border surveillance up and down the border and \nhave all kinds of surveillance equipment, as much as I think fencing \nhelps and access routes and all these investments help, I still think \nmaybe the most effective force multiplier for protecting our border is \nto take away the need for people to come here illegally in the first \nplace.\n  As we address the root causes, we have to address another challenge \nand that is the 11 million people who are here without proper \ndocumentation, living in the shadows today. Ironically, 40 percent came \nin on a legal status, on a student visa, a tourist visa, a work visa. \nThey overstayed their welcome and overstayed what the law allows.\n  Some critics argue that the bill before us grants immediate amnesty \nto those 11 million undocumented people. I don't think that is true. \nWhat they get is not amnesty but, rather, a long, I think a hard path \ntoward possible citizenship, one with many hurdles and no guarantees. \nIt kind of reminds me of the trek a bunch of them took through Mexico \njust to get to the border, getting across the border without getting \ncaught, trying to escape, in many cases, these coyotes who took \nadvantage of them, robbed them, in some cases raped them, and once they \ngot into this country avoiding getting detained. And a bunch got \ndetained and ended up in the detention centers. That is not an easy \npath.\n  I don't think the path this lays out ahead for those undocumented \ntoday is an easy path. Just to reach the first step, becoming what is \ncalled a registered provisional immigrant, individuals would have to \nclear multiple background checks, pay back taxes, pay a hefty fine. If \nthey committed any kind of significant crime they are disqualified from \npursuing legal status.\n  Once an applicant has cleared the first hurdle, registered \nprovisional immigrants must remain employed, pay even more taxes and \nfines, learn English, maintain a clean criminal record, and demonstrate \nthey are living not below the poverty line but above the poverty line; \nthey are gainfully employed. Most importantly, these people have to go \nto the back of the line, not ahead of people who are waiting to get \nahead who have played by the rules, but behind them, at the end of the \nline--behind the folks who are here legally, who are going to get \nprocessed, as they should, first. It is going to take about 10 years \nbefore those folks who are undocumented will have a chance to even \nqualify for a green card.\n\n  Three years after getting a green card, these immigrants would \nfinally be able to apply for citizenship. We are not talking about 13 \nweeks or 13 months, we are talking about 13 years. Once again, they \nhave to pass extensive background checks in order to successfully move \nforward in that process.\n  So to our colleagues who are suggesting this bill would immediately \nbegin legalizing the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country \nright away, I would simply ask: Does that sound like an immediate \nprocess to you? It doesn't to me. This is not an easy path, and, \nfrankly, a lot of people won't make it, just as a lot of people who \nhave tried to get into this country have not made it either. I think \nthe process we have laid out over those next 10, 13 years, if you will, \nis a tough, fair, and practical approach. Call it a lot of things, but \nI would not call it amnesty.\n  We also need to make sure the men and women around the world know \nthis Nation is making unprecedented investments to improve and \nmodernize our legal immigration system in addition to making it very \ndifficult for\n\n[[Page S4434]]\n\nfolks who try to come here illegally. We are dedicating significant \nresources to detaining and deporting those who try to go around the \nrules--spending roughly $2 billion a year on this effort. In fact, \nsince President Obama took office, removals have increased from 291,000 \npeople in 2007, or just under 300,000 folks, to more than 400,000 last \nyear, when we returned a record number of people to their home \ncountries.\n  Our Nation must also work with our neighbors to improve the process \nand decrease the time it takes to return our detainees to those \ncountries of origin. When we were in Texas recently, I learned we have \nan agreement with Guatemala where they issue electronic travel \ndocuments to their citizens almost as soon as we apprehend them along \nour border--mostly Texas. This process cuts down on detention times for \nGuatemalans from 30 days to roughly 7 days.\n  It has a real positive effect on the Guatemalans we arrest and take \ninto custody because they spend less time in detention--not a pleasant \nexperience. It saves us millions of dollars because we have to hold \nthem, feed them, and give them a place to stay for a shorter period of \ntime. We need to take the Guatemalan model where we dramatically reduce \nthe detention time and see if we cannot replicate their program with \nour other nations, especially particularly nations such as Mexico.\n  Finally, I will conclude by admitting this legislation is not \nperfect. On the other hand, I have not seen a perfect piece of \nlegislation. Even the Constitution we adopted in Delaware on December \n7, 1787, to become the first State wasn't perfect either. We amended it \nagain and again. We amended it over 30 times.\n  While I do believe there is certainly room for constructive criticism \nand debate about this bill, I am certain this legislation represents an \nimprovement over our current system. I believe we can make it even \nstronger in the coming weeks, and I hope we will.\n  I plan to offer some amendments, and my guess is the Presiding \nOfficer will offer amendments as well as our colleagues. We ought to \noffer them, debate them, and vote them up or down.\n  We must come to this debate with an understanding that the status quo \nis unacceptable. If we don't modernize our immigration system to allow \nemployers to fill the jobs our economy needs and our citizens are \nunwilling or unable to do, we are hurting our children's future while \nat the same time making our Nation less secure.\n  As a Nation founded on the principles of life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness, we simply cannot tolerate a shadow economy of 11 \nmillion people who are scared to live freely, who generate black \nmarkets to produce false identity documents, and who drive down the \nwages of U.S. citizens.\n  To my colleagues who are still uneasy with legalization, I ask this: \nWhat is the alternative? It is not practical to find and deport 11 \nmillion people. Most of the undocumented immigrants in this country \nhave lived here more than 10 years. Many have children who are U.S. \ncitizens. They have deep roots in our society and contribute \nmeaningfully to our national interests.\n  I think the American people would want us to be tough, but they also \nwant us to be humane and realistic. I believe this legislation offers \nthat path, that balance, and now is the time to take that path.\n  In closing, I am reminded of something that binds all of us together. \nIf we actually look above where you are sitting, there are some words \nin Latin. If we look up there, we will see the Latin phrase ``e \npluribus unum,'' which means ``out of many, one.'' It is a phrase that \nadorns our Nation's seal. It suggests that while we all come from many \ndifferent places, in the end we are one Nation.\n  With that thought in mind, I will simply say to our colleagues and to \nthose who are following this discussion tonight, we have a choice. We \ncan work together to make this bill better and adopt it in a bipartisan \nmanner or we can remain in gridlock and let the American people down.\n  I know what I want to do. I know what the people of Delaware want us \nto do. They want us to legislate, and I want us to legislate as well. I \nwant us to make our immigration system better. I want to show the \nAmerican people that Congress can come together--Democrats, \nRepublicans, and a couple of Independents--on an issue of great \nimportance to our country's economy and great importance to our \nnational security. We need to get this done, and I am encouraged with \nthe grace of God we will.\n  Mr. President, you will be glad to know that I am done, but our work \nremains to be done. I look forward to working with the Presiding \nOfficer and 98 of our colleagues to get the job done for the American \npeople.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/12/senate-section/article/S4434-1", "month": "06", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
