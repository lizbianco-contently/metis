Mr. President, in the two decades since the Violence \nAgainst Women Act passed--it passed with a very strong vote, a \nbipartisan vote here in the Senate, and then in the House at the time--\nincidents of domestic violence have fallen by more than half, by as \nmuch as 53 percent. The law has helped millions of women and children \nescape their attackers and get the justice they deserve. It is a \nlandmark piece of legislation. That is why Congress twice reauthorized \nthis legislation without a hint of controversy or a moment of delay.\n  But despite the overwhelming evidence this legislation saves lives \nand protects women, House Republicans used every procedural trick known \nto Congress to block its reauthorization last Congress. Despite strong \nbipartisan support here in the Senate, Republicans in the House refused \nto join the effort to renew our national commitment to ending domestic \nviolence.\n  Allowing partisan delays to put women's lives at risk is simply \nshameful. If House Republicans believe domestic violence is no longer a \nproblem in this country, they are wrong. Every day three women in \nAmerica die at the hands of their abusers. Every day many women escape \nwith their lives but with the physical and emotional scars of the abuse \nthat exists.\n  More than one-third of women in this country have been victims of \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking by a partner--one-third of the \nwomen in this country have been victims of violence, sexual assault, or \nstalking by a partner. It is in our power to help, and it is \nunthinkable that Republicans in the House would prevent us from taking \naction and again refuse to do anything, as they did last Congress.\n  Victims of violence and law enforcement officials who support them \nhave already waited too long for Congress to act. This week, the Senate \nwill pass a strong bipartisan reauthorization of the Violence Against \nWomen Act. This is something that was put forward by the chairman of \nthat committee, the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy. He has worked \nhard on it. He did everything possible last Congress to get this done. \nBecause of the House's intransigence, they refused to do anything in \nspite of his work.\n  I thank Chairman Leahy, Senator Murray, and the women of the Senate \nfor their leadership on this issue. I am pleased so many of my Senate \ncolleagues have expressed support for swift action on this legislation, \nand especially so many Senate Republicans have supported this \nlegislation. The Senate will not allow women to be denied the \nprotection they need and deserve.\n\n[[Page S450]]\n\n  We must ensure law enforcement has the means to stop these horrible \ncrimes. We must guarantee communities have the resources to support \nvictims regardless of sexual orientation, immigration status, or where \nthey live, as they heal. Every victim of domestic violence deserves the \nsame vigorous protections under the law. Because of the unique nature \nof the crime, combating domestic violence and protecting those affected \nalso requires unique tools. Reauthorizing this act would help law \nenforcement continue to develop effective strategies to prosecute cases \ninvolving violent crimes against women. It would provide funding for \nshelters and transitional housing programs for victims of domestic \nviolence and sexual assault and help victims become independent. It \nwould make legal assistance available to victims of violence and \nsafeguard children and youth affected by dating violence and stalking.\n\n  Although the Violence Against Women Act expired in 2011, many of the \nprograms established under the law have been funded by continuing \nresolutions. But not everything. A full reauthorization of this law is \nnecessary to ensure authorities have all the resources they need to \nfight domestic violence. So I hope the Senate's bipartisan action this \nweek will send a strong message to House Republican leaders that \nfurther partisan delay is unacceptable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/04/senate-section/article/S450-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy).

Mr. President, the American people are deeply unhappy \nwith the way Washington operates these days. They are tired of people \ntelling them what they want to hear instead of what they need to hear. \nThey are tired of all of the political games and gimmicks that \nsubstitute for real action on the problems we face as a Nation. Given \nwhat we have seen from the White House and Congressional Democrats, \nfrankly, it is hard to blame them. As I have said repeatedly in recent \nweeks, we need to find a way to control runaway Federal spending and \ndebt. We need to do it quickly. This is absolutely essential if we are \nto avoid a European-style catastrophe. It is what we need to do if we \nare serious about removing government obstacles that stand in the way \nof a robust recovery and new jobs.\n  Reducing the debt will throw off a wet blanket that has been weighing \non our economy for entirely too long. This is a serious challenge. It \ndemands serious spending reforms from both parties here in Washington. \nYet if you were to listen to the Democrats, you would think all of our \nills could be solved by raising taxes on private jets or energy \ncompanies.\n  These are not real solutions. They are poll-tested gimmicks. Just \ntake the tax hike on so-called corporate jets. It would not raise \nenough revenue to offset more than 1 week--1 week--of the decade-long \nsequester--1 week. Of course, anytime you have a tax hike, there are \ngoing to be negative repercussions for growth and jobs. We do not have \nto look too far into the past to see how disruptive those consequences \ncan be. In 1990, Washington politicians tried to enact a ``luxury tax'' \non just about everything you could associate with the upper class, \nincluding yachts and aircraft. It was a total failure. Not only was it \nlinked to the destruction of literally thousands of jobs in the boating \nindustry, but, according to one study, the government actually--listen \nto this--spent more in unemployment benefits and in lost taxes than it \nwas able to raise through the luxury tax itself. In other words, while \nthe tax may have seemed to serve as a useful wedge issue for Democratic \npoliticians, it made just about everyone worse off than they were \nbefore it passed. Workers, consumers, taxpayers, and the government \nwere all worse off. That is why a number of Members of today's Senate \nDemocratic caucus voted to repeal that particular tax a few years later \nin 1993. They even agreed to send refund checks to some of those \nimpacted by it.\n  So why are they proposing to go down this same sorry road one more \ntime? Well, in a variation of the old saying, you can conclude that \nthey do not want the facts to get in the way of a good political \ntalking point.\n  But the larger point is this: The challenge we face right now is the \nfact that government spending is completely and totally out of control. \nSo to focus on a tax of any kind is to miss the point entirely. The \namount of revenue we bring in as a percentage of GDP is set to return \nto the historical average of the past few decades. Spending, on the \nother hand, is way above historic norms, and spending is projected to \nactually get much worse in the years to come; that is, unless we do \nsomething about it today.\n  The American people elected a divided government. They expect it to \nwork. That means both parties need to engage and offer serious \nsolutions. Proposing a return to failed tax gimmicks of the past is not \nby any measure a serious solution. If White House officials want to \nreplace the same sequester they themselves proposed in 2011, it is \ntheir responsibility to lay out what concrete spending cuts they would \nbe willing to consider as potential offsets, as House Republicans \nalready have. If they do, then we Republicans are happy to hear them \nout and to work collaboratively on effective reforms. But if this is \njust another opportunity to trot out the Democrats' focus-group-\napproved policy stunt, if this is another fake fight designed by the \nWhite House to push us to the brink, then Republicans are not \ninterested in playing along. We are going to keep fighting for real \nspending reform, because that is what the American people expect us to \ndo.\n  Every day spent talking about corporate jets is a day wasted. Given \nthat the President again missed the deadline to submit a budget on time \nthis year, there is not much time to spare. The clock is ticking. It is \npast time to get serious.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/04/senate-section/article/S450-3", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a most \nremarkable woman. In just a few hours, a celebration of life service \nwill be held at St. Andrew's Church in Kansas City for Adele Hall, \ndescribed by the Kansas City Star in a front-page headline as ``first \nlady'' of Kansas City.\n  Adele was in Hawaii with her husband Don Hall, chairman of Hallmark \nCards, when she passed away. To say they were a remarkable couple is an \nunderstatement. They met when she was 3 years old and Don was 6. Adele \nsaid: I don't ever remember falling in love with Don. I just grew up \nbeing in love with him.\n  As the Star reported, her priorities were always with her husband and \nher three children. In addition to her love and caring for her family, \nAdele Hall had a unique ability to lead, and lead she did. Living a \nlife of caring and contribution, making a difference and demonstrating \nto all whose lives she touched and made better, she was a wonderful \nexample of honor and respect.\n  Adele's many accomplishments were almost legendary. She would demure \nfrom that description with her wonderful smile and give credit to \nothers. It\n\n[[Page S451]]\n\nwas how she accomplished so much that serves as such a wonderful \nexample and why she was so beloved.\n  The friends of Don and Adele and those with whom she worked describe \nher best. Henry Bloch, the founder of H Block and a lifelong friend, \nsaid:\n\n       If there ever was a first lady of Kansas City, it was \n     Adele. She was honored and respected by everybody. It's a \n     major loss for this community.\n\n  Irv Hockaday, a former CEO of Hallmark and a friend of Adele and \nDon's for close to 50 years, said:\n\n       She was like a magnetic sun . . . whose constant warmth and \n     magnetism just had a pull. And people gravitated to her. To \n     me, her most compelling quality, of many, was her empathy.\n       They say that no one is indispensable. That's true in a \n     way. But she comes about as close to being someone we can \n     never, ever forget or replicate.\n\n  Irv Hockaday certainly captured Adele, as did Steven Doyal, spokesman \nfor Hallmark Cards:\n\n       We lost a great human being. Her greatest passion was in \n     the area of children. She believed passionately in the \n     potential of every child.\n\n  At Children's Mercy Hospital, Adele moved easily from rocking sick \nbabies in the nursery to running board meetings and leading \nmultimillion-dollar fundraising campaigns. One of the best known was \nwith Tom Watson, with whom she established the Children's Mercy Golf \nClassic.\n  Jack Ovel, the hospital board chairman, said:\n\n       She was quick to give others credit. She was always telling \n     other people, ``You are the wind beneath my wings.''\n\n  Perhaps her most notable collaborative effort was bringing the \nUniversity of Kansas and Children's Mercy together. Early on she \nrealized what that would mean for residents of Kansas City.\n  Jim Heeter, president of the Greater City Chamber of Commerce, \ndescribed the news of Adele's passing, which came in the middle of the \nmonthly chamber board meeting:\n\n       The entire room fell into stunned silence when it was \n     announced. She was known and loved by virtually everyone \n     around our board table. We observed a long moment of silence \n     in her honor and her memory.\n\n  Mary Shaw ``Shawsie'' Branton, who was her copartner and close friend \nin one charitable and/or civic event after another said of Adele:\n\n       I have lost a close friend. She touched all our lives. \n     There was an aura around Adele, `How can I help? What can I \n     do? . . . How can I find a solution?'\n\n  ``This is a great day of sorrow,'' said Sarah Rowland, chairwoman of \nthe Nelson-Atkins board of trustees.\n  Jane Chu, CEO of the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts said:\n\n       Everything she did was about inspiring Kansas City \n     residents. She so believed in these projects because she so \n     believed in this city, she cared about making it a great \n     place to live.\n\n  One can clearly see by the many comments of Adele's friends and \nleaders in Kansas City, with regard to their sense of personal loss, \nexpressions of admiration of love and respect for the world of \nachievements Adele accomplished, there is only one Adele Hall.\n  In my case, Mr. President, I was on the floor of this body last \nMonday during a series of votes taking place when a cloakroom attendant \ngave me a message to call my office immediately. I did, and my chief of \nstaff, Jackie Cottrell, came over to the cloakroom and told me of the \nnews of Adele's untimely passing.\n  There are certain people in life where you feel you are privileged \njust to know them--people who make a difference, really nice people who \ngive you a certain sense of awe, people who are really not aware of \ntheir special and unique persona. Adele had that certain something--a \nunique charisma, comprised of a wonderful smile, charm and grace, but \nalso the determination and ability of a leader.\n  When she came into a room, those present knew things would get done. \nShe always stood ready in friendship and support and love. \nUnfortunately, given her strength of purpose, she was also the kind of \nperson you might well take for granted.\n  Jackie and I immediately called Annie Presley, a good friend and \ncompanion-in-arms with Adele. Annie and I couldn't say too much during \nthat phone call, but I did blurt out, ``Well, it's the end of an era.'' \nAnd it is. Adele, in addition to all of her civic and art works, had \ntremendous influence, serving as an adviser, a friend, and supporter to \nPresidents, Governors, Senators, Congressional Members, and city \nleaders. Annie was right by her side in these endeavors. Her passion \nfor politics made both Kansas and Missouri a better place to live. Her \nadvice, her guidance, and support were invaluable to so many. Don and \nAdele's Kansas home was the setting for countless benefactor \nreceptions. The list represents a Who's Who in politics, from both \nPresidents Bush, Senators Bob Dole, Kit Bond, Nancy Kassebaum, and, \nyes, somebody by the name of Pat Roberts.\n  My friendship with Don and Adele began more than 20 years ago. I \nadmit I was a bit nervous the first time I was invited to their home. I \narrived early and Adele warmly greeted me, welcomed me in. Don took me \ninto the study, and after some discussion we all ended up listening to \nthe Andrews Sisters--I don't know why--until we were informed it was \ntime to greet the other guests. I think Don and I would have been there \na lot longer if Don had his way. We have been great friends ever since.\n  Perhaps the highlight of our efforts together was when First Lady \nLaura Bush came to Kansas, and together we welcomed her to our great \nState.\n  Finally, Mr. President, when I talk about Adele's respect and her \nhumility, I am reminded of the story when President Bush came to \nWichita on my behalf. The White House staff and security, God bless \nthem, had names on the floor in the reception room, and those who were \ngreeting the President had to stand on the right name. God knows what \nwould have happened if you didn't stand on the right name.\n  Adele stood exactly as instructed on her name, without any \nhesitation. I did not do that. I didn't follow orders quite as well. I \nmet with the President's vehicle and hurriedly told him our special \nguests were standing at attention at their appropriate spot, which \namused the President greatly. The secret, of course, was that Don and \nAdele often stayed at the White House as guests of both George H.W. \nBush and President George W. Bush.\n  When President Bush came in the room, he asked: Adele, are you \nstanding in the right place?\n  She replied quickly: Why, Mr. President--George--I will stand \nwherever you want me to.\n  That really produced a lot of laughs and prompted a big hug.\n  Mr. President, today's obligations in the Senate prevent me from \nattending the celebration of life service, but I am there in spirit. To \nDon, Don Jr. and Jill, David and Laura, Margaret and Keith, and Adele's \nnine grandchildren, our thoughts and prayers are with you.\n  I feel compelled to say if all of the people in the Kansas City area \ncould be in attendance, those who loved Adele or who have benefited \nfrom her many endeavors, the numbers would fill Arrowhead Stadium and \nthen some.\n  Helen Steiner Rice may well have summed up what Adele would be \ntelling us now:\n\n       When I must leave you for a little while, please go on \n     bravely with a gallant smile. And, for my sake and in my \n     name, live on and do all things the same. Spend not your life \n     in empty days, but fill each waking hour in useful ways. \n     Reach out your hand in comfort and in cheer, and I, in turn, \n     will comfort you and hold you near.\n\n  Mr. President, the heavens are a little brighter now because they \nhave a shining star in Adele Hall.\n  I yield the floor, and upon careful study I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today, as I have \nvirtually every day since we have been back in session, to address what \nis perhaps the most critical question facing this Nation: how to rein \nin the out-of-control Federal spending that threatens to bankrupt the \ncountry and saddle future generations with a burden of\n\n[[Page S452]]\n\ndebt that will dramatically reduce the quality of their lives.\n  Yesterday morning on ABC's ``This Week with George Stephanopoulos,'' \nSenate Majority Leader Reid claimed:\n  ``The American people need to understand that it's not as if we've \ndone nothing for the debt.''\n  I would argue that the American people do understand, but what they \ndisagree with is the majority leader's statement that we have done \nsomething to reduce the debt we are accumulating at a record rate. We \nall know we are spending nearly $40,000 of taxpayer money per second. \nWe know it has now been 1,377 days since we passed a budget in the \nSenate or one has even been offered by the Democratic leadership. Our \ndebt continues to accumulate and now stands at nearly $16.5 trillion, \nand anybody who looks at the debt clock sees that the numbers are \nrotating faster than the eye can see. So, no, I don't agree. I don't \nthink we have done much to address our debt. And rather than recognize \nthe real problem of our debt, which is spending, the majority leader \ntalked about the need for yet more taxes and higher revenues.\n  After all the debate about making the wealthy pay more in order to \npay down our debt, the fiscal cliff deal barely changed the Nation's \nlong-term fiscal outlook, particularly if spending continues on its \npresent course.\n  A report from the Peterson Foundation released this week puts U.S. \ndebt on a track to reach 200 percent of gross domestic product by 2040. \nKeep in mind that many respected economists--economists without a \npartisan position to promote, those who have looked at this \nimpartially--have said to us that historically, without exception, once \na nation's debt reaches 90 percent of GDP, it becomes very damaging to \nthe economy, and it is something I believe we are now experiencing the \nearly phases of in America. So 200 percent of GDP, if we stay on the \npresent course, will take this country and our economy down, and it \nwill take away our ability to provide the needed and necessary \nfunctions of the Federal Government.\n  The plain fact is that our debt is going to continue to spiral upward \nuntil Washington tackles its spending addiction.\n  The President and some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle are claiming that in the last few years they have already cut the \nbudget to the bone. These so-called savings they talk about are savings \nanticipated by drawing down troops in Afghanistan and Iraq that are \nalready set to wind down. So we can't just simply say: Well, we have \nsolved the problem because we are now going to take this money which we \nanticipate we won't have to spend.\n  By the way, that assumes there will be no more overseas contingent \noperations that will have to take place in the next 10 years. If we \nlook at what is happening around the world, if we look at the \ninstability and threats that are happening around the world, it is \npretty hard to assume we simply don't or won't need to spend any money \nover the next 10 years to address something that is a direct threat to \nthe United States.\n  All of this basically says it is pretty hard to take seriously the \nsuggestion by the majority leader and the President that we have done \nour job in cutting spending to reduce the debt.\n  If I were able to take the time to list the wasteful catalog of \nduplicative spending and wasteful spending of the taxpayer dollars on \nthis floor, I would use up the rest of the day--and more. But let me \nmention a few examples from my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, \nwho I think has done this body and the American public a great service \nby delineating and outlining some of this unnecessary spending of \ntaxpayer dollars and giving us a route and a roadmap and a pathway \ntowards addressing unneeded wasteful spending of tax dollars, \nparticularly at a time when we are having to borrow nearly 40 percent \nor more in order to keep our government functioning. This spending \nSenator Coburn has listed comes out of official government reports--the \nGovernment Accountability Office, the Congressional Research Service, \nand other government entities. These have been documented by our own \nofficial national government agencies:\n  There is $1.6 billion spent annually to maintain unneeded Federal \nproperty. If it is unneeded, why do we have to maintain it year after \nyear at a cost of $1.6 billion? Let's put a ``for sale'' sign up there \nand receive some revenue from these assets that are documented as being \nunneeded.\n  Another $1.6 billion is spent by the Federal Government to provide \nfree cell phone service. Now, the Congress passed legislation for \ncertain categories of low-income people to receive free cell phones. \nWhether you are for that or against that or voted for it or voted \nagainst it, what has been laid out here is the fact that many of these \nphones are going to people who don't qualify for this handout, and \nhundreds of thousands of those go to people who already have at least \none phone. Offer somebody a free second phone, and they are going to \ngrab it. But do they need it, and does the taxpayer need to pay for it?\n  Also, $50 million of taxpayer money went to the IRS for a public \nrelations effort to try to improve its image with taxpayers. Good luck \nwith that PR program. I think we know their opinion of the IRS. And is \nthis really a necessary expenditure?\n  The IRS sent a prisoner who filed a bogus tax return a refund for \n$327,456, and they even sent it to the correctional facility. You would \nthink that somewhere along the line, somebody would say: Maybe we ought \nto look into this. Hopefully we will be able to get this one back, \nalong with $30,000 that was sent to a jail where a murderer collected \n$30,000 in claimed unemployment benefits. Well, yes, he was unemployed, \nbut that is not exactly what our unemployment system is designed to do. \nSo while we are going after the $327,000, maybe we can collect this \n$30,000 on the way.\n  Every day we hear of reports of food stamps being used to pay for \nbeer, cigarettes, cell phone bills, and even cars. That hardly needs to \nbe mentioned because it is something we have come to understand--there \nis a lot of misuse of tax dollars.\n  On and on it goes, and I could list more and more.\n  Just the other day, Senator Coburn listed some duplicative programs, \nand he thought: Well, maybe we don't need multiple numbers of these. \nMaybe we can consolidate.\n  We have 18 domestic food assistance programs, 45 separate job-\ntraining programs. And I love this one, my personal favorite--more than \n50 financial literacy programs provided by the Federal Government.\n  The first question we need to ask is what does the Federal Government \nhave to say about financial literacy, given our current financial \nsituation? Hopefully it is using its own dysfunction as an example of \nwhat not to do.\n  These outrageous spending items and duplicative Federal programs are \nnot isolated examples. Just a few weeks ago the Treasury Department \nissued its year-end report for fiscal 2012. One of the bombshells in \nthis report that has received virtually no coverage or commentary is \nthe estimate by the Government Accountability Office that $108 billion \nwas lost to improper payments by the Federal Government.\n  Since over one-third of all Federal spending wasn't even examined yet \nby the GAO, the total amount lost obviously will be much higher. The \nfact that this escaped the notice of much of the media and many of my \ncolleagues is very telling. Unfortunately, we are so used to the notion \nof inefficient or wasteful Federal spending, a government report \nverifying over $100 billion in waste, fraud, and abuse doesn't even \nregister.\n  When my colleagues come down to offer amendments and are voted down, \namendments to offset spending for new programs such as disaster relief \nand a cacophony of rejections comes their way saying, ``How dare you \neven think about trying to offset this, you are taking money away from \nbabies and children and mothers and essential functions of the Federal \nGovernment?'' Then you start to read down the list of wasteful programs \nand duplicative programs and they say they cannot come up with a dime \nto offset needed expenses.\n  Let me say we are not here to undermine or destroy the necessary \nfunction of running an efficient government. But the key word is \nefficient. We want to spend taxpayers' dollars in a way so taxpayers \nunderstand we are doing the\n\n[[Page S453]]\n\nbest to spend their hard-earned dollars on essential programs.\n  I have suggested to the Appropriations Committee that each program \nfor which we appropriate money be put through a system of what I call \ntriage. We ask each agency before it presents its budget to us, \nannually, for the appropriations to pay for their expenses and \ndistributions, that they first address this question: Is this an \nessential function of the Federal Government? Is this a function we \nmight like to do but can no longer afford to do? And separate that from \nthose we no longer need or never should have been put there in the \nfirst place.\n  At a time when we are suffering from the plunge into deficit spending \nand debt, should we not apply some standards and principles as to where \nand how we allocate funds that are sent to us by the taxpayer? I have \nasked each agency to do that. We have not received any reports back. \nAll we hear, from a number of voices around the town, is: Oh, no, we \ncannot touch any of this; every dime we spend is absolutely necessary.\n  I think what Senator Coburn has begun to do and what I hope to do, \nand to work on with him and others, is to identify some of those areas \nand literally ask the question to my colleagues and to the American \npeople: Do you think this is an essential function of the Federal \nGovernment? Is this something that maybe we would wish to do but do not \nhave the money to do? Or is this something that, frankly, has not lived \nup to its promise, is wasting money, or is this something that never \nshould have been passed in the first place?\n  If we do not apply those principles to our future spending, we are \ngoing to continue down this road. We all know the big three--Social \nSecurity, Medicaid, and Medicare--have to be reformed to save these \nprograms, but have to be reformed because they are unsustainable in \ntheir current form. I will be talking much more about that later. But \nwhat I do want to acknowledge here today is that without getting to \nthose programs, which we have to do if we are going to solve our long-\nterm problem, we also need to seriously look at how we spend money on \nall the discretionary spending that comes before this body. We have to \nlook at those things that simply do not measure up in terms of a \nresponsible way of handling our taxpayer revenues.\n  I am going to continue coming to the floor, I am going to continue \npointing out areas where I think we can save money, and continue to \nmake the case that this Congress has not begun to do the job it needs \nto do in terms of dealing with our spending.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/04/senate-section/article/S453-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S453-S454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEBT CEILING EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, last week the Senate passed legislation \nthat had already been approved in the House that extended the debt \nceiling until late this summer. It was the right thing to do. It was \nthe right thing to extend the debt ceiling of our Nation because it \nallows us to pay the bills we have already incurred. There is not one \ndime of new spending that is authorized under the legislation we \napproved. My only regret is that we did not extend it for a longer \nperiod of time, giving greater certainty to the financial markets.\n  If we were ever to violate the debt ceiling, the consequences would \nbe that the taxpayers of this country would have to pay more for the \nobligations of our Nation in interest costs. It would permanently \ndamage the reputation of this Nation as far as our ability to pay our \nbills. It would be counterproductive to everything we are trying to do \nto help the taxpayers of America. It was the right thing for us to do, \nto extend the debt ceiling, but we still have a lot more work we need \nto do.\n  Our current accumulation of debt is not sustainable. We cannot \ncontinue to spend what we are spending today and collect what we are \ncollecting today in revenue and sustain the fiscal integrity of the \nUnited States. We spend too much and we do not bring in enough revenue. \nThat is the issue we need to address. It was not addressed in the debt \nceiling. The debt ceiling should have been extended. But we now need to \ndeal with the fundamental problem that our spending and revenues are \nnot in line.\n  We could talk about the cause of how we got here. We could talk about \nhow the Congress reduced tax revenues while we were at war, a policy I \nspoke out against and voted against. But our responsibility is to \nfigure out how we go from where we are today, with budget deficits that \nare not sustainable, to how we can bring our country into better fiscal \nbalance. We need a balanced approach. We need an approach that looks at \nspending, looks at revenues, that acknowledges that job growth is, \nfirst and foremost, our objective. We have to create more jobs in our \neconomy--more people working, less people needing governmental \nservices, more people paying tax revenues; all that helps generate the \ngrowth in our economy.\n  We have to protect the middle class. The middle class has been \nparticularly vulnerable during this slowdown in our economy from which \nwe are now recovering. It has to be real, what we come up with. That \nmeans it really does deal with the deficit problems of this country and \nshould be long term. I think all of us are tired of these short-term \nextensions. They may avoid an immediate problem but they do not give \nthe type of predictability that is necessary for our economy to take \noff and grow.\n  If you are an investor, it is tough to invest if you do not know the \nground rules, if you do not know what the Tax Code is going to look \nlike, what the Federal budget is going to look like. How do you invest \nin expanding a plant to deal with expanded Federal needs when you don't \nknow what the budget is going to be? How do you deal with the Tax Code \nif maybe you want to develop an energy company when you do not know \nwhat the tax provisions are going to be for that operation? We need to \ngive predictability. Therefore, long-term solutions are better.\n  And it needs to be truly bipartisan. I was here on New Year's Eve at \nmidnight. I saw the Democrats and Republicans come together in a true \ncompromise that I think put the Nation's interests first rather than \nour partisan interests. I would have wished to see us do things a lot \ndifferently than in that agreement, but it was bipartisan, we \ncompromised, we listened, and did it in the best traditions of the \nCongress.\n  I wish to take us back 2 years ago when we started to struggle with \nhow we would deal with our fiscal problems. President Obama appointed \nthe Simpson-Bowles Commission, and we know a lot about that. They made \ntheir recommendations. Some of the recommendations' specifics were \npretty controversial, but I think as to the overall framework of the \nSimpson-Bowles recommendations--the amount of additional revenue we \nneed to bring in, the types and parameters of the spending cuts--I \nthink there was general national agreement that that was the framework \nwhich would allow us to move forward in the best interests of our \neconomy. I point out in the last Congress the Democrats on the Senate \nBudget Committee adopted that approach as our framework to move \nforward. I think that is what we need to look at.\n  Let me make a couple of points, because I have listened to a lot of \nmy colleagues come to the floor and talk about how we have not made \nprogress, that our deficits are too large. We have made progress. We \nhave. We have gotten about halfway there. Simpson-Bowles was somewhere \nbetween $4 and $5 trillion of deficit reduction over a 10-year period. \nWe are about halfway there. We have about $2.5 trillion we have gotten \ndone. We got that done because we passed the Budget Control Act, and \nthe Budget Control Act put in lower caps on discretionary spending on \nthe domestic side. That is now the law of the land. Over $1 trillion of \ndeficit reduction was accomplished because of the Budget Control Act.\n  We did another $1 trillion of deficit reduction on New Year's Eve, \nthe fiscal cliff agreements that brought in more revenue by making \npermanent the 39.6-percent tax rate for high-income taxpayers and \nbringing in some additional spending cuts. That is real.\n  My colleagues say we still have these large deficits and they are \nlarger than they were before, but if we did not do the Budget Control \nAct and we did not do the fiscal cliff agreements, the deficit would be \nmuch higher. Again, using some common baseline, such as Simpson-Bowles \ndid, we have done\n\n[[Page S454]]\n\nabout half of what, if you agree on the framework of Simpson-Bowles, we \nneed to do. We have to get more done; we are not there yet. The \nrevenues of this country traditionally have been about 19 percent of \nour economy. That is what it was under President Clinton when we \nbalanced the Federal budget. We actually had surpluses. Our economy was \ngrowing. There was job growth. We were moving in the right direction.\n  Our revenues have dipped to about 15 percent of our economy, so we \nare not anywhere near having as much revenue as we need in order to \nhave a balanced approach that allows for job growth. And, yes, our \nspending is too high, particularly on what we call the mandatory side. \nWe agree with that. If you look at our health care costs in this \ncountry, they are much higher than those of any other nation in the \nworld and we do not have the health results that would demonstrate why \nwe are spending so much more. We need a more efficient system. That is \nwhy a lot of us supported the Affordable Care Act, because we see in it \ndelivery system reform that will make our health care system more \nefficient, bring down the cost of hospital care by reducing \nreadmissions, bring down the cost of hospital care by reducing hospital \ninfection rates, bring down the cost of high-cost interventions by \ndealing with people with complicated issues, multiple issues, in a much \nmore managed way; using health technology more efficiently; using \npreventive care to actually reduce health care costs. We know early \nintervention saves lives, saves costs, and when you bring down the cost \nof health care you bring down the cost of Medicaid, you bring down the \ncost of Medicare, and you help our budget get into better balance.\n  We also believe we can save money in the military. The baseline for \nmilitary spending assumes the high level of military operations in \nAfghanistan. Well, our troops are coming home. I think we can now \nsafely assume that our Active military needs will not be at the high \nlevels they have been over the last decade, and that will save money. I \npersonally think we need to look at a BRAC-like process for our \ninternational military facilities, as we did for our domestic military \nfacilities. All of that can save money.\n  So what do we need to do? We need to get together, Democrats and \nRepublicans, on a balanced approach. We need to do it in the month of \nFebruary because on March 1 these automatic cuts, known as \nsequestration, take effect. The automatic cuts were put in during the \nBudget Control Act as a way to get us to act. None of us wanted to see \nacross-the-board cuts to both our domestic and our military budgets; we \ndidn't think that made a lot of sense. After all, some programs are \nmore important than others, and we should make the hard choices. We \nshould not be using an across-the-board cut.\n  We need to come together. As I have indicated, there are areas in the \nspending where I hope we can come together so we can make our system \nmore efficient, particularly on the delivery of health care. There are \ncertain reductions we can make in the overseas contingency accounts in \nour military.\n  On the revenue side, we have brought out areas where there are \nloopholes and shelters in our Tax Code. We can do a better job. It is \ninteresting that the top 1 percent of the taxpayers of this country \nreceive 25 percent of the benefits on what is known as tax \nexpenditures. I heard my colleagues come to the floor and talk about \nhow we have to bring down the cost of spending. Well, yes, we do spend \nthrough appropriations bills, but we also spend through tax \nexpenditures, which are provisions we put in the Tax Code to give \nbreaks to some--not all--of our constituents. When we add up all those \ntax expenditures, it comes to $1.2 trillion a year. That is what the \ntax expenditures come to. That is larger than our entire discretionary \nspending. We are spending more through the Tax Code than we are through \nappropriations bills. We can certainly find some savings in those tax \nexpenditures, and we can use that in a balanced approach to be able to \navoid the across-the-board cuts and get our budget back into better \nbalance. That is where we need to move as a Congress and as a nation.\n  It is important for us to take timely action. Let me underscore that. \nWe need to act in February. We don't want to go through the uncertainty \nof what sequestration means. I have talked to a lot of businesspeople \nwho depend on Federal contracts. Will that contract be let? They don't \nknow. We need to give predictability so that our economy can take off.\n  I hope we all put our Nation's fiscal interests ahead of any of our \npartisan objectives, and that means listening to each other. Democrats \nand Republicans need to listen. My colleagues on the Republican side of \nthe aisle have made some good points in regard to mandatory spending. \nMy colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle have made some very \nvalid points about the need for revenue. I hope we will listen to each \nother, resolve our differences, and put a proposal forward that brings \nour Nation back to a stable fiscal future, which will allow us to \ncreate the types of jobs we need by investment and fiscal prudence so \nour economy can continue to lead the world. We need to act in a \nresponsible, balanced, bipartisan, and timely way.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/04/senate-section/article/S454-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S454-S455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am honored to be an original cosponsor \nof the bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against Women \nAct. Let me thank the two leaders of that important bill, Senators \nLeahy and Crapo, for their work to ensure that the Senate makes \nrenewing this important law a high priority early in this Congress.\n  I also wish to acknowledge the work of the many advocates who have \ndelivered so strongly the message to Congress and to the public that we \nmust do more to prevent violence from occurring in our homes and in our \ncommunities. Our law enforcement officers, counselors, social workers, \nhealth care professionals, public educators, and community service \nproviders are truly on the front lines of the effort to help those who \nare the victims of violence and to help prevent violence from occurring \nin the first place. Their advocacy on behalf of these victims has \nhelped to make this bill a priority. I commend them all for the work \nthey are doing each and every day.\n  In my home State of Maine, we are fortunate to have a very low crime \nrate, but law enforcement officials tell me that the two greatest areas \nof concern are domestic violence and drugs. Often, these two go hand in \nhand. In fact, a 2011 study by the University of Southern Maine's \nMuskie School of Public Service found that 65 percent of victims of \ncrime in Maine believe the offender was under the influence of drugs or \nalcohol at the time.\n  Over the last decade, occurrences of domestic violence have resulted \nin nearly half of all homicides in my State. Nearly half are the result \nof incidents of domestic violence.\n  According to statistics from the Maine Department of Public Safety, \nthere were 5,360 reported domestic assaults in the year 2011, which is \nnearly a 5-percent increase from the previous year. This equates to one \ndomestic assault every 1 hour and 38 minutes, and this is in a State \nwith a very low crime rate.\n  Nationally, one in four women and one in seven men experience severe \nphysical violence at the hands of an intimate partner.\n  In addition, Maine's 10-year average is 364 rapes per year. Think \nabout that. That is almost one rape per day in a State with a very low \ncrime rate. Those are only the reported crimes. I suspect the actual \nnumber is even higher. According to the Maine Coalition Against Sexual \nAssault, an estimated 13,000 Mainers will experience some form of \nsexual violence this year alone. Currently, rape has the lowest \nreporting, arrest, and prosecution rate of all violent crimes in the \nUnited States.\n  So I am very pleased that this year's reauthorization bill also \nincludes the provisions of the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence \nRegistry--or SAFER--Act, which was authored by our colleague, Senator \nJohn Cornyn. I commend the Senator for his leadership in that area, and \nI am pleased to be a cosponsor of his bill, which unanimously passed in \nthe last Congress in the Senate and has been incorporated into the \nViolence Against Women Act reauthorization. This bipartisan bill, the\n\n[[Page S455]]\n\nSAFER Act, would authorize the Attorney General to award grants to \nState and local governments to audit and reduce the backlog of untested \nrape kits.\n  Mr. President, I think you will share my shock and alarm at the \nnumber of these kits which are sitting in the possession of law \nenforcement agencies and which could contain DNA evidence that would \nlead to prosecutions and help get rapists off the streets and yet have \nnot been analyzed. The estimate is that between 300,000 and 400,000 of \nthese kits are just sitting in the possession of law enforcement \nagencies but have not been analyzed. That is totally unacceptable.\n  The reauthorization bill we introduced last week would help ensure \nthat Maine and every other State has the necessary resources to support \nvictims of violence and, whenever possible, to prevent violence from \noccurring in the first place.\n  Elizabeth Saxl, the executive director of the Maine Coalition Against \nSexual Assault, recently wrote to me in support of the reauthorization \nof the Violence Against Women Act. She noted this in her letter:\n\n       By reauthorizing and making significant improvements to \n     these important programs, this legislation will help fulfill \n     the critical unmet needs of victims of violence and expand \n     protections to currently under-protected populations.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that her letter be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Violence Against Women Act has made a significant \ndifference in combating domestic violence, sexual assault, and \nstalking, through grants to State and local governments and nonprofit \norganizations. Since it was first passed in 1994, the programs \nauthorized under this law have provided State and local partners with \nmore than $4.7 billion of assistance. This assistance helps to ensure \nthat the victims of violence get the help they need to recover and has \nprevented incalculable suffering by stopping violent crimes before they \nhappen.\n  It is extremely important to pass this legislation because all men \nand women--and men are victims as well as women. In some ways, the name \nof this law should be changed. But all women and men, regardless of \nrace, religion, sexual orientation, or disability deserve to be safe \nand protected from physical violence, and that is what this \nreauthorization would help to do.\n  Finally, this is not and never should be a partisan issue. Violence \nand domestic assaults do not discriminate between Republicans and \nDemocrats, Independents and Greens, or people who are not politically \nactive at all.\n  This is an equal opportunity crime that harms people regardless of \ntheir political affiliation, their profession, their location, or their \nstatus in life. It is an issue that deserves bipartisan support. I hope \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle will come together and pass \nthis important bill.\n  I recognize there may be some provisions of this bill which are \ncontroversial; but, surely, we can come together in support of the goal \nof this vital legislation. We can work out differences if not on the \nSenate floor then in conference with the House; but, surely, we can \ncome together and reauthorize this law that has made such a difference \nto so many in our country.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                           Maine Coalition Against\n\n\n                                               Sexual Assault,\n\n                                    Augusta, ME, February 4, 2013.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins:  On behalf of the Maine Coalition \n     Against Sexual Assault (MECASA), and the sexual assault \n     crisis and support centers we represent, I am writing to \n     express our strong support for S. 47, the Violence Against \n     Women Reauthorization Act (VAWA) of 2013. By reauthorizing \n     and making significant improvements to these important \n     programs, this legislation will help fulfill the critical \n     unmet needs of victims of violence and expand protections to \n     currently under-protected populations.\n       VAWA has provided invaluable support for law enforcement, \n     courts, sexual assault crisis and support centers, domestic \n     violence service providers, prevention efforts, and community \n     outreach. In the past decade, nearly half of Maine's \n     homicides have been the result of domestic violence, many of \n     which included elements of sexual violence. Additionally, \n     nearly 13,000 Mainers will experience sexual violence this \n     year alone while Maine's ten-year average for rapes reported \n     to law enforcement is only 364. The cost of these crimes to \n     Maine is enormous. VAWA helps control these costs by enabling \n     support centers to provide free, necessary, quality services \n     to victims who need help, not to mention the incalculable \n     suffering that these programs help prevent.\n       Since the original passage of VAWA, Maine has strengthened \n     laws regarding domestic violence, sexual violence, and \n     stalking and has implemented programs which continue to yield \n     tangible results for victims and for public safety. Despite \n     VAWA's success, its criminal justice and community-based \n     programs remain acutely necessary. According to a recent \n     study by the University of Southern Maine's Muskie School of \n     Public Service, nearly one in five Mainers reported having \n     been the victim of sexual assault or an attempted sexual \n     assault in his or her lifetime. Nationally, the Center for \n     Disease Control and Prevention estimates that nearly one in \n     five women and one in 71 men have been raped at some time in \n     their lives, and one in four women and one in seven men \n     experience severe physical violence by an intimate partner.\n       MECASA supports efforts to further strengthen and improve \n     the response of the criminal justice, legal, and victim \n     support systems for survivors of domestic violence, dating \n     violence, sexual assault, and stalking. We are grateful to \n     you for your steadfast support of VAWA and your commitment to \n     violence prevention and response.\n       Thank you for all you do on behalf of Maine and our nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Elizabeth Ward Saxl,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, seeing no one seeking recognition, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Senator Corker pertaining to the introduction of S. \n215 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I notice the absence of a quorum, and I \nthank the chair for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/04/senate-section/article/S455-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S455-S458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DOD REFORM\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this past year, our national debt passed a \nstaggering $16 trillion, more than $51,000 for every man, woman, and \nchild in America. Today, several very serious fiscal matters that would \nseriously impact the Department of Defense and the U.S. defense \nindustrial base, including budget sequestration, the debt limit, and \ndisposition of the defense budget for fiscal year 2013 remain \nunresolved. Underpinning all of these matters is the larger issue of \nwhy the culture of how the Department of Defense does business must \nchange. While daunting, this question provides us with a valuable prism \nthrough which Senator Hagel's nomination, now pending consideration by \nthe Armed Services Committee, should be considered.\n  By ``culture,'' I mean that the mindset that has for years pervaded \nhow the Department of Defense buys goods and services and manages \nassets and resources without regard to either their affordability or \nwhat our service men and women actually need to defend the Nation.\n  After years of developing legislative initiatives intended to reform \nhow the Department does business, I am convinced that the single most \neffective agent of cultural change at the Department is the right \nleadership: leadership that recognizes that the Department owes to the \ntaxpayer a stewardship obligation to extract maximum value for every \ndefense dollar spent, and a moral responsibility to the warfighter that \nthese dollars are being spent wisely, to effectively procure desired \ncombat capability.\n\n[[Page S456]]\n\n  We need strong fiscal leadership to reject the use-or-lose mentality \nthat incentivizes managers of the Department's programs and activities \nto spend every dollar, no matter what our priorities really are, and \nreplace it with a process that actually rewards sound program \nmanagement, incentivizes efforts to cut costs, and rewards those who \nuse entrepreneurship and ingenuity to meet mission requirements, while \nreturning taxpayer funds to the U.S. Treasury. In other words, cultural \nchange needs leadership that not only rejects ``business-as-usual'' but \nalso challenges it. Where Senator Hagel is on this is not clear.\n  One area that reflects how desperately the Department of Defense \nneeds to change its culture of inefficiency is how it procures goods \nand services, in particular, how it acquires major weapons systems. \nWhile reforms in this area have been attempted for more than 25 years, \nthe same deplorable outcomes--major cost overruns, schedule slips, or \nfailures to perform as promised--all persist. Why? It is because \ndespite these efforts, the underlying culture within the Department of \n``business-as-usual,'' which predisposes its largest programs to these \noutcomes, has been allowed to live on.\n  In how the Department procures its largest and most expensive weapons \nsystems, this translates into a mindset that so fails to recognize the \nneed for affordability that it has made the Department more willing \nthan it should be to accept (at any cost) more risk than it can \nresponsibly manage. There are far too many examples of where the \nDepartment begins a major program without knowing what it really wants \nor how these requirements should translate into technical \nspecifications that are designed to generate the combat capability it \nreally needs. Also, all too many times, there is no traceability \nbetween these specifications through a test regime that is sufficient \nto ensure that the system the Department is procuring is operational \neffective, suitable, and survivable before entering operational testing \nor early production. So what happens? These systems stay ``on rails''; \nblow through their original cost and schedule estimates; and, at the \nend of the day, bear little resemblance to what the war-fighter \nactually needs.\n  But program management, fixated on ``keeping the money flowing'', \npush the program--many times, reimbursing the contractor for its costs \nthroughout, and with the parochial support of Members of this body--\ndown the development pipeline, offering facile excuses for poor \nperformance and, ultimately, less-than-desired capability. All of this \nhappens within an overall management system that is overly cumbersome \nand costly and provides for no meaningful accountability.\n  In the aggregate, this has been a ``perfect storm''. A defense \nprocurement culture that is content with promises of exquisite \nsolutions over actual affordability has squandered literally billions \nof taxpayer dollars. According to a recent study, since 2004, programs \ncanceled by the Army alone consumed between $3.3 billion and $3.8 \nbillion per year. That is 35 to 45 percent of the Army's annual budget \nfor development, testing, and engineering over this period. Obviously, \nthis is simply unacceptable and unsustainable.\n  Yet it happened again just recently. A couple of months ago, the Air \nForce, quite rightly, decided to kill a huge logistics supply chain \nmanagement business system called the Expeditionary Combat Support \nSystem, ECSS. But it did so only after, one, sinking about $1 billion \ninto the program since its start in 2005; two, recently finding that \nanother $1.1 billion would be needed to field just 25 percent of ECSS's \npromised capability; and, three, extracting from the taxpayer's total \n$1 billion investment less than $150 million in usable hardware and \nsoftware. I repeat: A total $1 billion investment, less than $150 \nmillion was obtained in usable hardware and software. This is a \ntravesty. In terms of how little benefit we realized compared to how \nmuch was spent, it is one of the most egregious examples of \nmismanagement in recent memory.\n\n  Some reforms have helped, but much work needs to be done. The Weapons \nSystems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 and its prescription to ``start \nprograms off right,'' was a move in the right direction. I am pleased \nto report that in its last of the three reports focused on how \neffectively the Department has been implementing that act, the \nGovernment Accountability Office recently found that the Department has \nbeen taking positive steps to implement this reform act.\n  It did so having sampled 11 weapons acquisition programs, including \nthe KC-46A tanker, the SSBN(X) Ohio-class ballistic, missile submarine \nreplacement, and the Ground Combat Vehicle, GCV. But getting rid of \npoor cost-, schedule-, and performance-outcomes and how the Department \nprocures goods and services will require the sustained and enduring \nchange that only a change in culture can provide. When it comes to \ndefense procurement, a change in culture is possible only with \nleadership that recognizes that for government to act as a responsible \nsteward over defense dollars, it must be as knowledgeable, skilled, and \nsophisticated a buyer as industry is a seller.\n  Whether Senator Hagel would serve as the right leader at the \nDepartment of Defense to foster needed cultural changes in the \nDepartment's procurement practices is unclear. What we do know is that \nthe right person must embrace the following principles: Set realistic \nrequirements early and manage changes to those requirements \naggressively. The Department must enforce better discipline and achieve \ngreater accountability in how it meets its most critical military needs \nby dismantling stovepipes among the requirements, acquisition policy, \nand budgeting communities and ensure clear lines of authority within \nacquisition organizations. With the benefit of robust participation by \nthe uniformed military, requirements should be frozen early, allowing \nfor sufficient trade-space among the program's cost- schedule- and \nperformance-variables to ensure that it is effectively managed \nthroughout its lifecycle. Exquisite high-risk, next-generation \nsolutions should be spiraled out over time. In other words, programs \nshould be set to shorter acquisition timelines and should be managed to \nthem.\n  Improve the Department's ability to price risk--effectively and \nindependently of industry--and budget to that cost. By ``risk,'' I mean \nthe risk that a system is exposed to throughout its life cycle: \ntechnical-, software-, development-, integration-, manufacturing-, and \nsustainment-risk--all of them. Acquiring weapons systems thoughtfully \nvis-a-vis risk would minimize funding instability which can absolutely \ndecimate a program's ability to deliver required capability on budget \nand on time and ultimately result in reliable systems that will be \naffordable to own and operate.\n  Revitalize, and where necessary, build-up the Department's \n``organic'' workforce in areas most vital to ``buying smart'', like \ncost-estimating, technical- and systems-engineering, developmental \ntesting, et cetera. The Department must be able to conduct proper \nshould-cost analysis to inform its positions when it negotiates \ncontracts and conduct engineering trade-off analysis to manage programs \neffectively over their lifecycles. With the benefit of this capability, \nthe Department will be able to more effectively target affordability \nand control cost growth.\n  Require the use of the type of contract that is most appropriate to \nthe level of risk to be managed in the fee structure that is most \nappropriate to the type of performance to be incentivized. This \nrequires the Department to know what it needs and, in connection with \nthat requirement, exactly what kind of contractor performance it wants \nto incentivize. To that extent and as quickly as possible, the \nDepartment must get its programs into a low- to moderate-risk \nenvironment where it can use fixed-price contracts to effectively \nincentivize cost control.\n\n  Better incentivize productivity and innovation. Rationalize profit \npolicy and effectively use performance-based contracting and other \ntools in the contracting toolkit to incentivize and reward contractors \nfor effectively managing costs, successfully managing their supply \nchains and indirect expenses, and actually delivering promised \ncapability.\n  Promote real competition, instead of ``checking the blocks''. Nothing \ndrives costs down and enhances quality more effectively than \ncompetition. The Department has to make sure that competition, or the \noption of competition,\n\n[[Page S457]]\n\nis brought to bear on a program throughout its lifecycle, at both the \nsystems and subsystems level. To the extent that the Department has \nbeen recently successful with some of its large, high-profile \nprocurements, it is because it has been able to leverage competition \naggressively.\n  Improve how the Department acquires services. Military departments \nthat have started diving into this area have already found massive \nopportunities for savings and efficiency- easily amounting to billions \nof dollars. This initiative should not only continue; it should expand \nthroughout the defense enterprise.\n  Reform how the Department procures information systems, especially, \nmajor automated information systems. While the technical aspects of \nthese products are, of course, fundamentally different from major \nweapons systems, the basic tradecraft, especially those that reflect \nbest business practices, shouldn't be that different. Procuring cyber-\nsecurity capability may, however, require greater agility and \nflexibility than what can be provided under the long and slow \n``deliberative'' acquisition process.\n  Improve the ``rapid acquisitions'' process. In support of on-going \noperations, the war-fighter cannot rely on the ``deliberative'' \nacquisition process to satisfy its needs. The process by which these \nsorts of urgent operational requirements are satisfied reliably and \ncost-effectively needs to be reformed.\n  Rein in the Department's ability to reprogram funds. I have been \nappalled that in fiscal year 2011 alone, the Department of Defense \ntransferred nearly $27 billion among Defense accounts and that only $11 \nbillion, or 40 percent of these transfers, received any type of \ncongressional oversight. That oversight was limited to just 8 Senators \nout of 100. The oversight of the transfer of billions of dollars is \nconfined to the oversight of eight Members of the U.S. Senate. I \nhappened to be one of them for the last 6 years, but I don't think it \nis appropriate to transfer that kind of money without all 100 percent \nbeing apprised of the need to do so. Despite that the Department cannot \nbe audited--the Department of Defense has never been audited--we \ncontinue to provide it with the flexibility to engage in what amounts \nto budget gamesmanship where certain accounts, such as operation and \nmaintenance and base-operations support, which are intended to satisfy \n``must-pay'' bills, are historically underfunded in the President's \nannual budget request, with the understanding that the Department will \nbe able to transfer funds between accounts down-the-road. In my view, \nthis type of budget gamesmanship is a big reason why the Department \ncannot annually produce auditable financial statements and frustrates \nobjectively assessing the priority or urgency of the Department's \nrequirements.\n  This brings me to the other major area of how the Defense Department \n``does business'' that underscores the need for cultural reform, \ndefense financial management, and the most significant thing that can \nbe done in this area is finally getting the Department auditable.\n  There can be no doubt that the ability of the Department to be \naudited independently would help ensure that the defense dollars are \nnot wasted, lost, or otherwise misused. Absent auditability, the \nGovernment Accountability Office (GAO) has, since 1995, designated the \nDepartment's financial management as ``high-risk''.\n  Today's fiscal challenges bring new urgency to the issue of \nauditability at the Department of Defense. To navigate successfully \nthrough this period of austerity and fiscal uncertainty without \ninadvertently impinging on military readiness, the Department will have \nto make management decisions that are fully informed and carefully \ncalibrated. To ensure intended results, the Department has to make sure \nthese decisions are being executed as planned.\n  From well-managed companies in the private sector, which have to make \ndecisions like this all the time, we know that reliable financial data, \neffective internal controls, efficient business processes, and sound \nbusiness systems are needed to support an organization whose finances \ncan be audited.\n  Granted, the Department won't use auditable financial statements \nthemselves to make important management decisions, but the high quality \nof the financial information that feeds into financial statements that \nare ready-for-audit would be incredibly valuable, indeed indispensable, \nfor identifying opportunities for savings and efficiencies; \nsuccessfully implementing initiatives and management controls to \nrealize these savings and efficiencies; and making sure that \nincreasingly scarce defense dollars are redirected to higher defense \npriorities. This would give the primary stakeholders in how the \nDepartment is managed--the war-fighter and the taxpayer--confidence \nthat the defense management decisions can be relied upon to produce \nintended results. Given the state of financial management at the \nDepartment of Defense today, we do not now have that confidence.\n  One big reason why we don't is that to date the Department's \ncommitment to achieving financial auditability has been characterized \nby blown-deadline after blown-deadline. Various statutes, including the \nChief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the Government Management Reform \nAct of 1994, the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996, \nand other provisions in various Defense authorization and \nappropriations acts, have required financial improvements at the \nDepartment of Defense for the Department to produce auditable financial \nstatements. After continuous failure, we are at a point now where, for \nexample, when then-Secretary of Defense Gates was trying to find \nefficiency and reduce waste at the Department a few years ago, he said \nwhat he was doing was ``something akin to an Easter egg hunt''. He \nexplained, ``[M]y staff and I learned that it was nearly impossible to \nget accurate information and answers to questions such as `[h]ow much \nmoney do you spend?' and ``[h]ow many people do you have?'''\n  For this reason, after succeeding Secretary Gates, Secretary Panetta \nimmediately elevated financial improvement to a top priority of the \nDepartment by directing the Department to cut in half the time to make \na key financial statement, called the Statement of Budgetary Resources \n(SBR), ready-for-audit. This goal must be achieved by fiscal year 2014. \nSeeking to leverage Secretary Panetta's initiative and with the \nassistance of Senator Ayotte, the Senate Armed Services Committee \nincluded a provision in its authorization bill this year that \nformalizes this goal.\n  I am pleased to say that while much work needs to be done for the \nDepartment of Defense to achieve its audit-readiness goals, the \nDepartment has made some limited progress, particularly through its \nFinancial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) plan, which the Senate \nArmed Services Committee legislated as a requirement a few years ago. \nThe House Armed Services Committee's Panel on Defense Financial \nManagement and Auditability Reform found early this year contained a \n``reasonable strategy and methodology.''\n  In my view, it is no longer the case that top defense managers ``just \ndon't get it'' or that they are dragging their feet because they don't \nsee financial improvement as a priority. Indeed, perhaps the silver-\nlining in today's fiscal challenges is that it seems to have united top \nmanagement at the Pentagon into finally realizing how important it is \nfor the Department to become financially auditable.\n  Indeed, over the last few years, some agencies within the Department, \nsuch as the Army Corps of Engineers, the Military Retirement Fund, \nDefense Contracting Audit Agency, and TRICARE's Contract Management \nActivity have received clean audit opinions. As GAO's Director of \nFinancial Management and Assurance Asif Khan recently said, Secretary \nPanetta's directive has resulted in a ``change in tone at the top'' \nthat has ``reset'' the Department's efforts to achieve an unqualified \naudit opinion. How exactly would Senator Hagel, if confirmed, further \nSecretary Panetta's efforts here?\n  This is not an academic question. As the Department of Defense's \nDeputy Inspector General for Auditing Dan Blair recently noted, for the \nDepartment to achieve an auditable statement of budgetary resources \n(SBR) by 2014, it must run what amounts to ``a big checking account \nwith thousands of people being able to write checks'' and that \ncapturing an ``auditable universe''\n\n[[Page S458]]\n\nwithin it will require reconciling between a general ledger and \nsubsidiary ledgers.\n  A big problem is ongoing delay in implementing very expensive \nbusiness computer systems called ``enterprise resource planning'' or \nERPs, which perform a number of business-related functions vital to \ntransforming the Department's business operations. The ECSS system I \nmentioned a few minutes ago is one of these ERPs.\n  As of December 2009, the Department of Defense has invested over $5.8 \nbillion in these ERPs and will invest billions more before they are \nfully implemented. Most of them are over budget and behind schedule or \nhaven't provided promised capability. Yet these ERPs make up more than \nhalf of the Department's entire expenditure in the area of business \ntransformation, costing the taxpayers more than $1 billion per year.\n  This is vitally important. If the Department doesn't get ERPs right, \nlike a system known as ECSS that cost $1 billion dollars, not only will \nthe Department have squandered monies that it had already sunk into \nthese programs but it will also severely undermined its ability to \nimprove the efficiency and the effectiveness of scores of business- \nmissions such as logistics and supply chain management, et cetera, that \nare key to supporting those service-men and -women who defend the \nNation.\n  What needs to be done? From the top down, lines of authority must be \nclarified. The relevant workforce must be well-versed in government \naccounting practices and standards and be experienced in related-\ninformation technology. Given how vitally important these ERPs are to \nthis mission, people who have actual experience successfully \nimplementing global business systems must be properly mixed into the \nworkforce, and contractors hired to integrate these business systems \ninto the Department must be the best-qualified partners and held to the \nsame high performance standards that should apply to any other major \ndefense acquisition.\n  Within this overall structure, there must be sufficient oversight and \naccountability vis-a-vis a well-defined and federated business \nenterprise architecture that ensures that, in terms of organizational \ntransformation and systems modernization, all the different elements of \nthe Department are moving in the same direction toward a single goal. \nThese kinds of issues need to have the day-to-day attention of the \nDepartment's Chief Management Officer, that is, the Deputy Secretary of \nDefense and the chief management officers within the military \ndepartments.\n  At this point, I am of the view that, with all of the congressional \nreforms and mandates in the area of financial improvement over the past \nfew years, the Department of Defense has all the tools it needs to have \nin its tool-kit to achieve audit-readiness on time and on budget. The \nissue is leadership and execution. As the House Panel on Financial \nManagement and Auditability Reform noted, a vital part of that is \n``ensuring that senior leaders are held accountable when audit \nreadiness goals are not met, and conversely, rewarded when goals are \nachieved''. Also, defense financial improvement must no longer be \nregarded as an activity important only to the Department's financial \ncommunity. Field commanders have to be fully engaged and interested in \ndriving change outside the Pentagon. If Senator Hagel is confirmed, his \nsetting this tone from the top will be vitally important.\n\n  Is all this enormously challenging? It absolutely is, as befits an \norganization of the size and complexity of the Department of Defense. \nWith an annual budget equal to the 17th largest economy in the world, \nas the Institute for Defense Analyses recently noted, the Department's \n``business'' of achieving its unique and disparate missions worldwide \non an ongoing and contingency basis equates more to an economy than a \ncommercial business.\n  Be that as it may, with an annual federal budget deficit of $1.3 \ntrillion and defense reductions of at least $487 billion and possibly, \nwith sequestration, another $500 billion over the next 10 years, the \nDepartment needs to have reliable financial management data to help it \ndistinguish between defense budget cuts that are prudent and necessary, \nand those that may impinge on military readiness and, therefore, \nendanger our national security.\n  Only a Department that can be audited can give us the assurance that \nthe Department is moving in the right direction in terms of identifying \nthe right opportunities to save defense dollars and eliminate waste, \nand redirecting increasingly scarce defense dollars to higher defense \npriorities.\n  All I have discussed today illustrates how important sound leadership \nat the top of the Department of Defense is to ``buying smarter'' and \ngetting the Department ready-for-audit. Without leadership \nfundamentally and unalterably mindful of the Department's \nresponsibility to the American people to use defense dollars wisely, \nthis cultural change will forever remain elusive. For this reason, this \nbody's consideration of the President's nominee to serve as the next \nSecretary of Defense will be more important than it has been in recent \nmemory.\n  I would like to give credit to the present Secretary of Defense, Mr. \nLeon Panetta, who brought his knowledge and expertise on budgetary \nmatters to his work at the Pentagon. I will say more about him later \non, but I am very appreciative of the outstanding service present \nSecretary of Defense Panetta has provided to this Nation, with many \nlong years of service both in elected as well as appointed office. We \nare proud to have Americans such as Secretary Panetta serving our \nNation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/04/senate-section/article/S458-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S458-S460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am glad the Senate is now having some \ndiscussion among Members not yet on the floor about the issue of \nimmigration because it is a very important problem that we have to deal \nwith. I look forward to the debate that I think is coming up this year \non immigration, and I would like to share my thoughts and my past \nexperiences on this issue. I particularly want to share my personal \nexperience from the 1980s amnesty law and what we can learn from that \ndebate.\n  But before I go into that history, I wish to commend many Senators \nwho are working together to forge a consensus and produce a product on \nthis terribly difficult issue. I commend them for sitting down and \nagreeing to a set of principles that were put forth in a news \nconference last week. As ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I \nexpect to play a role in brokering an even broader consensus with \nadditional Members.\n  I have read the bipartisan framework for immigration reform this \ngroup has written, and the one thing that struck me--in fact, it is the \nlast sentence in the preamble--is this:\n\n       We will ensure that this is a successful, permanent reform \n     to our immigration system that will not need to be revisited.\n\n  In other words, the group understands we need a long-term solution to \nthe problem. We need a serious fix so future generations don't have to \ndeal with 11 million or 15 million or 30 million people who have come \nillegally. That sentence is the most important part of that document, \nand we must not lose sight of the goal expressed by the eight Senators \nwho enunciated that.\n  But we need to learn from our previous mistakes so we truly don't \nhave to revisit the problem. So let us discuss the 1986 amnesty under \nPresident Reagan. There are few of us in the Senate today who were \npresent during that debate. In 1980, President Reagan campaigned on a \npromise that he would work to reform our immigration laws and legalize \nforeign workers in the United States. The President's policies were \nfurther shaped by the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee \nPolicy that was created in 1978 under President Carter.\n  President Reagan signed a bill into law on November 6, 1986. So 6 \nyears after he first ran for President, he signed a law. This law was \nknown as the Immigration Reform and Control Act. The process to \nfinalize the bill was long and arduous. It took years--6 years, to be \nexact.\n  In 1981, when I was a freshman Senator, I joined the Judiciary \nCommittee and was a member of the Subcommittee on Immigration and \nRefugee Policy. Back then, subcommittees did real work. They actually \nsat down and wrote legislation. We had 100 hours of hearings and 300 \nwitnesses before we\n\n[[Page S459]]\n\nmarked up a bill in May 1982--a markup 4 years before the President \never signed it.\n  Senator Simpson chaired the subcommittee, and other members included \nSenators Thurmond, Kennedy, and DeConcini. Senator Thurmond was called \nto the White House and Senator DeConcini had just been hospitalized, so \nSenators Simpson, Kennedy, and I brought up amendments and we actually \nvoted on them. Senator Kennedy, on that day, said:.\n\n       Immigration reform is one of the most complicated and \n     difficult issues; it involves human beings, it involves \n     families, it involves loved ones, children and the separation \n     of those individuals.\n\n  His words would still resonate today.\n  In 1982, I told my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee that I \nwanted to do the right thing for the United States, and this is what I \nsaid at that time:\n\n       The real issue here is what is best for United States \n     citizens. In trying to maintain that perspective, I have come \n     to the conclusion through the course of attending many \n     hearings on this issue, that increased border and interior \n     enforcement along with employer sanctions and a secure worker \n     eligibility identity system is necessary to regain control of \n     our borders.\n\n  This is a philosophy that continues to guide me on this issue of \nimmigration yet today. But I expressed my concerns with the \nlegalization component at the time. I echoed the recommendations of the \nSelect Commission on Immigration. That Commission said a legalization \nshould, No. 1, be consistent with U.S. interests; and, 2, the program \nshould not encourage further undocumented migration. The commission \nbelieved that a legalization program should not begin until new \nenforcement measures had been instituted.\n  The Commission knew then, as I did and as I know now, that ``without \nmore effective enforcement, legalization could serve as a stimulus to \nfurther illegal entry.'' Those are the words of the Commission. You \nsee, I didn't think permanent residency should be granted until we had \na worker eligibility system. I offered an amendment on that point in \n1982, but that amendment failed.\n  The Judiciary Committee and the full Senate passed a bill in 1982, \nbut it did not pass the House of Representatives. We tried again in the \nnext Congress. The Senate passed a bill in 1983, and the House followed \nin 1984. We convened a conference committee between the House and the \nSenate, but Walter Mondale came out opposed. So we adjourned for the \nelections and failed to finalize a bill that year--2 years before \nPresident Reagan finally signed a bill.\n  We returned in 1985 to pass our bill again. That year, Senator \nSimpson included a provision to trigger the amnesty program only after \nenforcement measures to curtail illegal immigration were in place. \nDoesn't that sound familiar? Congress passed a final bill in November \n1986. The vote in the Senate was 63 to 24 and the House vote was 238 to \n173.\n  Over the years, many Members have offered amendments to water down \nthe enforcement provision in the Simpson-Mazzoli Act. That was the name \nof the legislation. Senator Simpson and Congressman Mazzoli were the \nleaders of that effort in 1986. There was a lot of opposition to \nemployer sanctions, especially by Senator Kennedy. He wanted, in his \nwords, ``criminal penalties to be based only upon injunctive finding of \na pattern or practice.'' He tried to sunset the employer sanction. \nSenator Kennedy also fought hard to move the legalization cutoff date \nfrom 1980 to 1982 so more people could benefit from the amnesty.\n  The 1986 bill was supposed to be a three-legged stool: control of \nillegal immigration, the first leg; a legalization program, the second \nleg; and the third leg, reform of legal immigration. We authorized $422 \nmillion to carry out the requirements of the Immigration Reform Act and \ncreated a special fund for States to reimburse their costs. The 1986 \nbill included a legalization program for two categories of people: one \nfor individuals who had been present in the United States since 1982; \nand the second for farm workers who had worked in agriculture for at \nleast 90 days prior to enactment. A total of 2.7 million people were \ngiven amnesty.\n  We also had enforcement. For the first time ever, we made it illegal \nto knowingly hire or employ someone here illegally. We set penalties to \ndeter the hiring of people here illegally. We wrote in the bill that \n``one essential element of immigration control is an increase in the \nborder patrol and other inspection and enforcement activities of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service in order to prevent and deter \nthe illegal entry of aliens into the United States and the violation of \nthe terms of their entry.''\n  So let me again repeat one of the principles the Gang of 8 included \nin their framework enunciated last week: ``We will ensure that this is \na successful permanent reform to our immigration system that will not \nneed to be revisited.''\n  Unfortunately, the same principles from 1986 are being discussed \ntoday. Legalize now, enforce later. But it is clear that philosophy \ndoesn't work. Proponents of amnesty today argue we didn't get it right \nin 1986. I agree the enforcement mechanism in 1986 could have been \nstronger. That is why they need to be strong this time around. But I am \nalready concerned some will attempt to water down the principles that \nhave been put forth on enforcement measures. President Obama doesn't \nseem to favor triggers.\n  The senior Senator from New York said just last week that border \nsecurity wasn't going to stop legalization. In his words, he said:\n\n       We're not using border security as an excuse or block to \n     the path of citizenship.\n\n  Advocacy groups are already talking about ensuring that a border \nsecurity commission doesn't stand in the way or have veto authority \nover a legalization program.\n  One theme from 1986 is shining through today. Some say we need to \nlegalize the millions of people who are already on U.S. soil. They say \nwe need to bring them out of the shadows, know who is here, and give \nthem a chance at U.S. citizenship. They imply that this would be a one-\ntime deal because we would get it right this time--like we thought we \ngot it right in 1986 but didn't.\n  In the 1980s Senator Simpson was convinced that what we did then \nwould be a permanent solution to our immigration problems. He stated:\n\n       We are attempting to assure that this is a one-time only \n     program. . . . The purpose of legalization is not to award or \n     reward or include the largest number of persons available. It \n     is to bring forward into a legal status those most deeply \n     entrenched in a society they would be least likely to return \n     home to when the job opportunities no longer are available.\n\n  Senator Simpson said that a one-time amnesty would prevent us from a \ncontinuing series of amnesties. He said:\n\n       The major reason for legalization is to eliminate an \n     illegal sub-class within our society. This is the legislation \n     that will eliminate this exploitable group. Some people like \n     to say that they hope it will clean the slate; that is what \n     we are trying to do is clean the slate.\n\n  Well, those are good intentions by Senator Simpson, but, as I said, \nthey obviously haven't worked. And it is an admonition to those who \nwant to do it right, once and for all, to learn from the mistakes of \n1986.\n  Senator Simpson also said:\n\n       The American people, in my mind, will never accept a \n     legalization program unless they can be assured this is a \n     one-shot deal and that this is it, this is a one-time \n     occurrence. And the policymakers in this country are not \n     going to allow it to happen again and will prevent the \n     situation which gave rise to it.\n\n  Well, as smart as Senator Simpson is--and he is a smart person. I \nlike to see him on television, particularly when he is talking about \nwhy the President didn't back the Simpson-Bowles Commission on budget \nreform and fiscal reform. But here is a person who worked 6 years to \nget it right so we would never have to visit it again, when we had 3 \nmillion people who had come here, illegally violating our laws--get it \nfixed once and for all and thought he did. But I think now he would \nadmit--and I have to admit because I was on the subcommittee--we didn't \nget it right. I voted for that.\n  So now, as I am looking at a group of eight trying to say in the \npreamble of their working paper: We are going to fix this once and for \nall, well, you better check that it is not very easy to do that, and \nyou better do it better than we did.\n  The INS Commissioner at the time in 1986, Alan Nelson, told the \ncommittee that the legalization program was ``realistic and humane'' \nand said further that ``it is clear that this is meant to\n\n[[Page S460]]\n\nbe a one-time proposal, and not intended to recur.''\n  In 1986, the committee report said:\n\n       . . . the solution lies in legalizing the status of aliens \n     who have been present in the United States for several years, \n     recognizing that past failures to enforce the immigration \n     laws have allowed them to enter and to settle here.\n\n  Also, according to the report, the committee `` . . . strongly \nbelieves that a one-time legalization program is a necessary part of an \neffective enforcement program and that a generous program is an \nessential part of any immigration reform legislation.''\n  In 1986 the Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act. \nAt the time, President Reagan hailed it as the most comprehensive \nreform of our immigration laws since 1952. He stated that the \nlegislation was a major step toward meeting the challenge to our \nsovereignty while at the same time preserving and enhancing the \nNation's heritage of legal immigration--a heritage of which we all \nought to be proud.\n  What Congress, the public, and the President did not envision or did \nnot want was another amnesty debate. The American people were told in \n1986 that this would be a one-time shot. The incentive to buy in to the \nargument was the promise of enforcement.\n  In 1985 Senator Simpson said:\n\n       If legalization should occur before more effective \n     enforcement is available, the illegal population is only \n     going to grow very swiftly again, and that will create \n     pressures for additional legalization. And it will not be a \n     one-time only legalization; it will be a continuing series.\n\n  Many believed that employer sanctions were the only way to curtail \nillegal immigration. One committee report stated that ``unless employer \nsanctions are enacted, the Committee is concerned that the situation \nwill continue to worsen.''\n  In 1985 Senator Metzenbaum of Ohio said:\n\n       When push comes to shove, there is only one realistic way \n     that you can stop illegal immigration into this country, and \n     that is by making it illegal and being tough enough that \n     illegal immigrants cannot work in this country.\n\n  Knowing what we know now, an immigration reform bill must include \ntough enforcement measures. We must stop flow at the border. We must \nexpand and enhance legal avenues so that people are not coming here \nillegally. We must have a strong employment verification program.\n  Unfortunately, we aren't enforcing the laws we have on the books \ntoday. The American people don't trust that we will enforce these laws \nin the future. We provided amnesty overnight in 1986 and didn't fulfill \nthe other parts of the equation. Border security, enforcement measures, \nand legal immigration reform need to be the first things on our agenda \nin 2013.\n  I chose to talk about this topic today because I believe we can learn \nfrom the past. We can learn from our mistakes. This isn't just about \nour history, it is about our future. Today, people in foreign lands \nwant to be a part of this great Nation. We should feel privileged that \npeople love our country and want to become Americans.\n  We must make sure the decisions we make with regard to our \nimmigration policies follow our longstanding ideals. We want to welcome \nnew Americans, but we need to live by the rules we have set. We cannot \nlet our welcome mat be trampled on or our system of laws be undermined.\n  Let me end by echoing the words of President Reagan:\n\n       Distance does not discourage illegal immigration to the \n     United States from all around the globe. The problem of \n     illegal immigration should not, therefore, be seen as a \n     problem between the United States and its neighbors. Our \n     objective is only to establish a reasonable, fair, orderly, \n     and secure system of immigration into this country and not to \n     discriminate in any way against particular nations or people. \n     Future generations of Americans will be thankful for our \n     efforts to humanely regain control of our borders and thereby \n     preserve the value of one of the most sacred possessions of \n     our people: American citizenship.\n\n  My hope is that we will preserve the value of American citizenship, \nas President Reagan said. The path we take today will shape our country \nfor years to come. It is my hope that we can find a solution while \nlearning from our mistakes and ensuring that future generations don't \nhave to revisit this problem down the road.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to be here \ntoday to highlight my support for a program that is improving life in \nIdaho and across the Nation--the Violence Against Women Act.\n  I appreciate joining my colleague Senator Leahy, who will be here on \nthe floor in a few minutes, to formally open debate on this \nlegislation, and hopefully we will be able to get this over the finish \nline this year, as it is so critical to so many people in this country.\n  For nearly two decades, the Violence Against Women Act has been the \ncenterpiece of our Nation's commitment to ending domestic violence and \ndating and sexual violence. The Idaho Coalition Against Sexual and \nDomestic Violence uses vital funds, among many other things, to promote \nthe awareness of healthy relationships in middle and high schools in \nIdaho. It is heartening to hear that the number of Idaho high school \nstudents reporting that they have experienced dating violence has \ndropped by 5 percent from 2007 to 2011. However, I am sad to report \nthat since just January 1 of this year, four deaths have occurred in my \nState from the result of domestic violence. And even one is too many. \nThese tragic events serve as a reminder that while we are improving, we \nare far from ending this terrible abuse.\n  I am a lifelong champion of the prevention of domestic violence \nbecause I believe that while we are improving, we can and will do \nbetter. I stand behind this act as it provides critical services to \nvictims of violent crime as well as agencies and organizations that \nprovide important aid to those who are often victims in their own \nhomes. This legislation provides access to legal and social services \nfor survivors. It provides training for law enforcement, prosecutors, \njudges, attorneys, and advocates to address these crimes in our \nNation's communities. It provides intervention for those who have \nwitnessed abuse and are more likely to be involved in this type of \nviolence. It provides shelter and resources for victims who have \nnowhere else to turn.\n  There is significant evidence that these programs are working not \njust in Idaho but nationwide. The U.S. Department of Justice reported \nthat the number of women killed by an intimate partner decreased by 35 \npercent between 1993 and 2008. In 2012 it was reported that in 1 day \nalone, 688 women and their children impacted by violence sought safety \nin an emergency shelter or received counseling, legal advocacy, or \nchildren's support.\n  While we may not agree on all of the specifics of this \nreauthorization--and there are portions we will continue to negotiate \non and to refine--we all do agree on one very important idea; that is, \nviolence should not happen to anyone. This critical legislation is very \neffective in helping to address that abuse in our society.\n  As I said, there are parts of this legislation about which there are \nstill concerns. I am committed, as is Senator Leahy, to working with \nthose who have concerns to make the bill better and more workable so we \ncan move it through to become law in this session of Congress. But \nafter we debate and after we have worked and refined the legislation, I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting the authorization of this \nprogram and to continue the life-changing work this Chamber has been \ncommitted to for so many years.\n  I see my colleague Senator Leahy is on the Senate floor. I started a \nlittle before he got here. I know he is here to open the debate on this \nlegislation. I again thank him for his work on this issue and look \nforward to working with him in this Congress as we move forward.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have enjoyed working with the senior Senator from Idaho. \nIf he wants more time--\n\n[[Page S461]]\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. I have concluded my remarks.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 47, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to (S. 47) a bill to reauthorize the \n     Violence Against Women Act of 1994.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 \np.m. will be equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Idaho for \nhis comments. He has been not only a stalwart supporter, he actually \nhas been essential in the drafting of this legislation. We all share \nthis concern of finding ways to stop violence against women. I realize \ndifferent parts of the country have different problems, different \nstresses. I am pleased to have a western view to go with this eastern \nview. But also, I think, it is a case of the best legislation in this \nbody, legislation supported by both Democrats and Republicans. When we \ncome together as Senators, things get done.\n  That is one of the reasons we are turning to this bill, S. 47, the \nLeahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, as one of our \nfirst bills. It has bipartisan support. I thank Majority Leader Reid \nfor making this unfinished business a priority for the Senate.\n  Congressional enactment of our strong bipartisan bill to help all \nvictims of domestic and sexual violence is long overdue. Our bill has \nmore than 60 bipartisan Senate cosponsors. I think this week we can \nfinally finish what we started last year by passing the bill in the \nSenate, sending it to the other body, and having them take it up. I \nknow I am deeply indebted--we all are--to the women and men around the \ncountry who have been working with us. They have been steadfast in \ntheir commitment to the victims and to our efforts to combat domestic \nviolence, dating violence, stalking, and sexual assault.\n  There is a pressing need to update the Violence Against Women Act. \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2010 National Intimate \nPartner and Sexual Violence Survey found that one in four women has \nbeen the victim of severe physical domestic violence. One in five women \nhas been raped in her lifetime. More than half of the homicides in my \nState of Vermont are related to domestic violence.\n  Let me emphasize that just a bit. Vermont has one of the lowest crime \nrates in the country. But when I look at the source of the crime, more \nthan half of the homicides are related to domestic violence. Those \npercentages are very high in almost every State. That is simply \nunacceptable. While the Judiciary Committee has been preparing to \nconsider legislation on the subject of gun violence at the end of this \nmonth, we can act now, without delay, in the Senate to strengthen the \nprotections of the Violence Against Women Act.\n  All of the provisions in our bill passed the Senate last year. In \nfact, 9 months ago the Senate passed the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against \nWomen Reauthorization Act with 68 votes. The Senate often has a hard \ntime coming together with 51 votes, but here we had 68 votes from \nMembers of both parties, across the political spectrum.\n  Last December we worked out with Senator Cornyn and Senator Grassley \nadditional provisions to amend the Debbie Smith Act, which we passed, \nto reduce the backlog of untested rape kits in order to provide for \nadditional audits and reporting, and increase the capacity of State and \nlocal law enforcement to perform DNA analysis. Those provisions are now \nincorporated into this VAWA bill.\n  I hope those few Senators who opposed the bill last year will now \njoin with us to enact VAWA reauthorization. I think we should act \nquickly and decisively to pass this bill, and send it to the House. I \nknow if it reaches the President's desk, from what he has told me, he \nwill sign it without delay.\n  Our bill will support the use of techniques proven to identify high-\nrisk cases and prevent domestic violence homicides. It is going to \nincrease VAWA'S focus on sexual assault and push colleges to strengthen \ntheir efforts to protect students from domestic and sexual violence. It \nwill allow us to make real progress in addressing the horrifying \nepidemic of domestic violence in tribal communities. A recent study \nfound almost three in five native women had been assaulted by their \nspouses or intimate partners.\n  Our bill will allow services to get to those in the LGBT community \nwho have had trouble accessing services in the past. The Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention released a few weeks ago that found the \nrates of domestic and sexual violence in these communities are equal to \nor greater than those of the general population. We also have key \nimprovements for immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence.\n  I did note when we reintroduced this bill at the outset of this year \nthat we will be pressing the increase of U Visas for those victims who \nassist law enforcement in the context of comprehensive immigration \nreform. Last year, the House of Representatives refused to consider the \nSenate-passed bill because the U Visa provision, while fully offset, \nwas seen technically to affect revenues. We removed it from the bill \nthis year. I don't want this bill to be slowed up because of a \ntechnical excuse.\n  When somebody is being abused, they don't need to hear about \ntechnicalities. They want us to stop it, and they want us to expedite \naction on this bill. I remain strongly committed to the U Visa \nincrease. As I said, I will try to include it in the immigration \nlegislation we will be considering in the next couple of months. The \nreason I will do that, of course, is it will benefit law enforcement \nand victims, and we should enact it.\n  I have said so many times on the floor of the Senate that I remember \nmy days as a prosecutor in Vermont--let me state it this way: I \nremember going to crime scenes at 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning. I \nremember seeing people being taken out in an ambulance, barely alive, \nbattered to within an inch of their life. But I especially remember \nthose who did not even get that far, lying on the floor, up against a \nwall, waiting for the medical examiner to come and pronounce the person \ndead and allow the police to collect evidence and move them.\n  During that time no police officer ever said: Is this victim gay or \nstraight? Is this victim an immigrant or Native American? They said, as \nI have said so many times on the floor: A victim is a victim is a \nvictim. How do we stop this from happening to somebody else? How do we \ncatch the person who did this?\n  Law enforcement wants tools for after the fact. But even more, they \nwant what we have in here: something to stop the abuse from happening \nin the first place. Every day we do not pass legislation to prevent \nthis violence and assist victims, people are suffering.\n  I hope all Senators--Democrats, Republicans, Independents--will join \nus. I have spoken of Senator Crapo's longstanding commitment to \nvictims. But, also, I have spoken often of the support of Senators \nMikulski and Murkowski and Murray and Klobuchar and Coons and Collins \nand Shaheen and Franken and Hagan and Casey and so many others who have \njoined to help to shape this legislation and work to pass it. I also \nappreciate the support and assistance of the National Task Force to End \nSexual and Domestic Violence Against Women and its many member \norganizations whose insight has been so critical.\n  I thank the Vermont Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence. I \nam so proud of them. They have done great work helping victims in \nVermont with support from the VAWA programs. They have been a leader in \ndeveloping and supporting this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my statement a letter organized\n\n[[Page S462]]\n\nby the National Task Force and signed by more than 1,300 local, tribal, \nand national organizations supporting this important bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Since we first passed the Violence Against Women Act \nnearly two decades ago, States have strengthened criminal rape \nstatutes, and every State has made stalking a crime. The annual \nincidence of domestic violence has dropped more than 50 percent. We \nhave something here that has been a success. We have helped to provide \nvictims with critical services, such as housing and legal protection.\n  We have to remember, these are not just statistics. These are \nthousands of lives made immeasurably better. I might say because of \nthis work these thousands of lives are still lives; they are not \nstatistics of people murdered. All the provisions in our bill were \ndeveloped with the help of victims and those who assist them every day. \nThey are commonsense measures. They will help real people. Every \nprosecutor, every support group--all will tell you it is past time for \nCongress to enact this bill to provide help for victims of domestic \nviolence and rape.\n  We can make these concrete, important changes in the law. We can do \nit this week. I have been involved in this for years, and I have seen \nthe results of what we have done. I have seen the lives that have been \nmade immeasurably better because of what we have done. I have seen the \nlives that have been saved because of what we have done. There is no \nexcuse to delay further.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         National Task Force To End Sexual and Domestic Violence \n           Against Women,\n                                                 February 4, 2013.\n     Senator,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We, the undersigned local, tribal, and \n     national organizations, represent and support millions of \n     victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault \n     and stalking throughout the United States, American Indian \n     Tribes and territories. On behalf of the victims we \n     represent, the professionals who serve them and the \n     communities that sustain them, we ask that you support the \n     Violence Against Women Act's (VAWA) reauthorization by co-\n     sponsoring and voting for S. 47. As you know, VAWA is slated \n     to come to the Senate floor as early as next week and we are \n     asking you to take a leadership role in ensuring that this \n     landmark bi-partisan bill will continue its important work.\n       VAWA's programs support state, tribal and local efforts to \n     address the pervasive and insidious crimes of domestic \n     violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking. These \n     programs have made great progress towards reducing the \n     violence, helping victims to be healthy and feel safe and \n     holding perpetrators accountable. This critical legislation \n     must be reauthorized to ensure a continued response to these \n     crimes.\n       Since its original passage in 1994, VAWA has dramatically \n     enhanced our nation's response to violence against girls and \n     women, boys and men. More victims report domestic violence to \n     the police and the rate of non-fatal intimate partner \n     violence against women has decreased by 64%. The sexual \n     assault services program in VAWA helps rape crisis centers \n     keep their doors open to provide the frontline response to \n     victims of rape. VAWA provides for a coordinated community \n     approach, improving collaboration between law enforcement and \n     victim services providers to better meet the needs of \n     victims. These comprehensive and cost-effective programs not \n     only save lives, they also save money. In fact, VAWA saved \n     nearly $12.6 billion in net averted social costs in just its \n     first six years.\n       VAWA has unquestionably improved the national response to \n     these terrible crimes. Nonetheless, much work remains to be \n     done to address unmet needs and enhance access to protections \n     and services for all victims. We urge you to sponsor and vote \n     for S. 47 in order to build upon VAWA's successes and \n     continue to enhance our nation's ability to promote an end to \n     this violence, to hold perpetrators accountable and to keep \n     victims and their families safe from future harm. Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n  * * *\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues, as I will do, to \nsupport the motion to proceed to the Violence Against Women Act. I \nexpect that many of my Republican colleagues will also vote to proceed \nto the bill.\n\n  There has long been bipartisan support for the Violence Against Women \nAct. Too many women are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, \nstalking, and dating violence. Federal support for services to these \nwomen, and sometimes even men, has been beneficial to our country.\n  There is overwhelming bipartisan support for 98 percent of what is \ncontained in S. 47, so I favor proceeding to the bill and offering \nlimited amendments. We can then have a Senate vote, allow the other \nbody to work its will, resolve any differences between the bills, pass \na compromised reauthorization bill through both Houses, and get it to \nthe President.\n  The process on the Violence Against Women Act in the last Congress \nwas very disappointing. Previously the Violence Against Women Act was \nreauthorized unanimously. Something similar could have happened again \nlast year, but it didn't. New provisions were brought forth into the \nbill. Some of the provisions were very controversial. Some provisions \neven raised serious constitutional concerns, but those on the other \nside insisted on these provisions without any change and refused to \ncompromise. It appeared that the debate was more about blame and \npolitics than it was about providing help to women in need.\n  In the last Congress, both the Republican leader and this Senator \noffered that the Senate consent to striking a provision which violated \nthe Constitution's origination clause, and then proceed to conference. \nThe majority spurned those efforts on both occasions. Yet today S. 47 \nhas removed the very provision which raised the blue-slip problem with \nthe House of Representatives because, as we all know, under the \nConstitution all bills raising revenue must start in the House of \nRepresentatives. The majority did this only a few months after the \nmajority refused to drop that very same provision and proceed to \nconference. So this bill could have been to the President last year. \nThe willingness of the majority today to eliminate that very \nunconstitutional provision demonstrates that we could have had a bill \nto the President last year. That ought to be a terrible disappointment \nnot only to this Senator but to all the people in the Senate.\n  It is not true that unless S. 47 is passed exactly as is various \ngroups will be excluded from protections under the law. Would anyone \ncare to know why? Because the current law protects all victims.\n  Vice President Biden wrote the current law. Every Member of the \nSenate who was a Member of this body when the Violence Against Women \nAct was last reauthorized voted for that bill. Neither Vice President \nBiden nor any other Senator passed a discriminatory bill then. It is \nnot the case that unless the controversial provisions are accepted \nexactly as the majority insists without any compromise whatsoever that \nany groups will be excluded.\n  The key stumbling block to enacting a bill at this time is the \nprovision concerning Indian tribal courts. That provision raises \nserious constitutional questions concerning both the sovereignty of \ntribal courts and the constitutional rights of defendants who would be \ntried in those courts. We should focus on providing needed services to \nNative American women. S. 47 makes political statements and expounds on \nNative American sovereignty. It raises such significant constitutional \nproblems that its passage might actually not accomplish anything at all \nfor Native American women while failing to protect the constitutional \nrights of other American citizens.\n  Even the Congressional Research Service has raised constitutional \nquestions with the tribal provisions in this very bill. Negotiations \nare continuing, and I am quite confident that if we can reach an \nagreement on these questions, compromises on the other few remaining \nissues can also be secured and would allow the bill to pass with \noverwhelming bipartisan support. If we are unable to reach agreement in \nthe next couple of days, then I intend to offer a substitute that is \nmuch more likely to be accepted by the House and become law.\n  In the meantime, for this very day, all we are talking about is \ngetting to this bill so we can discuss these issues. I will vote for \nthe motion to proceed, and I ask my colleagues to do so as well.\n  I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S463]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

I know Senator Harkin is on the floor with others to \npresent several new pieces of legislation or to speak on items pending. \nI wanted to take a moment of personal privilege to say just a few words \nabout the spectacular sporting event that took place in our country \nyesterday in the city of New Orleans. I want to, of course, \ncongratulate the Baltimore Ravens, the Senators from Maryland, \nparticularly Senator Mikulski and Senator Cardin, and Governor \nO'Malley, who was there, of course, representing Maryland; the Senators \nfrom San Francisco and California, the 49ers, Senators Feinstein and \nBoxer, former Speaker Pelosi was with us yesterday in New Orleans, and \nthousands of fans from all over the world and, of course, watching on \ntelevision.\n  I wanted to make a note on this floor, not because it was just a \nsporting event, although it was one of the highest watched Super Bowls \never in the history of the game, but because of the role this Congress \nplayed and the administration in helping this great city and region and \nState rebound from what was a devastating body blow 7\\1/2\\ years ago \nwith Hurricane Katrina and then Rita hit 3 weeks later and then the \nlevees broke in over 52 places. The city went virtually underwater--at \nleast two-thirds of the city.\n  To see, 7\\1/2\\ years later, the city rebound, the people of New \nOrleans and Louisiana are just foremost in my thoughts right now for \ntheir fighting spirit, their resiliency, their unwillingness to give up \non this special place that will celebrate its 300th birthday in 2018. I \nwant to say a special thank-you to Mayor Landrieu, John Young, \npresident of Jefferson Parish, the leaders of St. Bernard and \nPlaquemines Parish. Those parishes were virtually destroyed, the lower \npart of Jefferson Parish. The whole region has come back. The world \ncould see it for themselves yesterday--the civic leadership, the faith-\nbased leadership. Again, a shout out to President Obama, his Cabinet \nand the Members on both sides of the aisle who stood by this region, \nthe gulf coast, to rebuild after all these years.\n  In conclusion, it is my only hope that after passing the Sandy \nsupplemental, we will stand united with the Northeast as they rebuild \nbigger, better, stronger, hosting the next Super Bowl which is a real \nsymbol of resurgence and rebuilding and resurrection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week is a milestone for working \nfamilies across America. Twenty years ago this week, President Bill \nClinton signed into law the Family and Medical Leave Act. There are \nmany laws we pass in Washington that most Americans never have reason \nto know or care about. The FMLA, by contrast, has changed this country \nin profoundly important ways.\n  It has touched the lives of millions of working families. It is \nalmost hard to imagine today, but 20 years ago before this landmark \nlaw, workers had to risk their jobs and livelihoods when family needs \narose. There was no national policy for maternity leave or paternity \nleave. New mothers were sometimes compelled to return to work just days \nafter giving birth or to quit jobs they would otherwise have liked to \nkeep.\n  There was no law allowing someone to take leave from work to care for \nan aging, potentially dying parent or to care for a child with a \nserious illness. Families had to leave their loved ones in the hands of \nothers or quit their jobs and face dire economic consequences. There \nwas no policy to allow a seriously ill worker to return to work after \nrecovering from cancer or other serious health condition. All these \nworkers risked being fired, having no job to return to, and losing \ntheir health insurance as well.\n  Countless hard-working Americans were forced to make wrenching \nchoices between their or their family's health and their economic well-\nbeing.\n  The passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act changed all that. It \nhas helped new parents bond with their children during those first \nmagical few weeks of life. It has helped to give workers struggling \nwith a difficult diagnosis the time and security they need to recover. \nIt has allowed loving family members to care for relatives with \ndisabilities and elderly parents.\n  It has ensured that family members of our wounded warriors can be \nthere to help their heroes recover. Just as important, it has helped \ncountless businesses across the country retain good workers and \nmaintain an experienced and dedicated workforce.\n  The FMLA has been an unqualified success. It has made a real \ndifference in the lives of millions of hard-working Americans. In fact, \nthe FMLA has been\n\n[[Page S464]]\n\nused more than 100 million times since its passage 20 years ago.\n  To be sure, the legislative path to the Family and Medical Leave Act \nwas not easy nor quick. In the Senate, Senator Chris Dodd was the \ntireless champion of the Family and Medical Leave Act. From the time of \nits first introduction in 1986 to its final passage in 1993, we would \nnot have the Family and Medical Leave Act without Senator Chris Dodd. \nHe held multiple subcommittee hearings across the country, hearing from \ndozens of witnesses. He led the bill through multiple committee markups \nand led the floor fight year after year after year. He worked to \noverride two Presidential vetoes and shepherded it to its final passage \nin 1993, after which it became the first law signed by a new President, \nPresident Bill Clinton.\n  Senator Dodd found a partner in Senator Kit Bond from Missouri, whose \nstrong interest in shoring up the American family led him to work with \nSenator Dodd on a bipartisan compromise proposal that would garner \nsignificant political support in both political parties. As Senator \nBond said upon introducing the final version of the bill in 1993:\n\n       I believe the single most important step we can take to \n     help all families in America is to try to reinstill \n     individual and family responsibility. To do that, we as a \n     society need to make family obligation something we encourage \n     rather than discourage. That is why I believe we should enact \n     the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n\n  Their bipartisan efforts have reaped huge rewards.\n  My office has heard from people around the country who have benefited \nfrom the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n  The Family and Medical Leave Act meant that Kimberly Jones of \nWisconsin was able to help her developmentally challenged son, David, \nduring a critical time. After years of struggling socially and in \nschool, after a misdiagnosis that led to medications that made him \nworse, David finally received the correct diagnosis of Asperger's \nsyndrome, which allowed him to get the right care and the appropriate \ntreatment. The FMLA allowed Kim to take 12 weeks off from work so she \ncould be with her son, David, to advocate for him, seek out \nprofessionals, learn how to help him, and support him through \ndetoxification from his previous medications.\n  Thanks to the FMLA, Kim was able to get David situated and take the \ntime to do what was best for him. Kim says parents shouldn't have to \nlose their jobs to do what is best for their children. She adds that \nchildren and families are in a better place because of the Family and \nMedical Leave Act.\n  Tonya Pinkston from Atlanta, GA, was diagnosed with lupus in 2009, \nbut she was allowed only 3 sick days a year. As the sole earner in her \nhousehold with her parents and daughter, she absolutely had to keep her \njob. Her boss suggested the Family and Medical Leave Act. Later, when \nher lupus flared, she was able to take leave for 4 weeks to allow her 1 \nweek in the hospital and recuperation at home.\n  Without the Family and Medical Leave Act, Tonya would have been fired \nfor missing so much time and she probably would have had to go on \nunemployment insurance. Tonya thanks God for the FMLA and feels \nfortunate that President Bill Clinton signed it and it was there when \nshe needed it.\n  Right now at a Baltimore hospital, Michelle Marrocco is using FMLA \nleave to care for her son, Brendan, a wounded warrior injured while \nserving in the Army in Iraq in 2009. Brendan is the first surviving \nquadruple amputee and has already faced challenges few of us can \nimagine. In December, he underwent a double-arm transplant. It has been \nwidely reported in the news media. Brendan will need years of \nrehabilitation and occupational therapy.\n  When Brendan was originally injured, Michelle's employer at the time \nvoluntarily paid for 3 months of leave. Michelle's current employer \nadheres to the FMLA, allowing her up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to \ncare for Brendan following his transplants.\n  She expects to take 2 months of leave, followed by intermittent leave \nto be with her son once a week. Without the FMLA, Michelle would have \nhad to quit her job. With the FMLA, she knows she doesn't have to worry \nabout her job, which is a huge relief for her. The lack of income is a \nbig concern, but it is something she and her husband will worry about \nlater. Thanks to new regulations from the Department of Labor, Michelle \nwill be able to take advantage of a new provision of the Family and \nMedical Leave Act, allowing up to 26 weeks of leave for the families of \nveterans injured in the line of duty.\n  The Family and Medical Leave Act is one of our Nation's most \nimportant laws. That is why I will introduce this week a resolution \nhonoring the FMLA and the leaders who made the FMLA a reality.\n  There are so many. I mentioned those who were here in the Senate; \nthere were those in the House who also helped shepherd this through. I \nwould mention, of course, Connie Morella, a former Congresswoman who \nwas so active in the bill.\n  I would mention also George Miller, Congressman George Miller, and \nCongresswoman Rosa DeLauro, who worked so hard to get this passed in \nthe House. There were people on the outside, Judy Lichtman, in 1993, \nwas the head of something called the Women's Legal Defense Fund. She \nand her colleague Donna Lenhoff played absolutely critical roles in \ngetting the FMLA written, introduced, and across the finish line. I \nwanted to mention those heroes who worked so hard for this important \nbill.\n  There is still more work to do to ensure that families are fully able \nto meet their family responsibilities as well as maintain economic \nsecurity.\n  Today, workers are ineligible to take FMLA for a variety of reasons. \nSome workers do not have enough tenure with their current employer, \neven if they have been in the workforce for years.\n  The FMLA requires 1 year of service, but in today's economy, workers \nmore frequently change jobs and, of course, family emergencies happen \nwithout warning. Other workers are not able to accumulate the required \n1,250 hours of work with a single employer in the preceding year. With \nthe growth in part-time work, both by choice and by necessity, more \nworkers may be ineligible for FMLA even though they are long-term \ndedicated employees. Millions of people work in businesses with fewer \nthan 50 employees, which means their employer is not covered by the \nFMLA and does not have to offer that kind of leave.\n  This also makes it harder for smaller businesses to recruit the best \nemployees because they are not on a level playing field with larger \ncompanies that must provide leave and where workers have come to expect \nit.\n  Still other workers are excluded from the law because of the nature \nof their relationship with a loved one. Workers may only take FMLA to \ncare for their minor child, parents or spouses. Under certain \ncircumstances, parents may care for their adult child with a \ndisability. This excludes siblings, grandchildren and grandparents, \ndomestic partners of the same or opposite sex, in-laws, cousins, and \neveryone else.\n  That is why the Family and Medical Leave Inclusion Act sponsored by \nSenator Durbin is so important. This bill will expand and modernize the \ndefinition of family to include many currently excluded relationships. \nToo many workers will otherwise have no one eligible to care for them \nin a time of need or the person they rely on most will not be \nrecognized as their family for purposes of the FMLA. This is a \ncommonsense change we can and must accomplish.\n  One of the most common and critical challenges faced by families is \nthe loss of income while taking unpaid FMLA leave. This obliges parents \nto cut short maternity and paternity leave. It forces cancer patients \nto work as much as possible, rather than taking time to fully \nrecuperate or, worse, to forgo leave altogether. Still others are \nfinancially devastated when they have no choice but to take unpaid \nleave.\n  We cannot allow family responsibilities to jeopardize families' \neconomic security. A social insurance program to provide some wage \nreplacement during family and medical leave would allow families to \nmaintain their economic security while seeing to their families. \nResearch shows this could be done on a universal basis with very small, \nshared contributions by workers and their employers. Two States, New \nJersey and California, have already implemented such paid leave \nsystems, helping families in those States to be financially secure \nduring family and medical leave.\n\n[[Page S465]]\n\n  Today is the day to honor the efforts of so many whose work led to \nthe passage and signing of the Family and Medical Leave Act 20 years \nago. This is a time to reflect on how transformative the Family and \nMedical Leave Act has been for our society. It is also time to look \nahead to additional ways we can support families and allow them to stay \nstrong, mutually supportive, and economically secure.\n  I look forward to future work to expand and strengthen the \nprotections of the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague Senator \nHarkin for his leadership on the Family and Medical Leave Act, along \nwith my predecessor Chris Dodd's very strong dedication to this cause \nand the historic difference he and Senator Harkin have made on a truly \ntransformative measure for the United States of America. The Family and \nMedical Leave Act has made a difference in so many lives and shaped so \nmany futures for the better in our Nation. I will be honored to join \nhis resolution and to support Senator Durbin's Family and Medical Leave \nInclusion Act and simply offer my thanks to him on behalf of \nConnecticut as well as the country for his leadership on this issue.\n  This measure is about human beings and the values that define us and \nmake us great as a nation, the greatest Nation in the history of the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/04/senate-section/article/S465-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S465-S466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, the measure we have approved today to \nmove forward, the Violence Against Women Act, so far as it defines us, \nstates our values and articulates the vision we see of our Nation as \ncaring for people who are victims of domestic abuse and sexual assault. \nI am proud of my colleagues for approving this measure today to go \nforward by an overwhelming bipartisan vote, 85 to 8.\n  I hope this day will be followed by final passage here and then in \nthe House of Representatives, avoiding the fate that befell it during \nthe last session, when I similarly supported this measure to \nreauthorize and strengthen a bill that has served us well for 18 years. \nIt served us well in addressing a problem that is as horrific and \nheinous as any that afflicts our society, domestic violence and sexual \nassault, shapes futures and transforms lives for the worse, unless they \nare followed by the service and law enforcement that VAWA provides. \nVAWA is about the organizations that provide those services and need \nthe support in Connecticut and around the country, organizations in \nConnecticut that provide services to 54,000 victims of domestic \nviolence and sexual assault every year. In our State alone, $4 million \nprovides those critical services to men and women and children so they \ncan survive and even thrive after domestic assault. We have made great \nstrides on this problem, but there is great work still to be done. We \ncannot be complacent or overconfident. We cannot be self-satisfied. We \nmust press ahead with VAWA, and that is why today's passage is so \nimportant--at least the passage of the motion to proceed.\n\n  Groups and organizations in Connecticut and across the nation report \nto me about critical staff shortages, resources they need to respond to \nthe hundreds of thousands of women every year who face these problems, \nand the protection they provide to children as well as women who are \nvictims of this crime.\n  I have been very privileged to join with Interval House in an effort \ncalled Men Against Domestic Violence. Men make a difference. They are \npotential role models, and we have tried to provide those role models \nto go into schools and provide education--a group of men who are \neducators, police, and other kinds of leaders in their communities, in \nbusiness. We helped to start this effort through Interval House, our \nmajor domestic shelter in the State. This is only a small example of \nhow these efforts can have a ripple effect through VAWA.\n  We need to not only renew our commitment to end domestic violence but \nalso to update and strengthen and expand the Violence Against Women \nAct. I am pleased to join my colleague Senator Portman in offering an \namendment that strengthens services for children and youth victims of \nsex trafficking. Yes, sex trafficking and human trafficking continue to \nexist in this Nation. It is sometimes invisible, unknown, one of the \nmost heinous crimes imaginable--modern-day slavery, unspeakable \nindenture of children. We need to do more to ensure that children in \nour communities who are victims of sex trafficking have access to the \nlifesaving services that are available to other youth victims of \ndomestic violence or sexual assault.\n  We can make sure agencies and organizations that provide these \nservices access grant funding available for this purpose. Again, this \ngoal ought to be bipartisan, and it is with Senator Portman and myself \non this amendment. I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  Vulnerable communities ought to receive the same kind of protection \nthrough VAWA even though they are now overlooked by existing law, and \nthose protections should be expanded. We have an obligation to ensure \nthat all victims of domestic violence, regardless of their sexual \norientation or gender identification, are covered by this law. So this \nlegislation contains protection for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and \ntransgender Americans. The LGBT community ought to know it is covered \nin the same way as every other part of our population, even though they \nface discrimination that prevents them from accessing those victim \nservices now.\n  In fact, a recent survey found that 45 percent of LGBT victims were \nturned away when they sought help from a violence center. That is \nsimply unacceptable. So this legislation will make sure they have \naccess to these services and also make great improvements in the law \nenforcement tools available to Native American communities.\n  Our Nation's tribal communities are literally facing an epidemic of \ndomestic violence and sexual assault. Nearly three out of five Native \nAmerican women are assaulted by their spouses or intimate partners, and \none-third of all Native American women will be raped during their \nlifetime. I know those statistics are hard to grasp. They seem \nincredible. Three out of five Native American women are assaulted by \ntheir spouses or intimate partners. One-third of all Native American \nwomen will be raped during their lifetime.\n  I wish they were wrong. I would be happy to be corrected. But those \nnumbers tell a searing and unacceptable truth about our Nation. Tribal \ncourts currently cannot prosecute domestic violence crimes against \nNative American women that are committed on tribal lands by a non-\nNative American. S. 47 closes that loophole so that all Native American \nwomen will have access to justice.\n  Finally, the 2000 reauthorization of VAWA contained landmark \nprovisions to protect immigrant victims of domestic violence, and S. 47 \nsignificantly maintains and expands those provisions, sending a strong \nmessage that immigrant women deserve the full protection of the law, \nthe full measure of American justice. It is the reason they have come \nto this country, the reason that millions of immigrants come to this \ncountry, the reason we are a nation of immigrants and strong because of \nthe diversity and the talent they bring to this Nation. We must \nguarantee justice to immigrant women.\n  I am still frustrated and disappointed the last Congress did not \napprove VAWA; that this measure was stalled in the House of \nRepresentatives despite a similarly bipartisan vote in this body to \napprove it. I hope this year the vote in this body will be a prelude to \nbipartisan approaches on this measure and others where basic human \nvalues are at stake; that there will be no stalling again; that this \nmeasure will proceed in the House on a similarly bipartisan basis.\n  An inclusive bipartisan VAWA should not be postponed. Time is not on \nthe side of victims. They need these services. Law enforcement needs \nthe support to make sure anyone committing domestic violence or sexual \nassault in this country is held responsible and accountable, and that \nwe send that message to women and children throughout this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S466]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/04/senate-section/article/S466-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       TOBACCO CONTROL ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND TOBACCO TAX PARITY ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week I was joined by Senators \nLautenberg and Blumenthal to introduce the Tobacco Tax Parity Act, a \nbill aimed at closing loopholes in how tobacco products are taxed and \nreducing the incidence of tobacco use.\n  It wasn't that long ago when it was common to smoke in offices, \nairplanes, elevators or even here in congressional hearings. We have \nmade progress since the landmark 1964 Surgeon General's Report showing \nthe negative effects of smoking on health, but there are plenty of \nsigns that the fight continues to protect future generations from \nsuffering the terrible effects of tobacco.\n  According to a Surgeon General's Report issued in March 2012, tobacco \nuse among youth is a ``pediatric epidemic'' and is the No. 1 cause of \npreventable and premature death in this country. Every year, tobacco \nproducts account for 443,000--or 1 out of 5--deaths. The report also \nfound that every day, 1,000 young people become new regular smokers \nand, of these new smokers, one-third will eventually die from tobacco-\nrelated causes.\n  While our Nation pays the physical and financial burden of tobacco \nuse through $96 billion in annual medical costs and $97 billion in lost \nproductivity due to premature death, tobacco companies invent new ways \nto generate profits and entice young people to pick up this deadly \nhabit.\n  In 2009, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act \nincreased the Federal tax rate on cigarettes and set the tax rate for \nsmall cigars and roll-your-own cigarettes at the same level as \ncigarettes. Cigars, smokeless tobacco, pipe tobacco, and nicotine \ncandies, however, remain at dramatically lower tax rates than \ncigarettes making them a cheap source of tobacco, particularly among \nyoung people. While cigarettes, roll-your-own, and little cigars are \ntaxed about $1 for a pack of 20 cigarettes, pipe tobacco is only taxed \n11 cents for what adds up to 20 cigarettes, a pouch of chewing tobacco \nis only taxed 9 cents, and a 12-pack can of nicotine tablets or \nlozenges is taxed less than 1 cent. Not surprisingly, as the tax for \ncigarettes has increased, cigarette sales dropped and the sales of \nundertaxed tobacco products went up.\n  This difference in tax rates doesn't make sense, and we are already \nseeing tobacco manufacturers abusing them by changing the labels on \ntheir products to avoid paying the higher tax. For instance, to avoid \npaying the higher tax on loose roll-your-own tobacco, some \nmanufacturers simply change the label on that product to pipe tobacco. \nThere are stores popping up across the country, including in Illinois, \nthat allow people to buy undertaxed pipe tobacco or cigarette tobacco \nintentionally mislabeled as pipe tobacco and rent time on a cigarette \nmaking machine where customers can make 200 cigarettes in 8 minutes and \nnot pay the $10 Federal cigarette tax.\n  A report released by the Government Accountability Office last year \nfound that the difference in tax rates creates opportunities for tax \navoidance and encourages consumers to use products with a lower tax. \nFor instance, the monthly sales of pipe tobacco in September 2011 \nincreased by over 1,200 percent compared to January 2009, while the \nmonthly sales for roll-your-own tobacco dropped 600 percent. Over $1.4 \nbillion in State and Federal revenue has already been lost due to \nmanufacturers relabeling and selling roll-your-own tobacco as pipe \ntobacco.\n  The Tobacco Tax Equity Act will end the exploitation of these tax \nloopholes by taxing all tobacco products at the same level as \ncigarettes. Through this legislation roll-your-own tobacco and pipe \ntobacco would be taxed at the same level of $1 for 20 cigarettes worth \nof tobacco. It would also raise the tax on a package of smokeless \ntobacco from 11 cents or less to $1--the same as a packet of \ncigarettes. The same goes for cigars, which are currently taxed no more \nthan 46 cents per a cigar. As new tobacco products come onto the \nmarket, this bill ensures that any product defined as a tobacco product \nby the FDA is taxed at a level equivalent with cigarettes.\n  According to an estimate by the Joint Committee on Taxation, closing \nthese loopholes will generate $3.6 billion over the next 10 years. But \nclosing the loophole will not only generate much needed revenue and \nprevent manufacturers from gaming the system, it will protect children \nand teens from picking up this dangerous habit. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/04/senate-section/article/S466-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TAFT UNION HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in saluting and commending Ryan Heber, Kim Fields and Mary Murphy, \nthree educators who risked their lives to protect students in Taft, CA.\n  On Thursday, January 10--less than 4 weeks after the horrific \nmassacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School--a student armed with a \nshotgun opened fire in a classroom at Taft Union High School and \nwounded two of his classmates. Today, one student remains hospitalized, \nrecovering from his injuries.\n  This was a tragic attack, and it is terrifying to think that it could \nhave been even worse had it not been for the brave, swift actions of \nTaft science teacher Ryan Heber and campus supervisors Kim Fields and \nMary Murphy.\n  When the shooting started, Mr. Heber responded immediately. After \nushering his other students out of harm's way, he began talking the \nshooter into ceasing his attack. Ms. Fields, who rushed to the \nclassroom when she heard gunfire, joined Mr. Heber in persuading the \nattacker to put down his gun and surrender to police when they arrived \non the scene. Meanwhile, Ms. Murphy stayed calm and made sure that \nstudents quickly and safely evacuated the classroom.\n  Like their teacher and supervisors, the students at Taft were also \nvery brave. They stayed calm and followed school safety measures. I \ncommend these young people and the first responders who swiftly \nresponded to the call for help.\n  The students, faculty, and staff deserve our support in the days and \nyears ahead, and they deserve our action to help curb gun violence and \nensure safety at our schools in Taft and across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/04/senate-section/article/S466-3", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S466-S467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO AARON MANKIN\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, having served on the Rogers School \nBoard, I understand how important the Wall of Distinction is to the \nschool district and the community. This honor highlights the \naccomplishments of a wide array of people who have proven their \ncommitment to upholding and sharing the values of Rogers.\n  I can't think of a better person who fits this description than Aaron \nMankin.\n  I have known the Mankin family for much of my life. I grew up with \nAaron's dad. Aaron grew up with my three daughters. Our families have a \nlong history together.\n  Aaron's love for his country led him to join the Marine Corps in \n2003, where he served as a combat correspondent. In 2005 he deployed to \nIraq, risking his life to protect the interests of his country. I had \nthe opportunity to visit with him during a trip to Iraq. Just a few \nweeks later, his life changed forever. He suffered intense burns and \nmajor lung damage when the armored vehicle he was riding in ran over a \nland mine in Northern Iraq. Aaron was sent to Brooke Army Medical \nCenter in San Antonio and placed in the ICU. The damage to his lungs \nwas so extensive that he was placed on a ventilator. He had third-\ndegree burns on his arms and had to have his thumb and two-thirds of \nhis index finger on his right hand amputated.\n  I have visited with Aaron on several occasions since his devastating \ninjuries and heard him share his experiences. He is one of my heroes, \nand I am always moved personally regarding my own efforts after seeing \nhow he has fought through his adversity.\n  Aaron has faced many challenges, but his contagious enthusiasm for \nlife has opened many doors, and I am confident those opportunities will \ncontinue. Many programs have benefited Aaron along his path to \nrecovery, and he has shown his appreciation by becoming a champion and \nspokesperson for UCLA's Operation Mend and the Intrepid Fallen Heroes \nFund.\n\n[[Page S467]]\n\n  He has a long list of accomplishments and awards, including earning \nthe Purple Heart and the Navy Achievement Medal with Combat \nDistinguishing Device for Valor. In addition, he was named as one of \nPeople Magazine's Heroes of the Year and a 2011 recipient of the \nVeterans Leadership Award presented by the Iraq and Afghanistan \nVeterans of America. The next year, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta \ninvited Aaron to discuss matters affecting wounded veterans.\n  He has taken his pain and suffering and turned it into a model of \nperseverance that is helping other soldiers and veterans heal from the \npain of battle.\n  Aaron, we are proud of your visionary leadership and all of your \naccomplishments. You have always maintained an optimistic attitude and \na determination that can be an example to us all. We are excited to see \nwhat your future holds, and we are proud to call you a son of Rogers, \nArkansas. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/04/senate-section/article/S467-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING GORDON MANSFIELD\n\n Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, today I rise to honor the legacy of \nformer VA Deputy Secretary Gordon Mansfield; a combat veteran, friend, \nand tireless advocate for our veterans. He passed away last week. Over \nthe course of his distinguished career Gordon served his nation, its \nveterans, and those persevering through disabilities. He will be missed \nbut his legacy remembered.\n  Like many in his generation, Gordon enlisted and served in Vietnam. \nDuring the Tet Offensive, while on his second combat tour, Gordon was \nwounded and sustained a spinal cord injury. He was awarded the Bronze \nStar, two Purple Hearts, the Combat Infantryman's Badge, and \nPresidential Unit Citation. While recovering from his injuries, Gordon \nearned his law degree, and upon moving back to Florida, began \npracticing law. He served as a counsel in a legal aid program devoted \nto assisting his fellow veterans.\n  From 1981 to 1989, Gordon served as the executive director of the \nParalyzed Veterans of America, advocating for disabled veterans' \ninterests on a national level. His work at PVA was instrumental in \nstanding up the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims as well as \nshaping landmark disabilities advocacy legislation. In 1989, Gordon \njoined the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and served as \nPresident George H.W. Bush's Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and \nEqual Opportunity. There he served as a strong advocate for accessible \nhousing.\n  In 2001, Gordon once again answered the call to help veterans, \njoining Secretary Anthony Principi as the Assistant Secretary for \nCongressional and Legislative Affairs at the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. In 2004, he became the Deputy Secretary and Chief Operating \nOfficer, and served as Acting Secretary in 2007. During his time at the \nVA, Gordon oversaw the implementation of the post-9/11 GI bill and many \nother major transformation initiatives.\n  I worked closely with Gordon to establish the Captain James A. Lovell \nFederal Health Care Center in North Chicago, the Nation's first fully \nintegrated Department of Defense-VA medical center. Only a few years \nbefore, a Washington consulting company recommended the closure of the \nNorth Chicago VA. Instead, the idea behind the Lovell FHCC was born.\n  Working with Gordon was a privilege, and through his dedication to \nthis effort, we succeeded. Today, over 100,000 veterans, military \nservicemembers, and their families have access to state-of-the-art \nhealth care at the Lovell FHCC.\n  It is for this, and his many other accomplishments, that we thank and \nhonor Gordon Mansfield for his service to this Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/04/senate-section/article/S467-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RHODE ISLAND'S MARINE ECONOMY\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \none of my State's great traditions and to a wonderful man. The \nHerreshoff Marine Museum, founded in 1971, preserves today the history \nof one our State's most important economic and design legacies, the \nHerreshoff boat building company of Bristol.\n  Early Rhode Island settlers took advantage of the State's location on \nthe Narragansett Bay to foster one of Colonial America's most \nsuccessful marine economies. Newport, RI, was the Colonies' fifth most \nprosperous commercial center, in part because of its port activity. \nSince that time, Rhode Islanders have sustained the State's maritime \ntradition, excelling in boatbuilding, fishing, shipping, port \noperation, energy exploration, and marine biology.\n  The marine trades continue to play a pivotal economic development \nrole in our State today; as many other sectors in Rhode Island struggle \nto rebound from the recent recession, our marine industry is actually \nexpanding. The Rhode Island Marine Trade Association reports that this \nindustry supports over 6,600 Rhode Island jobs, paying almost $260 \nmillion in wages to Rhode Island workers--and almost 10 percent of \nprivate employers in the State are associated with the boating \nindustry.\n  The Herreshoff family helped shape Rhode Island's maritime legacy. In \n1878, John Brown Herreshoff and his brother Nathanael Greene Herreshoff \nmore commonly known as ``Captain Nat''--joined forces to form the \nHerreshoff Manufacturing Company in Bristol, RI. Known for innovative \ndesign, superior skills, and efficient manufacturing, the Herreshoff \nManufacturing Company quickly became a national leader in the \nboatbuilding industry. The brothers developed a lighter, faster version \nof the steam generator boiler, which allowed steamboats to operate at a \nmuch higher speed than previously possible.. Indeed, Herreshoff built \nthe fastest boats on the water, both steam and sail. Between 1893 and \n1920, five of Nathanael Greene Herreshoff's custom-designed racing \nsloops were chosen to sail in the prestigious America's Cup, and all \nfive emerged as victors.\n  Notwithstanding these sea-going champions, the Herreshoffs' most \nacclaimed boat design is arguably the smaller S class. Nathanael Greene \nHerreshoff first designed the S boat in 1919, and the company built 95 \nboats before halting production in 1941. So well designed and built are \nthey, that many S boats are still racing today.\n  It is no wonder the S boat has held up so well. The boat shows speed \nand agility under all conditions, and its engineering is considered one \nof the most groundbreaking undertakings in boatbuilding history. The S \nboat was particularly well suited for the coastal waters of Rhode \nIsland: comfortable for easy day sailing; fast when racing hard. Its \ndeep keel and hull shape made the boat steady in the strong ocean \nbreeze that characterizes summer afternoons on Narragansett Bay, but on \nmild days its vast mainsail catches the lightest zephyr. The S boat \nboasted a keel with a high aspect ratio, and a high ballast-to-\ndisplacement ratio, allowing for a stiffer boat. Although these \nfeatures were unusual for the 1900s, other boat designers quickly \nadopted them after the great success of the S boat became apparent. The \nS boat transom became a common sight for other sailors.\n  Ninety-five years after the first S boat splashed into Bristol Harbor \nat the Herreshoff boatyard, the fleet is active and growing, with boats \nbeing restored to join the class. This success and growth is much \nthanks to fleet commodore Fred Roy. Fred brought bouyant enthusiasm and \ncheerfulness to the Narragansett Bay Herreshoff S Class Association, \nand the association and all who love our bay and its special sailing \ntraditions join in appreciation of Fred Roy. Fred has brought the \nspirit of the S boat, rail down and surging forward, to this part of \nour ongoing history and maritime culture, and I take this opportunity \nto thank and salute him, and celebrate this tradition of Narragansett \nBay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/04/senate-section/article/S467-3", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/04/senate-section/article/S467-4", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S467-S468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S468]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/04/senate-section/article/S468-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nREPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS DECLARED \n   IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13396 ON FEBRUARY 7, 2006, WITH RESPECT TO THE \n           SITUATION IN OR IN RELATION TO COTE D'IVOIRE--PM 1\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency, unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

A bill to require the Federal Aviation Administration to \nprescribe regulations to reduce helicopter noise pollution in \nresidential areas in Los Angeles County, California; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Los Angeles \nResidential Helicopter Noise Relief Act of 2013.\n  This legislation, which I introduce with Senator Boxer, would require \nthe\n\n[[Page S471]]\n\nFederal Aviation Administration to prescribe regulations for helicopter \noperations in the skies above Los Angeles in order to reduce helicopter \nnoise pollution in residential areas.\n  In addition to addressing noise, the FAA's regulations would have to \nincrease safety, minimize commercial aircraft delays, and exempt first \nresponders and military aircraft from their limitations.\n  The bill also would direct the FAA to consult with local communities \nand local helicopter operators when developing the regulations.\n  This legislation is necessary because today the citizens of Los \nAngeles County suffer intrusive and disruptive low-flying helicopter \ntraffic above their neighborhoods to an unprecedented degree.\n  The unique terrain of Los Angeles, with its many canyons and valleys, \noften concentrates the high decibel level noise from low-flying \nhelicopters on many of the millions of homes in the county.\n  The noise interrupts daily life for Los Angeles County's residents, \ndrowning out conversations and disrupting sleep cycles.\n  Despite multiple efforts from several community and homeowner \norganizations in Los Angeles County to address these disturbances over \nmany years, helicopter traffic in Los Angeles County is not currently \nregulated by the Federal Aviation Administration or any other agency.\n  As one expert recently explained to The Los Angeles Times, a \nhelicopter pilot is free to hover over a person's home for as many \nhours as he would like. The only limitation on helicopter hovering, in \nfact, appears to be fuel supply.\n  Last year, at my request the Senate Appropriations Committee directed \nthe Federal Aviation Administration to begin developing solutions to \nthis matter.\n  In response, the Federal Aviation Administration formed an internal \nworking group in July 2012 to solicit input from local communities and \nstakeholders on helicopter noise and safety issues in Los Angeles \nCounty.\n  As part of that process, FAA Regional Administrator Bill Withycombe \nhosted several public meetings in the summer and fall of 2012 that have \nallowed stakeholders and citizens to express their concerns and propose \nsolutions.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration will release a report in May 2013 \nevaluating a full set of voluntary and regulatory options to reduce \nhelicopter noise and address safety issues in Los Angeles County.\n  The study is a necessary first step in order to determine how \nhelicopters can be regulated in Los Angeles County in a manner that \nprovides relief to residents from helicopter noise and increase safety.\n  But the study is only a first step. It must be followed by meaningful \nand effective regulations to limit the impacts of these helicopters. I \nintroduce this legislation in order to ensure that the FAA will follow \nthrough on the regulatory options it plans to evaluate in its May 2013 \nreport.\n  This legislation directs the FAA to act in the interest of the \nmillions of Americans in Los Angeles County. I appreciate the steps the \nFAA has taken to date, but only regulations appear capable of \naddressing the quality of life impact caused by helicopters in Los \nAngeles.\n  Last August, thousands of people sat in the stands of the Hollywood \nBowl for a night of Beethoven.\n  Nestled into the Hollywood Hills and with little sign of the Nation's \nsecond largest city that surrounds it, the Hollywood Bowl is a unique \nspot to take in a concert.\n  But just as violinist Renaud Capucon stood for a solo, an \nunidentified helicopter flew overhead, drowning out the sound of his \nmusic.\n  It was an upsetting event for the audience, but it is far from \nunusual.\n  The people of Los Angeles have had too many wonderful outdoor \nconcerts and other cultural events disrupted by helicopters that fly \nwithout restriction.\n  Choppers in L.A.'s sky have caused too many sleepless nights.\n  Paparazzi helicopters have too often flown dangerously low and close \nto homes in their constant pursuit of celebrity images.\n  The air space above Los Angeles is the exclusive jurisdiction of the \nFederal Aviation Administration, so to bring some sanity to the skies \nabove L.A. requires Federal action, and Federal leadership.\n  This legislation directs the FAA to provide that leadership necessary \nto protect the public interest.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support it, and I look forward to \nworking with my fellow members to enact this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 208\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Los Angeles Residential \n     Helicopter Noise Relief Act of 2013''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Residents throughout Los Angeles County suffer \n     intrusive and disruptive low-flying helicopter traffic above \n     their neighborhoods. The unique terrain of canyons and \n     valleys that surround residential neighborhoods in Los \n     Angeles County often concentrate high decibel level noise \n     from the low-flying helicopters in and around Los Angeles \n     County residences. The concentrated noise interrupts daily \n     life for many Los Angeles County residents by drowning out \n     conversations and disrupting sleep cycles.\n       (2) Los Angeles County is home to a uniquely large \n     concentration of scenic, historic, entertainment, and \n     transportation venues, including sight-seeing, movie studios, \n     movie star homes, outdoor entertainment facilities, Griffith \n     Park, the Hollywood Sign, freeways, and many others, that \n     generate extensive helicopter activity.\n       (3) Los Angeles County is home to the world's leading civil \n     helicopter manufacturer that conducts extensive helicopter \n     operational testing across the region.\n       (4) Despite multiple efforts from several community and \n     homeowner organizations in Los Angeles County to address \n     these disturbances, helicopter traffic in Los Angeles County \n     is not currently regulated by the Federal Aviation \n     Administration or any other agency.\n       (5) At the request of members of Congress, the Federal \n     Aviation Administration formed an internal working group in \n     July 2012 to solicit input from local communities and \n     stakeholders on helicopter noise and safety issues in Los \n     Angeles County.\n       (6) As part of that process, several public meetings were \n     held in the fall and summer of 2012 that have allowed the \n     Federal Aviation Administration and stakeholders to hear and \n     better understand the concerns and complaints of affected \n     residents.\n       (7) The Federal Aviation Administration is scheduled to \n     release a report in May 2013 evaluating a full set of \n     voluntary and regulatory options to reduce helicopter noise \n     and address safety issues in Los Angeles County.\n       (8) The report is expected to explore how helicopters can \n     be regulated in Los Angeles County in a manner that provides \n     relief to residents from helicopter noise while also meeting \n     the needs of relevant stakeholders, including first \n     responders.\n\n     SEC. 3. REGULATIONS TO REDUCE HELICOPTER NOISE POLLUTION IN \n                   CERTAIN RESIDENTIAL AREAS.\n\n       (a) Rulemaking.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal \n     Aviation Administration shall prescribe regulations for \n     helicopter operations in Los Angeles County, California, that \n     include requirements relating to the flight paths and \n     altitudes associated with such operations to reduce \n     helicopter noise pollution in residential areas, increase \n     safety, and minimize scheduled commercial aircraft delays.\n       (b) Exemptions.--In prescribing regulations under \n     subsection (a), the Administrator shall exempt helicopter \n     operations related to emergency, law enforcement, or military \n     activities from the requirements described in that \n     subsection.\n       (c) Consultations.--In prescribing regulations under \n     subsection (a), the Administrator shall make reasonable \n     efforts to consult with local communities and local \n     helicopter operators in order to develop regulations that \n     meet the needs of local communities, helicopter operators, \n     and the Federal Aviation Administration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORKER (for himself and Mr. Vitter):\n  S. 215. A bill to ensure that the Federal Reserve conducts its \npolicies to ensure long-term price stability and a low rate of \ninflation; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I am here today to introduce the Federal \nReserve Mandate Act of 2013 in an effort to begin returning our country \nto the right place in monetary policy. Senator Vitter is joining me in \nthis effort.\n\n[[Page S472]]\n\n  The objective of our bill is simple. Our Central Bank, like other \nCentral Banks around the world, should be focused on creating an \nenvironment of price stability. This should be the guiding principle of \nmonetary policy decisions.\n  This is neither a radical nor a new idea. Most economists argue that \nthe proper role of the Central Bank is to serve as a lender of last \nresort in a time of crisis, to supply payment distribution and clearing \nmechanisms, and to manage the money supply so that inflation stays in \ncheck. Managing unemployment is a completely separate task and not \nappropriate for the blunt tools of monetary policy. That is why almost \nevery developed country's Central Bank has as its mandate the \nmaintenance of price stability. In other words, we are an outlier.\n  This is not to say that a focus on price stability means the Fed is \nabandoning unemployment. In fact, just the opposite is true. Monetary \npolicy can and should create an environment where jobs can grow and \nthrive by giving the economy certainty that prices will remain stable \nover the long term.\n  We have strayed a long way from traditional Central Bank actions. We \nhave lost sight of the proper role of monetary policy in our economy. \nWith roughly $3 trillion in assets--and I think the Presiding Officer \nknows that by the end of this year it is projected we will have $4 \ntrillion in assets--sitting on the Fed's balance sheet, there is no \nquestion that the Fed is distorting financial markets with multiple \nrounds of quantitative easing. At a minimum, we have completely lost \nprice signals from instruments such as treasuries and mortgage-backed \nsecurities. It is likely, however, we are doing more damage than just \nthat. We may be creating asset bubbles elsewhere as money moves into \ninvestments that are risky.\n  We are also punishing savers. Purchasing assets to drive down rates \nforces pension funds and retirees to shift money into asset classes \nthat may not be best for them. We are creating ``Fed addicts'' in our \nmarkets. Equity markets go through cycles where they become almost Fed \nobsessed. In these environments, good news is bad for equity markets \nbecause it means less QE buying. Meanwhile, bad economic news is good \nfor markets because it means more easy money is on the way. Now we risk \nthe perils of unwinding this policy.\n  Economists are beginning to discuss the likelihood that the Fed will \ntake significant losses on assets it has purchased. We just had one of \nthe Fed Governors in our office last week sharing with us that as we \nbegin unwinding these balance sheets, it is very likely, as the \nPresiding Officer can imagine, as interest rates go up and the Fed \nbegins to buy these securities, we are going to lose money on those \nassets. So it is likely the Fed is going to take significant losses on \nthe assets it purchased. Since the Fed is buying these bonds at record \nlow yields, they will likely sell them down the road at higher yields. \nI don't think there is anybody right now who disagrees with that \nprobability.\n  The effect of this is a permanent increase in monetary supplies. This \nis an incredibly perverse situation we have now locked ourselves into.\n  The employment mandate at the Fed has not always existed. A lot of \npeople believe it has. It was added with the passage of the Humphrey-\nHawkins Act in 1978. Humphrey-Hawkins was passed in a moment of self-\ncongratulations, like a lot of things around here are passed. Congress \npatted itself on the back for ``ending unemployment.'' Obviously, \nnothing could be further from the truth. The Fed cannot end \nunemployment by printing money.\n  The Central Bank should be tasked with maintaining price stability. \nWe must return to this core principle. This is the reason we are \noffering this piece of legislation today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 224. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nestablish a grant program to support the restoration of San Francisco \nBay; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator \nBoxer to introduce legislation to further the restoration of the San \nFrancisco Bay.\n  Over the last 150 years, the water quality and health of the San \nFrancisco Bay Estuary have been diminished by pollution, invasive \nspecies, loss of wetland habitat and other factors. The degradation has \nnot only impacted fish and wildlife, but has also reduced the estuary's \nability to support important economic activities such as commercial and \nsport fishing, shipping, agriculture, recreation, and tourism.\n  Federal funding in recent years has begun the Bay's recovery process \nby investing in projects which improve water quality and restore \ncritical habitat. These investments, $28 million between 2008 and 2012 \nby the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency alone, were critical to \nspurring $22 million in matching funds and leveraging $81 million from \nother partners. But much work remains.\n  That is why I am pleased to introduce the San Francisco Bay \nRestoration Act with Senator Boxer, Chairwoman of the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. Companion legislation will also \nbe introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congresswoman \nJackie Speier.\n  This bill was first introduced in the 112th Congress. The Senate \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works reported favorably on the \nbill and recommended its passage on January 26, 2012.\n  This bill recognizes the important restoration work that must be done \nto restore and protect the iconic San Francisco Bay by authorizing $5 \nmillion a year for restoration work between 2013 and 2017, and \nprioritizing funding for projects that will protect and restore vital \nestuarine habitat for migratory waterfowl, shorebirds, and wildlife; \nimprove and restore water quality and rearing habitat for fish; and in \nturn reinvigorate recreation, tourism, and agricultural activities in \nand around the bay.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in their support for this measure.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 224\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``San Francisco Bay \n     Restoration Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na study of alternatives for commemorating and interpreting the role of \nthe Buffalo Soldiers in the early years of the National Parks, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Boxer to introduce the Buffalo Soldiers in the National Parks \nStudy Act. This legislation is an important step in preserving the \nlegacy of the Army's first all-black infantry and cavalry units and \ntheir unique role in the creation of our National Park system.\n  The Buffalo Soldiers served bravely in campaigns both at home and \nabroad before being stationed at the military Presidio in San Francisco \nand being given charge of patrolling the National Park system. Although \nfirst tasked with taming the frontier, these troops also took on the \nresponsibility of preserving that wilderness for future generations. \nEach summer, Buffalo Soldier regiments traveled roughly 320 miles from \nSan Francisco to either Sequoia or Yosemite National Park, where they \npatrolled the parks for poachers and loggers, built trails, and \nescorted visitors. They were, in essence if not in name, the nation's \nfirst park rangers.\n  In a time of segregation and adversity, these soldiers served their \ncountry bravely and the National Parks they worked to establish are \npart of the legacy they leave behind. Unfortunately, this unique aspect \nof their history is neither widely recognized nor remembered. This \nlegislation would address that by authorizing a study to determine the \nmost appropriate way to memorialize the Buffalo Soldiers.\n  The study would evaluate the suitability and feasibility of \nestablishing a national historic trail commemorating the route traveled \nby the Buffalo Soldiers from their post in the Presidio of San \nFrancisco to Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks and to any other \nNational Parks where they may have served.\n  The bill will identify properties associated with the Buffalo \nSoldiers that could be added to the National Register of Historic \nPlaces.\n  The bill will develop educational initiatives and a public awareness \ncampaign about the contribution of African-American soldiers after the \nCivil War.\n  Although the experiences of the Buffalo Soldiers are an important \npiece of our national history, we are in danger of losing their legacy \nto the passage of time unless we take conscious steps to preserve the \nmemory. This legislation works to ensure that the contributions of the \nBuffalo Soldiers will be remembered and shared by all.\n  Furthermore, as the centennial of the National Park Service in 2016 \napproaches, it is an especially appropriate time to conduct research \nand increase public awareness of the stewardship role the Buffalo \nSoldiers played in the early years of the National Parks.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in their support for this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 225\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Buffalo Soldiers in the \n     National Parks Study Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In the late 19th century and early 20th century, \n     African-American troops who came to be known as the Buffalo \n     Soldiers served in many critical roles in the western United \n     States, including protecting some of the first National \n     Parks.\n       (2) Based at the Presidio in San Francisco, Buffalo \n     Soldiers were assigned to Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks \n     where they patrolled the backcountry, built trails, stopped \n     poaching, and otherwise served in the roles later assumed by \n     National Park rangers.\n       (3) The public would benefit from having opportunities to \n     learn more about the Buffalo Soldiers in the National Parks \n     and their contributions to the management of National Parks \n     and the legacy of African-Americans in the post-Civil War \n     era.\n       (4) As the centennial of the National Park Service in 2016 \n     approaches, it is an especially appropriate time to conduct \n     research and increase public awareness of the stewardship \n     role the Buffalo Soldiers played in the early years of the \n     National Parks.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to authorize a \n     study to determine the most effective ways to increase \n     understanding and public awareness of the critical role that \n     the Buffalo Soldiers played in the early years of the \n     National Parks.\n\n     SEC. 3. STUDY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior shall \n     conduct a study of alternatives for commemorating and \n     interpreting the role of the Buffalo Soldiers in the early \n     years of the National Parks.\n       (b) Contents of Study.--The study shall include--\n       (1) a historical assessment, based on extensive research, \n     of the Buffalo Soldiers who served in National Parks in the \n     years prior to the establishment of the National Park \n     Service;\n       (2) an evaluation of the suitability and feasibility of \n     establishing a national historic trail commemorating the \n     route traveled by the Buffalo Soldiers from their post in the \n     Presidio of San Francisco to Sequoia and Yosemite National \n     Parks and to any other National Parks where they may have \n     served;\n       (3) the identification of properties that could meet \n     criteria for listing in the National Register of Historic \n     Places or criteria for designation as National Historic \n     Landmarks;\n       (4) an evaluation of appropriate ways to enhance historical \n     research, education, interpretation, and public awareness of \n     the story of the Buffalo Soldiers' stewardship role in the \n     National Parks, including ways to link the story to the \n     development of National Parks and the story of African-\n     American military service following the Civil War; and\n       (5) any other matters that the Secretary of the Interior \n     deems appropriate for this study.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 3 years after funds are made \n     available for the study, the Secretary of the Interior shall \n     submit to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources of the Senate a report containing the study's \n     findings and recommendations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 228. A bill to establish the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta National \nHeritage Area; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator \nBoxer to introduce legislation to establish a National Heritage Area in \nthe California Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This legislation will \ncreate the first Heritage Area in California.\n  This bill was first introduced in January 2011 during the 112th \nCongress and received a hearing in the Senate Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources Subcommittee on National Parks. Since then, the Delta \nProtection Commission has completed a feasibility study, as required, \nand endorsed the legislation. Additionally, the National Park Service \nhas confirmed that the study is consistent with the agency's interim \nNational Heritage Area Feasibility Study Guidelines.\n  I was pleased to have had the opportunity to work with Senator Boxer,\n\n[[Page S474]]\n\nRepresentative John Garamendi, and the County Supervisors from the five \nDelta Counties to develop this legislation and look forward to \ncontinuing to partner with them as well as local, State and Federal \nagencies to care for and improve the Delta.\n  This bill will establish the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta as a \nNational Heritage Area.\n  The Delta Protection Commission, created by California law and \nresponsible to the citizens of the Delta and California, will manage \nthe Heritage Area. It will ensure an open and public process, working \nwith all levels of Federal, State, and local government, tribes, local \nstakeholders, and private property owners as it develops and implements \nthe management plan for the Heritage Area. The goal is to conserve and \nprotect the Delta, its communities, its resources, and its history.\n  It is also important to understand what this legislation will not do.\n  It will not affect water rights.\n  It will not affect water contracts.\n  It will not affect private property.\n  Nothing in this bill gives any governmental agency any more \nregulatory power than it already has, nor does it take away regulatory \nfrom agencies that have it.\n  In short, this bill does not affect water rights or water contracts, \nnor does it impose any additional responsibilities on local government \nor residents. Instead, it authorizes Federal assistance to a local \nprocess already required by State law that will elevate the Delta, \nproviding a means to conserve and protect its valued communities, \nresources, and history.\n\n  The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is the largest estuary on the West \nCoast. It is the most extensive inland delta in the world, and a unique \nnational treasure.\n  Today, it is a labyrinth of sloughs, wetlands, and deepwater channels \nthat connect the waters of the high Sierra mountain streams to the \nPacific Ocean through the San Francisco Bay. Its approximately 60 \nislands are protected by 1,100 miles of levees, and are home to \n3,500,000 residents, including 2,500 family farmers. The Delta and its \nfarmers produce some of the highest quality specialty crops in the \nUnited States.\n  The Delta offers recreational opportunities to the two million \nCalifornians who visit the Delta each year for boating, fishing, \nhunting, visiting historic sites, and viewing wildlife. It provides \nhabitat for more than 750 species of plants and wildlife. These include \nsand hill cranes that migrate to the Delta wetland from places as far \naway as Siberia. The Delta also provides habitat for 55 species of \nfish, including Chinook salmon--some as large as 60 pounds--that return \neach year to travel through the Delta to spawn in the tributaries.\n  These same waterways also channel fresh water to the Federal and \nState-owned pumps in the South Delta that provide water to 23 million \nCalifornians and three million acres of irrigated agricultural land \nelsewhere in the State.\n  Before the Delta was reclaimed for farmland in the 19th Century, the \nDelta flooded regularly with snow melt each spring, and provided the \nrich environment that, by 1492, supported the largest settlement of \nNative Americans in North America.\n  The Delta was the gateway to the gold fields in 1849, after which \nChinese workers built hundreds of miles of levees throughout the \nwaterways of the Delta to make its rich peat soils available for \nfarming and to control flooding.\n  Japanese, Italians, German, Portuguese, Dutch, Greeks, South Asians \nand other immigrants began the farming legacy, and developed \ntechnologies specifically adapted to the unique environment, including \nthe Caterpillar Tractor, which later contributed to agriculture and \ntransportation internationally.\n  Delta communities created a river culture befitting their dependence \non water transport, a culture which has attracted the attention of \nauthors from Mark Twain and Jack London to Joan Didion.\n  The Delta is in crisis due to many factors, including invasive \nspecies, urban and agricultural run-off, wastewater discharges, \nchannelization, dredging, water export operations, and other stressors.\n  Many of the islands of the Delta are between 10 and 20 feet below sea \nlevel, and the levee system is presently inadequate to provide reliable \nflood protection for historic communities, significant habitats, \nagricultural enterprises, water resources, transportation and other \ninfrastructure.\n  Existing levees have not been engineered to withstand earthquakes. \nShould levees fail for any reason, a rush of seawater into the interior \nof the Delta could damage the already fragile ecosystem, contaminate \ndrinking water for many Californians, flood agricultural land, inundate \ntowns, and damage roads, power lines, and water project infrastructure.\n  The State of California has been working for decades on a resolution \nto the water supply and ecosystem crisis in the State, and has a long \nhistory of partnerships with Federal agencies, working together to \nresolve challenges to the Delta's historic communities, ecosystem and \nthe water it supplies so many Californians.\n  The Delta Protection Commission, established under State law, has \nbeen tasked by the California State Legislature with providing a forum \nfor Delta residents to engage in decisions regarding actions to \nrecognize and enhance the unique cultural, recreational, agricultural \nresources, infrastructure and legacy communities of the Delta and to \nserve as the facilitating agency for the implementation of a National \nHeritage Area in the Delta.\n  This legislation will complement the broadly supported State Water \nLegislation of 2009, which called for a Heritage designation for the \nDelta.\n  This legislation authorizes the creation of the Delta Heritage Area \nand Federal assistance to the Delta Protection Commission in \nimplementing the Area. This legislation is just a small part of the \ncommitment the Federal Government must make to the Delta. I look \nforward to continuing to work with my colleagues at every level of \ngovernment to restore and sustain the ecosystem in the Delta, to \nprovide for reliable water supply in the State of California, to \nrecover the native species of the Delta, protect communities in the \nDelta from flood risk, ensure economic sustainability in the Delta, \nimprove water quality in the Delta, and sustain the unique cultural, \nhistorical, recreational, agricultural and economic values of the \nDelta.\n  The National Heritage Area designation for the Sacramento-San Joaquin \nDelta will help local governments develop and implement a plan for a \nsustainable future by providing Federal recognition, technical \nassistance and small amounts of funding to a community-based process \nalready underway.\n  Through the Delta Heritage Area, local communities and citizens will \npartner with Federal, State and local governments to collaboratively \nwork to promote conservation, community revitalization, and economic \ndevelopment projects.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 228\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of S. 227, introduced earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 227) to authorize the transfer of certain funds \n     to improve security at United States embassies and other \n     diplomatic facilities worldwide, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n                                 S. 227\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Today I am pleased the Senate will pass the bipartisan \nEmbassy Security Funds Transfer Act of 2013. This commonsense \nlegislation will enact a provision similar to one passed overwhelmingly \nby the Senate last December as part of the Sandy Supplemental but that \nwas stripped out by House Republicans.\n  This bill simply provides authority to the State Department to \ntransfer up to $1.1 billion in overseas contingency operations funds \nappropriated in Fiscal Year 2012 for operations in Iraq, which are no \nlonger needed due to reduced State operations there, to be used for \nincreased security at U.S. embassies and other overseas posts \nidentified in the Department's security review after the terrorist \nattack in Benghazi.\n  Making such resources available for these purposes is one of the \nrecommendations of the Accountability Review Board chaired by \nAmbassador Pickering and Admiral Mullen. The bill permits the transfer \nof funds between the diplomatic and consular programs and embassy \nsecurity construction and maintenance accounts. Such transfers would \notherwise be precluded due to percentage limitations.\n  To be clear, this legislation appropriates no additional funds. It \ncosts the taxpayers no additional money. It has no scoring impact. It \nmerely allows for the transfer of existing, appropriated funds for this \ncritical purpose. There is nothing controversial about this bill.\n  We all want to do what we can to prevent another tragedy like what \noccurred in Benghazi. The State Department has done a review, and these \nfunds will be used to expedite construction of Marine security guard \nposts at overseas facilities and for the construction of other secure \nembassies. While it is impossible to guarantee the safety of our \ndiplomats and aid workers, many\n\n[[Page S477]]\n\nof whom risk their lives daily in dangerous places, we should protect \nthem as best we can so they can carry out their duties as safely as \npossible.\n  As I mentioned, the Senate approved a similar provision last \nDecember, overwhelmingly, by voice vote. I thank Chairwoman Mikulski, \nSenator Graham, and the other cosponsors for supporting this bill and \nfor helping to expedite its consideration. I am confident that the \nchairwoman and ranking member of the House State and Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee share our view that this is an appropriate use of these \nfunds. I hope the House will act quickly to send this bill to the \nPresident.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of this important \nlegislation, I am pleased the Senate will pass this bill and once again \nprovide for stronger security at our diplomatic facilities.\n  Numerous reports have documented the security failures that resulted \nin the tragic deaths of four Americans at the consulate in Benghazi. \nBoth the Administrative Review Board and the report of the Senate \nHomeland Security Committee found that inexcusable failures of judgment \nled State Department decisionmakers to ignore the rising threat levels \nin Benghazi and the repeated requests for enhanced security at the \nsite. Marine Security Guards were not on site to protect our consulate \nin one of the most dangerous and unstable regions in the world. The \nfailures of management that led to these decisions are reprehensible; \nthe lapses in judgment indefensible. It is beyond my comprehension why \nthe individuals whose poor decisionmaking directly resulted in the \ndeaths of four Americans remain employed by the State Department, and \ncompensated by the U.S. taxpayers.\n  One of the most troubling aspects of the Benghazi attack is the \ncomplete disregard that State Department leadership gave to the \nrepeated requests for enhanced security from Ambassador Christopher \nStevens. Should funding have been an issue, the State Department always \nhas the option available to come to Congress for approval to transfer \nfunds within accounts. In fact, this is what S. 227 accomplishes--it \nprovides the State Department transfer authority to prioritize \ndiplomatic security in our embassies around the world. It is a sad, but \nnecessary postscript to this tragic event--and a step that, if taken \nearlier by the State Department, may have saved the lives lost in \nBenghazi.\n  It is my hope that the Senate takes into consideration my repeated \ncalls for increased Marine security at our embassies in high threat \nareas of the world. In the two budgets I have authored during my Senate \ntenure, I not only called for increased funding for military \nprotection, but also for reducing the presence of embassies in the most \ndangerous areas of the globe. The safety of our men and women in \ndiplomatic service must be prioritized. This means placing more \nemphasis on involvement in security by the Defense Department, but it \nalso means assessing whether our diplomacy in the most dangerous areas \nof the world is better done from afar.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read three times and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 227) was ordered to a third reading, was read the third \ntime, and passed, as follows:\n\n\n                                 S. 228\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
